            "title": "Acute colitis during chronic experimental traumatic brain injury in mice induces dysautonomia and persistent extraintestinal, systemic, and CNS inflammation with exacerbated neurological deficits.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Disruptions of brain-gut axis have been implicated in the progression of a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and central nervous system (CNS) diseases and injuries, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a chronic disease process characterized by persistent secondary injury processes which can be exacerbated by subsequent challenges. Enteric pathogen infection during chronic TBI worsened cortical lesion volume; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the damaging effects of enteric challenge during chronic TBI remain unknown. This preclinical study examined the effect of intestinal inflammation during chronic TBI on associated neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes, systemic inflammation, and dysautonomia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered to adult male C57BL/6NCrl mice 28 days following craniotomy (Sham) or TBI for 7 days to induce intestinal inflammation, followed by a return to normal drinking water for an additional 7 to 28 days for recovery; uninjured animals (Naïve) served as an additional control group. Behavioral testing was carried out prior to, during, and following DSS administration to assess changes in motor and cognitive function, social behavior, and mood. Electrocardiography was performed to examine autonomic balance. Brains were collected for histological and molecular analyses of injury lesion, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Blood, colons, spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), and thymus were collected for morphometric analyses and/or immune characterization by flow cytometry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Intestinal inflammation 28 days after craniotomy or TBI persistently induced, or exacerbated, respectively, deficits in fine motor coordination, cognition, social behavior, and anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral changes were associated with an induction, or exacerbation, of hippocampal neuronal cell loss and microglial activation in Sham and TBI mice administered DSS, respectively. Acute DSS administration resulted in a sustained systemic immune response with increases in myeloid cells in blood and spleen, as well as myeloid cells and lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes. Dysautonomia was also induced in Sham and TBI mice administered DSS, with increased sympathetic tone beginning during DSS administration and persisting through the first recovery week.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Intestinal inflammation during chronic experimental TBI causes a sustained systemic immune response and altered autonomic balance that are associated with microglial activation, increased neurodegeneration, and persistent neurological deficits."

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major public health risk for developing anxiety-related disorders and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation in humans. Extensive research has shown that dietary intake or supplementation of the natural flavonoid quercetin might be useful for treating anxiety-related symptoms. The objectives of this study were to determine whether quercetin treatment can attenuate anxiogenic-like behaviors and normalize HPA axis function in mice with mTBI. Animals subjected to mTBI were treated daily with quercetin (50 mg/kg) or diazepam (positive control, 3 mg/kg) for 14 days. Four behavioral tests (open field, plus maze, light-dark box, and zero maze) were used to assess anxiety-related behaviors in mice. To evaluate HPA axis function, adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone were measured in the serum of mice after the anxiety tests. Quercetin treatment was found to significantly reduce anxiety-like behaviors in mTBI-induced mice. A strength of this study is the consistency of results among anxiety tests. The dysregulation of the HPA axis in mTBI-induced mice treated with quercetin was also attenuated, with decreased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. The effects of quercetin were comparable with those of diazepam treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that quercetin might be useful for treating anxiety-related symptoms and HPA axis hyperreactivity in patients with mTBI."

            "abstract": "Victims of minimal traumatic brain injury (mTBI) do not show clear morphological brain defects, but frequently suffer lasting cognitive deficits, emotional difficulties and behavioral disturbances. In the present study we adopted a non-invasive closed-head weight-drop mouse model to produce mTBI. We examined the effects of 20, 25, or 30 g weight drop 7, 30, 60 and 90 days following injury on mice's ability to perform the Morris water maze. The mice suffered profound long-lasting learning and memory deficits that were force- and time-dependent. Although the injured mice could acquire the task, they could not improve their initial escape latency by more than 50%, while normal mice improved by up to 450% (P<0.001). In order to directly compare the learning ability of individual mice following our mTBI we have devised a new measure which we term learning rate. We define learning rate as the rate the mouse improved its own performance in consecutive trials in a given experimental day. The learning rate of control mice increased linearly throughout the testing period with a slope of approximately 0.9. Injured mice that sustained 20 and 25 g weight drop could also improve their learning rate linearly but with a slope of only 0.2. Mice who sustained 30 g weight drop could not improve their learning rate linearly and reached a plateau after the third experimental learning day. These results indicate that the severity of injury may correlate with the degree of integration of the learning task. These cognitive deficits occurred without any other clear neurological damage, no evident brain edema, no notable damage to the blood-brain barrier and no early anatomical changes to the brain (observed by magnetic resonance imaging imaging). These results demonstrate that persistent deficits of cognitive learning abilities in mice, similar to those observed in human post-concussive syndrome, can follow mTBI without any anatomical damage to the brain and its surrounding tissue."

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between the subjective report of feeling foggy at one-week post concussion and acute neuropsychological outcome. The outcome variables were derived from a computerized neuropsychological screening battery, Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). Participants were 110 high school students who sustained a sports-related concussion and were evaluated 5-10 days post injury (M = 6.8 days). Athletes were divided into two groups on the basis of self-reported fogginess. The first group reported no fogginess (n = 91), whereas the second group reported experiencing some degree of fogginess (n = 19) on a 6-point scale. The athletes with persistent fogginess experienced a large number of other post-concussion symptoms, compared to the athletes with no reported fogginess. In addition, the athletes with persistent fogginess had significantly slower reaction times, reduced memory performance, and slower processing speed. Thus, athletes with any degree of self-reported fogginess at one-week post injury are likely to have adverse effects from their concussions in multiple domains."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Despite large numbers of traumatized refugees, little is known about effective treatment of war trauma in refugees and immigrants. Few studies evaluating treatment have been published and most studies are follow-up studies with methodological limitations and little comparability across studies.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of the PhD is to characterize transcultural trauma patients in Denmark needing psychiatric treatment with regards to psychopathology and predictors of mental health and to evaluate the effects of the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two studies reported in 4 papers form the basis of the thesis. FORLOB (Paper 1-3) was a follow-up study that included all patients receiving treatment at the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in Copenhagen from April 2008 to February 2010. Patients completed self-ratings of symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety as well as level of functioning and quality of life (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS & WHO-5) before treatment and after treatment. Associations of co-morbid diagnoses and predictors of the patients' health condition were examined with linear and logistic regression and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Treatment in FORLOB consisted of a combination of Sertraline, Mianserin, psycho-education and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT). The treatment administered to each patient was monitored in detail and changes in outcome and predictors of change were analyzed. PTF1 (Paper 4) was a randomized controlled clinical trial with 2x2 factorial design (antidepressants, TFCBT, antidepressants & TFCBT, waiting list). Potential participants were screened amongst adult patients referred to the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in the period June 2009-2011. Patients with PTSD, war trauma and without a psychotic disorder were included. The manualized treatment consisted of weekly sessions with a physician and/or psychologist over a period of 6 months. The treatment effect was evaluated with a combination of self-ratings and blinded and non-blinded observer ratings. Outcome measures included symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain and somatization, quality of life and level of functioning (HTQ, HSCL-25, SCL-90, WHO-5, SDS, VAS, Hamilton, GAF). Treatment was offered with translation and screening instruments were translated to the six most common languages in the patient group covering the needs of 92% of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In FORLOB, patients had several co-morbidities and not just PTSD. Almost all patients had depression, pain and untreated somatic complaints in addition to PTSD. Furthermore, 36-58% had physical problems they were in treatment for, 9-16% of patients had psychotic symptoms mainly related to their trauma, 27% had enduring personality change due to catastrophic events according to ICD-10 and 46% reported traumatic brain injury. Patients reporting chronic pain had higher symptom scores on HSCL-25 and HTQ and patients with psychotic symptoms scored higher on all symptom clusters on HTQ. At pre-treatment assessment, the patients' level of functioning and quality of life were very low, the majority of patients lived on public subsidies, education levels were low and most patients had a limited social network. In FORLOB, we found a moderate significant change (Cohen's d 0.44-0.67) on all self-report outcome measures (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS and WHO-5) after combination treatment. We found less improvement in PTSD when patients were receiving public subsidies and less improvement of depression when patients reported pain in the upper extremities. We found a positive association between systematic use of CBT methods and improvement in patient condition. In PTF1, the randomized clinical trial, we found a small, but significant effect of treatment with medicine on blinded observer-ratings of depression and anxiety (Ham-D and Ham-A) and a large effect on non-blinded ratings of level of functioning (GAF-F and GAF-S), in addition to a small effect on self-reported level of functioning and headache (SDS and VAS). Cohen's d calculated as the differences between randomization groups receiving medicine and not receiving medicine ranged from 0.91-1.01 on GAF-F and GAF-S, whereas on the other ratings showing significant change Cohen's d was 0.31-0.41. We did not find any effect of psychotherapy on any outcomes nor any effect of psycho-therapy or medicine on the primary outcome measure, PTSD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Traditionally, treatment of traumatized refugees have focused on PTSD, but this study demonstrates that patients suffer from numerous psychiatric and somatic co-morbidities and the comprehensiveness of PTSD in explaining symptoms of traumatized refugees is questionable. This has implications for the type and implementation of treatment. PTF1 is the largest randomized clinical trial published on the treatment of traumatized refugees. It is a strength of PTF1 that it includes a waiting list control group thereby accounting for any effects due to spontaneous recovery and that treatment modalities are examined separately and in combination. In both FORLOB and PTF1, treatment adherence and patient compliance with treatment was thoroughly documented. Effect sizes were moderate in FORLOB and small in PTF1. There were discrepancies between the results in FORLOB and PTF1 with regards to the effect measured on self-ratings that can only partially be explained by methodological limitations of the follow-up study. Both studies are undertaken under pragmatic and realistic circumstances and the results are therefore relevant to other contexts. Patients are representative of patients in other North-European studies of traumatized refugees but differ from patients in trials published on culturally adapted CBT and Narrative Exposure Therapy."

We recruited 102 participants with moderate to severe TBI aged between 40 and 85 years. TBI participants were assessed on average 22 years post-injury. Seventy-seven healthy controls were also recruited. Participants' 'brain age' was determined using T1-weighted MRI images. TBI participants were estimated to have greater 'brain age' compared to healthy controls. 'Brain age' gap was unrelated to time since injury or long-term functional outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Greater brain age was associated with greater injury severity measured by post traumatic amnesia duration and Glasgow Coma Scale. 'Brain age' was significantly and inversely associated with verbal memory, but unrelated to visual memory/ability and cognitive flexibility and processing speed.

However, one study did not find such an impairment, and, in general, comparison across studies has been made difficult because of the different stimuli and tasks employed. In a collaborative study to facilitate such comparisons, we report here the recognition of emotional facial expressions in nine subjects with bilateral amygdala damage, using a sensitive and quantitative assessment. Compared to controls, the subjects as a group were significantly impaired in recognizing fear, although individual performances ranged from severely impaired to essentially normal. Most subjects were impaired on several negative emotions in addition to fear, but no subject was impaired in recognizing happy expressions. An analysis of response consistency showed that impaired recognition of fear could not be attributed simply to mistaking fear for another emotion. While it remains unclear why some subjects with amygdala damage included here are not impaired on our task, the results overall are consistent with the idea that the amygdala plays an important role in triggering knowledge related to threat and danger signaled by facial expressions."

            "abstract": "Although they are likely to add their effects, physical and psychic traumata (or traumas) can provoke in different ways the appearance of depressive symptoms sometimes common. Post-traumatic depression, reactional depression, major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder represent different clinical and nosographic disorders in despite of their occasionally common symptomatic core. Historically, it is interesting to note during the XXth century the true semantic change of the terms of trauma from the somatic field to the psychic sphere. Physical traumatism is often represented by a material shock for the subject and by its organic consequences. It is defined as an event that leaves its mark which itself inflicts and handicaps the vital trajectory of the subject. It primarily comprises brain and rachis injuries, whose evolution is frequently characterized by the occurrence/appearance of a depressive disorder, whose genesis rests on psychological but also neurobiologic and physical arguments. Thus major depressive disorders are often present in the course of various physical traumatisms mainly related to nervous system. In accordance with several studies, the prevalence of major depressive disorders ranges from 25% to 50%. These mood disorders occur in the year which follows the accidental event. Their average time of revelation is estimated at four months and their average duration lies between three and six months. Lastly, although these depressive illnesses present clinical symptoms comparable with those observed in other contexts, some nuances can be raised. Nonetheless, they confine sometimes with true clinical forms depending on the intensity, the form, the circumstances or the consequences of the trauma. Psychic traumatism doesn't have the same profile and rests for much dedicated with the reexperiencing. Thus for some authors, depression illness represents a disorder that occurs after a traumatic event whereas others see a differential diagnosis which exludes or which represents a comorbidity with post-traumatic stress disorder. The review of the literature allows us to emphasize the complexity of the links as well as the clinical and epidemiologic differences between stress disorder and major depressive disorder. From the clinical point of view, the major features of PTSD are articulated around a triad of symptoms. They include the reexperiencing symptoms of the traumatic event such as intrusive memories and recurrent nightmares, the protective reactions such as avoidance of the stimuli associated with the trauma and emotional numbing, and the arousal symptoms such as the startled response and hypervigilance. The complexity of this syndrom is due to the frequent combination of these symptoms with other nonspecific ones. As far as the mood is concerned (the mood symptoms are concerned), the regrouping of some of these symptoms allows the clinician to sometimes releave a depressive symptomatology without being able to assess the DSM diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Epidemiologic studies dealing with the risk of installation of a PTSD after a traumatic event reveal differences in the prevalence depending on the nature of the traumatic events: ranging from 1% in general population to 80% following some situations of extreme and durable psychic suffering. Between both poles, one finds a prevalence ranging between 20 and 50% following other events such as serious accidents, natural disasters or criminal assaults. The clinical features of depressive episodes comorbid or associated with PTSD have some characteristics making it possible to individualize various clinical forms as a function of traumatic event type: asthenic, characterial or with somatic symptoms. According to the majority of authors, the co-occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder is high although differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. However, conceptual differences remain and two conceptions are distinguished. For some authors, like Bleich and Shalev, there would not be true chronological evolution from PTSD to MDD. Moreover the presence of symptoms considered as pertaining to the mood register within the criteria of PTSD would be clearly predictive of the occurrence and the severity of the diagnosis but not of the chronicity. For others, there would be a continuity between post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. It is the case in many studies of veterans but also for civilian traumatic events. It is also the case for the American national study of comorbidity in which Kessler concludes that for 78% of the subjects who present a comorbidity PTSD/MDD (comorbidity raised for 48% of the 5,877 subjects included), the mood disorder is secondary to PTSD.

            "abstract": "The current treatment of concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is primarily based on expert consensus. Most clinical practice guidelines advise cognitive and physical rest after injury including withdrawal from normal life activities such as school attendance, sports participation, and technology use until symptoms resolve. Some individuals who sustain an mTBI experience persistent physical, cognitive, and mental health problems. Activity restriction itself may contribute to protracted recovery and other complications. Williamson's Activity Restriction Model of Depression, formulated more than 20 years ago, is central to this hypothesis. We review research evidence for potential harms of prolonged activity restriction and report an mTBI case as an example of how an \"activity restriction cascade\" can unfold. According to this model, psychological consequences of removal from validating life activities, combined with physical deconditioning, contribute to the development and persistence of postconcussive symptoms after mTBI in some youth. A modification to mTBI guidelines that emphasizes prompt reengagement in life activities as tolerated is encouraged."

            "abstract": "Chronic exposure to stress causes cognitive deficits, anxiety and depression. Earlier studies have suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) can differentially modulate the stress-induced alterations either by their action on HPA axis or via direct reciprocal connections between them. The PFC dysfunction and BLA hypertrophy following stress are known to cause anxiety and affective symptoms. Recent studies indicate that inactivation of BLA projections to PFC remarkably decreases anxiety. However, the effect of BLA inactivation on stress-induced anxiety and associated volume loss in prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate (ACC) subregions of PFC is not known. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of BLA lesion or inactivation during chronic immobilization stress (CIS) on an approach-avoidance task and associated volume loss in the PFC. The stressed rats showed a significant volumetric reduction in layer I and II of the PrL and ACC. Interestingly, BLA lesion prior to stress prevented the volume loss in PrL and ACC. Further, BLA lesion blocked the anxiety-like behavior in stressed rats. However, in the absence of stress, BLA lesion increased the number of shocks as compared to controls. As BLA lesion produced an anticonflict effect, we performed temporary inactivation of BLA specifically during stress. Similar to BLA lesion, lidocaine-induced inactivation prevented the stress-induced volume loss and anxiety-like behavior. We demonstrate that inactivation of BLA during stress prevents CIS-induced anxiety and associated structural correlates in the PFC. The present study extends the hypothesis of amygdalar silencing as a possible management strategy for stress and associated disorders."

            "abstract": "An increased prevalence of depression, emotional lability, decreased energy levels, and poor quality of life have been reported in adults with GH deficiency (GHD). The impairment of psychological parameters depends on the aetiology of GHD and the presence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies because of hormonal effects on neural cell metabolism. Cognitive dysfunctions appear to be specifically related to GHD itself, whereas the lower emotional well-being and reduced motor performance are attributed to other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Traumatic Brain Injury causes very often hypopituitarism and GHD as well as other many psychological symptoms: cognitive impairment, sleeping disorders, and depression. Many neurobehavioral symptoms of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) are the same suffered by adult GHD and hypopituitaric patients but there are no data about the occurrence of hypopituitarism in PCS. In some studies treatment with rhGH is reported to have a beneficial effect and GHD could contribute itself to the global impairment of psychological dysfunctions. The link between psychosocial impairments and GHD is not fully understood. The effects of long-term rhGH therapy on cognitive functions are largely unknown. Thus, long-term placebo-controlled double-blind studies are required to investigate whether psychological dysfunctions are reversible on GH substitution."

We tested if simple EEG responses within an oddball paradigm could capture variance relevant to this clinical problem. The P3a and P3b components reflect bottom-up and top-down processes driving engagement with exogenous stimuli. Since these features are related to primitive decision abilities, abnormal amplitudes following mTBI may account for problems in the ability to exert executive control. Sub-acute (<2 weeks) mTBI participants (N = 38) and healthy controls (N = 24) were assessed at an initial session as well as a two-month follow-up (sessions 1 and 2). We contrasted the initial assessment to a comparison group of participants with chronic symptomatology following brain injury (N = 23). There were no group differences in P3a or P3b amplitudes. Yet in the sub-acute mTBI group, higher symptomatology on the Frontal Systems Behavior scale (FrSBe), a questionnaire validated as measuring symptomatic distress related to frontal lobe injury, correlated with lower P3a in session 1. This relationship was replicated in session 2. These findings were distinct from chronic TBI participants, who instead expressed a relationship between increased FrSBe symptoms and a lower P3b component. In the sub-acute group, P3b amplitudes in the first session correlated with the degree of symptom change between sessions 1 and 2, above and beyond demographic predictors. Controls did not show any relationship between FrSBe symptoms and P3a or P3b. These findings identify symptom-specific alterations in neural systems that vary along the time course of post-concussive symptomatology."

A large number of patients suffer with cognitive disabilities and psychiatric conditions after TBI, especially anxiety and depression. The constellation of post-injury cognitive and behavioral symptoms suggest permanent effects of injury on neurotransmission. Guided in part by preclinical studies, clinical trials have focused on high-yield pathophysiologic mechanisms, including protein aggregation, inflammation, metabolic disruption, cell generation, physiology, and alterations in neurotransmitter signaling. Despite successful treatment of experimental TBI in animal models, clinical studies based on these findings have failed to translate to humans. The current international effort to reshape TBI research is focusing on redefining the taxonomy and characterization of TBI. In addition, as the next round of clinical trials is pending, there is a pressing need to consider what the field has learned over the past two decades of research, and how we can best capitalize on this knowledge to inform the hypotheses for future innovations. Thus, it is critically important to extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI, particularly to mechanisms that are associated with recovery versus development of chronic symptoms.

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can produce life-long disabilities, including anxiety, cognitive, balance, and motor deficits. The experimental model of closed head TBI (cTBI) induced by weight drop/impact acceleration is known to produce hallmark TBI injuries. However, comprehensive long-term characterization of comorbidities induced by graded mild-to- mild/moderate intensities using this experimental cTBI model has not been reported. The present study used two intensities of weight drop (1.0 m and 1.25 m/450 g) to produce cTBI in a rat model to investigate initial and long-term disability of four comorbidities: anxiety, cognitive, vestibulomotor, and spinal reflex that related to spasticity. TBI and sham injuries were produced under general anesthesia. Time for righting recoveries post-TBI recorded to estimate duration of unconsciousness, revealed that the TBI mild/moderate group required a mean of 1 min 27 sec longer than the values observed for noninjured sham animals. Screening magnetic resonance imaging images revealed no anatomical changes, mid-line shifts, or hemorrhagic volumes. However, compared to sham injuries, significant long-term anxiety, cognitive, balance, and physiological changes in motor reflex related to spasticity were observed post-TBI for both TBI intensities. The longitudinal trajectory of anxiety and balance disabilities tested at 2, 4, 8, and 18 weeks revealed progressively worsening disabilities. In general, disability magnitudes were proportional to injury intensity for three of the four measures. A natural hypothesis would pose that all disabilities would increase incrementally relative to injury severity. Surprisingly, anxiety disability progressed over time to be greater in the mildest injury. Collectively, translational implications of these observations suggest that patients with mild TBI should be evaluated longitudinally at multiple time points, and that anxiety disorder could potentially have a particularly low threshold for appearance and progressively worsen post-injury."

Here, we investigated how brain damage differentially affects electrodermal responses based on sex. We studied neurologically normal, healthy adults and a sample of neurological patients. Participants listened to music, an emotional stimulus that reliably elicits skin conductance responses (SCRs). Electrodermal activity was recorded while participants listened to musical clips. When analyzing the data without regard to sex, there were no differences between healthy and brain-damaged participants in their SCRs. However, we found a significant interaction between brain injury status and sex. For men, brain damage significantly reduced SCRs. For women, there were no differences between brain-damaged participants and neurologically healthy participants. These findings illustrate the importance of including demographic variables, such as sex, when investigating brain-behavior relationships with a psychophysiological dependent variable."

Several factors have been shown to influence resolution of post-concussion related symptoms (PCS), but resilience, a trait that reflects the ability to overcome adversity, is another factor that may influence recovery. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of resilience with resolution of symptoms during recovery in adolescents and young adults following SRC.\n## METHOD\nThis prospective study is part of the North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex). Subjects (\n## RESULTS\nRepeated measures ANCOVA and linear regression models showed that lower resilience ratings at initial visit were associated with a greater number and severity of PCSS symptoms along with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during recovery from SRC. At three months, subjects with lower initial resilience ratings were less likely to report feeling back to normal and had greater aggravation of symptoms from physical and cognitive activity even when they had returned to sports/physical activity.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nLower resilience was associated with greater symptoms and delayed recovery from SRC. Results suggest that resilience may be another important factor to address in recovery from SRC. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which resilience measured after SRC reflects pre-injury characteristics and to better inform the development of interventions to promote resilience during recovery.\n"

Interventions aimed at addressing symptoms associated with both physical and psychological stressors (e.g., PPC and PTSD symptoms) are needed. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a probiotic intervention, as well as to begin the process of evaluating potential biological outcomes. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial was implemented among US military Veterans from recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those enrolled had clinically significant PPC and PTSD symptoms. Participants were randomized to intervention (Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938) or placebo supplementation (daily for 8 weeks +/- 2 weeks) at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by irritable bowel syndrome status. Thirty-one Veterans were enrolled and randomized (15 to the placebo condition and 16 to the probiotic condition). Results: Thresholds for feasibility, acceptability, and safety were met. Probiotic supplementation resulted in a decrease in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations relative to the placebo group that approached statistical significance (p = 0.056). Although during the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; administered post-supplementation) no between-group differences were found on a subjective measure of stress responsivity (Visual Analog Scale), there was a significantly larger increase in mean heart beats per minute between baseline and the math task for the placebo group as compared with the probiotic group (estimated mean change, probiotic 5.3 [95% Confidence Interval: -0.55, 11.0], placebo 16.9 [11.0, 22.7], p = 0.006). Conclusions: Findings from this trial support the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of supplementation with an anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory probiotic, L. reuteri DSM 17938, among Veterans with PPC and PTSD symptoms.

In the past 3 decades, clinicians have gone from mostly anecdotal strategies to an international consensus-based approach and the early evolution of evidence-based practice. There is increasing engagement by mainstream neuroscientists in this field, which had previously been dominated by sports team physicians. However, the interchange has largely taken place in the media rather than through scientific journals. Legislators have proposed regulatory measures that restrict medical management of concussion in ways that apply to no other medical condition. This paper examines some of the key areas that are likely to be the focus of research in the next few years."

This study's first objective was to compare resting state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by means of positron emission tomography with (15)O labelled water in 21 WAD patients with 18 healthy, pain-free controls. A second objective was to investigate the relations between brain areas with altered rCBF to pain experience, somatic symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms and personality traits in the patient group. Patients had heightened resting rCBF bilaterally in the posterior parahippocampal and the posterior cingulate gyri, in the right thalamus and the right medial prefrontal gyrus as well as lowered tempero-occipital blood flow compared with healthy controls. The altered rCBF in the patient group was correlated to neck disability ratings. We thus suggest an involvement of the posterior cingulate, parahippocampal and medial prefrontal gyri in WAD and speculate that alterations in the resting state are linked to an increased self-relevant evaluation of pain and stress."

However, this relates predominantly to mortality following moderate-severe TBI. It remains unclear whether increasing age exerts risk on the expected recovery from mild TBI (mTBI). In this systematic review of mTBI in older age (60+ years), a focus was to identify outcome through several domains - cognition, psychological health, and life participation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fourteen studies were identified for review, using PRISMA guidelines.

In contrast, there is stronger evidence across time points that older adults do not experience elevated levels of psychological distress following injury and endorse fewer psychological symptoms than younger adults. Meta-analysis, based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months+ post-injury, indicates that a large proportion (67%; 95% CI 0.569, 0.761) of older adults can achieve good functional recovery, similar to younger adults. Nevertheless, individual studies using alternative life participation measures suggest more mixed rates of recovery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although our initial review suggests some optimism in recovery from mTBI in older age, there is an urgent need for more investigations in this under-researched but growing demographic.

            "abstract": "Glucose is an essential cellular fuel for maintaining normal brain functions. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) decreases brain glucose utilization in both human and experimental animals during the acute or subacute phase of TBI. It remains unclear as to how the damages affect brain glucose utilization and its association with persistent neurobehavioral impairments in the chronic phase of mild TBI (mTBI). Accordingly, we compared expression of selected genes important to brain glucose utilization in different brain regions of mice during the chronic phase in mTBI vs. sham operated mice. These genes included hexokinase-1 (HK1), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), capillary glucose transporter (Glut-1), neuron glucose transporter (Glut-3), astrocyte lactate transpor1 (MCT-1), neuron lactate transporter (MCT-2), lactate receptor (GPR81), and Hexokinase isoform-2 (HK2). Young adult male C57BL/6J mice were brain injured with repetitive closed-head concussions. Morris water maze (MWM), elevated plus maze (EPM), and neurological severity score test (NSS) were performed for evaluation of mice neurobehavioral impairments at 2, 4, and 6 months post mTBI. Two days after completion of the last behavioral test, the frontal cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, hypothalamus, and cerebellum were collected for gene expression measurements. The expression of the mRNAs encoding PK, and PDH, two critical enzymes in glucose metabolism, was decreased at all-time points only in the hippocampus, but was unchanged in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and cortex in mTBI mice. mTBI mice also exhibited the following behavioral alterations: (1) decreased spatial learning and memory 2, 4, and 6 months after the injury, (2) increased proportion of time spent on open vs. closed arms determined by EPM, and (3) accelerated reduction in motor activity observed at 4 months, two months earlier than observed in the sham group, during the EPM testing. There were no significant differences in NSS between injury and sham groups at any of the three time points. Thus, mTBI in male mice led to persistent decreased hippocampal expression of mRNAs that encode critical glucose utilization related enzymes in association with long-term impairments in selected neurobehavioral outcomes."

            "abstract": "Comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in chronic pain are a common health problem, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previously, we have demonstrated that sensitization of the CeA neurons via decreased GABAergic inhibition contributes to anxiety-like behaviors in neuropathic pain rats. In this study, by using male Sprague Dawley rats, we reported that the CeA plays a key role in processing both sensory and negative emotional-affective components of neuropathic pain. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of CeA, but not lateral/basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA/BLA), abrogated both pain hypersensitivity and aversive and depressive symptoms of neuropathic rats induced by spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Moreover, SNL rats showed structural and functional neuroplasticity manifested as reduced dendritic spines on the CeA neurons and enhanced LTD at the LA/BLA-CeA synapse. Disruption of GluA2-containing AMPAR trafficking and endocytosis from synapses using synthetic peptides, either pep2-EVKI or Tat-GluA2(3Y), restored the enhanced LTD at the LA/BLA-CeA synapse, and alleviated the mechanical allodynia and comorbid aversive and depressive symptoms in neuropathic rats, indicating that the endocytosis of GluA2-containing AMPARs from synapses is probably involved in the LTD at the LA/BLA-CeA synapse and the comorbid aversive and depressive symptoms in neuropathic pain in SNL-operated rats. These data provide a novel mechanism for elucidating comorbid aversive and depressive symptoms in neuropathic pain and highlight that structural and functional neuroplasticity in the amygdala may be important as a promising therapeutic target for comorbid negative emotional-affective disorders in chronic pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Several studies have demonstrated the high comorbidity of negative affective disorders in patients with chronic pain. Understanding the affective aspects related to chronic pain may facilitate the development of novel therapies for more effective management. Here, we unravel that the CeA plays a key role in processing both sensory and negative emotional-affective components of neuropathic pain, and LTD at the amygdaloid LA/BLA-CeA synapse mediated by GluA2-containing AMPAR endocytosis underlies the comorbid aversive and depressive symptoms in neuropathic pain.

            "abstract": "Although a proportion of individuals report chronic cognitive difficulties after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from behavioral testing have been inconsistent. In fact, the variability inherent to the mTBI population may be masking subtle cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that this variability could be reduced by accounting for post-concussion syndrome (PCS) in the sample. Thirty-six participants with mTBI (>1 year post-injury) and 36 non-head injured controls performed information processing speed (Paced Visual Serial Addition Task, PVSAT) and working memory (n-Back) tasks. Both groups were split by PCS diagnosis (4 groups, all n = 18), with categorization of controls based on symptom report. Participants with mTBI and persistent PCS had significantly greater error rates on both the n-Back and PVSAT, at every difficulty level except 0-Back (used as a test of performance validity). There was no difference between any of the other groups. Therefore, a cognitive deficit can be observed in mTBI participants, even 1 year after injury. Correlations between cognitive performance and symptoms were only observed for mTBI participants, with worse performance correlating with lower sleep quality, in addition to a medium effect size association (falling short of statistical significance) with higher PCS symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. These results suggest that the reduction in cognitive performance is not due to greater symptom report itself, but is associated to some extent with the initial injury. Furthermore, the results validate the utility of our participant grouping, and demonstrate its potential to reduce the variability observed in previous studies."

            "abstract": "The debilitating effects of repetitive concussive traumatic brain injury (rcTBI) have been increasingly recognized in both military and civilian populations. rcTBI may result in significant neurological, cognitive, and affective sequelae, and is often followed by physical and/or psychological post-injury stressors that may exacerbate the effects of the injury and prolong the recovery period for injured patients. However, the consequences of post-injury stressors and their subsequent effects on social and emotional behavior in the context of rcTBI have been relatively little studied in animal models. Here, we use a mouse model of rcTBI with two closed-skull blunt impacts 24 hours apart and social and emotional behavior testing to examine the consequences of a stressor (foot shock fear conditioning) following brain injury (rcTBI). rcTBI alone did not affect cued or contextual fear conditioning or extinction compared to uninjured sham animals. In the sucrose preference test, rcTBI animals had decreased preference for sucrose, an anhedonia-like behavior, regardless of whether they experienced foot shock stress or were non-shocked controls. However, rcTBI and post-injury foot shock stress had synergistic effects in tests of social recognition and depression-like behavior. In the social recognition test, animals with both injury and shock were more impaired than either non-shocked injured mice or shocked but uninjured mice. In the tail suspension test, injured mice had increased depression-like behavior compared with uninjured mice, and shock stress worsened the depression-like behavior only in the injured mice with no effect in the uninjured mice. These results provide a model of subtle emotional behavioral deficits after combined concussive brain injury and stress, and may provide a platform for testing treatment and prevention strategies for social behavior deficits and mood disorders that are tailored to patients with traumatic brain injury."

            "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that experiencing a mild closed head trauma or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with a greater incidence of anxiety disorders. Dysfunction of limbic structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, is associated with the symptoms of anxiety disorders. Therefore, the goal of the current studies was to characterize the consequences of closed mTBI on these limbic structures and associated fear and anxiety-related behaviors. A weight-drop procedure was employed to induce mTBI in male rats. Rats were transcardically perfused 4 or 9 days following exposure to mTBI or control procedures, and neuronal number, brain region area, and the number of apoptotic cells in each region were determined. In separate groups of rats, the effects of mTBI on anxiety-like behaviors, motor function, nociception, and acquisition, retention and extinction of contextual fear were also assessed. Findings suggest that mTBI was associated with significant neuronal cell loss in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus and increased cell number in subregions of the amygdala, both of which appear to be related to alterations to apoptosis in these regions following mTBI. Furthermore, mTBI increased expression of anxiety-like behaviors and conditioned fear, with no effect on motor performance or nociception. Overall, a single impact to the skull to mimic mTBI in rats produces discrete alterations to neuronal numbers within the limbic system and specific emotional deficits, providing a potential neurobiological link between mTBI and anxiety disorders."

As the client becomes more active, the rehabilitation professional should pay close attention to symptoms associated with mTBI, such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The systematic approach to return to play provided by the Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport can apply to adults with mTBI. This protocol calls for gradually increasing the intensity of physical activity while attending to postconcussion symptoms. During the incident that led to an mTBI, the injured individual may incur injuries to the vestibular and balance system that are best addressed by professionals with specific training in vestibular rehabilitation, most commonly physical therapists. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a condition in which otoconia particles in the inner ear dislodge into the semicircular canals, resulting in severe vertigo and imbalance. This condition frequently resolves in a few sessions with a vestibular physical therapist. In conditions such as gaze instability, motion sensitivity, impaired postural control, and cervicogenic dizziness, improvement is more gradual and requires longer follow-up with a physical therapist and a home exercise program. In all of the above-stated conditions, it is essential to consider that a patient with protracted symptoms of mTBI or postconcussion syndrome will recover more slowly than others and should be monitored for symptoms throughout the intervention."

            "abstract": "Abstract In children, the importance of detecting deficits after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion has grown with the increasing popularity of leisure physical activities and contact sports. Whereas most postconcussive symptoms (PCS) are similar for children and adults, the breadth of consequences to children remains largely unknown. To investigate the effect of mTBI on brain function, we compared working memory performance and related brain activity using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 concussed youths and 15 healthy age-matched control subjects. Neuropsychological tests, self-perceived PCS, and levels of anxiety and depression were also assessed. Our results showed that, behaviorally, concussed youths had significantly worse performances on the working memory tasks, as well as on the Rey figure delayed recall and verbal fluency. fMRI results revealed that, compared to healthy children, concussed youths had significantly reduced task-related activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and left superior parietal lobule during performance of verbal and nonverbal working memory tasks. Additionally, concussed youths also showed less activation than healthy controls in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left thalamus, and left caudate nucleus during the nonverbal task. Regression analysis indicated that BOLD signal changes in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly correlated with performance such that greater activities in these regions, relative to the control condition, were associated with greater accuracy. Our findings confirmed functional alterations in brain activity after concussion in youths, a result similar to that observed in adults. However, significant differences were noted. In particular, the observation of reduced working memory accuracy suggests that youths may be unable to engage compensatory strategies to maintain cognitive performance after mTBI. This has significant implications for safe return to daily activities, including competitive sport."

In our previous work, we found individuals with chronic mTBI have decreased emotion habituation. The objective of the current study was to test whether reduced habituation is a mechanism underlying increased risk for mental health disturbances following mTBI. Research Design: We used a cross-sectional assessment of emotion habituation in a sample of young adults at least 1 year after an mTBI. Methods and Procedures: We repeatedly showed mTBI and control participants the same set of highly arousing, negative images and positive images. Participants rated each image for arousal and valence. Main Outcomes and Results: Unexpectedly, we found individuals with mTBI habituated faster to emotional images than controls. However, enhanced habituation was not linkd with emotional outcomes. Participants with mTBI did not differ from controls for reactivity, but blunted reactivity in all participants was associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although there are subtle differences in emotion responses in chronic mTBI, the differences were not associated with mental health disturbances. Nevertheless, this difference in emotional processing may increase risk for untested mental health issues."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often experienced under stressful circumstances that can lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and neurobehavioral symptoms of brain injury. There is considerable symptom overlap in the behavioral expression of these conditions. Psychometric network analysis is a useful approach to investigate the role of specific symptoms in connecting these two disorders and is well suited to explore their interrelatedness. This study applied network analysis to examine the associations among PTSD and TBI symptoms in a sample of Service Members and Veterans (SM/Vs) with a history of TBI one year after injury. Responses to the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) were obtained from participants who completed comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services across five Veterans Affairs polytrauma rehabilitation centers. Participants (N = 612) were 93.1% male with an average age of 36.98 years at injury. The analysis produced a stable network. Within the NSI symptom groups, the frustration symptom was an important bridge between the affective and cognitive TBI symptoms. The PCL-C nodes formed their own small cluster with hyperarousal yielding connections with the affective, cognitive, and somatic symptom groups. Consistent with this observation, the hyperarousal node had the second strongest bridge centrality in the network. Hyperarousal appears to play a key role in holding together this network of distress and thus represents a prime target for intervention among individuals with elevated symptoms of PTSD and a history of TBI. Network analysis offers an empirical approach to visualizing and quantifying the associations among symptoms. The identification of symptoms that are central to connecting multiple conditions can inform diagnostic precision and treatment selection."

            "abstract": "Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are traumatic events that affect up to 3.8 million athletes per year. The initial diagnosis and management is often instituted on the field of play by coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians. SRCs are usually transient episodes of neurological dysfunction following a traumatic impact, with most symptoms resolving in 7-10 days; however, a small percentage of patients will suffer protracted symptoms for years after the event and may develop chronic neurodegenerative disease. Rarely, SRCs are associated with complications, such as skull fractures, epidural or subdural hematomas, and edema requiring neurosurgical evaluation. Current standards of care are based on a paradigm of rest and gradual return to play, with decisions driven by subjective and objective information gleaned from a detailed history and physical examination. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI, and detailed understanding of the complex pathophysiological process underlying SRCs and how they affect the athletes acutely and long-term, may change the way physicians treat athletes who suffer a concussion. It is hoped that these advances will allow a more accurate assessment of when an athlete is truly safe to return to play, decreasing the risk of secondary impact injuries, and provide avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting the complex biochemical cascade that results from a traumatic injury to the brain."

            "abstract": "After a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), emotion recognition is typically impaired. This is commonly attributed to widespread multifocal damage in cortical areas involved in emotion processing as well as to Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). However, current models suggest that emotional recognition is subserved by a distributed network cantered on the amygdala, which involves both cortical and subcortical structures. While the cortical system is preferentially tuned to process high spatial frequencies, the subcortical networks are more sensitive to low-spatial frequencies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether emotion perception from low-spatial frequencies underpinning the subcortical system is relatively preserved in TBI patients. We tested a group of 14 subjects with severe TBI and 20 matched healthy controls. Each participant was asked to recognize the emotion expressed by each stimulus that consisted of happy and fearful faces, filtered for their low and high spatial frequencies components. Results in TBI patients' performances showed that low-spatial frequency expressions were recognized with higher accuracy and faster reaction times when compared to high spatial frequency stimuli. On the contrary, healthy controls did not show any effect in the two conditions, neither for response accuracy nor for reaction times. The outcomes of this study indicate that emotion perception from low-spatial frequencies is relatively preserved in TBI, thereby suggesting spare of functioning in the subcortical system in mediating emotion recognition."

Non-serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the CBZ group with greater nervous system effects. CBZ up to 400 mg two times daily was not superior to placebo at reducing irritability/aggression according observers and participants.

            "title": "Pathophysiology of Mild TBI: Implications for Altered Signaling Pathways.",
            "abstract": "Concussions and mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) represent a substantial portion of the annual incidence of TBI aided by the increased reporting of concussions in youth sports, and the increased exposure of soldiers to blast injuries in the war theater. The pathophysiology of concussions and mild TBI consist predominantly of axonal injury at the cellular level and working memory deficits at the behavioral level. Importantly, studies in humans and in animals are making it clear that concussions and mild TBI are not merely a milder form of moderate-severe TBI but represent a separate disease/injury state. Therefore, acute and chronic treatment strategies, both behavioral and pharmacological, need to be implemented based on thorough pre-clinical assessment. The review in this chapter focuses on two under-studied components of the pathophysiology of mild TBI—the role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in axonal injury, and the role of the dopaminergic system in working memory deficits.\n    \n\n      \n      The growing awareness of the incidence of concussion in contact sports, coupled with the emergence of blast-related injuries in combat fighting, has heightened the urgency to understand the underlying mechanisms of mild brain trauma and devise potential therapeutic interventions. TBI in general, and mild TBI in particular, is considered a “silent epidemic” because many of the acute and enduring alterations in cognitive, motor, and somatosensory functions may not be readily apparent to external observers. Moderate to severe TBI is a major cause of injury-induced death and disability with an annual incidence of approximately 500 in 100,000 people affected in the United States (Sosin et al., 1989; Kraus and McArthur, 1996; Rutland-Brown et al., 2006). However, approximately 80% of all TBI cases are categorized as mild head injuries (Bazarian et al., 2005; Langlois et al., 2006). It is important to note that these approximations are underestimates because they do not account for incidents of TBI in which the person does not seek medical care (Faul et al., 2010). Recent estimates to correct for this underreporting have placed the annual incidence at approximately 3.8 million (Bazarian et al., 2005; Ropper and Gorson, 2007; Halstead and Walter, 2010). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, which measures level of consciousness, has been the primary clinical tool for assessing initial brain injury severity in mild (GCS 13–15), moderate (GCS 9–12), or severe (GCS < 8) cases (Teasdale and Jennett, 1974). Although this scoring system serves as a reliable predictor of patient survival (Steyerberg et al., 2008), particularly in the acute phase of trauma and for those patients with more severe head injury (Saatman et al., 2008), it does not necessarily reflect the underlying cerebral pathology because different structural abnormalities can produce a similar clinical picture.\n    \n\n      \n      Concussions are a frequent occurrence in contact sports such as football, hockey, lacrosse, and soccer, and increasing evidence suggests that athletes may sustain multiple concussions throughout their career (Bakhos et al., 2010; Bazarian et al., 2005; Grady, 2010; McCrory et al., 2009). Another significant population is soldiers suffering from blast-related injuries, with one in six soldiers returning from combat deployment in Iraq meeting the criteria for concussion (Wilk et al., 2010). Gender factors may also play a role in the epidemiology of concussion. Comparisons of similar sports have yielded the observation that females have nearly twice the rate of concussion compared with males (Dick, 2009; Lincoln et al., 2011). It is important to note that concussed high school males and females self-report different symptoms, with females more often complaining of drowsiness and noise sensitivity, whereas males complain of cognitive deficits and amnesia (Frommer et al., 2011). Furthermore, females also have a higher postconcussion symptom score 3 months postinjury (Bazarian et al., 2010). Two primary complications of concussion are the postconcussion syndrome and second impact syndrome. The postconcussion syndrome is the persistence of concussion-induced symptomatology for greater than 3 months postinjury, presumably because of both neurophysiological and neuropathological processes secondary to the initial concussion (Silverberg and Iverson, 2011).\n    \n\n      \n      Second impact syndrome is a condition in which a second head impact is sustained during a “vulnerable period” before the complete symptomatic resolution of the initial impact leading to profound engorgement, massive edema, and increased intracranial pressure within minutes of the impact and resulting in brain herniation, followed by coma and death (Cantu, 1998; Field et al., 2003). It is believed that this vulnerable period is the duration of an injury-induced failure of cerebral blood flow autoregulation (Lam et al., 1997), which can leave the patient highly vulnerable to drastic fluxes and extremes of blood pressure. Second impact syndrome has a morbidity rate of 100% and a mortality rate of 50%, and it is important to note that as of 2001, all reported cases of second impact syndrome had occurred in athletes younger than 20 years of age (McCrory, 2001).\n    \n\n      \n      Neurobehavioral symptoms, which often correlate with severity of the TBI, vary in type and duration and are manifested as somatic and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms (reviewed in Riggio and Wong, 2009). Somatic symptoms refer to the physical changes associated with TBI and include headache, dizziness/nausea, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep pattern. Headache is the most commonly reported somatic symptom after mild TBI and is considered acute if resolved within 2 months or chronic if headaches persist for longer than 2 months. Dizziness is another commonly reported symptom of TBI and generally resolves within 2 months but may continue in patients with moderate or severe TBI. Another particularly debilitating symptom is fatigue, likely due to difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Neuropsychiatric sequelae after TBI comprise cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders and are identified in almost all TBI patients for up to 3 months, with a small percentage exhibiting persistent (months—years) symptoms. Cognitive deficits are characterized by impaired attention, memory, and/or executive function and may cause the patient to become irritable, anxious, or depressed. Cognitive deficits in cases of mild TBI generally resolve within days and do not have to be associated with loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia. Behavioral manifestations after TBI include personality changes, depression, and anxiety. Personality changes describe aggression, impulsivity, irritability, emotional lability, and apathy. Major depression is one of the most frequently reported behavioral sequelae of TBI, accounting for approximately 25% to 40% of cases of moderate-to-severe TBI (Riggio and Wong, 2009).\n    \n\n      \n      Collectively, these observations underscore the need to develop age-, sex-, and injury severity—appropriate animal models of mild TBI and concussions. The following review describes the current state of knowledge of the pathophysiology of mild TBI/concussions, with particular attention to axonal injury and cognitive deficits."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      As a result of determinants specific to the psychopathological structure of the psychological trauma, psycho-traumatised patients very rarely solicit the health care system directly with a request for treatment centred on their trauma. The medical profession is consulted for non-specific symptoms and complications, which are mainly somatoform, addictions and depressive disorders. After a few epidemiological reminders followed by a discussion concerning contemporary depressive and post-traumatic nosographic features, we define, through our clinical experience collated with the data in the literature, different clinical and etiopathogenic contexts of post-traumatic depression in order to control their therapeutic treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical findings:\n        \n      \n      Burnout post-traumatic depression in response to re-experiencing is the most common: it is a reactive psycho-physiological burnout in response to the emotional distress re-experienced during flashbacks, insomnia, a constant feeling of insecurity and the deleterious consequences of this symptomatology in terms of social adaptation. A common genetic predisposition affecting serotoninergic regulation seems to be a vulnerability marker of both depressive and psychotraumatic symptoms. In this case, SSRI will be effective on sadness. In addition, these antidepressants have been widely prescribed for the first-line treatment of depressive and psychotraumatic symptoms. However, this pharmacological class is often insufficient in relieving autonomic hyperactivity such as re-experiencing which are mediated more by noradrenergic hyperactivity. SNRI such as venlafaxine can be used as a first-line treatment. Post-traumatic depression with psychotic features congruent with mood is dominated by a feeling of incurability; the subject blames himself and feels guilty about the traumatic event and its consequences. Symptoms of denial of identity are sometimes observed: confined by an intense depersonalization, the psycho-traumatised subject evokes that he is \"no longer himself\" and that his mind \"is disconnected\". Confronted with the psychological emptiness of the traumatic scene, the psycho-traumatised subject remains devoid of thought as if their mind has left him. In addition to antidepressant therapy, an atypical antipsychotic drug must be prescribed to relieve the melancholic symptoms as well as the concomitant psychotraumatic symptoms. Post-traumatic depression masked by peripheral physical injuries is the result of accidents combining psychological and physical impairment. The physical pain resulting from the accident regularly recalls the drama in the same way as traumatic re-experiencing. Depression masked by this somatic suffering is difficult to diagnose, but the repeated somatic complaints at the forefront of the request for treatment, the breakdown of self-esteem as well as the level of subjective strain due to pain and dysesthesia are all indications. The psychotherapy will focus on the symbolic reconstruction of the organs that have been damaged or destroyed, with the aim of healing the extensive narcissistic impairment. Post-concussive depression is diagnosed following a head trauma, however severe. It is sometimes assigned to neurological lesions and at other times recognised as the expression of a purely psychological reaction. Antidepressant therapy, or possibly trial therapy, is often indicated. The terms traumatic grief and post-traumatic grief are often used synonymously in publications: a conceptual opposition must however been recalled. If the traumatic grief is the result of the loss of an object that holds much psychological importance for the individual, the subject has not however been traumatised by this event and is not suffering and will not suffer from re-experiencing. The therapy will include methods used in the psychotherapeutic treatment of grief; antidepressants are often insufficient. Differently, post-traumatic grief takes shape when the loss of another is concomitant with the confrontation with the reality of the death witnessed in a moment of peri-traumatic dissociation. This grief is often observed following the discovery of the body of a close friend or family member who has committed suicide, or when part of a family has been decimated by an accident whilst the survivors watch their close relations die pending the arrival of the emergency services, or when a military comrade is wounded in combat in front of his partner. The mourning process cannot really begin until the flashbacks cease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical depression or even melancholia, possibly masked by somatic or post-concussive complaints, is often the initial mode of contact with the health care system for the psycho-traumatised subject. The different clinical and etiopathogenic contexts of post-traumatic depression that we have developed in this work use specific therapies which need to be clarified by further research based on this nosography."

We employed 2 stress paradigms: 8 weeks of continuous restraint stress (chronic restraint stress, CRS) and 2h of restraint stress (acute restraint stress, ARS), to mimic both chronic stress and severe acute stress. Prolonged (4 weeks) and short-term (a single injection) Ipt treatment was administered 30min before each stress paradigm. We found that HPA axis was altered after stress, with different responses to CRS (lower ACTH and CORT, higher AVP, but normal CRH) and ARS (higher CRH, ACTH and CORT, but normal AVP). Both prolonged and short-term Ipt treatment normalized stress-induced HPA axis disorders and abnormal behaviors in mice. CRS and ARS up-regulated mRNA levels of inflammation-related molecules (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and TLR4) and oxidative stress molecules (gp91phox, iNOS and Nrf2) in the mouse hypothalamus. Double immunofluorescence showed CRS and ARS increased microglia activation (CD11b and TNFα) and oxidative stress in neurons (NeuN and gp91phox), which were alleviated by Ipt. Therefore, the present study reveals that Ipt could prevent against stress-induced HPA axis disorders and depressive behavior by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress in the hypothalamus."

            "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain has currently become a remarkable public health concern, considerably damaging not only the physiological but also the psychological aspects of humans. This study investigated whether neuropathic pain affects maternal care and assessed the effect of parental neuropathic pain on the development of neuropathic pain and emotion among offspring. Our results showed that mother rats suffered from chronic constriction injury (CCI) exhibited defective maternal care. The offspring fed by CCI mother rats (own or cross-fed) showed a significant increase in anxiety and anxiety-related behavior compared with that fed by sham-operated mother rats. The offspring fed by CCI mother rats also displayed decreased oxytocin expression in their supraoptic nucleus than that fed by sham-operated mother rats. Moreover, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 expression in the amygdale was increased, whereas DNMT3a and DNMT3b expressions remained the same in offspring fed by CCI mother rats, as detected with immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In addition, the total DNA methylation in amygdale was upregulated in offspring fed by CCI mother rats. Considering the above findings, the data of this study suggest that parental neuropathic pain influences emotion-related behavior in offspring through maternal feeding behavior rather than through genetic factors and pregnancy experience that was associated with DNA methylation of amygdale in offspring."

            "abstract": "Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairments in military service members and veterans. Recent animal studies show that GABA-ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons are susceptible to brain injury, with damage causing abnormal increases in spontaneous gamma-band (30-80 Hz) activity. We investigated spontaneous gamma activity in individuals with mTBI using high-resolution resting-state magnetoencephalography source imaging. Participants included 25 symptomatic individuals with chronic combat-related blast mTBI and 35 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. Compared with controls, gamma activity was markedly elevated in mTBI participants throughout frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, whereas gamma activity was reduced in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Across groups, greater gamma activity correlated with poorer performances on tests of executive functioning and visuospatial processing. Many neurocognitive associations, however, were partly driven by the higher incidence of mTBI participants with both higher gamma activity and poorer cognition, suggesting that expansive upregulation of gamma has negative repercussions for cognition particularly in mTBI. This is the first human study to demonstrate abnormal resting-state gamma activity in mTBI. These novel findings suggest the possibility that abnormal gamma activities may be a proxy for GABA-ergic interneuron dysfunction and a promising neuroimaging marker of insidious mild head injuries."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a complex phenomenon leading to neurological diseases and persistent disability that currently affects millions of people worldwide. Increasing evidence shows that a wide range of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) suffer from depression during the initial stages of injury and the post-acute stages of recovery. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in depression following mTBI are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor is involved in the regulation of depression-related behaviors following mild traumatic brain injury in mice. Mice with or without mTBI received intracerebroventricular injections of 5-HT1A receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT) or antagonist (WAY-100635) for 5 days, then animals were subjected to behavioral tests. Four behavioral tests including novelty-suppressed feeding test, forced swim test, sucrose preference test and tail suspension test were used to evaluate depression-related symptoms in animals. Our results indicated that mTBI induction increased depression-like symptoms through altering serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activity in the brain. Activation of 5-HT1A receptor by a subthreshold dose of 8-OH-DPAT led to a significant decrease in depression-like behaviors, whereas blockade of 5-HT1A receptor by a subthreshold dose of WAY-100635 resulted in a considerable increase in depression-like phenotypes in mTBI-induced mice. The major strength of the present study is that depression-related symptoms were assessed in four behavioral tests. The present study supports the idea that disturbances in the function of serotonergic system in the brain following mTBI can play an important role in the regulation of depression-related behaviors."

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), often referred to as concussion, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sleep disturbances are common after mTBI. Moreover, subjects who develop subjective sleep complaints after mTBI also report more severe somatic, mental health, and cognitive impairment and take longer to recover from mTBI sequelae. Despite many previous studies addressing the role of sleep in post-mTBI morbidity, the mechanisms linking sleep to recovery after mTBI remain poorly understood. The glymphatic system is a brainwide network that supports fluid movement through the cerebral parenchyma and the clearance of interstitial solutes and wastes from the brain. Notably, the glymphatic system is active primarily during sleep. Clearance of cellular byproducts related to somatic, mental health, and neurodegenerative processes (e.g., amyloid-β and tau, among others) depends in part on intact glymphatic function, which becomes impaired after mTBI. In this viewpoint, we review the current knowledge regarding the association between sleep disturbances and post-mTBI symptoms. We also discuss the role of glymphatic dysfunction as a potential link between mTBI, sleep disruption, and posttraumatic morbidity. We outline a model where glymphatic dysfunction and sleep disruption caused by mTBI may have an additive effect on waste clearance, leading to cerebral dysfunction and impaired recovery. Finally, we review the novel techniques being developed to examine glymphatic function in humans and explore potential interventions to alter glymphatic exchange that may offer a novel therapeutic approach to those experiencing poor sleep and prolonged symptoms after mTBI."

Focusing on contact-sport players who are at great risk of mTBI, our study was designed to examine the moderating role of internal locus of control. Specifically, we predicted that following diagnosis threat (reminder of their risk of sustaining mTBI and of its consequences), low-internal contact-sport players would underperform (assimilation to the stereotype), while their high-internal counterparts would outperform (contrast effect). We predicted that effort and anxiety would mediate these effects.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Contact-sport players and non-contact-sport players (\"control\" group) were randomly assigned to one condition (diagnosis threat or neutral) and then completed attention, executive, episodic memory, and working memory tasks.

A total of 31 patients aged 10 to 18 years participated in the intervention. The median time since injury at treatment onset was 95 days though the range was large (23-720 days). Treatment was on average four sessions in duration. Sessions included concussion education, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring. Outcomes were measured using symptom reports on the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool - Third Edition (SCAT-3) and parent-reported quality of life on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Mixed-effects models revealed that symptom reports did not decrease prior to the initiation of this treatment, though significant symptom improvement occurred following treatment. Quality of life scores significantly improved across domains, with the largest gains made in the emotional and school domains. Participant characteristics including age, sex, maternal education, and previous mental health problems were not found to be significantly related to treatment outcomes. Contrary to predictions, length of time since injury was not related to symptom changes. The primary limitation of this study is that it lacks randomization and an experimental control group. The results suggest that brief cognitive behavioral intervention may be a promising treatment for children and adolescents experiencing persistent post-concussive symptoms and warrants further investigation."

CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor that plays a role in innate immunity, inflammation and vascular dysfunction and regulates post-stroke injury, neovascularization, reactive astrogliosis and scar formation. By subjecting WT and CD36KO mice to different MCAo occlusion durations to generate comparable acute lesion sizes, we addressed the role of CD36 in BBB dysfunction, scar formation and recovery. The majority of stroke recovery studies primarily focus on motor function. Here, we employed an extensive behavioral test arsenal to evaluate psychological and cognitive endpoints. While not evident during the acute phase, CD36 deficient mice displayed significantly attenuated BBB leakage and scar formation at three months after stroke compared to wild-type littermates. Assessment of motor (open field, rotarod), anxiety (plus maze, light-dark box), depression (forced swim, sucrose preference) and memory tests (water maze) revealed that CD36 deficiency ameliorated stroke-induced behavioral impairments in activity, hedonic responses and spatial learning and strategy switching. Our findings indicate that CD36 contributes to stroke-induced BBB dysfunction and scar formation in an injury-independent manner, as well as to the chronic motor and neurophysiological deficits in chronic stroke."

MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched, with additional searching of key journals, clinical trials registries, and international drug regulators. The primary outcomes of interest were reduction in symptoms of anxiety and occurrence of harms.

            "abstract": "Concussion in athletes can contribute to early neuropsychological changes that may be indicative of future neurodegenerative disease. One of the hallmark findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy is anxiety and impulsive behavior that often develops early in the course of the disease. The behavioral dysfunction can be grouped into a broader category referred to as cognitive disruption. The current gold standard for diagnosing chronic neurodegeneration is post-mortem evaluation of tauopathy to identify neurofibrillary tau tangles in neurons. Few studies, however, have looked at clinical correlations between acute injury and chronic neurodegeneration in terms of behavior. This lack of focus towards translational study has limited advancements towards treatment. In this pilot investigation, the acute cognitive and emotional (anger, impulsivity, and anxiety) affects of concussion in a cohort of collegiate athletes (n = 30) are examined and compared to findings in the post-mortem pathologic features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Specifically, the role of the seroternergic system with alpha synuclein and tauopathy staining and the potential for early clinically relevant behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions was investigated. The purpose was to determine if athletes began demonstrating cognitive disruption present in post-mortem evaluation during the acute phase of injury. The acute data was collected via questionnaires within ten days of the athletes' concussion diagnosis. Results demonstrated that 11 of 30 athletes (36%) scored in a diagnosable range of anxiety post-concussion, and athletes scored above the norm in state-anger (M = 22.9, SD = 9.99), indicating severe emotional disturbance. A limitation is that due to the long time frame from acute injury to the development of neurodegeneration individual athletes cannot be tracked in longevity thus limiting the findings to the realm of correlation. The findings from this pilot study warrant further investigation into the neuropsychological aspects for how to manage concussion and prevent degenerative disease."

Craniocerebral trauma is one of the most important problems of modern neurology, due to the high frequency and severity of disability. In recent years, there has been a steady increase in effects of TBI, a significant part of which are asthenic, autonomic, cognitive, emotional and motor disorders. Factors affecting the severity of the consequences of TBI are: the severity of the injury, the age, at which the injury occurred, the time elapsed since the injury, the localization of the lesion. After mild TBI, the structure of cognitive impairment is dominated by memory and attention disorders (75%), visual-motor coordination, as well as asthenic disorders (88%), chronic headaches (95%). After moderate and severe TBI, there are more pronounced impairment of cognitive and motor functions accompanied by pathological neurological symptoms in 94-100% of children, which leads to difficulties in learning, self-service and has a negative impact on social adaptation. The article describes in detail the modern methods of complex diagnosis, as well as pathogenetically justified methods of drug therapy of cognitive disorders in patients with the consequences of TBI.

They may exhibit affective changes, such as thinking that they are worthless, alone and without any future perspectives. When they are left without the help of specialists and/or family and friends, their problems gain even greater significance. PCS includes subjective physical complaints (i.e. headache, dizziness) and cognitive, emotional and behavioral changes. PCS influences all areas of the patient's life. Subjects who have sustained head injury often have problems with marital relationships, maintaining of independence, employment, leisure activities and other functions which are related to social adjustment. Various studies have attempted to predict the post-injury status of HI patients from information available, such as data on the severity of head injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and the results of neuropsychological assessment. This kind of prediction is important in planning of rehabilitation services and thus improving the kind of help available to survivors of HI. Early prediction of post-injury psychological status may also help the patient and his family in coping with the difficulties related to the trauma.

BDNF signaling pathway-related molecules was determined by Western blotting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Paeonol attenuated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, which were accompanied by hippocampal neuronal morphological alterations. After Paeonol treatment for 4 weeks, the dendritic length and complexity and the density of dendritic spines markedly increased in the hippocampal CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG). However, CUMS or Paeonol treatment does not selectively affect dendritic spine types. Simultaneously, administration of Paeonol deterred CUMS-induced cofilin1 activation that is essential for remolding of dendritic spines. The induction of CUMS downregulated BDNF levels and upregulated Rac1/RhoA levels; however, the tendency of these was inhibited by treatment with Paeonol.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest that BDNF-Rac1/RhoA pathway may be involved in attenuation of CUMS-induced behavioral and neuronal damage by Paeonol that may represent a novel therapeutic agent for depression."

Moreover, a better understanding of the variables that contribute to community integration and life satisfaction is still needed. The aim of the study was to assess the association of mood, fatigue and post-concussive symptoms with community integration and life satisfaction early following mTBI.Research method: A total of 85 participants aged between 18 and 61 years who sustained mTBI were included. Participants answered web-based questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression symptoms, fatigue, post-concussive symptoms, community integration and life satisfaction in the first three months post mTBI.Results: Post-concussive symptoms, fatigue and anxiety were not associated with community integration or life satisfaction. However, depressive symptoms were negatively associated with community integration and life satisfaction.Conclusions: Among all acute post-concussive symptoms following mTBI, depressive symptoms seem to have strongest relationship with community integration and life satisfaction. Acute psychological intervention targeting these symptoms is strongly recommended."

The post-concussion syndrome has been defined as a clinical state where 3 or more symptoms persist for more than 3 months. This report focuses on the quantification of PCS according to the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). We studied 100 consecutive patients with MHI and normal computed tomography of the brain. At 3 months after injury, 62% reported the presence of one or more symptoms, and 40% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-concussion syndrome. Patients with post-concussion syndrome had significantly (P < 0.001) higher RPQ scores (mean 19.1, SD 11.9) than those without (mean 1.2, SD 1.8). Patients on sick leave owing to the injury reported significantly (P = 0.05) higher RPQ scores (mean 10.3, SD 13.2) than those not on sick leave (mean 5.5, SD 8.6). We observed no association between age, gender, cause of injury, severity of injury, duration of amnesia and RPQ score.

            "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation has generated extensive interest within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation community, but little work has been done with repetitive protocols, which can produce prolonged changes in behavior. This is partly because of concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria. In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study. Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure. The stimulation was well tolerated and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score."

Moreover, they might play a pivotal role in conveying the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of a (more or less) stronger proneness for, or resilience against psychopathology. There are only few insights in the neurobiology of genetically and environmentally based individual differences in fear learning and extinction. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 74 healthy subjects were investigated. These were invited according to 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 (S+ vs. L(A)L(A); triallelic classification) and TPH2 (G(-703)T) (T+ vs. T-) genotype. The aim was to investigate the influence of genetic factors and traumatic life events on skin conductance responses (SCRs) and neural responses (amygdala, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) during acquisition and extinction learning in a differential fear conditioning paradigm. Fear acquisition was characterized by stronger late conditioned and unconditioned responses in the right insula in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. During extinction traumatic life events were associated with reduced amygdala activation in S-allele carriers vs. non-carriers. Beyond that, T-allele carriers of the TPH2 (G(-703)T) polymorphism with a higher number of traumatic life events showed enhanced responsiveness in the amygdala during acquisition and in the vmPFC during extinction learning compared with non-carriers. Finally, a combined effect of the two polymorphisms with higher responses in S- and T-allele carriers was found in the dACC during extinction. The results indicate an increased expression of conditioned, but also unconditioned fear responses in the insula in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. A combined effect of the two polymorphisms on dACC activation during extinction might be associated with prolonged fear expression. Gene-by-environment interactions in amygdala and vmPFC activation may reflect a neural endophenotype translating genetic and adverse environmental influences into vulnerability for or resilience against developing affective psychopathology."

Risk factors for injury are impulsivity, poor supervision, and parents who are unable to set limits.

One of these factors is co- and pre-morbidities, which includes migraines, mental health disorders, attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), learning disability, and sleep disorders. Mental health disorders, and in particular, depression, have received some attention in the management of SRC and in this review we summarize the empirical evidence for its inclusion as a modifying factor. This review is divided into three main bodies of findings: (1) the incidence and prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in non-concussed and concussed athletes, with comparison made to the general population; (2) managing the post-concussion athlete and accounting for premorbid depressive symptoms; and (3) depression as a long-term effect of repetitive head trauma. Overall, it has been reported that certain subpopulations of athletes have similar or even higher rates of depressive symptoms when compared to the general population. The challenge of accounting for these baseline-depressive symptoms while managing the post-concussive athlete is stressed.

As a compound that can cross the placental barrier to promote fetal lung maturation, dexamethasone is extensively used in pregnant women at risk of premature delivery.

In the present study, we observed anxiety- and depressive-like behavior changes and hyperexcitability of hippocampal neurons in adult rat offspring with previous prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE); the observed changes were related to in utero damage of parvalbumin interneurons. A programmed change in neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4) signaling was the key to the damage of parvalbumin interneurons in the hippocampus of PDE offspring. Anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, NRG1-ErbB4 signaling activation, and damage of parvalbumin interneurons in PDE offspring were aggravated after chronic stress. The intervention of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling contributed to the improvement in dexamethasone-mediated injury to parvalbumin interneurons. These results suggested that PDE might cause anxiety- and depressive-like behavior changes in male rat offspring through the programmed activation of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling, resulting in damage to parvalbumin interneurons and hyperactivity of the hippocampus. Intrauterine programming of neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) overactivation by dexamethasone mediates anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in male rat offspring."

In order to understand inconsistencies in agreement, we also examined the associations between evaluation outcomes and conceptually relevant patient characteristics, deployment-related events, current self-reported health symptoms, and suspected psychiatric conditions. The Veteran sample comprised 14,026 OIF/OEF VA patients with deployment-related mTBI history (n = 9,858) or no history of mTBI (n = 4,168) as defined by ACRM-based criteria. In the majority of cases (76.0%), clinician judgment was in agreement with the ACRM-based criteria. The most common inconsistency was between clinician judgment (no) and ACRM-based criteria (yes) for 21.3% of the patients. Injury etiology, current self-reported health symptoms, and suspected psychiatric conditions were additional factors associated with clinician diagnosis and ACRM-based criteria disagreement. Adherence to established diagnostic guidelines is essential for accurate determination of mTBI history and for understanding the extent to which mTBI symptoms resolve or persist over time in OIF/OEF Veterans."

Parents from both groups filled in standardized questionnaires containing questions about the health condition of the children: headache, neck pain, dizziness, malaise, fatigability, exercise or noise intolerance, irritability, weepiness, sadness, anxiety, nocturnal enuresis, tics, sleep disorders, memory or learning difficulties, hyperactivity, seizures, attention disorder, buzzing in the ears, subjective parental concerns about the child's health condition, and parental concerns about their child having a brain disorder. The severity of the complaints was rated on the Visual Analogue Scale. After the final exclusion, 102 pairs strictly matched by sex, age, and the date of trauma were analyzed. The differences of parental complaints about the health condition of their children between case and control groups were statistically insignificant for all symptoms, except parental concerns about their child having brain damage which were significantly higher in the case group. The likelihood of parental concerns about the possibility of their child having brain damage was 2.7 times higher in the case group. Headache, learning difficulties, and sleep disorders were significant variables predicting the concerns. These results question the validity of the post-concussion syndrome in children."

            "abstract": "Repeated or chronic stressful stimuli induce emotion- and mood-related abnormalities, such as anxiety and depression. Conversely, regular exercise exerts protective effects. Here, we found that exercise recovered anxiety-like behaviors, as measured using the open field and elevated plus maze tests in an anxiety mouse model. In addition to behavioral improvement, exercise enhanced the synaptic density of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), but not the 5-HT1AR in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) region in this mouse model. Furthermore, global treatment with a selective 5-HT2AR antagonist (MDL11930) generated an anxiety phenotype. Thus, synaptic recruitment of 5-HT2AR in BLA neurons may mediate the anxiolytic effects of exercise. The exercise regimen also reduced adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR)-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) activation, and the anxiolytic effect of the exercise was blunted by local activation of A2AR within the BLA using CGS21680, a selective A2AR agonist. Particularly, A2AR-mediated PKA activity was shown to be dependent on 5-HT2AR signaling in the BLA. These results imply that repeated stress upregulates A2AR-mediated adenosine signaling to facilitate PKA activation, whereas regular exercise inhibits A2AR function by increasing 5-HT2AR in the BLA. Accordingly, this integrated modulation of 5-HT and adenosine signaling, via 5-HT2AR and A2AR respectively, may be a mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effect of regular exercise."

Both receptors are also related to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that include difficulties in concentration and memory, impaired executive functions, psychomotor slowing, depression and irritability, which are also hallmarks of the long-term sequelae of TBI. Moreover, A growing body of evidence attributes negative influences to CCR5 activation on cognition, particularly after stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here we investigated the effect of their blockage on motor and cognitive functions, on brain tissue loss and preservation and on some of the biochemical pathways involved. We examined the effect of maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist used in HIV patients as a viral entry inhibitor, and of plerixafor (AMD3100), a CXCR4 antagonist used in cancer patients as an immune-modulator, on mice subjected to closed head injury (CHI). Mice were treated with maraviroc or plerixafor after CHI for the following 4 or 5 days, respectively. Neurobehavior was assessed according to the Neurological Severity Score; cognitive tests were performed by using the Y-maze, Barnes maze and the novel object recognition test; anxiety was evaluated with the open field test. The mice were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected for Western blot, pathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Both drugs enhanced tissue preservation in the cortex, hippocampus, periventricular areas, corpus callosum and striatum, and reduced astrogliosis)GFAP expression). They also increased the levels of synaptic cognition-related signaling molecules such as phosphorylated NR1 and CREB, and the synaptic plasticity protein PSD95. Both treatments also enhanced the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 on different brain cell types. In summary, the beneficial effects of blocking CCR5 and CXCR4 after CHI suggest that the drugs used in this study, both FDA approved and in clinical use, should be considered for translational research in TBI patients."

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep disturbance, concussion duration, and repeated concussions by assessing postconcussive symptoms and cognition. Methods: Subjects (ages 13-33 years) underwent postconcussion cognitive function evaluation and reported postconcussion symptoms including severity of disturbed sleep (drowsiness, trouble falling asleep, sleeping more than usual, and sleeping less than usual), mood disturbance (sadness, irritability, nervousness, and emotional lability), and headache. Data on cognitive function and concussive symptoms were collected for 430 subjects after first concussion, 192 subjects after second concussion, and 118 subjects after three or more concussions. A subset of subjects (119) were monitored longitudinally to assess concussion duration. Analyses included group comparisons, regression, and correlation; data were adjusted for age and gender. Results: Sleep disturbance differed significantly by group (mean[SEM]: 1st concussion = 2.56[0.2]; 2nd concussion = 3.65[0.34]; 3+ concussions = 4.32[0.43]). Concussion history predicts concussion duration (R2 = 0.20, F[1,116] = 27.33, p < 0.001). Furthermore, trouble falling asleep (β = 0.15) and sleeping less than usual (β = 0.15) predicted concussion duration (R2 = 0.062, F[1,116] = 3.15, p = 0.047).

In addition, after repeated concussions, the positive correlation between sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction strengthened. Conclusions: History of repeated concussion is associated with longer concussion duration and higher reported sleep disturbance. Furthermore, those with sleep disturbance after repeated concussion exhibit more severe headaches, mood disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction.Abbreviations: ImPACT: Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Assessment (ImPACT); this is a computer-based test that assesses an individual's cognitive function and cumulatively documents current concussion symptoms.

            "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been an increasing awareness that traumatic brain injury (TBI) and concussion substantially increase the risk for developing psychiatric disorders. Even mild TBI increases the risk for depression and anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder by two- to threefold, predisposing patients to further functional impairment. This strong epidemiological link supports examination of potential mechanisms driving neuropsychiatric symptom development after TBI. One potential mechanism for increased neuropsychiatric symptoms after TBI is via inflammatory processes, as central nervous system inflammation can last years after initial injury. There is emerging preliminary evidence that TBI patients with posttraumatic stress disorder or depression exhibit increased central and peripheral inflammatory markers compared with TBI patients without these comorbidities. Growing evidence has demonstrated that immune signaling in animals plays an integral role in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors after severe stress or brain injury. In this review, we will 1) discuss current evidence for chronic inflammation after TBI in the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, 2) highlight potential microglial activation and cytokine signaling contributions, and 3) discuss potential promise and pitfalls for immune-targeted interventions and biomarker strategies to identify and treat TBI patients with immune-related neuropsychiatric symptoms."

It was also prompted by the recent publication of national clinical guidelines in the UK about the management of prolonged disorders of consciousness. In this editorial we highlight the depth and range of emotional reactions commonly experienced by families with a severely brain injured relative. We suggest that clinicians should understand such emotions as normal responses to a terrible situation, and consider the ways in which clinical practice can be adapted to avoid contributing to family trauma."

There were moderate correlations between anger and anxiety (Spearman's ρ=0.61) and between depression and affective anger (ρ=0.51), hostility (ρ=0.56), and perceived hostility (ρ=0.35). Participants were dichotomized into a possible depression group (N=49) and a no-depression group (N=117) on the basis of the question \"I feel depressed,\" specific to the past 7 days. The possible depression group reported higher anxiety (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.51), anger (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.96), and hostility (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.95).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Some degree of anger and aggression are reported by a sizable minority of middle-aged men in the general population with no known history of TBI.

            "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency initiates a loss of combat effectiveness by impairing physical and cognitive functioning of combat Operators. Synthesized in response to sunlight and consumed in the diet, vitamin D functions as a hormone and regulates gene expression for nearly 300 genes throughout the human body. These target genes are involved processes essential to combat operations, such as immune function, response to stress, inflammation, and regulation of calcium movement. Since widespread vitamin D deficiency is observed across the U.S. population, poor vitamin D status is expected in Servicemembers. Physical conditions linked to vitamin D deficiency include increased risk for muscle or bone injury, muscle weakness, and reduced neuromuscular function. Hormonally, vitamin D levels have been positively correlated with testosterone levels. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with cognitive decline, depression, and may prolong recovery following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Since vitamin D deficiency elevates systemic inflammation, poor vitamin D status at the time of brain injury may prolong the inflammatory response and exacerbate postconcussive symptoms. Furthermore, veterans with mTBI experience chronic endocrine dysfunction. While vitamin D status has not been assessed post-mTBI, it is plausible that vitamin D levels are altered along with testosterone and growth hormone, raising the question of whether vitamin D deficiency results from trauma-related hormonal abnormalities or whether vitamin D deficiency increases the risk for endocrine dysfunction. Through its association with testosterone production, vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since testosterone levels are altered in veterans with PTSD. Therefore, vitamin D status has a significant impact on Operator health and performance. Supplementing vita-min D to deficient Operators provides a noninvasive and low-cost intervention to maintain combat force."

A self-report measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) was administered at the pre- and post-intervention time points and at follow-up, around 5 weeks after the final session. Participants also completed an individual assessment of change questionnaire at follow-up, reporting on subjective views of observed changes.Results: Statistically significant improvements were found on measures of both anxiety and depression following completion of the relaxation program. Scores at follow-up (mean = 5 weeks) revealed the improvement was maintained for anxiety, and there was further significant improvement for depression. Reliable change analyses from pre- to post-intervention demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in anxiety scores for 47% of participants and in depression scores for 30% of participants. No clinically significant increase in depression and anxiety was identified from pre- to post-intervention, and this was generally maintained at follow-up.Conclusion: Relaxation training is proposed as a clinically effective treatment for anxiety and depression in people living with long-term neurological conditions, which could in turn lead to better functional outcomes of neurorehabilitation. The program investigated here has additional benefits of being delivered in people's own homes, which overcomes barriers to attending hospital, and is consistent with trends towards home as opposed to hospital care. This program may also be less costly to administer as it can be delivered as part of a stepped-care program by therapy assistants under supervision from qualified staff, and encourages self-management over the longer term. Design limitations may reduce the generalisability of these findings, but are clinically encouraging and should stimulate further research.Implications for RehabilitationRelaxation training…• could be offered as an effective first-line intervention, as an alternative to medication to treat anxiety and depression to people living with Long-Term Neurological Conditionsis a self-management strategy which can be taught in people's own homes, if getting out of the house is difficultcan be delivered as a stepped-care intervention via therapy assistants, helping to reduce costs and demands on rehabilitation servicesmay help to improve the functional outcomes of wider rehabilitation interventions by addressing psychological issues which can be a barrier."

Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control (CT), neuropathic pain (NP), NPtDCS, NP + alcohol (NPAL), or NPALtDCS groups, subjected to sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) and exposed to alcohol (20% v/v solution, 4 g/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 15 days. Afterward, rats were treated using bimodal tDCS (0.5 mA/20 min/8 days) and tested in the open field. Rats were killed 24 h after the last behavioral assessment, and brain and spinal cord tissue samples were collected and processed for NPY immunohistochemistry, expression of Il1a and Il1b in the spinal cord, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and levels of IL-1α and IL-1β in the same brain structures and the striatum. tDCS reverted the anxiety-like behavior induced by CCI and alcohol, and the increased expression of Il1a in the spinal cord induced by alcohol, which increased the expression of Il1b in the cerebellum. In addition, tDCS modulated the hypothalamic NPY-immunoreactivity, increased the levels of IL-1α in the hippocampus (like NP and AL), and increased the expression of Il1b in the spinal cord (like AL). Thus, this study shows that tDCS changes NP and alcohol-induced anxiety-like behavior, possibly through its central modulatory effect of NPY and spinal cord expression of Il1a and Il1b, being considered a treatment option for alcohol and NP-induced anxiety symptoms."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects approximately 3 million Americans yearly and increases vulnerability to developing psychiatric comorbidities. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent psychiatric diagnosis preceding injury and TBI may increase subsequent alcohol use. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a limbic structure commonly affected by TBI that is implicated in anxiety and AUD. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) regulate synaptic activity in the BLA, and BLA eCB modulation alters anxiety-like behavior and stress reactivity. Previous work from our laboratories showed that systemic eCB degradation inhibition ameliorates TBI-induced increases in anxiety-like behavior and motivation to respond for alcohol in male rats. Here, we used a lateral fluid percussion model to test moderate TBI effects on anxiety-like behavior, alcohol drinking, and eCB levels and cell signaling in BLA, as well as the effect of alcohol drinking on anxiety-like behavior and the BLA eCB system, in female rats. Our results show that TBI does not promote escalation of operant alcohol self-administration or increase anxiety-like behavior in female rats. In the BLA, TBI and alcohol drinking alter tissue amounts of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) 1 h post-injury, and 2-AG levels remain low 11 days post-injury. Eleven days after injury, BLA pyramidal neurons were hyperexcitable, but measures of synaptic transmission and eCB signaling were unchanged. These data show that TBI impacts BLA 2-AG tissue levels, that this effect is modified by alcohol drinking, and also that TBI increases BLA cell excitability."

            "abstract": "Chronic pain with comorbid emotional disorders is a prevalent neurological disease in patients under various pathological conditions, yet patients show considerable difference in their vulnerability to developing chronic pain. Understanding the neurobiological basis underlying this pain vulnerability is essential to develop targeted therapies of higher efficiency in pain treatment of precision medicine. However, this pain vulnerability has not been addressed in preclinical pain research in animals to date. In this study, we investigated individual variance in both sensory and affective/emotional dimensions of pain behaviors in response to chronic neuropathic pain condition in a mouse model of chronic pain. We found that mice displayed considerably diverse sensitivities in the chronic pain-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of affective pain. Importantly, the mouse group that was more vulnerable to developing anxiety was also more vulnerable to developing depressive behavior under the chronic pain condition. In contrast, there was relatively much less variance in individual responses in the sensory dimension of pain sensitization. Molecular analysis revealed that those mice vulnerable to developing the emotional disorders showed a significant reduction in the protein level of DNA methyltransferase 3a in the emotion-processing central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, social stress also revealed significant individual variance in anxiety behavior in mice. These findings suggest that individual pain vulnerability may be inherent mostly in the emotional/affective component of chronic pain and remain consistent in different aspects of negative emotion, in which adaptive changes in the function of DNA methyltransferase 3a for DNA methylation in central amygdala may play an important role. This may open a new avenue of basic research into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying pain vulnerability."

A sample of 85 people who experienced TBI were recruited through social media websites and brain injury services across the North-West of England. The overall combined biopsychosocial model was significant, explaining 52-54.3% of the variance in SA (across five imputations of missing data). The addition of psychological variables (self-esteem, locus of control, self-efficacy) made a significant contribution to the overall model, accounting for an additional 12.2-13% of variance in SA above that explained by demographic and clinical variables. Perceived stigma was the only significant independent predictor of SA (B = .274, p = .005). The findings suggest that psychological variables are important in the development of SA following TBI and must be considered alongside clinical factors.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite high prevalence of anxiety accompanying with chronic pain, the mechanisms underlying pain-related anxiety are largely unknown. With its well-documented role in pain and emotion processing, the amygdala may act as a key player in pathogenesis of neuropathic pain-related anxiety. Pain-related plasticity and sensitization of CeA (central nucleus of the amygdala) neurons have been shown in several models of chronic pain. In addition, firing pattern of neurons with spike output can powerfully affect functional output of the brain nucleus, and GABAergic neurons are crucial in the modulation of neuronal excitability. In this study, we first investigated whether pain-related plasticity (e.g. alteration of neuronal firing patterns) and sensitization of CeA neurons contribute to nerve injury-evoked anxiety in neuropathic rats. Furthermore, we explored whether GABAergic disinhibition is responsible for regulating firing patterns and intrinsic excitabilities of CeA neurons as well as for pain-related anxiety in neuropathic rats.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We discovered that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced neuropathic pain-related anxiety-like behaviors in rats, which could be specifically inhibited by intra-CeA administration of anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Moreover, we found potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats, of which including: 1) increased burst firing pattern and early-adapting firing pattern; 2) increased spike frequency and intrinsic excitability; 3) increased amplitude of both after-depolarized-potential (ADP) and sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. In addition, we observed a remarkable reduction of GABAergic inhibition in CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats, which was proved to be important for altered firing patterns and hyperexcitability of CeA neurons, thereby greatly contributing to the development of neuropathic pain-related anxiety. Accordantly, activation of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of muscimol, a selective GABAA receptors agonist, could inhibit SNL-induced anxiety-like behaviors in neuropathic rats. By contrast, suppression of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of bicuculline, a selective GABAA receptors antagonist, produced anxiety-like behavior in normal rats.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that reduction of GABAergic inhibition may be responsible for potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons, which likely underlie the enhanced output of amygdala and neuropathic pain-related anxiety in SNL rats."

However, little is known about possible sex differences underlying the neuropathology and manifestation of one of modern war's signature injuries, traumatic brain injury (TBI). The paucity of information regarding sex differences in TBI is particularly evident when examining changes in executive function and emotion regulation associated with post concussive events. The current study objective was to observe whether patterns of orbitofrontal (OFC) functional connectivity would differ between female veterans with TBI and their male counterparts. The study further sought to determine whether OFC connectivity might be differentially associated with clinical measures of aggression and hostility. Seventeen female veterans and 24 male veterans, age 18 to 25, who met criteria for TBI completed resting state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical assessment measures. Imaging data were analyzed using left and right seed regions of the OFC, and regression analyses were conducted to observe the relationship between resting state connectivity and self-reported aggression. Females and males in this study differed in OFC connectivity, with females demonstrating greater connectivity between left and right OFC and parietal and occipital regions and males demonstrating greater connectivity between left and right OFC and frontal and temporal regions. Significant associations between resting state connectivity and clinical measures were found only in male veterans. These findings suggest that TBI may interact with sex-specific patterns of brain connectivity in male and female veterans and exert divergent effects on clinical profiles of aggression post-injury."

Diffusion-weighted images were acquired with a Siemens 3T scanner. All participants completed a clinical interview. There were no significant differences between groups on measures of depression, anxiety, stress, or post-concussion symptoms; however, NRL players scored significantly higher on the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). Voxelwise analyses of DTI measures were performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with age and AUDIT scores included as covariates. TBSS revealed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA), and increased radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and trace (TR) in white matter regions of recently retired NRL players compared with controls. FA was significantly reduced in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and right corticospinal tract while TR, RD, and AD were increased in these regions, as well as the corpus callosum, forceps major, right uncinate fasciculus, and left corticospinal tract. In summary, DTI in a small cohort of recently retired professional NRL players with a history of multiple concussions showed differences in white matter microstructure compared with age- and education-matched controls with no history of brain trauma."

            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Post-concussion syndrome refers to the adverse group of symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The Rivermead post-concussion syndrome questionnaire (RPQ) is a common clinical tool for assessing baseline post-concussion syndrome symptomology; however, it is unknown if scores on this questionnaire are associated with future disability. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the association between baseline RPQ scores and future disability in older adults with mTBI.Methods and Findings: This study used a prospective cohort design, using the RPQ to measure baseline post-concussion syndrome symptomatology. Disability at 6 months was measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE; disability), short-form 12 (SF-12; physical and mental quality of life), and self-reported recovery. Linear and logistic models adjusted for confounding factors were estimated using 200 bootstrapped samples. Individuals with higher levels of baseline symptomatology were more likely to have poor GOSE scores (RR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.51, 2.31]) and self-reported recovery (RR = 2.64, 95% CI [1.31, 8.98]) 6 months later.Conclusions: High levels of baseline symptomatology may be associated with overall disability and individual perceptions of recovery 6 months post-MTBI. While the RPQ is valid in assessing a patient's post-concussive symptoms following mTBI, it may not predict long-term physical or mental health in older adults."

However, each disorder is linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes, underscoring the need to better understand how neurologic and psychiatric risk factors interact following trauma. Here, we present data showing that individuals with a TBI are more likely to develop PTSD, and that individuals with PTSD are more likely to develop persistent cognitive sequelae related to TBI. Further, we describe neurobiological models of PTSD, highlighting how patterns of neurologic damage typical in TBI may promote or protect against the development of PTSD in brain-injured populations. These data highlight the unique course of PTSD following a TBI and have important diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment implications for individuals with a dual diagnosis."

            "abstract": "TBI is a significant risk factor for the development of dementia, with the interaction between structural damage from TBI and neuroinflammation potentially driving this relationship. This study investigated the early chronic post-TBI neuroinflammatory response and its relationship to both neurodegenerative pathology and functional impairment up to 3 months post-injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either sham surgery or the Marmarou model of diffuse moderate-severe TBI. At 1-month and 3-months post-injury, a functional battery encompassing motor function, depressive-like behaviour, anxiety and cognition was performed. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis assessed a range of inflammatory, neurodegenerative and oxidative stress markers. At both 1 and 3-months post injury, depressive-like behaviour was significantly increased in TBI animals, with TBI animals also exhibiting impaired cognitive flexibility at 3 months, although learning and memory remained intact. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in markers of synaptic integrity and astrocytic and microglia number within the pre-frontal cortex at 1-month post-injury, although this resolved by 3-months post-injury. In contrast, minimal pathology was evident within the hippocampus at 1 month, with only a decrease in neurofilament-light seen at 3 months post-injury. Thus, following a moderate-severe diffuse injury, the pre-frontal cortex is most vulnerable to early neuro-structural changes. While these changes are resolved at 3 months post-injury, future studies should investigate whether they re-emerge or progress to other areas, such as the hippocampus, at later time points, which could predispose individuals to the development of dementia."

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a proposed treatment but has not been rigorously studied for this condition. Objectives In a secondary analysis, examine for possible effects on psychomotor (balance and fine motor) and cognitive performance 1 week after an HBO2 intervention in service members with PCS after mTBI. Methods A randomized, double-blind, sham control, feasibility trial comparing pretreatment and posttreatment was conducted in 60 male active-duty marines with combat-related mTBI and PCS persisting for 3 to 36 months. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 preassigned oxygen fractions (10.5%, 75%, or 100%) at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (ATA), resulting in respective groups with an oxygen exposure equivalent to (1) breathing surface air (Sham Air), (2) 100% oxygen at 1.5 ATA (1.5 ATAO2), and (3) 100% oxygen at 2.0 ATA (2.0 ATAO2). Over a 10-week period, participants received 40 hyperbaric chamber sessions of 60 minutes each. Outcome measures, including computerized posturography (balance), grooved pegboard (fine motor speed/dexterity), and multiple neuropsychological tests of cognitive performance, were collected preintervention and 1-week postintervention. Results Despite the multiple sensitive cognitive and psychomotor measures analyzed at an unadjusted 5% significance level, this study demonstrated no immediate postintervention beneficial effect of exposure to either 1.5 ATAO2 or 2.0 ATAO2 compared with the Sham Air intervention.

This association has so far been interpreted as either spurious or psychologically mediated. Biased recall and misattribution could foster illness beliefs about brain damage that promote symptom production. Furthermore, the emotional impact of head injury could induce long-term changes in stress responsivity. Lastly, maladaptive cognitive-behavioural processes involving symptom modelling and aversive conditioning, known to play a role in functional neurological disorders, could contribute to the development of PNES after head trauma. Lesional effects of head injury, on the other hand, remain unexplored in the context of PNES. However, even mild traumatic brain injury without structural MRI abnormalities on routine imaging can lead to disruptions of network connectivity that correlate with short-term cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms. Since alterations in global functional connectivity have been demonstrated in PNES patients using imaging and electroencephalography, we hypothesize that, in some patients, TBI and the associated disruption of long-range association fibres could contribute to the individual propensity for dissociative experiences in general and PNES in particular. This possibility is explored in the context of new cognitive-behavioural models of PNES pathogenesis, and the concept of a \"dissociogenic\" brain lesion is introduced."

            "abstract": "Poor adaptation to stress, alterations in cerebrovascular function and excessive brain inflammation play critical roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurological disorders such as major depression, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and traumatic brain injury. Treatment for these highly prevalent and devastating conditions is at present very limited and many times inefficient, and the search for novel therapeutic options is of major importance. Recently, attention has been focused on the role of a brain regulatory peptide, Angiotensin II, and in the translational value of the blockade of its physiological AT(1) receptors. In addition to its well-known cardiovascular effects, Angiotensin II, through AT(1) receptor stimulation, is a pleiotropic brain modulatory factor involved in the control of the reaction to stress, in the regulation of cerebrovascular flow and the response to inflammation. Excessive brain AT(1) receptor activity is associated with exaggerated sympathetic and hormonal response to stress, vulnerability to cerebrovascular ischemia and brain inflammation, processes leading to neuronal injury. In animal models, inhibition of brain AT(1) receptor activity with systemically administered Angiotensin II receptor blockers is neuroprotective; it reduces exaggerated stress responses and anxiety, prevents stress-induced gastric ulcerations, decreases vulnerability to ischemia and stroke, reverses chronic cerebrovascular inflammation, and reduces acute inflammatory responses produced by bacterial endotoxin. These effects protect neurons from injury and contribute to increase the lifespan. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are compounds with a good margin of safety widely used in the treatment of hypertension and their anti-inflammatory and vascular protective effects contribute to reduce renal and cardiovascular failure. Inhibition of brain AT(1) receptors in humans is also neuroprotective, reducing the incidence of stroke, improving cognition and decreasing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of AT(1) receptors offers a novel and safe therapeutic approach for the treatment of illnesses of increasing prevalence and socioeconomic impact, such as mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases of the brain."

Head injury can also have long-term cognitive effects, but little is known about the long-term risk of depression associated with head injury. We investigated the lifetime rates of depressive illness 50 years after closed head injury.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were male World War II veterans who served during 1944-1945 and were hospitalized at that time for a head injury, pneumonia, or laceration, puncture, or incision wounds. We used military medical records to establish the presence and severity of closed head injuries. Veterans with (n = 520) and without (n = 1198) head injuries were interviewed in 1996-1997 for their lifetime history of depressive illness. Men with dementia were excluded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Veterans with head injury were more likely to report major depression in subsequent years and were more often currently depressed. Using logistic regression and controlling for age and education, the lifetime prevalence of major depression in the head injured group was 18.5% vs 13.4% in those with no head injury (odds ratio = 1.54, 95% confidence interval = 1.17-2.04). Current major depression was detected in 11.2% of the veterans with head injuries vs 8.5% of those without head injury (odds ratio = 1.63, 95% confidence interval = 1.07-2.50). This increase in depression could not be explained by a history of myocardial infarction, a history of cerebrovascular accident, or history of alcohol abuse. The lifetime risk of depression increased with severity of the head injury.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The risk of depression remains elevated for decades following head injury and seems to be highest in those who have had a severe head injury."

Impaired perception of emotion in voice can occur independently to facial expression and represents a specific target for remediation. No research to date has addressed this. The current study used a randomised controlled trial to examine the efficacy of a short treatment (three x two-hour sessions) for improving the ability to recognise emotional prosody for people with acquired brain injury, mostly TBI. Ten participants were allocated to treatment and 10 to waitlist. All participants remained involved for the duration of the study in the groups to which they were allocated. There were no significant treatment effects for group, but analyses of individual performances indicated that six of the treated participants made demonstrable improvements on objective measures of prosody recognition. The reasons why some participants showed improvements while others did not, was not obvious. Improvements on objective lab-based measures did not generalise to relative reports of improvements in everyday communicative ability. Nor was there clear evidence of long-term effects. In conclusion, treatment of emotional prosody was effective in the short-term for half of the participants. Further research is required to determine what conditions are required to optimise generalisability and longer-term gains."

However PCS is often difficult to diagnose using routine clinical, neuroimaging or laboratory evaluations, while CTE currently only can be definitively diagnosed postmortem. We sought to develop an animal model to simulate human repetitive concussive head injury for systematic study. In this study, mice received single or multiple head impacts by a stereotaxic impact device with a custom-made rubber tip-fitted impactor. Dynamic changes in MRI, neurobiochemical markers (Tau hyperphosphorylation and glia activation in brain tissues) and neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety, depression, motor function and cognitive function at various acute/subacute (1-7 day post-injury) and chronic (14-60 days post-injury) time points were examined. To explore the potential biomarkers of rCHI, serum levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) were also monitored at various time points. Our results show temporal dynamics of MRI consistent with structural perturbation in the acute phase and neurobiochemical changes (P-Tau and GFAP induction) in the subacute and chronic phase as well as development of chronic neurobehavioral changes, which resemble those observed in mTBI patients."

The experimental group received rTMS during a 30-minute session 5 days per week for 2 weeks; the control group received sham rTMS. The patients were then evaluated for depression using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and for cognitive function using the Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT). RESULTS A significant decrease in MADRS, TMT, and SCWT was observed after the intervention in the experimental group (P<0.01), and there was a significant difference in the change value of MADRS, TMT, and SCWT compared to the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the effect size for gains in the experimental group and control group was very strong for MADRS, TMT, and SCWT (effect size=1.44, 1.49, and 1.24 respectively).

We have previously reported that neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure resulted in cognitive deficits in juvenile rats (P21); thus, the goal of the present study was to determine whether neonatal LPS exposure has long-lasting effects in adult rats. After an LPS (1mg/kg) intracerebral (i.c.) injection in postnatal day 5 (P5) Sprague-Dawley female rat pups, neurobehavioral tests were carried out on P21 and P22, P49 and P50 or P70 and P71 and brain injury was examined at 66days after LPS injection (P71). Our data indicate that neonatal LPS exposure resulted in learning deficits in the passive avoidance task, less anxiety-like (anxiolytic-like) responses in the elevated plus-maze task, reductions in the hippocampal volume and the number of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)+ cells, as well as axonal injury in the CA1 region of the middle dorsal hippocampus in P71 rats. Neonatal LPS exposure also resulted in sustained inflammatory responses in the P71 rat hippocampus, as indicated by an increased number of activated microglia and elevation of interleukin-1β content in the rat hippocampus. This study reveals that neonatal LPS exposure causes persistent injuries to the hippocampus and results in long-lasting learning disabilities, and these effects are related to the chronic inflammation in the rat hippocampus."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can initiate a very complex disease of the central nervous system (CNS), starting with the primary pathology of the inciting trauma and subsequent inflammatory and CNS tissue response. Delirium has long been regarded as an almost inevitable consequence of moderate to severe TBI, but more recently has been recognized as an organ dysfunction syndrome with potentially mitigating interventions. The diagnosis of delirium is independently associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased mortality and worse cognitive outcome across critically ill populations. Investigation of the unique problems and management challenges of TBI patients is needed to reduce the burden of delirium in this population. In this narrative review, possible etiologic mechanisms behind post-traumatic delirium are discussed, including primary injury to structures mediating arousal and attention and secondary injury due to progressive inflammatory destruction of the brain parenchyma. Other potential etiologic contributors include dysregulation of neurotransmission due to intravenous sedatives, seizures, organ failure, sleep cycle disruption or other delirium risk factors. Delirium screening can be accomplished in TBI patients and the presence of delirium portends worse outcomes. There is evidence that multi-component care bundles including an analgesia-prioritized sedation algorithm, regular spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, protocolized delirium assessment, early mobility and family engagement can reduce the burden of ICU delirium. The aim of this review is to summarize the approach to delirium in TBI patients with an emphasis on pathogenesis and management. Emerging CNS-active drug therapies that show promise in preclinical studies are highlighted."

Subjects underwent symptom, neuropsychological, and psychological testing, before and after treatment or control with retesting 2 months after the 40th HBOT. Fifty subjects completed the protocol with primary outcome testing. HBOT subjects experienced significant improvements in Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, Memory Index, Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality Of Life after Brain Injury compared to the Control Group.

A 35-year-old male (BR) with impaired ability to recognize facial emotions as a result of severe TBI participated in the study over a 3-month duration. BR's mean accuracy across six universal static facial expressions of emotion improved significantly during intervention and was maintained at follow up. BR was most impaired in labelling negative (sad, angry, disgusted, anxious) versus positive facial expressions (surprised, happy). BR's accuracy to negative facial affect significantly improved during intervention. No further improvement was possible for positive expressions because a ceiling effect was observed at baseline. Overall BR's mean response times across emotions was reduced at baseline but increased significantly during intervention. This was also recorded for both positive and negative expressions, respectively. This novel combined intervention has potential to improve facial affect recognition after TBI. Further evaluation using a multiple-baseline design is recommended.

We compared differences in brain structure, specifically cortical thickness (CT), cortical volume (CV), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 54 individuals who sustained a recent mTBI and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Individuals with mTBI were split into three groups, depending on their time since injury. By comparing structural measures between mTBI and HC groups, differences in CT reflected cortical thickening within several areas following 0-3 (time-point, TP1) and 3-6 months (TP2) post-mTBI. Compared with the HC group, the mTBI group at TP2 showed lower CSA within several areas. Compared with the mTBI group at TP2, the mTBI group during the most chronic stage (TP3: 6-18 months post-mTBI) showed significantly higher CSA in several areas. All the above reported differences in CT and CSA were significant at a cluster-forming p < .01 (corrected for multiple comparisons). We also found that in the mTBI group at TP2, CT within two clusters (i.e., the left rostral middle frontal gyrus (L. RMFG) and the right postcentral gyrus (R. PostCG)) was negatively correlated with basic attention abilities (L. RMFG: r = -.41, p = .05 and R. PostCG: r = -.44, p = .03). Our findings suggest that alterations in CT and associated neuropsychological assessments may be more prominent during the early stages of mTBI.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Patellar instability with medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) deficiency is a common sports injury among young people. Although nonoperative and surgical treatment can provide stability of the patella, patients often have anxiety related to the knee. We speculate that neural dysfunction may be related to anxiety in these patients; however, the mechanism in the brain that generates this anxiety remains unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      (1) How does brain activity in patients with MPFL deficiency change in the areas related to somatic sensation against lateral shift of the patella? (2) How does patella instability, which can lead to continuous fear or apprehension for dislocation, influence brain activity in the areas related to emotion?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Nineteen patients with MPFL deficiency underwent surgical reconstruction in our hospital from April 2012 to March 2014. Excluding seven patients with osteochondral lesions, 12 patients (five males and seven females; mean age, 20 years) with MPFL deficiency were sequentially included in this study. Eleven control subjects (four males and seven females; mean age, 23 years) were recruited from medical students who had no history of knee injury. Diagnosis of the MPFL deficiency was made with MR images, which confirmed the rupture, and by proving the instability with a custom-made biomechanical device. Brain activity during passive lateral stress to the patella was assessed by functional MRI. Functional and anatomic images were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. Differences in functional MRI outcome measures from the detected activated brain regions between the patients with MPFL deficiency and controls were assessed using t tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Intergroup analysis showed less activity in several sensorimotor cortical areas, including the contralateral primary somatosensory areas (% signal change for MPFL group 0.49% versus 1.1% for the control group; p < 0.001), thalamus (0.2% versus 0.41% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), ipsilateral thalamus (0.02% versus 0.27% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), and ipsilateral cerebellum (0.82% versus 1.25% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001) in the MPFL deficiency group than in the control group. In contrast, the MPFL deficiency group showed more activity in several areas, including the contralateral primary motor area (1.06% versus 0.6% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), supplementary motor area (0.89% versus 0.52% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), prefrontal cortex (1.09% versus 1.09% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), inferior parietal lobule (0.89% versus 0.62% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), anterior cingulate cortex (0.84% versus 0.08% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), visual cortex (0.86% versus 0.14% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), vermis (1.18% versus 0.37% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001), and ipsilateral prefrontal cortex (1.1% versus 0.75% for the MPFL versus control, respectively; p < 0.001) than did the control group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Less activity in the contralateral somatosensory cortical areas suggested that MPFL deficiency may lead to diminished somatic sensation against lateral shift of the patella. In contrast, increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule may indicate anxiety or fear resulting from patellar instability, which is recognized as an aversion similar to that toward chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that specific brain-area activity is increased in patients with MPFL deficiency relative to that in controls. Further longitudinal research to assess brain activity and proprioception between patients pre- and postreconstructive knee surgery may reveal more regarding how patella instability is related to brain function. We hope that based on such research, a neural approach to improve patella-instability-related brain function can be developed."

            "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders affect nearly 50% of individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anhedonia is a major symptom of numerous psychiatric disorders and is a diagnostic criterion for depression. It has recently been appreciated that reinforcement may be separated into consummatory (hedonic), motivational and decisional components, all of which may be affected differently in disease. Although anhedonia is typically assessed using positive reinforcement, the importance of stress in psychopathology suggests the study of negative reinforcement (removal or avoidance of aversive events) may be equally important. The present study investigated positive and negative reinforcement following a rat model of mild TBI (mTBI) using lateral fluid percussion. Hedonic value and motivation for reinforcement was determined by behavioral economic analyses. Following mTBI, the hedonic value of avoiding foot shock was reduced. In contrast, the hedonic value of escaping foot shock or obtaining a sucrose pellet was not altered by mTBI. Moreover, motivation to avoid or escape foot shock or to acquire sucrose was not altered by mTBI. Our results suggest that individuals experiencing mTBI find avoidance of aversive events less reinforcing, and therefore are less apt to utilize proactive control of stress."

Although positive affect had a negligible effect on Category Test improvements by itself, positive affect played a moderating role that complemented the effect of HRV coherence. HRV coherence had a stronger effect on Category Test performance among those participants who demonstrated higher positive affect. A regression model was fit that included main effects for HRV coherence and positive affect, as well as their interaction.

The present study evaluated the effect of risperidone, an atypical neuroleptic, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in aged rats, which might be more vulnerable to brain insults. Aged Wistar rats were treated with risperidone at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.p., once a day), fluoxetine at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.p., once a day), or their combination. Drug treatment was started 7 days before focal cortical photothrombosis (Rose Bengal, 20 mg/kg) and continued for 28 days thereafter. Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze before cortical stroke, immediately after stroke, and at the end of follow-up. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up. The high slip ratio for the contralateral hindlimb in ischemic rats treated with risperidone indicated sensorimotor impairment when tested 2 h after drug administration. Sensorimotor impairment was not observed, however, when the rats were tested 24 h after risperidone administration. Similarly, water-maze performance was impaired 2 h after risperidone. Fluoxetine did not affect sensorimotor or water-maze performance. Cortical infarct volumes were not different in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with antipsychotic drugs. The present study showed that an atypical neuroleptic, risperidone, acutely impairs behavioral performance, but does not affect histological or functional outcome in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis."

The cannabinoid system has essential participation in the pain sensitivity circuit. In this perspective, cannabidiol (CBD) is considered a promising strategy for treating neuropathic pain. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of sub-chronic systemic treatment with CBD (0.3, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, i.p.) in male in rats submitted to chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) or not (SHAM) and assessed in nociceptive tests (von Frey, acetone, and hot plate, three days CBD's treatment) and in the open field test (OFT, two days CBD's treatment). We performed a screening immunoreactivity of CB1 and TRPV1 receptors in cortical and limbic regions tissues, which were collected after 1.5 h of behavioral tests on the 24th experimental day. This study presents a dose-response curve to understand better the effects of low doses (3 mg/kg) on CBD's antiallodynic and anxiolytic effects. Also, low doses of CBD were able to (1) reverse mechanical and thermal allodynia (cold) and hyperalgesia, (2) reverse anxious behaviors (reduction of the % of grooming and freezing time, and increase of the % of center time in the OFT) induced by chronic pain. The peripheral neuropathy promoted the increase in the expression of CB1 and TRPV1 receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insular cortex (AIC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and ventral hippocampus (VH). CBD potentiated this effect in the ACC, AIC, BLA, DH, and VH regions. These results provide substantial evidence of the role of the ACC-AIC-BLA corticolimbic circuit, and BLA-VH for pain regulation. These results can be clinically relevant since they contribute to the evidence of CBD's beneficial effects on treating chronic pain and associated comorbidities such as anxiety."

Acute CeA infusions with the PACAP receptor antagonist PACAP(6-38) blocked chronic constriction injury-induced behavioral responses.

The survey also included the Perceptions of Concussion Inventory for Athletes (PCI-A) which results in six outcome variables (anxiety, effects, control, clarity, treatment, and symptom variability). Univariable and a backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression model were utilized to identify variables that were associated with greater (above median) negative anxiety-related concussion perception scores.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Collegiate athletes displayed moderate anxiety-related concussion perceptions (12.8 ± 3.2; scores ranged from 4 - low anxiety to 20 - high anxiety). The majority of participants reported that concussions are upsetting to them (60.7%), with a sizable proportion being worried (46.7%), fearful (40.7%), or anxious (25.0%) about sustaining a concussion. In the multivariable regression, higher perception that concussions have long-term effects (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.79-4.12), greater beliefs of internal control to influence concussion outcomes (OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.15-2.75), and female sex (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.15-2.71) were associated with higher anxiety beliefs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study for the first time establishes that negative, anxiety-related perceptions about concussions are prevalent in a collegiate athlete population. Addressing these perceptions through evidence-based, educational and management initiatives, such as highlighting that concussions are treatable and most do not result in long-term negative consequences with early diagnosis and proper management, are critical to improve emotions surrounding concussion. This may be particularly important for female athletes in this population."

            "abstract": "Twenty-nine protein kinase inhibitors have been used to treat human diseases. Out of these, two are Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2 inhibitors. The ROCKs heavily influence neuronal architecture and structural plasticity, and ROCKs are putative drug targets for various brain disorders. While the pan-ROCK inhibitor Fasudil has been clinically approved to treat hypertension, heart failure, glaucoma, spinal cord injury, and stroke, a barrier to progress on this therapeutic avenue is the lack of experimental comparisons between pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of ROCKs. Our study begins to address this question using parallel approaches to study behavior in mice that were treated with Fasudil or were heterozygous for ROCK1 or ROCK2. Adult mice treated with Fasudil for thirty days displayed reduced time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, whereas activity in the open field was more analogous to mock-treated animals. Both male and female adult ROCK1+/- and ROCK2+/- mice exhibited reduced time spent in open arms of the elevated plus maze compared to littermate controls. However, ROCK1 or ROCK2 heterozygosity did not alter performance in the open field or Y-maze. These results indicate that chronic treatment with Fasudil induces anxiety-like behaviors that are likely the consequence of ROCK1 and/or ROCK2 inhibition. Our findings may have implications for several ongoing clinical trials using Fasudil or other ROCK-based therapeutics."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To describe the clinical presentation and early clinical course of a sample of deployed U.S. military service members following concussion, underscoring the impact of pre-existing migraine and other co-occurring conditions. It is important to obtain a comprehensive clinical history to identify evidence of underlying migraine and other health conditions which may contribute to an individual's presenting symptoms influencing early management and outcomes following concussion. Early outcome measures assessed include headache treatment response and fitness for return to duty.\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      Acute concussion is reported to result in an array of somatic, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. It is well established that these symptoms are not specific for concussion and may result from exacerbation of pre-existing or underlying medical conditions and factors. Although most symptoms attributable to concussion resolve within days to weeks, there is evidence that persistent symptoms beyond that specific recovery time may be attributable to factors other than concussion. Military populations are at risk for a number of recognized co-morbid and co-occurring conditions, as well as special situational and psychosocial factors which may influence symptoms and clinical course following concussion. In addition, combat-related concussion frequently occurs in the setting of a blast or military vehicle accidents thus causing concurrent injuries where musculoskeletal injuries may contribute to the clinical presentation. The resultant acute stress reaction, secondary to the traumatic experience associated with concussion, may also cause or aggravate underlying psychological co-morbidities that may influence presenting symptoms. Prior studies identified co-morbidities associated with chronic post-concussive syndrome, which we find are also present during the early phase following deployment-related concussion, thereby influencing presentation and impacting recovery. This retrospective chart review was intended to demonstrate the presence and potential impact of co-morbid and co-occurring conditions contributing to symptoms following concussion, especially migraine due to its high prevalence among post-traumatic headaches.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective chart review was performed by the treating neurologist of 40 service members following concussion in the deployed environment. Clinical symptoms and co-morbid and co-occurring conditions including evidence of pre-existing migraine identified during comprehensive neurologic evaluations were collected. Both pre-deployment/pre-traumatic and post-traumatic headache features supporting migraine and early instituted headache management and treatment response are described. Rates of return to duty in this sample were also tabulated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Headaches were the most frequently reported acute symptom following concussion in this deployed service member population (38/40 patients [98%]), followed by insomnia, tinnitus, impaired concentration, nausea, dizziness, anxiety, impaired balance, depression, and hearing loss. Co-occurring acute injuries, acute stress reaction, and recent onset medication overuse were the most frequent co-occurring conditions identified by the treating neurologist as potentially contributing to the service member's presentation. Chronic co-morbidities identified included chronic headache, anxiety/depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Service members with 3 or more identified co-morbidities or co-occurring conditions were more likely to require evacuation from theater. Pre-deployment headaches were reported by 25/40 [63%] service members, with 5/40 [12.5%] reporting known prior personal history of migraine. Of those reporting pre-deployment headaches, 21/25 [84%] described migraine features and/or triggers, though most [(15/25) 60%] reported as infrequent. Daily post-traumatic headaches were frequent (26/38 [68%]) and associated with typical migraine features and/or triggers. Of those treated with triptans (16/40 patient [42%]), most (12/16 patient [75%]) showed positive treatment response.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Concussion in the deployed settings does not occur in isolation, with co-morbid and co-occurring conditions being common. Presence of multiple co-morbidities appears to influence clinical course and overall recovery. Post-traumatic headaches are often phenotypically fully consistent with migraine, and appear related to pre-existing migraine if supported by detailed pre-deployment headache history suggesting same. Careful and comprehensive history taking and evaluation is invaluable in identifying associated conditions including migraine, potentially helping clinicians with more accurate symptom attribution, diagnoses, and improved clinical management following acute concussion."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability, specifically among younger adults. Behavioral changes are common after moderate to severe TBI and have adverse consequences for social and vocational functioning. It is hypothesized that deficits in social cognition, including facial affect recognition, might underlie these behavioral changes. Measurement of behavioral deficits is complicated, because the rating scales used rely on subjective judgement, often lack specificity and many patients provide unrealistically positive reports of their functioning due to impaired self-awareness. Accordingly, it is important to find performance based tests that allow objective and early identification of these problems. In the present study 51 moderate to severe TBI patients in the sub-acute and chronic stage were assessed with a test for emotion recognition (FEEST) and a questionnaire for behavioral problems (DEX) with a self and proxy rated version. Patients performed worse on the total score and on the negative emotion subscores of the FEEST than a matched group of 31 healthy controls. Patients also exhibited significantly more behavioral problems on both the DEX self and proxy rated version, but proxy ratings revealed more severe problems. No significant correlation was found between FEEST scores and DEX self ratings. However, impaired emotion recognition in the patients, and in particular of Sadness and Anger, was significantly correlated with behavioral problems as rated by proxies and with impaired self-awareness. This is the first study to find these associations, strengthening the proposed recognition of social signals as a condition for adequate social functioning. Hence, deficits in emotion recognition can be conceived as markers for behavioral problems and lack of insight in TBI patients. This finding is also of clinical importance since, unlike behavioral problems, emotion recognition can be objectively measured early after injury, allowing for early detection and treatment of these problems."

            "abstract": "Psychological stress and affective disorders are clinically associated with hypertension and vascular disease, but the biological links between the conditions have not been fully explored. To examine this relationship, we used chronic social defeat (CSD) stress, which produces anxiety-like and depressive-like behavioral declines in susceptible mice. In such mice, CSD also produces cerebrovascular microbleeds in scattered locations. Here, we showed further evidence of vascular pathology and blood-brain barrier breakdown by visualizing plasma immunoglobulins and erythrocytes within the parenchyma and perivascular spaces of CSD brains. To further characterize the impact of stress on the cerebrovasculature, brain endothelial cells (bECs) were isolated, and global gene expression profiles were generated. Bioinformatic analysis of CSD-induced transcriptional changes in bECs showed enrichment in pathways that delineate the vascular response to injury. These pathways followed a temporal sequence of inflammation, oxidative stress, growth factor signaling, and wound healing (i.e., platelet aggregation, hemostasis, fibrinogen deposition, and angiogenesis). Immunohistochemical staining for markers of fibrinogen deposition and angiogenesis confirmed the existence of the markers at the sites of vascular disruptions. Recovery after CSD cessation was marked by recruitment of leukocytes perhaps participating in vascular repair. The data suggest that co-morbidity of affective disorders and vascular diseases may be attributed in part to a common link in altered endothelial cell function."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. In recent studies, we have shown that experimental TBI caused an immediate (24-h post) suppression of neuronal processing, especially in supragranular cortical layers. We now examine the long-term effects of experimental TBI on the sensory cortex and how these changes may contribute to a range of TBI morbidities. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received either a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury (n=14) or a sham surgery (n=12) and 12 weeks of recovery before behavioral assessment, magnetic resonance imaging, and electrophysiological recordings from the barrel cortex. TBI rats demonstrated sensorimotor deficits, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behavior, and this was associated with significant atrophy of the barrel cortex and other brain structures. Extracellular recordings from ipsilateral barrel cortex revealed normal neuronal responsiveness and diffusion tensor MRI showed increased fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and tract density within this region. These findings suggest that long-term recovery of neuronal responsiveness is owing to structural reorganization within this region. Therefore, it is likely that long-term structural and functional changes within sensory cortex post-TBI may allow for recovery of neuronal responsiveness, but that this recovery does not remediate all behavioral deficits."

Depression was diagnosed clinically in 3 studies, otherwise by structured interview or checklist. Only 5 studies described how they performed randomisation. 1 study compared drug with no treatment, and the rest with placebo: all of the latter said they were double blind.6 studies used SSRIs, 3 atypical antidepressants, and the remainder tricyclics.Patients treated with antidepressants were significantly more likely to improve than those given placebo (13 studies, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.51) or no treatment (1 study, OR 3.45, 95% CI 11.1-1.10). About 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4). Most antidepressants (tricyclics and SSRIs together, 15 trials ) produced a small but significant increase in dropout (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.40. NNH 9.8, 95% CI 5.4-42.9). The \"atypical\" antidepressant mianserin produced significantly less dropout than placebo. Only 2 studies used numerical scales designed to measure effects on function and quality of life; in HIV (Karnofsky scale), drug was better than no treatment; in lung disease (Sickness Impact Profile), drug was not significantly different from placebo. Only 7 studies reported looking for changes in the physical disease. Antidepressants produced no change in immune function in HIV relative to placebo (2 studies) or no treatment (1 study). Relative to placebo, antidepressants produced no change in cardiovascular function in heart disease, in respiratory function in lung disease, or in vital signs or laboratory tests in cancer (1 study each). Nortriptyline produced worse control in diabetes.

About 4 patients would need to be treated with antidepressants to produce one recovery from depression which would not have occurred had they been given placebo (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.2-6.4).

Trends towards tricyclics being more effective than SSRIs, but also more likely to produce dropout were noted, but these are based on non-randomised comparisons between trials. Problems with the evidence include most of the trials' use of observers, rather than patients, to decide on improvement, and concentration mainly on symptoms rather than function and quality of life. There is also a possibility of undetected negative trials.Nevertheless, the review provides evidence that use of antidepressants should at least be considered in those with both physical illness and depression. Regarding diagnosis, the existence of a cheap and readily available treatment for depression should encourage detailed assessment of persistent low mood in the physically ill."

The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1-3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients."

            "abstract": "Childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly occurs during brain development and can have direct, immediately observable neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral consequences. However, it can also disrupt subsequent brain development, and long-term outcomes are a combination of preinjury development and abilities, consequences of brain injury, as well as delayed impaired development of skills that were immature at the time of injury. There is a growing number of studies on mild TBI/sport-related concussions, describing initial symptoms and their evolution over time and providing guidelines for effective management of symptoms and return to activity/school/sports. Mild TBI usually does not lead to long-term cognitive or academic consequences, despite reports of behavioral/psychologic issues postinjury. Regarding moderate to severe TBI, injury to the brain is more severe, with evidence of a number of detrimental consequences in various domains. Patients can display neurologic impairments (e.g., motor deficits, signs of cerebellar disorder, posttraumatic epilepsy), medical problems (e.g., endocrine pituitary deficits, sleep-wake abnormalities), or sensory deficits (e.g., visual, olfactory deficits). The most commonly reported deficits are in the cognitive-behavioral field, which tend to be significantly disabling in the long-term, impacting the development of autonomy, socialization and academic achievement, participation, quality of life, and later, independence and ability to enter the workforce (e.g., intellectual deficits, slow processing speed, attention, memory, executive functions deficits, impulsivity, intolerance to frustration). A number of factors influence outcomes following pediatric TBI, including preinjury stage of development and abilities, brain injury severity, age at injury (with younger age at injury most often associated with worse outcomes), and a number of family/environment factors (e.g., parental education and occupation, family functioning, parenting style, warmth and responsiveness, access to rehabilitation and care). Interventions should identify and target these specific factors, given their major role in postinjury outcomes. Abusive head trauma (AHT) occurs in very young children (most often <6 months) and is a form of severe TBI, usually associated with delay before appropriate care is sought. Outcomes are systematically worse following AHT than following accidental TBI, even when controlling for age at injury and injury severity. Children with moderate to severe TBI and AHT usually require specific, coordinated, multidisciplinary, and long-term rehabilitation interventions and school adaptations, until transition to adult services. Interventions should be patient- and family-centered, focusing on specific goals, comprising education about TBI, and promoting optimal parenting, communication, and collaborative problem-solving."

            "abstract": "A history of concussion, particularly repeated injury, has been linked to an increased risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is characterized by abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and deficits in learning and memory. As yet the mechanisms associated with the development of CTE are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to develop and characterize a novel model of repetitive mTBI that accurately reproduces the key short and long-term functional and histopathological features seen clinically. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive 0, 1 or 3x mTBI spaced five days apart using a modified version of the Marmarou impact-acceleration diffuse-TBI model to deliver 110G of linear force. Functional outcomes were assessed six and twelve weeks post-injury, with histopathology assessed twenty-four hours and twelve weeks post-injury. Repetitive mTBI resulted in mild spatial and recognition memory deficits as reflected by increased escape latency on the Barnes maze and decreased time spent in the novel arm of the Y maze. There was a trend towards increased anxiety-like behavior, with decreased time spent in the inner portion of the open field. At 24 hours and 12 weeks post injury, repetitive mTBI animals showed increased tau phosphorylation and microglial activation within the cortex. Increases in APP immunoreactivity were observed in repetitive mTBI animals at 12 weeks indicating long-term changes in axonal integrity. This novel model of repetitive mTBI with its persistent cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, axonal injury and tau hyperphosphorylation, thus represents a clinically relevant experimental approach to further explore the underlying pathogenesis of CTE."

Mice were categorized according to left-side cerebral blood flow (CBF) value on day 6 into those with severe cerebral hypoperfusion (SCH; n = 16, < 30% of preoperative CBF baseline value) or moderate cerebral hypoperfusion (MCH; n = 21, 30-50% of preoperative value). Another 15 mice were sham operated. Neurological dysfunction was evaluated by Morris water maze, rotating rod, and open field tests. Histopathological examination was performed on day 35 after surgery. MCH animals showed persistent hyperlocomotion with reduced anxiety and spatial reference memory dysfunction. Rarefaction and small necrotic lesions were predominantly confined to the WM, with reactive astrocytosis, microglial infiltration, axonal loss, and myelin disruption, and these changes were dominant on the left side. SCH animals had persistent hyperlocomotion and motor dysfunction, and their ischemic lesions extended from the WM to the hippocampus and cortex. In MCH animals, myelin basic protein and neurofilament fiber densities in the WM were correlated with the time spent in the correct area in the water maze probe trials. Our MCH mouse model with the development of several types of neurological dysfunction with high reproducibility would be useful for investigating the pathomechanisms of WM injury in human SIVD."

            "abstract": "Differentiation of symptoms associated with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) versus post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following trauma presents many treatment challenges among veterans and active duty service members receiving rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The acute phase of rehabilitation poses difficulties for amnestic individuals that may elicit classic PTA symptoms as well as premorbid PTSS, thereby activating maladaptive cognitions and an increase in agitation and arousal. Historically, explicit learning and memory strategies were considered non-efficacious with amnestic individuals until PTA resolves; therefore, rehabilitation therapies have utilized implicit learning in the initial phases of recovery. However, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which uses explicit learning and memory strategies based on cognitive, trauma, and neuropsychology lowers agitation and confusion for amnestic individuals with PTSS. In this paper, two case studies present preliminary evidence for effective implicit learning following a CBT intervention for individuals in PTA after a severe TBI receiving care. Notably, following a CBT intervention, agitation, confusion, and arousal were diminished despite having no recollection of the intervention. Thus, these cases suggest amnestic individuals in the acute recovery stage after severe TBI benefit from CBT to replace maladaptive attributions minimizing PTA and PTSS (e.g., confusion, arousal, and agitation) and improving motivation, participation, and recovery."

The majority of studies show that minocycline can reduce tissue damage and improve functional recovery following central nervous system injuries, mainly attributed to the drug's direct anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties. Surprisingly the consequences of minocycline's antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) effects on the gut microbiota and systemic immune response after spinal cord injury have largely been ignored despite their links to changes in mental health and immune suppression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Here, we sought to determine minocycline's effect on spinal cord injury-induced changes in the microbiota-immune axis using a cervical contusion injury in female Lewis rats.

Plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines and fecal microbiota composition (using 16s rRNA sequencing) were monitored for 4 weeks following spinal cord injury as measures of the microbiota-immune axis.

            "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain has demonstrated that coexisting psychiatric disorders are associated with disability and poorer treatment outcomes. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN, Ih) channels play a major role in pain via hyperexcitability and facilitation of ectopic firing in neurons. Neuronal hyperexcitability contributes to pain maintenance and anxiety/depression. GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic neurotransmission in the brain is impaired in the pathophysiology of chronic neuropathic pain with comorbidity mood disorders. Currently, interaction of HCN channels and GABAergic synaptic transmission inhibition in neuropathic pain and the associated comorbidity anxiety/depression mechanism remains relatively unknown. To address this, the HCN channel inhibitor, ZD7288, was administrated to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats after spared nerve injury (SNI). Our findings show that intracerebroventricular injection of ZD7288 concurrently attenuates co-existing nociceptive and depression-like behaviors, and increases glutamicacid decarboxylase (GAD67/65) expression and GABA levels in the hippocampus and thalamus with High-performance liquid chromatography technique. It suggests that inhibition of HCN channels is likely to decrease the hyperexcitability of neurons in rat SNI and improve the level of GABA. Further, HCN channel may offer a new strategy to alleviate both neuropathic pain and comorbidity for depression."

Participants were 79 adults with mTBI recruited from one of four specialty outpatient clinics in Vancouver, Canada. The WHODAS 2.0 12 item version is a disease-nonspecific measure of disability representing six International Classification of Disability, Functioning, and Health activity and participation domains including cognition, mobility, self-care, interpersonal functioning, life activities, and participation. Results of analyses showed that the WHODAS 2.0 had high internal consistency and adequate construct and concurrent validity. A three factor structure emerged in this sample. The scale differentiated between patients with good and those with poor outcomes based on post-concussion syndrome, psychiatric, and pain status. Participants with multiple comorbidities reported the most disability on the WHODAS. Concurrent validity was also supported by lower WHODAS scores in participants who had returned to work versus those who had not. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the psychometric properties of the WHODAS 2.0 in a sample of people with mTBI. In summary, the WHODAS was sensitive to post-concussion syndrome after mTBI, as well as to health conditions that commonly co-occur with mTBI (e.g., mental health problems and chronic pain)."

However, a consistent neural substrate has not yet been found. We used graph analysis to further unravel the complex interactions between functional brain networks, complaints, anxiety and depression in the sub-acute stage after mTBI. This study included 54 patients with uncomplicated mTBI and 20 matched healthy controls. Posttraumatic complaints, anxiety and depression were measured at two weeks post-injury. Patients were selected based on presence (n = 34) or absence (n = 20) of complaints. Resting-state fMRI scans were made approximately four weeks post-injury. High order independent component analysis resulted in 89 neural components that were included in subsequent graph analyses. No differences in graph measures were found between patients with mTBI and healthy controls. Regarding the two patient subgroups, degree, strength, local efficiency and eigenvector centrality of the bilateral posterior cingulate/precuneus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus were higher, and eigenvector centrality of the frontal pole/ bilateral middle & superior frontal gyrus was lower in patients with complaints compared to patients without complaints. In patients with mTBI, higher degree, strength and eigenvector centrality of default mode network components were related to higher depression scores, and higher degree and eigenvector centrality of executive network components were related to lower depression scores. In patients without complaints, one extra module was found compared to patients with complaints and healthy controls, consisting of the cingulate areas. In conclusion, this research extends the knowledge of functional network connectivity after mTBI. Specifically, our results suggest that an imbalance in the function of the default mode- and executive network plays a central role in the interaction between emotion regulation and the persistence of posttraumatic complaints."

Firm evidence that carbamazepine or valproate is effective in the management of agitation and/or aggression following ABI is lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Numerous drugs have been tried in the management of aggression in ABI but without firm evidence of their efficacy. It is therefore important to choose drugs with few side effects and to monitor their effect. Beta-blockers have the best evidence for efficacy and deserve more attention. The lack of evidence highlights the need for better evaluations of drugs for this important problem."

            "abstract": "The case is reported of a 40 year old male high risk sport athlete who had seriously injured himself several times and as a result was partially physically disabled and had trouble with mental tasks requiring concentration such as spelling, reading numbers, and writing. The athlete was referred to a sports psychologist. In consultations, it became clear that he was having difficulty reconciling the difference between his life as it used to be and as it would be in the future. Part of his difficulty was dealing with the frustration and anger \"outbursts\" which resulted from not being able to perform straightforward everyday motor skills. In spite of his injuries and disability, the patient badly wanted to continue participating in extreme sports. Reversal theory is used in the discussion to provide theoretical explanations of the motivation for his extreme risk taking behaviour."

            "abstract": "The last 20 years has seen the emergence of a sub-category of the mild traumatic brain injury literature termed 'sport-related concussion'. Some important differences now exist between this sub-category and the wider findings in the field and these could be detrimental to patients with persisting post-concussion symptoms (PCS). Sport-related studies often emphasize the cerebral risks associated with concussive injuries whilst the broader literature typically focuses on the relatively benign organic implications and the role of psychological factors in persisting symptoms. Clinically, anxiety caused by these mixed messages could lead to an exacerbation of PCS. This paper summarizes the commonalities and differences between the literatures and addresses the key clinical implications."

Common concussion symptom inventories such as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 (SCAT5) contain a large number of questions that assess these neuropsychiatric domains. In fact, of 22 items assessed by the SCAT5, arguably only five of the items do not overlap with symptoms assessed by standard measures of anxiety and depression, suggesting that concussion is best viewed as a neuropsychiatric syndrome. Furthermore, it is important to understand the complex relationship between preinjury psychologic health, acute injury symptom profile, and the role that changes in mood, emotions, and behavior play in the recovery trajectory after concussion. Some research suggests that there may also be long-term neuropsychiatric effects of concussion, repetitive concussion, and repetitive head impacts. This chapter provides a review of the neuropsychiatric sequelae of acute SRC, the current evidence for long-term neuropsychiatric effects of repetitive concussion, and the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms on recovery trajectory.

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters stress responses, which may influence neuroinflammation and behavioral outcome. Sleep disruption (SD) is an understudied post-injury environmental stressor that directly engages stress-immune pathways. Thus, we predicted that maladaptive changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after TBI compromise the neuroendocrine response to SD and exacerbate neuroinflammation. To test this, we induced lateral fluid percussion TBI or sham injury in female and male C57BL/6 mice aged 8-10 weeks that were then left undisturbed or exposed to 3 days of transient SD. At 3 days post-injury (DPI) plasma corticosterone (CORT) was reduced in TBI compared with sham mice, indicating altered HPA-mediated stress response to SD. This response was associated with approach-avoid conflict behavior and exaggerated cortical neuroinflammation. Post-injury SD specifically enhanced neutrophil trafficking to the injured brain in conjunction with dysregulated aquaporin-4 (AQP4) polarization. Delayed and persistent effects of post-injury SD were determined 4 days after SD concluded at 7 DPI. SD prolonged anxiety-like behavior regardless of injury and was associated with increased cortical Iba1 labeling in both sham and TBI mice. Strikingly, TBI SD mice displayed an increased number of CD45+ cells near the site of injury, enhanced cortical glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunolabeling, and persistent expression of Trem2 and Tlr4 7 DPI compared with TBI mice. These results support the hypothesis that post-injury SD alters stress-immune pathways and inflammatory outcomes after TBI. These data provide new insight to the dynamic interplay between TBI, stress, and inflammation."

            "abstract": "Spectral information from resting state EEG is altered in acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and in disorders of consciousness, but there is disagreement about whether mTBI can elicit long term changes in the spectral profile. Even when identified, any long-term changes attributed to TBI can be confounded by psychiatric comorbidities such as PTSD, particularly for combat-related mTBI where postdeployment distress is commonplace. To address this question, we measured spectral power during the resting state in a large sample of service members and Veterans varying in mTBI history and active PTSD diagnosis but matched for having had combat blast exposure. We found that PTSD was associated with decreases in low frequency power, especially in the right temporoparietal region, while conversely, blast-related mTBI was associated with increases in low frequency power, especially in prefrontal and right temporal areas. Results support the idea that long-term neurophysiological effects of mTBI share some features with states of reduced arousal and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting a role for EEG in tracking the trajectory of recovery and persisting vulnerabilities to injury. Additionally, results suggest that EEG power reflects distinct pathophysiologies for current PTSD and chronic mTBI."

In this study, we investigated empathy after TBI through the lens of the perception-action model of empathy. Specifically, we looked at the effect of similarity of experience on self-reported empathy and skin conductance in participants with TBI and controls.Method: Thirty people with a traumatic brain injury and 30 matched healthy controls initially recounted three emotional events they had experienced in the past (one happy, one angry and one sad). Then, at a second visit, participants heard three stories which were written to be similar their own stories and three which were based on someone else's stories. We recorded skin conductance while participants listened and then collected self-reported levels of empathy for protagonists in the stories.Results: We found that self-reported empathy, but not skin conductance levels, was greater for similar compared to dissimilar stories. Further, participants with TBI were able to empathise with others despite having markedly reduced autonomic arousal and overall impairment in cognitive functioning.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the PAM has relevance with respect to explaining self-reported empathy for the experiences of others, but cannot explain the role of physiological responses associated with empathy. Further, our results suggest that intact cognitive functioning and physiological responses are not necessary for normal experiences of empathy after TBI."

A large percentage of patients with neuropathic pain are also afflicted with depression and anxiety disorders, a pattern that is also seen in animal models. Furthermore, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that chronic pain corresponds with adaptations in several brain networks involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Chronic stress is also a major risk factor for depression. We investigated whether chronic pain and stress affect similar molecular mechanisms and whether chronic pain can affect gene expression patterns that are involved in depression. Using two mouse models of neuropathic pain and depression [spared nerve injury (SNI) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)], we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and pathway analysis to monitor changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In addition to finding unique transcriptome profiles across these regions, we identified a substantial number of signaling pathway-associated genes with similar changes in expression in both SNI and CUS mice. Many of these genes have been implicated in depression, anxiety, and chronic pain in patients.

Among PCS patients, increased metabolism in the right cingulate gyrus correlated with the severity of postconcussion symptoms. Conversely, increased metabolism in the left temporal lobe was associated with both improved mood and measures of adaptability/rehabilitation.

While a mechanistic understanding of this discordance has thus far remained elusive, factors such as mood, attention and expectation have all been implicated as important modulators of breathlessness. Therefore, we have developed a model to better understand the relationships between these factors using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Subsequently we examined how expectation-related brain activity differed between these symptom-defined clusters of participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cohort of 91 participants with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) underwent functional brain imaging, self-report questionnaires and clinical measures of respiratory function.

Although possible mechanisms for habenula activation have been proposed, the effects of chronic stress on the habenular structure have never been studied. Herein, we assessed changes in volume, cell density and dendritic structure of habenular cells after chronic stress exposure using stereological and 3D morphological analysis. This study shows for the first time that there is a hemispherical asymmetry in the medial habenula (MHb) of the adult rat, with the right MHb containing more neurons than its left counterpart. Additionally, it shows that chronic stress induces a bilateral atrophy of both the MHb and the lateral habenula (LHb). This atrophy was accompanied by a reduction of the number of neurons in the right MHb and the number of glial cells in the bilateral LHb, but not by changes in the dendritic arbors of multipolar neurons. Importantly, these structural changes were correlated with elevated levels of serum corticosterone and increased anxious-like behavior in stressed animals. To further assess the role of the habenula in stress-related anxiety, bilateral lesions of the LHb were performed; interestingly, in lesioned animals the chronic stress protocol did not trigger increases in circulating corticosterone or anxious-like behavior. This study highlights the role of the habenula in the stress responses and how its sub-regions are structurally impacted by chronic stress with physiological and behavioral consequences."

Previous research suggests these symptoms are not specific to head injury and are often associated with psychiatric symptoms. The current study examines the relative contributions of posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and TBI on postconcussive symptoms, and explores whether the relationship remains after controlling for symptom overlap. Two hundred eighteen combat Veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and Operation New Dawn (OND) provided the data for this study as part of a baseline evaluation for inclusion into larger treatment study for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants completed the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen (BTBIS), Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), PTSD Checklist-Stressor Version (PCL-S), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Significant differences in NSI total score between individuals with and without history of TBI were not found. A series of regression analyses demonstrated that Depression and PTSD were significant predictors of NSI score even after removal of NSI symptoms that overlap with PTSD or depression. TBI status was also a significant predictor of PCS in most models, but its relative contribution was much smaller than that of depression and PTSD. Within PTSD symptoms, hyperarousal cluster was a significant predictor of NSI scores. Findings demonstrate that depression and PTSD are related to PCS beyond similarities in construct. Further, within a primarily PTSD treatment-seeking population, these psychiatric symptoms appear to be a stronger contributor than TBI."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in young adults in the United States, but there is still no effective agent for treatment. N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) is a major endocannabinoid in the brain. Its increase after brain injury is believed to be protective. However, the compensatory role of AEA is transient due to its rapid hydrolysis by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Thus, inhibition of FAAH can boost the endogenous levels of AEA and prolong its protective effect. Using a TBI mouse model, we found that post-injury chronic treatment with PF3845, a selective and potent FAAH inhibitor, reversed TBI-induced impairments in fine motor movement, hippocampus dependent working memory and anxiety-like behavior. Treatment with PF3845 inactivated FAAH activity and enhanced the AEA levels in the brain. It reduced neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus, and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Hsp70/72 in both cortex and hippocampus. PF3845 also suppressed the increased production of amyloid precursor protein, prevented dendritic loss and restored the levels of synaptophysin in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. Furthermore, PF3845 suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and enhanced the expression of arginase-1 post-TBI, suggesting a shift of microglia/macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. The effects of PF3845 on TBI-induced behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration were mediated by activation of cannabinoid type 1 and 2 receptors and might be attributable to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT. These results suggest that selective inhibition of FAAH is likely to be beneficial for TBI treatment."

Yet, the impact of chronic cognitive and physical fatigue and their associations with psychiatric, sleep, cognitive, and psychosocial sequelae in mild-moderate TBI remain poorly understood. Sixty Veterans with a history of mild-moderate TBI and 40 Veteran controls (VC) were administered the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, a validated measure of TBI-related cognitive and physical fatigue as well as measures of neuropsychiatric, psychosocial, sleep, and objective cognitive functioning. Compared to VC, TBI Veterans endorsed significantly greater levels of cognitive and physical fatigue. In TBI, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) were associated with both cognitive and physical fatigue, while loss of consciousness (LOC) and poor attention/processing speed were related to elevations in cognitive fatigue only. In regression analyses, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and LOC significantly predicted cognitive fatigue, while only post-traumatic stress symptoms and PTA contributed to physical fatigue. Cognitive and physical fatigue are problematic symptoms following mild-moderate TBI that are differentially associated with specific injury and psychiatric sequelae. Findings provide potential symptom targets for interventions aimed at ameliorating fatigue, and further underscore the importance of assessing and treating fatigue as a multi-dimensional symptom following TBI."

            "abstract": "Many individuals are affected on their higher brain functions, such as intelligence, memory, and attention, even after minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Although higher brain dysfunction is based on impairment of the cerbral circulation and metabolism, the precise relationship between them remains unknown. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between the cerebral circulation or cerebral metabolism and higher brain dysfunction. Twenty subjects with higher brain dysfunction caused by chronic MTBI were studied. They had no abnormal MRI findings. The full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) were quantitatively evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), and the subjects were classified into the normal group and the impaired group. Concurrent with the evaluation of FIQ, positron emission tomography (PET) was performed by the steady state method with 15O gases inhalation. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were calculated in the bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe. First, of all twenty subjects, we investigated rCBF, OEF and CMRO2 in all regions. Then we compared rCBF, OEF, and CMRO2 between the normal group and the impaired group based on FIQ score. We also studied the change of FIQ score of 13 subjects 9.3 months after the first evaluation. In addition, we investigated the change of rCBF, OEF and CMRO2 along with the improvement of FIQ score. Although rCBF and OEF of all subjects were within the normal range in all regions, CMRO2 of more than half of subjects was under the lower normal limit in all regions except in the right occipital lobe, showing the presence of \"relative luxury perfusion\". Comparison of rCBF, OEF and CMRO2 between normal group and impaired group revealed that CMRO2 of the impaired group was significantly lower than that of the normal group in the bilateral frontal, temporal, and occipital lobe. After 9.3 months, FIQ scores of 13 subjects were significantly increased. CMRO2 was significantly increased in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobe, as well as in the right occipital lobe, along with the improvement of FIQ score. It was concluded that higher brain dysfunction caused by chronic MTBI was related to malfunction of neuronal networks based on the generalized decrease of brain oxygen metabolism in all brain regions. Damage to neuronal networks in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobe appeared to play the most important role in higher brain dysfunction."

            "abstract": "Current guidelines for patients experiencing a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often focus on conservative care and observation. However, mTBI may increase the risk of severe novel psychiatric disorders (NPDs) within 180 days, and long-term management of mTBI should include psychiatric evaluation in patient populations. Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using 8 years of the Nationwide Readmission Database. All individuals who were admitted for concussion and were readmitted within 180 days were queried. This cohort was then subdivided based on age, sex, and whether they experienced loss of consciousness (LOC) to control for demographic-dependent confounding. A binary decision tree provided recommendations for patients who may be at risk of developing severe NPDs. Analysis included 12,080 patients who experienced concussion. Males and females with LOC had higher rates of depression in all age quartiles within 180 days (p < 0.05). Young females with LOC had increased rates of suicidal ideation (p < 0.01), and those >25 years of age had increased rates of anxiety (p < 0.005). Adult males with LOC had increased rates of suicidal ideation (p < 0.002) and males >75 years of age had increased rates of anxiety at readmission (p < 0.05). Males without LOC had increased rates of depression (p < 0.005), with men in the second quartile also at higher risk of developing anxiety (p < 0.05). Females without LOC showed the fewest number of NPDs at readmission. Concussion may be associated with increased rates of NPDs in the first 6 months following discharge. We use these data to develop recommendations for psychiatric screening of patients with mTBI."

There was a statistically significant interaction effect between depression groups and the combined coping strategy and personality trait variables (F(36,128)=2.959, p < .001; Wilks' Λ= .167). Individuals with mild (p = .045), moderate (p = .004) and severe (p < .001) depression symptoms had greater experiential avoidance (EA) than those without depression. Those with severe depression symptoms had significantly greater anxiety sensitivity than those with no (p < 0.001), mild, (p = .004) or moderate (p = .025) depression symptoms. Overall, individuals in the no, mild, and moderate depression groups used emotion-focused strategies primarily, followed by dysfunctional strategies for coping. Conversely, those with severe depression symptoms primarily used dysfunctional strategies, followed by emotion-focused strategies to cope. All depression groups applied problem-based coping strategies infrequently.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of passive coping strategies combined with increased EA behaviours among severely depressed individuals with ABI may lead to long-term negative outcomes.

Blast-exposed rats display PTSD-like behavior, suggesting relationships may exist between PTSD and blast exposure. Other studies demonstrate the roles of stathmin and corticosterone associated with fear- and anxiety-like behaviors in rodent models. Furthermore, studies have observed ranges of responses to both physical and psychological trauma in animal populations (Elder 2012, Ritov 2016). This study exposed rodents to repeated blast overpressure (BOP) and analyzed behavioral responses and molecular variables at 3 weeks and 6 months after exposure. We applied a modified version of a previously reported behavioral profiling approach that separates \"affected\" and \"unaffected\" rats based on the presence of anxiety-like behaviors (Ritov, 2016). We report that \"affected\" 3 week animals showed higher plasma corticosterone and amygdalar stathmin levels, while \"affected\" 6 month animals had lower prefrontal cortex stathmin. Higher corticosterone also paralleled anxiety behavior in \"affected\" 3 week animals, which was not observed in 6 month animals, indicating possible negative feedback loop mechanisms. Elevated levels of amygdalar stathmin correlated with anxiety behaviors in \"affected\" 3 week and 6 month animals, indicating sustained molecular changes. We conclude that this unique analysis may provide more information about response to blast. This type of analysis should also be considered when treating clinical populations, since individual differences may affect behavioral and long-term outcomes. Future studies should elucidate relationships of stress and fear responses in the context of BOP."

Furthermore, anxiety or fear often enhances the suffering of pain. Based on recent studies, I propose chronic anxiety triggered by injury or chronic pain is mediated through presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key cortical region for pain perception. Conversely, NMDA receptor-dependent postsynaptic LTP plays a more important role in behavioral sensitization in chronic pain. Thus, postsynaptic and presynaptic LTP in ACC neurons are likely the key cellular mechanisms for causing chronic pain and its associated anxiety, respectively. This suggests potential targets for treating chronic pain and related anxiety."

ImPACT's symptom inventory can be divided into four clusters: affective, cognitive, physical/somatic, and sleep. Most athletes (81.9%) did not endorse any items on the affective symptom cluster; however, 90 athletes (7.4%) fell above the cutoff of 5 for depression on the PHQ-9, and approximately half of all athletes endorsed one or more PHQ-9 items. Simple linear regressions revealed ImPACT's sleep symptom cluster as the best predictor of PHQ-9 total score; however, affective, cognitive, and physical symptom clusters significantly predicted PHQ-9 total score as well. Due to relative under-endorsement of items on ImPACT's affective symptom cluster compared to the PHQ-9, the clinical utility of incorporating a stand-alone measure of depression such as the PHQ-9 during baseline testing is supported."

Students in the high anxiety group had slightly lower scores on neurocognitive testing, but the differences were not practically meaningful; however, they endorsed dramatically more physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. Anxiety can mimic the ICD-10 postconcussional syndrome in adolescent student athletes at baseline, when they have not been injured."

            "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI; e.g., sports concussions) is common and results in significant cognitive impairment. Targeted therapies for rmTBI are lacking, though evidence from other injury models indicates that targeting N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-mediated glutamatergic toxicity might mitigate rmTBI-induced neurologic deficits. However, there is a paucity of preclinical or clinical data regarding NMDAR antagonist efficacy in the rmTBI setting. To test whether NMDAR antagonist therapy improves outcomes after rmTBI, mice were subjected to rmTBI injury (4 injuries in 4days) and randomized to treatment with the NMDA antagonist memantine or with vehicle. Functional outcomes were assessed by motor, anxiety/impulsivity and mnemonic behavioral tests. At the synaptic level, NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) was assessed in isolated neocortical slices. At the molecular level, the magnitude of gliosis and tau hyper-phosphorylation was tested by Western blot and immunostaining, and NMDAR subunit expression was evaluated by Western blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Compared to vehicle-treated mice, memantine-treated mice had reduced tau phosphorylation at acute time points after injury, and less glial activation and LTP deficit 1 month after injury. Treatment with memantine also corresponded to normal NMDAR expression after rmTBI. No corresponding protection in behavior outcomes was observed. Here we found NMDAR antagonist therapy may improve histopathological and functional outcomes after rmTBI, though without consistent corresponding improvement in behavioral outcomes. These data raise prospects for therapeutic post-concussive NMDAR antagonism, particularly in athletes and warriors, who suffer functional impairment and neurodegenerative sequelae after multiple concussions."

Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI."

Statistically significant increases in the frequency of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and a postconcussive symptom complex were seen comparing single to multiple TBIs. However, a predeployment TBI did not increase the likelihood of sustaining another TBI in a blast exposure. Associations between blast exposure and abdominal pain, pain on deep breathing, shortness of breath, hearing loss, and tinnitus suggested residual barotrauma. Combat exposures with and without physical injury were each associated not only with PTSD but also with numerous postconcussive and non-postconcussive symptoms. The experience of seeing others wounded or killed or experiencing the death of a buddy or leader was associated with indigestion and headaches but not with depression, anxiety, or PTSD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Complex relationships exist between multiple deployment-related factors and numerous overlapping and co-occurring current adverse physical and psychological health outcomes.

Individuals with a history of chronic (>1-year prior) mild TBI have an increased risk of mood disturbances (eg, depression, suicide). This population also has lingering sleep alterations, including poor sleep quality and changes in sleep stage proportions.

In addition to head trauma, however, many potentially modifiable risk factors are associated with cognitive impairment. We examined the association of self-reported risk factors for cognitive impairment (e.g., cardiovascular health, sleep, pain, depression, anxiety, smoking, physical impairment, and physical activity) with cognition-related quality of life, measured by the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders, Applied Cognition-General Concerns (Neuro-QOL) among 3803 former National Football League (NFL) players. We examined the prevalence of risk factors among men who had experienced a high number of concussion symptoms during playing years, comparing men with good current cognition-related QOL, the \"healthy concussed,\" to men with poor cognition-related QOL, the \"unhealthy concussed.\" Physical functioning, pain, depression, and anxiety were very strongly associated with poor cognitive-related QOL (risk ratio range, 2.21-2.70, p < 0.0001 for all). Short sleep duration and low physical activity were also strongly associated (RR = 1.69 and 1.57, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both). The largest differences between healthy and unhealthy concussed were in chronic pain (72.0% vs. 21.2%), depressive symptoms (50.3% vs. 6.3%), anxiety symptoms (53.4% vs. 11.6%), and physical impairment (52.4% vs. 12.5%). Substantial differences also existed in prevalence of sleep apnea, short sleep duration, high-intensity exercise, weight training, high blood pressure, and body mass index ≥35 kg/m2 (all differences >10 percentage points). We identified cognitive risk factors, including chronic pain, mood problems, sleep problems, obesity, and lack of exercise, that were commonly present in former football players with cognition-related impairment.

However, the impact of social isolation following stroke, which may be more clinically relevant as a target for therapeutic intervention, has yet to be examined. In this study, we investigated both the sub-acute (2 weeks) and chronic (7 weeks) effects of social isolation on post-stroke functional and histological outcome. Worsened histological damage from ischemic injury and an increase in depressive-like behavior was observed in isolated mice as compared to pair-housed mice. Mice isolated immediately after stroke showed a decrease in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These changes, both histological and behavioral, suggest an overall negative effect of social isolation on stroke outcome, potentially contributing to post-stroke depression and anxiety. Therefore, it is important to identify patients who have perceived isolation post-stroke to hopefully prevent this exacerbation of histological damage and subsequent depression."

The epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in the general population is described as a basis for understanding the disorders that occur before and after TBI. For each disorder category, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and adjustment disorders, the evidence from retrospective, cross-sectional and prospective studies is reviewed, showing the frequency, time course, and predictors of the disorders. Studies show elevated rates of depressive and anxiety disorders after TBI, most commonly major depressive disorder and PTSD, usually emerging in the first year postinjury but with delayed onset in severe injury cases. Although individuals with a preinjury history are more likely to develop these disorders, the nature of the disorders may change after injury, and novel psychiatric disorders are also common. Even though the frequency of anxiety disorders diminishes over the years postinjury, depressive disorders are more persistent during postinjury years.

To date, predisposing mechanisms for chronic pain in TBI patients are largely unknown. Psychological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety following TBI are commonly reported comorbidities to post-traumatic pain. Long term consequences can be debilitating and affect quality of life even when the injury is mild. In this review, we present the most commonly reported chronic pain conditions across the spectrum of severity of TBI, mainly focusing on mild TBI. We discuss chronic post- traumatic headaches, widespread pain as well as post-traumatic central pain. We discuss pain in the context of injury severity and military versus civilian populations. We are only starting to understand the biological mechanisms behind post-traumatic pain and associated psychological distress following TBI, with genetic, biochemical and imaging studies pointing to the dopaminergic, neurotrophic factors and the role of Apolipoprotein. Physiological and neurological mechanisms are proposed to partially explain this interaction between post-traumatic pain and psychological distress. Nevertheless, the evidence for the role of structural brain damage remains incomplete and to a large extent debatable, as it is still difficult to establish clear causality between brain trauma and chronic pain. Finally, general aspects of management of chronic pain post-TBI are addressed."

            "abstract": "High trait anxiety is a substantial risk factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression. While neuroinflammation has been identified to contribute to stress-induced anxiety, little is known about potential dysregulation in the neuroinflammatory system of genetically determined pathological anxiety or high trait anxiety individuals. We report microglial alterations in various brain regions in a mouse model of high trait anxiety (HAB). In particular, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of HABs exhibited enhanced density and average cell area of Iba1+, and density of phagocytic (CD68+/Iba1+) microglia compared to normal anxiety (NAB) controls. Minocycline was used to assess the capacity of a putative microglia 'inhibitor' in modulating hyperanxiety behavior of HABs. Chronic oral minocycline indeed reduced HAB hyperanxiety, which was associated with significant decreases in Iba1+ and CD68+Iba1+ cell densities in the DG. Addressing causality, it was demonstrated that longer (10 days), but not shorter (5 days), periods of minocycline microinfusions locally into the DG of HAB reduced Iba-1+ cell density and attenuated hyperanxiety-related behavior, indicating that neuroinflammation in the DG is at least partially involved in the maintenance of pathological anxiety. The present data reveal evidence of disturbances in the microglial system of individuals with high trait anxiety. Minocycline attenuated HAB hyperanxiety, likely by modulation of microglial activity within the DG. Thus, the present data suggest that drugs with microglia-targeted anti-inflammatory properties could be promising as novel alternative or complimentary anxiolytic therapeutic approaches in specific subgroups of individuals genetically predisposed to hyperanxiety."

            "abstract": "Clinical Scenario: Mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, has been associated with physical, cognitive, and emotional sequelae. Little is understood in regard to many characteristics, such as anxiety, and their effect on post-concussion symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical question:\n        \n      \n      Is state anxiety, trait anxiety, or anxiety sensitivity a clinical predictor of symptoms in those presenting with mild traumatic brain injury or concussion? Summary of Key Findings: A literature search returned 3 possible studies; 3 studies met inclusion criteria and included. One study reported in athletes that greater social support was associated with decreased state-anxiety, lower state anxiety post-concussion was associated with increased social support, and that those with greater social support may experience reduced anxiety, regardless of injury type sustained. One study reported baseline trait anxiety in athletes was not significantly associated with post-concussion state anxiety, but that symptoms of depression at baseline was the strongest predictor for post-concussion state anxiety. Three studies reported that state and trait anxiety are not related to increased post-concussion symptom scores. One study reported that greater anxiety sensitivity is related to higher reported post-concussion symptom scores, which may manifest as somatic symptoms following concussion, and revealed that anxiety sensitivity may be a risk factor symptom development. Clinical Bottom Line: There is low-level to moderate evidence to support that anxiety sensitivity is linked to post-concussion symptoms. State and trait anxiety do not appear to be related to post-concussion symptoms alone. Post-concussion state anxiety may occur if post-concussion symptoms of depression are present or if baseline symptoms of depression are present. Better social support may improve state anxiety post-concussion. Strength of Recommendation: There is grade B evidence to support that state and trait anxiety are not risk factors for post-concussion symptom development. There is grade C evidence to support anxiety sensitivity as a risk factor for developing post-concussion symptoms."

            "abstract": "Mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are often associated with functional limitations after traumatic brain injury (TBI), prompting researchers to explore which of these TBI-related sequelae tends to precede the other. Past studies among patients with injuries ranging in severity have predominantly reported that functional impairments predict subsequent psychological concerns, rather than the other way around; however, it remains unclear whether this directionality holds for individuals with mild TBI (mTBI). The present study utilized a cross-lagged panel design within a structural equation modeling analytical framework to explore the longitudinal relationships of symptoms of depression and anxiety to functional status among 717 adult mTBI patients, with assessments occurring at 2 weeks and 3 months post-injury. Symptoms of both depression and anxiety significantly predicted subsequent functional limitations (λs = -0.21 and -0.25), whereas the reverse effects were nonsignificant (λs = -0.05 and -0.03); thus, psychological concerns appeared to function as a precursor to functional impairment. This pattern was particularly pronounced among patients with normal head computed tomography (CT) results; however, results were less clear cut among those subjects whose injuries were accompanied by intracranial abnormalities detected on CT imaging, suggesting the possibility of a more reciprocal relationship in the case of CT-positive mTBI. These results may serve to partially explain the incidence of persistent functional limitations observed among subsets of mTBI patients in past studies. Findings likewise highlight the importance of assessment and treatment for mental health problems after mTBI as an important factor to promote psychological well-being and functional recovery."

            "abstract": "Purpose: To examine the nature of occupational gaps and desired re-engagement following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the relationship to mood, self-discrepancy, and psychosocial functioning.Materials and methods: Fifty-nine adults with severe TBI (73% male, M age = 36.50, SD = 12.54) were administered measures of past, current, and desired occupations (Occupational Gaps Questionnaire), mood (Depression Stress and Anxiety Scale - 21), and self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale - version 3). Psychosocial functioning was rated by relatives on the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Questionnaire.Results: Participants reported that they engaged in significantly fewer occupations than prior to their injury (p < 0.001). Further, they participated in fewer occupations than they desired (p < 0.001). Desired re-engagement was identified for 18 of the 30 occupations (e.g., working, sports, managing personal finances, and supporting others). A higher number of these re-engagement gaps was significantly related to greater anxiety (r = 0.30, p < 0.05) and lower psychosocial functioning (r = -0.29, p < 0.05). A mediation analysis revealed that re-engagement gaps were indirectly related to self-discrepancy through an association with anxiety.Conclusions: Occupational gaps are commonly experienced after severe traumatic brain injury. Lack of engagement in desired occupations is associated with greater anxiety and poorer psychosocial functioning. Anxiety regarding these gaps may contribute to negative comparisons between one's pre-injury and post-injury self. Identification of occupational gaps and their psychological impact may guide the focus of client-centred rehabilitation approaches.Implications for RehabilitationGaps between current activity engagement (i.e., post injury) and desired activity engagement are commonly experienced after severe traumatic brain injury.Greater desired re-engagement gaps (i.e., when individuals report they are not completing activities that they would like to do) are associated with greater anxiety and poorer psychosocial functioning.Individuals who are unable to re-engage in desired activities are more likely to experience anxiety, which in turn may contribute to negative self-discrepancy.It may be beneficial to explore the personal meaning of changes in occupation after traumatic brain injury."

            "abstract": "Postconcussion syndrome (PCS) is a heterogeneous condition comprised of a set of signs and symptoms in somatic, cognitive, and emotional domains. PCS is a controversial concept because of differing consensus criteria, variability in presentation, and lack of specificity to concussion. Whereas symptoms of concussion resolve in most individuals over days to weeks, a minority of individuals experience symptoms persisting months to years. The clinical consequences of concussion may be best conceptualized as two multidimensional disorders: (1) a constellation of acute symptoms termed early-phase posttraumatic disorder (commonly headache, dizziness, imbalance, fatigue, sleep disruption, impaired cognition, photo- and phonophobia); and (2) late-phase posttraumatic disorder, consisting of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms. This phase is highly influenced by various psychosocial factors and is much less specific to the brain injury itself. Risk factors for development of a late-phase disorder include a high early symptom burden (e.g., headache, fatigue), a history of multiple concussions, psychiatric conditions (anxiety, depression), longer duration of unconsciousness or amnesia, and younger age. Successful treatment requires thoughtful differential diagnosis, including consideration of comorbid and premorbid conditions and other possible contributing factors. Treatment should include a hierarchic, sequential approach to management of treatable symptoms that impact functioning, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, headache, musculoskeletal pain, and vertigo. A guided prescription of aerobic exercise is beneficial for early- and late-phase disorders after concussion."

The current study analyzed a large sample of children and adolescents from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (n = 2978) to examine trajectories of psychopathologies. Using data from the Achenbach Childhood Behavior Checklist, latent classes of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology were identified. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine if mTBI predicted class membership, while controlling for a number of variables associated with psychopathology.

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) arising from blast exposure during war is common, and frequently complicated by psychiatric morbidity. There is controversy as to whether mild TBI from blast is different from other causes of mild TBI. Anxiety and affective disorders such as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression are common accompaniments of blast injury with a significant overlap in the diagnostic features of PTSD with post-concussive syndrome (PCS). This review focuses on this overlap and the effects of mild TBI due to bomb blast. Mild TBI may have been over diagnosed by late retrospective review of returned servicemen and women using imprecise criteria. There is therefore a requirement for clear and careful documentation by health professionals of a TBI due to bomb blast shortly after the event so that the diagnosis of TBI can be made with confidence. There is a need for the early recognition of symptoms of PCS, PTSD and depression and early multi-disciplinary interventions focussed on expected return to duties. There also needs to be a continued emphasis on the de-stigmatization of psychological conditions in military personnel returning from deployment."

            "abstract": "Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is not only a signature injury to soldiers in combat field and training facilities but may also a growing concern in civilian population due to recent increases in the use of improvised explosives by insurgent groups. Unlike moderate or severe BINT, repeated low-level blast (rLLB) is different in its etiology as well as pathology. Due to the constant use of heavy weaponry as part of combat readiness, rLLB usually occurs in service members undergoing training as part of combat readiness. rLLB does not display overt pathological symptoms; however, earlier studies report chronic neurocognitive changes such as altered mood, irritability, and aggressive behavior, all of which may be caused by subtle neuropathological manifestations. Current animal models of rLLB for investigation of neurobehavioral and neuropathological alterations have not been adequate and do not sufficiently represent rLLB conditions. Here, we developed a rat model of rLLB by applying controlled low-level blast pressures (<10 psi) repeated successively five times to mimic the pressures experienced by service members. Using this model, we assessed anxiety-like symptoms, motor coordination, and short-term memory as a function of time. We also examined levels of superoxide-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase, microglial activation, and reactive astrocytosis as factors likely contributing to these neurobehavioral changes. Animals exposed to rLLB displayed acute and chronic anxiety-like symptoms, motor and short-term memory impairments. These changes were paralleled by increased microglial activation and reactive astrocytosis. Conversely, animals exposed to a single low-level blast did not display significant changes. Collectively, this study demonstrates that, unlike a single low-level blast, rLLB exerts a cumulative impact on different brain regions and produces chronic neuropathological changes in so doing, may be responsible for neurobehavioral alterations."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes substantial neurological disabilities and mental distress. Annual TBI incidence is in magnitude of millions, making it a global health challenge. Categorization of TBI into severe, moderate and mild by scores on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is based on clinical grounds and standard brain imaging (CT). Recent research focused on repeated mild TBI (sport and non-sport concussions) suggests that a considerable number of patients have long-term disabling neurocognitive and neurobehavioral sequelae. These relate to subtle neuronal injury (diffuse axonal injury) visible only by using advanced neuroimaging distinguishing microstructural tissue damage. With advanced MRI protocols better characterization of TBI is achievable. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) visualizes white matter pathology, susceptibility weight imaging (SWI) detects microscopic bleeding while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides closer understanding of cognitive disorders etc. However, advanced imaging is still not integrated in the clinical care of patients with TBI. Patients with chronic TBI may experience many somatic disorders, cognitive disturbances and mental complaints. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in TBI are complex, brain injuries are highly heterogeneous and include neuroendocrine dysfunctions. Post-traumatic neuroendocrine dysfunctions received attention since the year 2000. Occurrence of TBI-related hypopituitarism does not correlate to severity of the GCS scores. Complete or partial hypopituitarism (isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency as most frequent) may occur after mild TBI equally as after moderate-to-severe TBI. Many symptoms of hypopituitarism overlap with symptoms occurring in patients with chronic TBI, i.e. they have lower scores on neuropsychological examinations (cognitive disability) and have more symptoms of mental distress (depression and fatigue). The great challenges for the endocrinologist are: (1) detection of hypopituitarism in patients with TBI prospectively (in the acute phase and months to years after TBI), (2) assessment of the extent of cognitive impairment at baseline, and (3) monitoring of treatment effects (alteration of cognitive functioning and mental distress with hormone replacement therapy). Only few studies recently suggest that with growth hormone (rhGH) replacement in patients with chronic TBI and with abnormal GH secretion, cognitive performance may not change while symptoms related to depression and fatigue improve. Stagnation in post-TBI rehabilitation progress is recommended as a signal for clinical suspicion of neuroendocrine dysfunction. This remains a challenging area for more research."

Human anger likely follows similar principles. As an adaptive phenomenon, escalation may involve particular neural circuitry. To advance beyond a standard view that the frontal lobe tonically inhibits subcortical circuits of aggression, a model is proposed which starts with the general rostrally directed flow of information in the brain. Earlier stage processing of visual and auditory input is transmitted from posterior and middle temporal cortices to anterior temporal lobe where rudimentary appraisals of threat and provocation are developed. These directly but diffusely activate cortical/subcortical anger/aggression response systems. At the same time, the anterior temporal loci transmit the modality-specific perceptual information to orbito-frontal cortex where it is integrated with information about, e.g., the opponent's relative dominance/social status and evaluated for likelihood of potential rewards and punishments associated with different modes of responding and so forth. These frontal areas then impose an inhibitory gating or modulation and focusing of activity initiated by the anterior temporal loci through their projections to GABAergic interneurons in the same cortical/subcortical circuits. Escalation occurs as the inhibition imposed by the frontal areas is progressively lifted. Exploration of the implications, applications and hypotheses flowing from this model will improve our understanding of the biologically important and socially significant phenomena of escalation."

            "abstract": "Much concern exists over the role of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the chronic cognitive and mental health problems that develop in veterans and active duty military personnel. The brain vasculature is particularly sensitive to blast injury. The aim of this study was to characterize the evolving molecular and histologic alterations in the neurovascular unit induced by three repetitive low-energy blast exposures (3 × 74.5 kPa) in a rat model mimicking human mild TBI or subclinical blast exposure. High-resolution two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry of purified brain vascular fractions from blast-exposed animals 6 weeks post-exposure showed decreased levels of vascular-associated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and several neuronal intermediate filament proteins (α-internexin and the low, middle, and high molecular weight neurofilament subunits). Loss of these proteins suggested that blast exposure disrupts gliovascular and neurovascular interactions. Electron microscopy confirmed blast-induced effects on perivascular astrocytes including swelling and degeneration of astrocytic endfeet in the brain cortical vasculature. Because the astrocyte is a major sensor of neuronal activity and regulator of cerebral blood flow, structural disruption of gliovascular integrity within the neurovascular unit should impair cerebral autoregulation. Disrupted neurovascular connections to pial and parenchymal blood vessels might also affect brain circulation. Blast exposures also induced structural and functional alterations in the arterial smooth muscle layer. Interestingly, by 8 months after blast exposure, GFAP and neuronal intermediate filament expression had recovered to control levels in isolated brain vascular fractions. However, despite this recovery, a widespread vascular pathology was still apparent at 10 months after blast exposure histologically and on micro-computed tomography scanning. Thus, low-level blast exposure disrupts gliovascular and neurovascular connections while inducing a chronic vascular pathology."

Computerized cognitive training can help alleviate complaints and improve daily life functioning of TBI patients. However, the underlying biological mechanisms of cognitive training in TBI are not fully understood. In the present study, we utilised for the first time a touchscreen cognitive training system in a rat model of mild TBI. Moreover, we wanted to examine whether the beneficial effects of a cognitive training are task-dependent and selective in their target. Specifically, we examined the effect of two training tasks, i.e. the Paired Associate Learning (PAL) task targeting spatial memory functioning and 5-Choice Continuous Performance (5-CCP) task loading on attention and inhibition control, on the microstructural organization of the hippocampus and cingulum, respectively, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our findings revealed that the two training protocols induced similar effects on the diffusion MRI metrics. Further, in the TBI groups who received training microstructural organization in the hippocampus and cingulum improved (as denoted by increases in fractional anisotropy), while a worsening (i.e., increases in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity) was found in the TBI control group. In addition, these alterations in diffusion MRI metrics coincided with improved performance on the training tasks in the TBI groups who received training. Our findings show the potential of DTI metrics as reliable measure to evaluate cognitive training in TBI patients and to facilitate future research investigating further improvement of cognitive training targeting deficits in spatial memory and attention."

As part of a larger retrospective cohort study that aimed to assess the health-related outcomes of post 9/11 veterans with penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI), we examined the health impact of caregiving on caregivers. Caregivers (n = 66) of veterans with pTBI completed a survey that captured the veterans' and their own health-related outcomes. Surveys included veteran and caregiver sociodemographics, caregiver role, tasks, burden, and caregiver-reported measures of veterans' health and quality of life. The participants were spouses (58%) and parents (32%) providing full-time assistance for more than 5 yr (74%). In their caregiver role, they provided assistance with activities of daily living and emotional/social support. Forty-eight percent of these caregivers met the definition of experiencing clinically significant burden. Veterans with pTBI had other comorbidities (e.g., depression, cognitive dysfunction, and anger), which were associated with caregiver burden.

Therefore, we aimed to explore the perceptions of chronic post-stroke cognition and mood symptoms and goals among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of community-dwelling adults aging with stroke. Method: This qualitative study using mixed-methods analysis included semi-structured interviews regarding perceived post-stroke cognitive and mood symptoms among community-dwelling stroke survivors at least one-year post stroke. Transcripts were subjected to thematic content analysis, and differences in theme usage patterns by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and post-acute rehabilitation setting were assessed using an inferential clustering technique. Results: The majority of participants (93%) reported cognition-related themes, including language and communication, memory, thinking abilities, comprehension, visual-spatial processing, and cognitive assessments and training. Nearly half of participants mentioned mood-related themes, including depression, aggression and anger, mood fluctuations, anxiety, and psychological services and medication. Nearly half reported an unmet need for cognition or mood-related treatment. Inferential clustering analysis revealed that older participants reported a different pattern of cognitive and mood symptoms than those aged younger than 65 (p = 0.02). Older adults were more likely to describe post-stroke language/communication changes, while younger adults described post-stroke mood changes. Conclusion: Stroke survivors experienced cognitive and mood-related symptoms beyond one-year post stroke, which has implications for long-term assessment and management. Incorporation of continued symptom monitoring into existing community-based services is needed to address chronic cognitive and mood symptoms affecting the quality of life of persons with stroke."

These psychiatric conditions have generally been considered psychosocial consequences of the trauma, but neurobiological alterations and causes have also been implicated. Using a rat model of TBI (lateral fluid-percussion injury), this longitudinal study seeks to assess anxiety and depression-like behaviors following experimental TBI. Male Wistar rats (n = 20) received a severe (approximately 3.5 atmosphere) pressure pulse directed to the right sensorimotor cortex, or sham surgery (n = 15). At 1, 3, and 6 months following injury, all rats underwent four assessments of anxiety and depression-like behaviors: exposure to an open field, elevated plus maze test, the forced swim test, and the sucrose preference test. Injured animals displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors throughout the study, as evidenced by reduced time spent (p = 0.014) and reduced entries (p < 0.001) into the center area of the open field, and reduced proportion of time in the open arms of the plus maze (p = 0.015), compared to sham-injured controls. These striking changes were particularly evident 1 and 3 months after injury. No differences were observed in depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test (a measure of behavioral despair) and the sucrose preference test (a measure of anhedonia). This report provides the first evidence of persistent anxiety-like disturbances in an experimental model of TBI. This finding indicates that the common occurrence of these symptoms in human sufferers is likely to have, at least in part, a neurobiological basis. Studies in this model could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying affective disturbance in brain-injured patients."

Consequently, participants anxiously strove to prevent further harm to their spouse's health due to what they perceived as the continued \"hidden\" threat of brain injury.

Our research reports on carers' experiences of anxiety which they managed through hypervigilant and overprotective practices which put them at risk of burnout.

            "abstract": "A substantial minority of children experience post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following injury. Research indicates variation in the trajectory of PTSS following pediatric injury, but investigation of PTSS following concussion has assumed homogeneity. This study aimed to identify differential trajectories of PTSS following pediatric concussion and to investigate risk factors, including acute post-concussive symptoms (PCS), associated with these trajectories. A total of 120 children ages 8-18 years reported PTSS for 3 months following concussion diagnosis using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, with a score of 16 or above indicating probable post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Age, gender, injury mechanism, loss of consciousness, previous concussions, prior hospitalization, prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and acute PCS were assessed as risk factors. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling. Results revealed 16% of children had clinically significant PTSS 2 weeks post-concussion, declining to 10% at 1 month and 6% at 3 months post-injury. Group-based trajectory modeling identified three trajectories of PTSS post-concussion: \"resilient\" (70%); \"recovering\" (25%), in which children experienced elevated acute symptoms that declined over time; and \"chronic symptomatology\" (5%). Due to small size, the chronic group should be interpreted with caution. Higher acute PCS and prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety both significantly increased predicted probability of recovering trajectory group membership. These findings establish that most children are resilient to PTSS following concussion, but that PTSS do occur acutely in a substantial minority of children. The study indicates mental health factors, particularly PTSS, depression, and anxiety, should be considered integral to models of concussion management and treatment."

            "abstract": "There is growing evidence that repeated brain concussion can result in cumulative and long-term behavioral symptoms, neuropathological changes, and neurodegeneration. Little is known about the factors and mechanisms that contribute to these effects. The current study addresses the need to investigate and better understand the effects of repeated concussion through the development of an animal model. Male Long-Evans rats received 1, 3, or 5 mild lateral fluid percussion injuries or sham injuries spaced 5 days apart. After the final injury, rats received either a short (24 h) or long (8 weeks) post-injury recovery period, followed by a detailed behavioral analysis consisting of tests for rodent anxiety-like behavior, cognition, social behavior, sensorimotor function, and depression-like behavior. Brains were examined immunohistochemically to assess neuroinflammation and cortical damage. Rats given 1, 3, or 5 mild percussion injuries displayed significant short-term cognitive impairments. Rats given repeated mild percussion injuries displayed significantly worse short- and long-term cognitive impairments. Rats given 5 mild percussion injuries also displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Neuropathological analysis revealed short-term neuroinflammation in 3-injury rats, and both short- and long-term neuroinflammation in 5-injury rats. There was also evidence that repeated injuries induced short- and long-term cortical damage. These cumulative and long-term changes are consistent with findings in human patients suffering repeated brain concussion, provide support for the use of repeated mild lateral fluid percussion injuries to study repeated concussion in the rat, and suggest that neuroinflammation may be important for understanding the cumulative and chronic effects of repeated concussion."

            "abstract": "We have previously reported long-term changes in the brains of non-concussed varsity rugby players using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI). Others have reported cognitive deficits in contact sport athletes that have not met the diagnostic criteria for concussion. These results suggest that repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (rmTBIs) that are not severe enough to meet the diagnostic threshold for concussion, produce long-term consequences. We sought to characterize the neuroimaging, cognitive, pathological and metabolomic changes in a mouse model of rmTBI. Using a closed-skull model of mTBI that when scaled to human leads to rotational and linear accelerations far below what has been reported for sports concussion athletes, we found that 5 daily mTBIs triggered two temporally distinct types of pathological changes. First, during the first days and weeks after injury, the rmTBI produced diffuse axonal injury, a transient inflammatory response and changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that resolved with time. Second, the rmTBI led to pathological changes that were evident months after the injury including: changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), altered levels of synaptic proteins, behavioural deficits in attention and spatial memory, accumulations of pathologically phosphorylated tau, altered blood metabolomic profiles and white matter ultrastructural abnormalities. These results indicate that exceedingly mild rmTBI, in mice, triggers processes with pathological consequences observable months after the initial injury."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy are both major health problems, well-publicized for the severe delayed effects attributed to them, including cognitive decline, psychiatric disorders, seizures, impaired motor function, and personality changes. For convenience, the two afflictions are considered together under the rubric traumatic brain injury. Despite the need for neuroprotective agents, no substances have shown efficacy in clinical studies. Thus, a deeper understanding of the neuropathological mechanism of such injury is still needed. Proposed here is a theory that microorganisms from within the brain and elsewhere in the body contribute to the long-term neurological deterioration characteristic of traumatic brain injury. The label, \"The Beehive Theory\", is drawn from the well-known fact that disturbing a tranquil beehive with a blow can cause a swarm of angry bees to exit their dwelling place and attack nearby humans. Similarly, an impact to the head can initiate dislocations and disruptions in the microbiota present in the brain and body. First, since the normal human brain is not sterile, but is host to a variety of microorganisms, blows to the skull may dislodge them from their accustomed local environments, in which they have been living in quiet equilibrium with neighboring brain cells. Deleterious substances may be released by the displaced microbes, including metabolic products and antigens. Second, upon impact commensal microbes already resident on surfaces of the nose, mouth, and eyes, and potentially harmful organisms from the environment, may gain access to the brain through the distal ends of the olfactory and optic nerves or even a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Third, microbes dwelling in more distant parts of the body may be propelled through the walls of local blood vessels into the bloodstream, and then leak out into damaged areas of the brain that have increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Fourth, the impact may cause dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal microbiome, thereby disrupting signaling via the gut-brain axis. Possible preventatives or therapeutics that would address the adverse contributions of microbes to the late sequelae of traumatic brain injury include anti-inflammatories, antibacterials, antivirals, and probiotics."

Here, we characterized, in a mouse model, the long-term development of these sensory and aversive components as well as anxiodepressive-like consequences of neuropathic pain and determined their electrophysiological impact on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, cortical areas 24a/24b). We show that these symptoms of neuropathic pain evolve and recover in different time courses following nerve injury in male mice. In vivo electrophysiological recordings evidence an increased firing rate and bursting activity within the ACC when anxiodepressive-like consequences developed, and this hyperactivity persists beyond the period of mechanical hypersensitivity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings also support ACC hyperactivity, as shown by increased excitatory postsynaptic transmission and contribution of NMDA receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC hyperactivity was sufficient to alleviate the aversive and anxiodepressive-like consequences of neuropathic pain, indicating that these consequences are underpinned by ACC hyperactivity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression. It has been shown that it is possible to model this comorbidity in animal models by taking into consideration the time factor. In this study, we aimed at determining the dynamic of different components and consequences of chronic pain, and correlated them with electrophysiological alterations. By combining electrophysiological, optogenetic, and behavioral analyses in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, we show that the mechanical hypersensitivity, ongoing pain, anxiodepressive consequences, and their recoveries do not necessarily exhibit temporal synchrony during chronic pain processing, and that the hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex is essential for driving the emotional impact of neuropathic pain."

Patients with mTBIs completed several questionnaires and cognitive testing at approximately one month (n=126) and one year (n=103) post-injury. At approximately three weeks post-injury, DTI was undertaken using a Siemens 3T scanner in a subgroup (n=71). Measures of fractional anisotropy were calculated for 16 regions of interest (ROIs) and measures of apparent diffusion coefficient were calculated for 10 ROIs. Patients were compared with healthy control subjects. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) PCS criteria and mild or greater symptom reporting, 59% of the mTBI sample met criteria at one month and 38% met criteria at one year. However, 31% of the healthy control sample also met criteria for the syndrome-illustrating a high false-positive rate. Significant predictors of ICD-10 PCS at one month were pre-injury mental health problems and the presence of extra-cranial bodily injuries. Being symptomatic at one month was a significant predictor of being symptomatic at one year, and depression was significantly related to PCS at both one month and one year. Intracranial abnormalities visible on MRI were present in 12.1% of this sample, and multifocal areas of unusual white matter as measured by DTI were present in 50.7% (compared with 12.4% of controls). Structural MRI abnormalities and microstructural white matter findings were not significantly associated with greater post-concussion symptom reporting. The personal experience and reporting of post-concussion symptoms is likely individualized, representing the cumulative effect of multiple variables, such as genetics, mental health history, current life stress, medical problems, chronic pain, depression, personality factors, and other psychosocial and environmental factors. The extent to which damage to the structure of the brain contributes to the persistence of post-concussion symptoms remains unclear.\n"

However, its neurotoxicity remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of chronic pregabalin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons of the frontal lobe. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats which received PGB starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day), then the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. Group III (PGB withdrawal) included 20 rats which received PGB as described in group II. After that, administration of PGB was stopped and the rats were kept for another one month. By the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. The specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining as well as morphometric analysis. Sections of the frontal cortex of group II showed changes in the form of disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF as well as moderate-strong immunoexpression of iNOS and nestin. These expressions were significantly different from the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with group III. These findings indicate that chronic PGB dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress injury of the frontal cortex. The PGB- induced neurotoxic effects persisted after withdrawal. The influence of these neurotoxic effects and their relevance to the cognitive or neurologic disorders in PGB-dependent individuals warrants further research. Furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to PGB dependence as well as withdrawal in future studies."

In addition, prepulse inhibition was studied in these models. Light-enhanced startle was blunted following IFS and OBX and RRS decreased overall startle responding. Prepulse inhibition, however, was unaffected. These findings indicate that induction models for affective disorders may be associated with long term effects on affective startle modulation. The lack of changes in sensory motor gating suggests that these changes can be ascribed to alterations in emotional reactivity.

Although the BAI, BDI and PSQI scores of the mTBI group were significantly different than those of the control group at baseline, all had improved significantly 6 weeks later. However, only the PSQI score improved to a level that was not significantly different from that of the control group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Daytime sleepiness is not affected by mTBI. However, mTBI causes depression and anxiety and diminished sleep quality. Although all these conditions improve significantly within 6 weeks post-mTBI, only sleep quality improves to a pre-mTBI level. Thus, recovery from mTBI-induced sleep disturbance occurs more rapidly than that of mTBI-induced depression and anxiety."

            "abstract": "Evaluation of the chronic effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) has long focused on sensorimotor deficits, neuropathic pain, bladder/bowel dysfunction, loss of sexual function, and emotional distress. Although not well appreciated clinically, SCI can cause cognitive impairment including deficits in learning and memory, executive function, attention, and processing speed; it also commonly leads to depression. Recent large-scale longitudinal population-based studies indicate that patients with isolated SCI (without concurrent brain injury) are at a high risk of dementia associated with substantial cognitive impairments. Yet, little basic research has addressed potential mechanisms for cognitive impairment and depression after injury. In addition to contributing to disability in their own right, these changes can adversely affect rehabilitation and recovery and reduce quality of life. Here, we review clinical and experimental work on the complex and varied responses in the brain following SCI. We also discuss potential mechanisms responsible for these less well-examined, important SCI consequences. In addition, we outline the existing and developing therapeutic options aimed at reducing SCI-induced brain neuroinflammation and post-injury cognitive and emotional impairments."

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), four other databases and clinical trials registers. In addition, we manually searched the proceedings of three major scientific conferences on SCI. We updated this search in November 2014 but these results have not yet been incorporated.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials of any intervention not involving intake of medication or other active substances to treat chronic pain in people with SCI.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. The primary outcome was any measure of pain intensity or pain relief. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, anxiety, depression and quality of life. When possible, meta-analyses were performed to calculate standardised mean differences for each type of intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 16 trials involving a total of 616 participants. Eight different types of interventions were studied. Eight trials investigated the effects of electrical brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES); five trials) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; three trials). Interventions in the remaining studies included exercise programmes (three trials); acupuncture (two trials); self-hypnosis (one trial); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (one trial); and a cognitive behavioural programme (one trial). None of the included trials were considered to have low overall risk of bias. Twelve studies had high overall risk of bias, and in four studies risk of bias was unclear. The overall quality of the included studies was weak. Their validity was impaired by methodological weaknesses such as inappropriate choice of control groups. An additional search in November 2014 identified more recent studies that will be included in an update of this review.For tDCS the pooled mean difference between intervention and control groups in pain scores on an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS) (0-10) was a reduction of -1.90 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to -0.33; P value 0.02) in the short term and of -1.87 (95% CI -3.30 to -0.45; P value 0.01) in the mid term. Exercise programmes led to mean reductions in chronic shoulder pain of -1.9 score points for the Short Form (SF)-36 item for pain experience (95% CI -3.4 to -0.4; P value 0.01) and -2.8 pain VAS units (95% CI -3.77 to -1.83; P value < 0.00001); this represented the largest observed treatment effects in the included studies. Trials using rTMS, CES, acupuncture, self-hypnosis, TENS or a cognitive behavioural programme provided no evidence that these interventions reduce chronic pain. Ten trials examined study endpoints other than pain, including anxiety, depression and quality of life, but available data were too scarce for firm conclusions to be drawn. In four trials no side effects were reported with study interventions. Five trials reported transient mild side effects. Overall, a paucity of evidence was found on any serious or long-lasting side effects of the interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence is insufficient to suggest that non-pharmacological treatments are effective in reducing chronic pain in people living with SCI. The benefits and harms of commonly used non-pharmacological pain treatments should be investigated in randomised controlled trials with adequate sample size and study methodology."

Animal models of brain injury afford the opportunity for controlled study of the effects of injury on functional outcomes. In this study, male and cycling female C57BL/6J mice sustained rCBI (3x) at 24-hr intervals and were tested in a context and cued fear conditioning paradigm, open field (OF), elevated zero maze and tail suspension test. All mice with rCBI showed less freezing behavior than sham control mice during the fear conditioning context test. Injured male, but not female mice also froze less in response to the auditory cue (tone). Injured mice were hyperactive in an OF environment and spent more time in the open quadrants of the elevated zero maze, suggesting decreased anxiety, but there were no differences between injured mice and sham-controls in depressive-like activity on the tail suspension test. Pathologically, injured mice showed increased astrogliosis in the injured cortex and white matter tracts (optic tracts and corpus callosum). There were no changes in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cortex or amygdala, but injured male mice had fewer parvalbumin-positive neurons in the hippocampus. Parvalbumin-reactive interneurons of the hippocampus have been previously demonstrated to be involved in hippocampal-cortical interactions required for memory consolidation, and it is possible memory changes in the fear-conditioning paradigm following rCBI are the result of more subtle imbalances in excitation and inhibition both within the amygdala and hippocampus, and between more widespread brain regions that are injured following a diffuse brain injury."

It was generally assumed, that such lesions were to heal without any residues. This notion can not be upheld completely any longer, since according to today's state of knowledge on the pathogenesis of brain trauma, chronic troubles and impairments may occur even after mild traumatic brain injuries. Besides, a number of psychosocial stress factors making it more difficult to cope with the posttraumatic disturbances and the new challenging life situation, play a marked role as to the outcome.

However, most mindfulness-based interventions are resource-intensive, lengthy, and not feasible for busy orthopaedic surgical practices.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to determine if a 60-second personalized mindfulness-based video exercise is (1) associated with improved pain intensity, emotional distress, and state anxiety compared with an attention placebo control (a time-matched educational pamphlet about pain and stress); and (2) feasible and acceptable for patients with upper extremity injury in an orthopaedic practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial of the mindfulness-based video exercise (60 seconds duration, free online) versus an attention placebo control (an educational pamphlet about pain and stress presented to patients to read over 60 seconds). One hundred forty-nine patients presenting for a new or followup appointment at the office of one of two orthopaedic hand and upper extremity outpatient surgical practices at an urban academic hospital were invited to participate between September 2016 and December 2016. Of 149 patients screened, 125 patients were randomized and completed a demographic questionnaire, the Numeric Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, the State Anxiety subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess state anxiety, and Emotion Thermometers to assess anxiety, anger, and depression before and after the interventions. Postintervention, patients also completed the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire Scale-3 to assess the acceptability. A mean score of 21 or higher is considered acceptable. Feasibility was determined based on number of patients approached who refused participation. The intervention was defined as feasible if refusal rate was lower than 25%. Analysis of covariance was used to test comparative improved pain intensity on the NRS, psychologic distress on the Emotion Thermometers, and state anxiety on the State Anxiety Subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Index after controlling for respective baseline scores. A 1-point minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was used on the NRS for pain intensity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Adjusted for the baseline means, compared with patients who received the attention placebo control, patients who participated in the mindfulness-based video exercise demonstrated improved pain intensity (mindfulness-based video exercise: 3.03 ± 0.12; control: 3.49 ± 0.12; mean difference: 0.46 [0.12-0.80]; p = 0.008); state anxiety (mindfulness-based video exercise: 32.35 ± 0.59; control: 35.29 ± 0.59; mean difference: 2.94 [1.29-4.59]; p = 0.001); anxiety symptoms (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.49 ± 0.19; control: 2.10 ± 0.19; mean difference: 0.61 [0.08-1.14]; p = 0.024); depression (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.03 ± 0.10; control: 1.47 ± 0.11; mean difference: 0.44 [0.15-0.73]; p = 0.004); and anger (mindfulness-based video exercise: 0.76 ± 0.12; control: 1.36 ± 0.12; mean difference: 0.60 [0.26-0.94]; p = 0.001). However, the observed differences in pain intensity were below 1 point on the NRS, which is the MCID established in patients with chronic pain. No MCID is available for the other measures. The mindfulness-based video exercise was feasible based on a dropout rate of 0%, and acceptability reached the medium range with similar scores in both groups (mindfulness-based video exercise: 20.70 ± 5.48; control: 20.52 ± 6.42).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A 60-second mindfulness-based video exercise is feasible to implement and acceptable to patients in busy orthopaedic practices. This video exercise is also effective in improving momentary pain, anxiety, depression, and anger in this population, but it is unclear whether these improved pain and distress levels are meaningful to patients who present with low levels of pain and psychologic distress. Future studies should seek to discern whether the improved pain and distress levels we observed are clinically important or whether the intervention delivers larger effects in subgroups of patients experiencing greater pain intensity and if the improved pain and distress levels are durable. Such studies might also assess cost-effectiveness, because this mindfulness-based tool takes little time and few resources to use, and the effects and durability of multiple sessions of a mindfulness-based video exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level II, therapeutic study."

Eight TBI subjects showed severe learning deficits (TBI-NOT MET) because they never learned the task, and showed significantly impaired recall and recognition performance.

Predictors included: age, sex, socioeconomic status, mental health history, duration of concussion symptoms, history of prior concussion, trauma history and sleep quality.Results: The sample included 200 youth with PPCS, (mean 14.7 SD 1.7 years, 82% white, 62% female). Forty percent reported clinically significant depressive symptoms, 25% anxiety, 14% thoughts of self-harm and 8% thoughts of suicide. History of depression was associated with 3-fold higher risk for thoughts of self-harm (95% CI:1.82-6.99) and 6-fold higher risk for suicidal ideation (95% CI:1.74-24.46). Better sleep quality was associated with lower risk for all outcomes. History of prior concussion and duration of PPCS were not significantly associated with any outcomes.Conclusions: Suicidal thoughts are common post-concussion, and history of depression is a strong risk factor. Tailored interventions may be needed to address mental health in this population."

            "abstract": "Historically, the insula was considered primary gustatory cortex. Now it is known to play a more comprehensive role in the processing of sensory information, including acting as primary cortex for interoceptive information, including autonomic nervous system mediated changes. As such, it is critical for emotional feeling in accord with the James-Lange theory, a role previously ascribed to the limbic system. Neuroimaged abnormal grey matter volumes or activity levels in the insula have been associated with schizophrenia, eating disorders, anxiety and mood disorders, conduct disorder, autism, addiction, and chronic pain. The significance of these abnormal activity patterns remains theoretical. Neuropsychological studies have linked dominant insula injury with various symptoms of aphasia, but its exact role in language processing remains uncertain as most cases involve lesions that extend into perisylvian language zones. Functional neuroimaging studies have found insula hyper-activations, typically in conjunction with anterior cingulate cortex, for all manner of experimental tasks including those involving perception, intentional action, and consciousness. Such neuroimaged activity is unlikely to be task-specific, but rather reflective of generic changes in autonomic activity in response to salience, homeostatic incongruence, or cognitive challenge."

Here, in a sample of 26 participants with TBI and 20 healthy comparison participants (HC) we measured facial-affect recognition abilities and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) using fMRI. We then used network-based statistics to examine (A) the presence of rs-FC differences between individuals with TBI and HC within the facial-affect processing network, and (B) the association between inter-individual differences in emotion recognition skills and rs-FC within the facial-affect processing network. We found that participants with TBI showed significantly lower rs-FC in a component comprising homotopic and within-hemisphere, anterior-posterior connections within the facial-affect processing network. In addition, within the TBI group, participants with higher emotion-labeling skills showed stronger rs-FC within a network comprised of intra- and inter-hemispheric bilateral connections. Findings indicate that the ability to successfully recognize facial-affect after TBI is related to rs-FC within components of facial-affective networks, and provide new evidence that further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying emotion recognition impairment in TBI."

To identify those problems most likely to resolve over time, and to examine information and follow-up requirements. DESIGN, METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The families of 97 children with mild (49), moderate (19) and severe (29) TBI, aged 5-15 at injury, were interviewed and assessed at a mean of 2.29 years post-injury and compared with 31 healthy controls. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on problems pre- and post-TBI. Initially, respondents reported problems spontaneously, and were subsequently prompted using a checklist of problem categories. Problems of behaviour and emotion were measured using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and results:\n        \n      \n      Following the TBI, 83 children (85.6%) received no therapeutic input, 74 families (76.3%) had unmet information needs, particularly regarding long-term consequences. At first interview, 1097 problems were reported by the TBI group. Behavioural and school problems were frequently reported by all TBI groups, significantly more than controls (p < or = 0.001). On the VABS, approximately two thirds of children with TBI exhibited 'significant' maladaptive behaviours, significantly more than controls (p = 0.002). Children in the mild and moderate/severe groups were significantly more anxious than controls on the HADS (p = 0.04). At 12 month follow-up, there were no significant differences in problem resolution between the TBI groups: 498 (53.9%) problems remained unchanged and 75 (8.1%) had worsened. Physical problems were most likely to resolve.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Parents should be given information and support following their child's TBI, children should be routinely followed-up by health professionals and their needs assessed.

In the present study, we utilized an omega-3 diet during early life as a metabolic preconditioning to alter the course of TBI during adulthood. TBI animals under omega-3 deficiency were more prone to alterations in energy homeostasis (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; AMPK phosphorylation and cytochrome C oxidase II; COII levels) and mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; PGC-1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A; TFAM). A similar response was found for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signaling through tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). The results from in vitro studies showed that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a TrkB receptor agonist, upregulates the levels of biogenesis activator PGC-1α, and CREB phosphorylation in neuroblastoma cells suggesting that BDNF-TrkB signaling is pivotal for engaging signals related to synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism. The treatment with 7,8-DHF elevated the mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which emphasizes the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling as mitochondrial bioenergetics stimulator. Omega-3 deficiency worsened the effects of TBI on anxiety-like behavior and potentiated a reduction of anxiolytic neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPY1R). These results highlight the action of metabolic preconditioning for building long-term neuronal resilience against TBI incurred during adulthood. Overall, the results emphasize the interactive action of metabolic and plasticity signals for supporting neurological health."

Amygdaloid mechanisms underlying pain processing and control are poorly known. Here we tested the hypothesis that perioperative CeA administration of tetrapentylammonium (TPA), a non-selective THIK-1 channel blocker and thereby inhibitor of microglia, attenuates development of chronic neuropathic pain and comorbid anxiety-like behavior.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Rats with a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathy or sham operation had a chronic cannula for drug microinjections into the CeA or a control injection site.

In the late phase (> D14), CeA administration of TPA (3-30 μg) failed to influence pain. Perioperative minocycline (microglia inhibitor; 25 μg), MK-801 (an N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist; 0.1 μg), vehicle or TPA in a control injection site failed to attenuate pain development.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Perioperative treatment of the CeA with TPA delayed development of neuropathic pain and comorbid anxiety-like behavior, while TPA treatment failed to influence maintenance of established neuropathic pain. The failures to attenuate pain development with CeA administrations of minocycline or MK-801 do not support the hypothesis that the TPA-induced prophylactic effect was due to inhibition of amygdaloid microglia or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. While TPA in the CeA proved to have a prophylactic effect on SNI-induced pain behavior, the underlying mechanism still remains to be studied."

CFE occurs following orthopaedic procedures including, intra-medullary (IM) nailing and total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The incidence of CFE is high (59-100% TJA) and the resulting POC is associated with higher overall complication rates. Cognitive dysfunction improves in many patients but can persist - with potentially disastrous outcomes. The pathomechanics of CFE implicate circulating lipid micro-emboli (LME) that are forced from IM depots by instrumentation/nailing. Passage to the left side of the heart is possible through intra-cardiac or arteriovenous shunts in the lung. LME are propelled to the brain where they cause disruption via ischemia or by alterations in the blood-brain-barrier - causing cerebral oedema. Prevention of CFE follows established practices for preventing FES and consideration of additional techniques to remove resident fat and reduce IM pressures.

Indeed, the acute mechanical injury often evolves to a chronic brain disorder with long-term cognitive, emotional and social dysfunction even in the case of mild TBI. Contrary to the commonly held idea that children show better recovery from injuries than adults, pediatric TBI patients actually have worse outcome than adults for the same injury severity. Acute trauma to the young brain likely interferes with the fine-tuned developmental processes and may give rise to long-lasting consequences on brain's function. This review will focus on cerebrovascular dysfunction as an important early event that may lead to long-term phenotypic changes in the brain after pediatric TBI. These, in turn may be associated with accelerated brain aging and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, since no effective treatments are currently available, understanding the unique pathophysiological mechanisms of pediatric TBI is crucial for the development of new therapeutic options."

            "abstract": "Clinical studies show that anxiety and chronic pain are concomitant. The neural basis for the comorbidity is unclear. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been recognized as a critical area for affective disorders and chronic pain modulation. In this study, we examined the role of the PFC in the pathogenesis of anxiety associated with chronic pain in a rat model of neuropathic pain with spare nerve injury (SNI). The SNI rats showed apparent anxiety-like behaviors in both open field (OF) test and elevated-plus maze (EPM) test eight weeks after surgery. Thus, the number of entries to the central area in the OF decreased to 45% (±5%, n = 15) of sham control (n = 17), while the overall motor activity (i.e., total distance) was unaffected. In the EPM, the percentage of entries into the open arms significantly (p < 0.001) decreased in SNI rats (SNI: 12.58 ± 2.7%, n = 15; sham: 30.75 ± 2.82%, n = 17), so did the time spent in the open arms (SNI: 4.35 ± 1.45%, n = 15; Sham: 11.65 ± 2.18%, n = 17). To explore the neural basis for the association between anxiety and chronic pain, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the medial PFC (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus. In SNI rats, there were significantly greater increases in both theta-frequency power in the mPFC and theta-frequency synchronization between the mPFC and ventral hippocampus, when animals were displaying elevated anxiety-like behaviors in avoiding anxiogenic regions in EPM and OF chamber. Western blot analyses showed a significant elevation of serotonin transporter expression in the anxious SNI rats. Inhibition of serotonin transporter effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors following sub-chronic (15 days) treatment with systemic citalopram (10 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally). Moreover, the anxiety-like behaviors in the SNI rats were also suppressed by direct mPFC application of serotonin. Taken together, we conclude that the plasticity of serotonin transmission in the mPFC likely contribute to the promotion of anxiety state associated with neuropathic pain."

This confusion is increasingly problematic as the management of 'concussed' individuals is a pressing concern. Historically, it has been used to describe patients briefly disabled following a head injury, with the assumption that this was due to a transient disorder of brain function without long-term sequelae. However, the symptoms of concussion are highly variable in duration, and can persist for many years with no reliable early predictors of outcome. Using vague terminology for post-traumatic problems leads to misconceptions and biases in the diagnostic process, producing uninterpretable science, poor clinical guidelines and confused policy. We propose that the term concussion should be avoided. Instead neurologists and other healthcare professionals should classify the severity of traumatic brain injury and then attempt to precisely diagnose the underlying cause of post-traumatic symptoms."

The best approach is to assess the presence of depressive symptoms using semi-structured or structured psychiatric interviews such as the Present State Exam, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. The diagnosis of a depressive syndrome should be made using standardized diagnostic criteria for mood disorders due to neurological disease such as in the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. Depression rating scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Scales for Depression may be used to rate the severity of depression and monitor the progression of antidepressant treatment. Most studies in acute and chronic neurologic disorders demonstrated the specificity of both autonomic and psychological symptoms for the syndrome of depression.

At two sites, chronic mTBI human subjects with persistent post-concussive symptoms (three months to five years after injury) and age- and education-matched healthy human control subjects underwent extensive neuropsychological and visual tracking eye movement tests. At one site, patients and controls also performed the visual tracking tasks while blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although neither neuropsychological nor visual tracking measures distinguished patients from controls at the level of individual subjects, abnormal BOLD signals were reliably detected in patients. The most consistent changes were localized in white matter regions: anterior internal capsule and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In contrast, BOLD signals were normal in cortical regions, such as the frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus, that mediate oculomotor and attention functions necessary for visual tracking. The abnormal BOLD signals accurately differentiated chronic mTBI patients from healthy controls at the single-subject level, although they did not correlate with symptoms or neuropsychological performance.

In the complex pathogenesis the primary cause is neuronal dysfunction mediated by autoantibodies, vasculopathia and coagulopathia. Until now, more than 20 antibodies have been identified in association with damages of the nervous system. These antibodies may impair neurons or astrocytes and may promote thrombotic processes in vessels of the brain. Activation of endothelial cells and disturbance of blood-brain barrier are also pathogenic factors. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus the most frequent psychiatric manifestations are organic psychosyndrome, particularly deterioration of cognitive functions, and depression, while the most common neurological syndromes are epilepsy and ischemic stroke.

Rats subject to TBI displayed mood (anxiety-like) and memory dysfunction. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of both synaptic (synaptophysin) and plasticity proteins (BDNF and CREB), a loss of cresyl violet-stained neurons, and increased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus. Notably, chronic GUO treatment (7.5 mg/kg i.p. daily starting 1 h after TBI) prevented all these TBI-induced long-term behavioral, neurochemical, and morphological modifications. This neuroprotective effect of GUO was abrogated in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (1 mg/kg) but unaltered by the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (0.05 mg/kg).

Plasma and brain IGF1 and IGF2 levels were evaluated in mice 3 weeks and 3 days after a controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced mild-to-moderate TBI. The effects of conditioned fear on IGF levels and its interaction with TBI (TBI followed, 3 weeks later, by fear-inducing procedures) were also evaluated. In the plasma, IGF1 decreased 3 weeks post-TBI only (-9%), whereas IGF2 remained unaffected. In the brain, IGF1 increased only in the cortex and hippocampus at 3 weeks post-TBI (up to +650%). At 3 days, surpringly, this increase was more diffuse and more important in sham (craniotomized) animals. Additionally, IGF2 immunostaining in brain ventricles was reorganized in TBI animals at both post-TBI stages. Conditioned fear exposure did not influence the effects of early chronic TBI on plasma IGF1 levels, but reduced plasma IGF2 (-6%) levels. It also dampened the effects of TBI on brain IGF systems, but brain IGF1 level and IGF2 tissue distribution remained statistically different from controls under these conditions. In co-exposed animals, DNA methylation increased at the hippocampal Igf1 gene promoter. These results show that blood IGF1 and IGF2 are most reduced in the early chronic phase of TBI and after exposure to a stressful event, and that the brain IGF system is up-regulated after TBI, and more so in the acute phase."

At 6 months, the PST group significantly improved on a measure of psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory; BSI-18) compared to the EO group (p = 0.005), but not on post-concussion symptoms (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire [RPQ]; p = 0.19), the two primary endpoints. However, these effects did not persist at 12-month follow-up (BSI, p = 0.54; RPQ, p = 0.45). The PST group also had significant short-term improvement on secondary endpoints, including sleep (p = 0.01), depression (p = 0.03), post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.04), and physical functioning (p = 0.03). Participants preferred PST over EO (p < 0.001). Telephone-delivered PST appears to be a well-accepted treatment that offers promise for reducing psychological distress after combat-related mTBI and could be a useful adjunct treatment post-mTBI. Further studies are required to determine how to sustain its effects. (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01387490 https://clinicaltrials.gov )."

Brain SPECT is more sensitive and shows perfusion abnormalities immediately after mTBI. This work explores the perfusion abnormalities for young patients suffering from fatigue several months after mTBI.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Twelve mTBI patients (age:8-36 yr, 4 male) with no history of fatigue prior to trauma were prospectively studied following onset of fatigue 6-12 months after mTBI utilizing 99 m-Tc ECD brain SPECT with early and delayed radiotracer imaging.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The perfusion pattern in the mTBI + fatigue group included left hemispheric deficits in frontal lobes (early phase: 15.2 ± 4.2%, delayed phase: 9.9 ± 2.2%) and medial temporal lobes (early phase 11.2 ± 3.7%, delayed phase: 9.0 ± 2.3%). Seven patients additionally showed excess tracer accumulation in the parenchyma surrounding internal jugular bulb inferior to temporal lobe. This was modeled as due to increased cellular permeability from TBI induced oxidative stress affecting endothelial tight junctions and consequent tracer leakage across jugular bulbs. Prolonged posture changes from erect to supine position during imaging increase jugular cross-sectional area and venous wall pressure as has been observed in other disease processes and seem to be responsible for tracer leakage from jugular bulbs in our study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This work supports an oxidative stress and BBB disruption model for mTBI. The frontal and temporal lobe perfusion deficits are attributed to anatomical vulnerabilities of these lobes. During a mild TBI both of these lobes are susceptible to grazing impacts with underlying bony ridges. We propose a relation between mTBI and fatigue arising from oxidative stress in mTBI affecting ATP generation and altering endothelial homeostasis for both micro-and-large vasculatures. The tracer leakage observed around jugular veins is due to posture induced changes in venous cross-sections and wall pressure as well as from compromised endothelium post TBI induced oxidative stress."

The aim of this work was to investigate if 17-β-estradiol (βE) was able to prevent hippocampal-related behavioral and biochemical changes induced by neonatal ionizing radiation exposure and to elucidate a potential neuroprotective mechanism. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5 Gy of X-rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. A subset of rats was subcutaneously administered with successive injections of βE or 17-α-estradiol (αE), prior and after irradiation. Rats were subjected to different behavioral tasks to evaluate habituation and associative memory as well as anxiety levels. Hippocampal ROS levels and protein kinase C (PKC) activity were also assessed. Results show that although βE was unable to prevent radiation-induced hippocampal PKC activity changes, most behavioral abnormalities were reversed. Moreover, hippocampal ROS levels in βE-treated irradiated rats approached control values. In addition, αE administered to irradiated animals was effective in preventing radiation-induced alterations. In conclusion, βE was able to counteract behavioral and biochemical changes induced in irradiated animals, probably acting through an antioxidant mechanism."

            "abstract": "An early transient increase in brain polyamine (PA) metabolism, termed the PA-stress-response (PSR), is a common reaction to stressful stimuli, including physical, emotional, and hormonal stressors, with a magnitude related to the stress intensity. In the extreme, traumatic injury can result in an incomplete PSR, with persistent accumulation of putrescine and eventual reduction in the concentrations of the higher polyamines (PAs), spermidine and spermine. Chronic intermittent application of stressors causes a recurrence of the brain PSR, but, in contrast, it leads to habituation of the response in the periphery (liver). Severe continuous stress, however, may lead to accumulation of brain PAs. Long-term inhibition of PA synthesis depletes brain PAs and can result in altered emotional reactivity to stressors. Furthermore, the brain PSR, in contrast to the periphery, can be blocked by a long-term, but not by short-term, treatment with lithium, the most efficacious treatment of manic-depressive illness. The brain PSR is developmentally regulated, and the switch to the mature pattern coincides with the cessation of the \"stress hyporesponsive period\" in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system. In contrast to the brain and liver, the PSR in the adrenal and thymus is down-regulated by acute stressors. Transient up-regulation of the PSR, as in the brain and liver, is implicated in cell survival while its down-regulation is implicated in cell death. Taken together, the findings indicate that the PSR is a dynamic process that varies with the type, intensity, and duration of stressors, and implicate this response as an adaptive mechanism in the reaction to stressful events. Under persistent stressful conditions, however, the PSR may be maladaptive as may be reflected by PA accumulation. This raises the hypothesis that proper regulation of brain PSR may be critical for neuronal function and for an appropriate behavioral response to stressors."

This study examined the effect of maternal deprivation (MD) on nociceptive responding prior to and following peripheral nerve injury (L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation [SNL]).

MD female, but not male, rats exhibited thermal hypoalgesia and mechanical allodynia compared with control (non-MD) counterparts. SNL resulted in mechanical and cold allodynia in MD and control rats of both sexes. However, MD females exhibited enhanced SNL-induced allodynic responding compared with non-MD counterparts. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of MD-SNL males when compared with non-SNL counterparts.

MD-SNL females exhibited reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha in the prefrontal cortex with a concomitant increase in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in the hippocampus, compared with either MD or SNL alone.

METHODS A retrospective medical record review of clients who had completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) at their initial assessment and were discharged from a large metropolitan concussion service in New Zealand was undertaken over a 6-month period in 2014 (n = 107).

RESULTS Time from injury to initial assessment by a specialist concussion service was correlated with proportionally more psychological symptoms present at initial assessments (r = 0.222, P = 0.024); in particular, feeling depressed or tearful (r = 0.292, P = 0.003). Time to discharge was correlated with individual RPQ symptom proportions present at initial assessment for headaches (r = -0.238, P = 0.015), sensitivity to noise (r = 0.220, P = 0.026), feeling depressed or tearful (r = 0.193, P = 0.051) and feeling frustrated or impatient (r = 0.252, P = 0.003), along with the psychological cluster proportion (r = 0.235, P = 0.017) and the total RPQ score (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Prompt diagnosis and treatment of mTBI may minimise the severity of post-concussion symptoms, especially symptoms associated with mental health and wellbeing."

            "abstract": "Acute or chronic liver injury is closely related to hyperammonemia, which will result in oxidative stress and damage to nerve cells, and these factors are vital to the development of anxiety and depression. In this study, the effect of Nootkatone (NKT) on the anxiety- and depression-like behavioral changes in mice induced by liver injury was investigated. Liver injury was induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN; 350 mg/kg) three times a week for 4 weeks. NKT (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was given as co-treatment daily for 4 weeks. NKT (5 mg/kg) co-treatment remarkably ameliorates D-GalN-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as evident from the results of sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, tail suspension test, and novelty suppressed feeding test. Results showed that NKT could induce an elevation in serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase level, alleviate the oxidative stress induced by hyperammonemia through activating Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathways, decrease the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NOX2 in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, enhance the vitality of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione levels in serum, liver, and brain, and significantly reduce the generation of malondialdehyde. At the same time, NKT also reduces the level of ammonia in serum and brain and upgrades the activity of glutamine synthetase in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, the present results suggested that NKT has a significant antidepressant effect through modulation of oxidative stress induced by D-GalN administration."

In this study of adolescent athletes, we examined whether an additional head impact within 24 h of a sports-related concussion (SRC) is associated with higher symptom burden and prolonged clinical recovery compared with a single-injury group. Forty-two student-athletes (52% male, mean age = 14.9 years) diagnosed with an SRC in a concussion clinic were selected for this study: (1) 21 athletes who sustained an additional significant head impact within 24 h of the initial injury (additional-impact group); (2) 21 single-injury athletes, age and gender matched, who sustained only one discrete concussive blow to the head (single-injury group). Groups did not differ on initial injury characteristics or pre-injury risk factors. The effect of injury status (single- vs. additional-impact) was examined on athlete- and parent-reported symptom burden (at first clinic visit) and length of recovery (LOR). Higher symptom burden was reported by the athletes and parents in the additional-impact group at the time of first visit. The additional-impact group also had a significantly longer LOR compared with the single-injury group. These findings provide preliminary, hypothesis-generating evidence for the importance of immediate removal from play following an SRC to protect athletes from re-injury, which may worsen symptoms and prolong recovery. The retrospective study design from a specialized clinical sample points to the need for future prospective studies of the relationship between single- and additional-impact injuries on symptom burden and LOR."

            "abstract": "A history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), particularly repeated mTBI (rmTBI), has been identified as a risk factor for late-onset neurodegenerative conditions. The mild and transient nature of early symptoms often impedes diagnosis in young adults who are disproportionately affected by mTBIs. A proportion of the affected population will incur long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences but the underlying pathomechanism is currently unknown. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides sensitive and quantitative assessment of TBI-induced structural changes, including white matter injury, and may be used to predict long-term outcome. We used DTI in an animal model of blast rmTBI (rmbTBI) to quantify blast-induced structural changes at 7 and 90 days post-injury, and their evolution between the two time points. Young adult male rats (~P65 at injury) were exposed to repeated mild blast overpressure, or anesthetized as shams, and their fixed brains were imaged using high-field (7 T) MRI. We found that whole brain volumes similarly increased in injured and sham rats from 7 to 90 days. However, we detected localized volume increases in blast-exposed animals 7 days post-injury, mainly ipsilateral to incident blast waves. Affected regions included gray matter of the frontal association, cingulate, and motor cortex, thalamus, substantia nigra, and raphe nuclei (median and dorsal), as well as white matter of the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle. Conversely, we measured volume reductions in these and other regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum, at 90 days post-injury. DTI also detected both transient and persistent microstructural changes following injury, with some changes showing distinct ipsilateral versus contralateral side differences relative to blast impact. Early changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) were subtle, becoming more prominent at 90 days in the cerebral and inferior cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellar white matter. Widespread increases in radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (primary eigenvalue or E1) at 7 days post-injury largely subsided by 90 days, although RD was more sensitive than E1 at detecting white matter changes. E1 effects in gray and white matter, which paralleled increases in apparent diffusion, were likely more indicative of dysregulated water homeostasis than pathologic structural changes. Importantly, we found evidence for a different developmental trajectory following rmbTBI, as indicated by significant injury x age interactions on volume. Our findings demonstrate that rmbTBI initiates dynamic pathobiological processes that may negatively alter the course of late-stage neurodevelopment and adversely affect long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes."

These ongoing symptoms can cause significant disability and be frustrating for the patient and family. In addition, factors other than brain injury can cause complications for these patients, such as adjustment disorder or exacerbation of preexisting conditions such as depression or migraine. Individuals with prolonged symptoms of concussion may be classified as having post-concussion syndrome. A careful and thoughtful evaluation is important, as the clinician must determine whether these prolonged symptoms reflect brain injury pathophysiology versus another process. Although there have been numerous studies on the acute management of concussion, much less is available on the treatment of persistent disease. This review will provide an evaluation approach for the patient with prolonged concussion symptoms and review recent literature on treatment strategies."

Methods: 75 OEF/OIF/OND-era Veterans (56 deployment-related mTBI; 19 no history of TBI), were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and self-report measures of mood and QOL. Self-perceived irritability was measured using the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory. Prospective memory (PM) was measured using the Memory for Intentions Test (MIST). Results: Self-perceived irritability was significantly higher for Veterans with, versus without, a history of deployment-related mTBI. Among Veterans with a history of mTBI, self-perceived irritability was inversely associated with PM performance, even after adjusting for PTSD severity. Greater self-perceived irritability was also associated with higher depressive symptoms and reduced QOL for perceived physical health, psychological health, social support, and environmental factors; however, only social support remained significant after adjusting for PTSD severity. Depression symptom severity was not significantly associated with PM, suggesting that PM may be uniquely related to self-perceived irritability rather than mood dysregulation more generally. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary evidence of a relationship between PM and self-perceived irritability in Veterans with a history of mTBI. PM and irritability may be related via their mutual reliance on high-level cognitive control. Results illustrate possible cognitive and affective factors contributing to psychological and interpersonal challenges for this population. Future investigations with larger and more diverse samples are needed to replicate findings and explore potential mechanisms linking irritability and PM following mTBI."

            "abstract": "About one-third of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail at least two antidepressant drug trials at 1 year. Together with clinical and experimental evidence indicating that the pathophysiology of MDD is multifactorial, this observation underscores the importance of elucidating mechanisms beyond monoaminergic dysregulation that can contribute to the genesis and persistence of MDD. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mechanistically linked to the presence of neurovascular dysfunction with blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability in selected neurological disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, MDD is frequently comorbid with such neurological disorders and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in disorders characterized by vascular endothelial dysfunction (cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the neurobiology of MDD. More recent evidence links neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to MDD without neurological comorbidity. We review this emerging literature and present a theoretical integration between these abnormalities to those involving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in MDD. We discuss our hypothesis that alterations in endothelial nitric oxide levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling are central mechanistic links in this regard. Understanding the contribution of neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to the pathophysiology of MDD may help to identify novel therapeutic and preventative approaches."

Whereas the physical effects ranging from sensori-motor disturbances to posttraumatic epilepsy are often reported as well as cognitive sequelae, deteriorations of emotional and behavioural aspects are often neglected. Recent advances in imaging technology and clinical neuropsychology research have greatly contributed to increase our understanding of the effect of traumatic brain injury on diverse behavioural functions. After a brief review of the current status of problems facing the brain injured patients, this paper discusses the neuropsychological aspects of 3 long term brain injured patients. All 3 patients showed important behavioural and emotional distress several years after the accident. Whereas case report of patient A and C discuss the emotional and personality disturbance characterised by anxiety, depression and irritability, case report of patient C which is a case of classic frontal syndrome showed important memory impairment with emotional disturbance characterised by apathy, lack of motivation and complete indifference to his surrounding environment. Whatever the mechanisms involved, psychoaffective disturbances in the brain injured patients appear as important problems in the long term. These emotional difficulties must be considered in the treatment and rehabilitation procedures of these victims in order to help them to improve their social adjustment and quality of life aspects. Neuropsychological test data can be used to develop treatment strategies tailored for an individual's specific cognitive strengths and deficits."

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes significant sensory-motor and cognitive deficits in humans. However, no study has evaluated cognition in rodent ICH models. Thus, we used a battery of tests to comprehensively examine whether a striatal ICH causes cognitive impairments in rats. Bacterial collagenase (or sterile saline for SHAM surgery) was injected into the striatum to create an ICH. Two days later, functional deficits were assessed using a neurological deficit scale (NDS), which is most sensitive to ICH injury. Sensory and/or motor deficits may confound cognitive testing; thus, we waited until these had resolved before testing learning and memory. Testing was conducted 1-7 months after ICH and included spontaneous alternation, elevated plus maze, open-field, Morris water maze, T-maze (win-shift and win-stay paradigms), and the radial arm maze (eight and four arms baited protocols). Significant motor deficits at 2 days completely resolved by 1 month, at which time cognitive testing began. In contrast to persistent cognitive deficits that occur after ICH in humans, we did not detect significant learning or memory deficits after ICH in rats. Our results suggest that these tests will not likely be useful for assessing outcome in experimental ICH studies. In conclusion, animal models that better mimic clinical ICH (both motor and cognitive deficits) must be developed. This may include increasing ICH severity or injuring other functional subdivisions within the striatum that may lead to more profound cognitive deficits."

            "abstract": "Concussions are occurring at alarming rates in the United States and have become a serious public health concern. The CDC estimates that 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur in sports and recreational activities annually. Concussion as defined by the 2013 Concussion Consensus Statement \"may be caused either by a direct blow to the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an 'impulsive' force transmitted to the head.\" Concussions leave the individual with both short- and long-term effects. The short-term effects of sport related concussions may include changes in playing ability, confusion, memory disturbance, the loss of consciousness, slowing of reaction time, loss of coordination, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, changes in sleep patterns and mood changes. These symptoms typically resolve in a matter of days. However, while some individuals recover from a single concussion rather quickly, many experience lingering effects that can last for weeks or months. The factors related to concussion susceptibility and the subsequent recovery times are not well known or understood at this time. Several factors have been suggested and they include the individual's concussion history, the severity of the initial injury, history of migraines, history of learning disabilities, history of psychiatric comorbidities, and possibly, genetic factors. Many studies have individually investigated certain factors both the short-term and long-term effects of concussions, recovery time course, susceptibility and recovery. What has not been clearly established is an effective multifaceted approach to concussion evaluation that would yield valuable information related to the etiology, functional changes, and recovery. The purpose of this manuscript is to show one such multifaceted approached which examines concussions using computerized neurocognitive testing, event related potentials, somatosensory perceptual responses, balance assessment, gait assessment and genetic testing."

We examined the association between anxiety and other physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms in injured adolescents and young adults undergoing an initial evaluation in a specialty concussion clinic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were 158 adolescents and young adults presenting to a multidisciplinary concussion clinic for evaluation and treatment (54.4% girls and women; mean age = 17.3 years; SD = 2.9). Their median days post injury was 29 (interquartile range = 14-49; range = 7-349). They were divided into binary groups based on whether they had a pre-injury history of anxiety diagnosis or treatment and whether they were experiencing current anxiety in the week prior to the evaluation, and then compared on the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Youth with a pre-injury history of anxiety reported greater post-concussion symptoms (Md total score = 36.0, IQR = 21.5-53.0) compared to youth with no pre-injury history of anxiety (Md total score = 20.5, IQR = 6.0-36.0; MW U = 1,520.00 p = 0.001, r = 0.26, small-medium effect size). They reported significantly worse headaches, nausea, balance difficulty, dizziness, vision problems, fatigue, concentration difficulty, irritability, nervousness, sadness, feeling more emotional, trouble falling asleep, and sleeping more than usual. Youth with high post-injury anxiety reported greater post-concussion symptoms (Md total score = 55.0, IQR = 33.0-62.5) compared to youth with low post-injury anxiety (Md total score = 19.0, IQR = 6.0-35.0; MW U = 681.00, p < 0.001, r = 0.49, large effect size). They reported significantly worse headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vision problems, fatigue, sensitivity to light, feeling mentally foggy, feeling slowed down, concentration difficulty, memory difficulty, irritability, sadness, feeling more emotional, drowsiness, trouble falling asleep, sleeping less than usual, and sleeping more than usual. Logistic regressions revealed that both pre-injury and post-injury anxiety were strong predictors of persistent post-concussion symptoms, with high post-injury anxiety presenting the strongest independent predictor, while attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and pre-injury migraines were not significant predictors. Essentially all adolescents with high post-injury anxiety (97.1%) and nearly 9 of 10 adolescents with pre-injury treatment for anxiety (87.8%) met criteria for persistent post-concussion symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Pre-injury and post-injury anxiety are important risk factors for greater post-concussion symptoms among adolescents and young adults. Elevated post-injury anxiety was the strongest predictor of persistent post-concussion symptoms. Assessment of anxiety is important among adolescents presenting for concussion care and delivery of evidence-supported treatments for anxiety are important considerations for treatment planning for these youth."

In a second experiment, MD-lesioned subjects were submitted to a GO/NOGO temporal alternation task involving two intertrial intervals (ITIs: 0 and 30 s). Lesioned subjects exhibited large bilateral mediodorsal thalamic lesions with small damage into the centromedial thalamic nucleus. In the first experiment, MD-lesioned animals performed normally a sequential alternation task involving fixed ITIs over seven successive trials (5 or 30 s); in contrast, MD-lesioned subjects exhibited deficits in the sequential task involving the same but mixed ITIs (30-5 s versus 5-30 s) the deficit being observed for the last trials of the series, regardless the ITIs used. MD lesions increased fear reactivity in an elevated-plus maze, and scores of anxiety were negatively correlated with performance in the mixed alternation schedule. The second experiment involving non spatial information extended results of the first experiment in showing that the deficit of MD-lesioned animals was not dependent on the ITIs separating trials. Overall, our data show that MD-lesioned subjects exhibit a cognitive impairment characterized by a difficulty to maintain an alternation rule in situations involving procedural variance, and this deficit could stem primarily from an increase of fear reactivity."

A fragment of 61 chronic kidney patients, aged 52±2.43, complete examination is presented. The examination included a detailed clinical and neurological check-up, neuropsychological (evaluating the trait and state anxiety levels by applying the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), laboratory (identifying the parameters of electrolytic balance, nitrogen metabolism, autoimmune markers of brain and kidney tissue injury) and instrumental examinations (nephrosonography, brain MRI, electroneuromyography). Thus, having examined the patients with CKD in detail, we detected the signs of a nervous system disorder in all the patients, polyneuropathy - in 74% of patients, autonomic nervous system tone disorder, neuropsychological status change, in particular, the increased state anxiety level - in 42% of patients. At the detailed examination of the patients with CKD there were identified the impairments in the structures of both the central and peripheral parts of the nervous system, as well as the autonomic nervous system and certain neuropsychological makers. Taking into account the fact that CKD is polyetiologic, and the neurological symptoms manifest themselves early in the course of the disease, as well as the disability, caused by the pathology, is high, we consider studying clinical, neurological and neuropsychological characteristics in patients with CKD to optimize the algorithm for early detection of this pathology."

However, the neuroplastic changes associated with peripheral neuropathic pain and the onset and progression of allodynic symptoms remain unclear. Here, we used a chronic neuropathic pain model (spared nerve injury; SNI) to examine functional and metabolic brain changes associated with the development and maintenance of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, the latter which we assessed both behaviorally and during a novel acetone application paradigm using functional MRI (fMRI). Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent SNI (n=7) or sham (n=5) surgery to the left hindpaw. Rats were anesthetized and scanned using a 7 T MRI scanner 1 week prior to (pre-injury) and 4 (early/subchronic) and 20 weeks (late/chronic) post-injury. Functional scans were acquired during acetone application to the left hindpaw. (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was also performed to assess SNI-induced metabolic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) pre- and 4 weeks post-injury. Mechanical and cold sensitivity, as well as anxiety-like behaviors, were assessed 2 weeks pre-injury, and 2, 5, 9, 14, and 19 weeks post-injury. Stimulus-evoked brain responses (acetone application to the left hindpaw) were analyzed across the pre- and post-injury time points. In response to acetone application during fMRI, SNI rats showed widespread and functionally diverse changes within pain-related brain regions including somatosensory and cingulate cortices and subcortically within the thalamus and the periaqueductal gray. These functional brain changes temporally coincided with early and sustained increases in both mechanical and cold sensitivity. SNI rats also showed increased glutamate within the ACC that correlated with behavioral measures of cold hypersensitivity. Together, our findings suggest that extensive functional reorganization within pain-related brain regions may underlie the development and chronification of allodynic-like behaviors."

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, cerebral concussion) is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to evaluate how omega-3 fatty acids during brain maturation can influence challenges incurred during adulthood (transitioning to unhealthy diet and mTBI) and predispose the brain to a PTSD-like pathobiology. Rats exposed to diets enriched or deficient in omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) during their brain maturation period, were transitioned to a western diet (WD) when becoming adult and then subjected to mTBI. TBI resulted in an increase in anxiety-like behavior and its molecular counterpart NPY1R, a hallmark of PTSD, but these effects were more pronounced in the animals exposed to n-3 deficient diet and switched to WD. The n-3 deficiency followed by WD disrupted BDNF signaling and the activation of elements of BDNF signaling pathway (TrkB, CaMKII, Akt and CREB) in frontal cortex. TBI worsened these effects and more prominently in combination with the n-3 deficiency condition. Moreover, the n-3 deficiency primed the immune system to the challenges imposed by the WD and brain trauma as evidenced by results showing that the WD or mTBI affected brain IL1β levels and peripheral Th17 and Treg subsets only in animals previously conditioned to the n-3 deficient diet. These results provide novel evidence for the capacity of maladaptive dietary habits to lower the threshold for neurological disorders in response to challenges."

            "abstract": "Approximately 500,000 infants are born prematurely each year in the United States. These infants typically require an extensive stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where they experience on average 14 painful and invasive procedures each day. These procedures, including repeated heel lance, insertion of intravenous lines, and respiratory and gastric suctioning, typically result in an inflammatory response, inducing pain and stress in the newborn. Remarkably, the majority of these procedures are performed in the complete absence of pre- or post-emptive analgesics. Recent clinical studies report that former NICU patients have increased thresholds for pain and stress later in life as compared with term-born infants. However, to date, the mechanisms whereby early-life inflammation alters later-life response to stress and pain are not known. The present studies were conducted to determine if neonatal injury impairs adult responses to anxiety- and stress-provoking stimuli. As we have previously reported that early-life pain results in a significant increase in opioid peptide expression within the midbrain periaqueductal gray, the role of endogenous opioids in our behavioral studies was also examined. Male and female rats received an intraplantar injection of the inflammatory agent carrageenan (1%) on the day of birth. In adulthood, animals were assessed for changes in response to anxiety- and stress-provoking stimuli using the open field and forced swim tests, respectively. Injury-induced changes in sucrose preference and stress-induced analgesia were also assessed. As adults, neonatally injured animals displayed a blunted response to both anxiety- and stress-provoking stimuli, as indicated by significantly more time spent in the inner area of the open field and a 2-fold increase in latency to immobility in the forced swim test as compared to controls. No change in sucrose preference was observed. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we observed a 2-fold increase in enkephalin mRNA and protein expression, respectively, in stress-related brain regions including the central amygdala and lateral septum. Administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone reversed the attenuated responses to forced swim stress and stress-induced analgesia, suggesting the changes in stress-related behavior were opioid-dependent. Together, these data contribute to mounting evidence that neonatal injury in the absence of analgesics has adverse effects that are both long-term and polysystemic."

Psychotherapy, especially in regards to longer-term adjustment to brain injury, may have an important adjunctive role in treatment approaches, but adaptations of techniques may be needed. A clinical pathway is described which can help to raise clinicians awareness, as well as increase detection rates and consideration of the specific role of individual psychotherapy in this clinical population.

            "abstract": "The hippocampus, a limbic structure important in learning and memory, is particularly sensitive to chronic stress and to glucocorticoids. While glucocorticoids are essential for an effective stress response, their oversecretion was originally hypothesized to contribute to age-related hippocampal degeneration. However, conflicting findings were reported on whether prolonged exposure to elevated glucocorticoids endangered the hippocampus and whether the primate hippocampus even responded to glucocorticoids as the rodent hippocampus did. This review discusses the seemingly inconsistent findings about the effects of elevated and prolonged glucocorticoids on hippocampal health and proposes that a chronic stress history, which includes repeated elevation of glucocorticoids, may make the hippocampus vulnerable to potential injury. Studies are described to show that chronic stress or prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids can compromise the hippocampus by producing dendritic retraction, a reversible form of plasticity that includes dendritic restructuring without irreversible cell death. Conditions that produce dendritic retraction are hypothesized to make the hippocampus vulnerable to neurotoxic or metabolic challenges. Of particular interest is the finding that the hippocampus can recover from dendritic retraction without any noticeable cell loss. When conditions surrounding dendritic retraction are present, the potential for harm is increased because dendritic retraction may persist for weeks, months or even years, thereby broadening the window of time during which the hippocampus is vulnerable to harm, called the 'glucocorticoid vulnerability hypothesis'. The relevance of these findings is discussed with regard to conditions exhibiting parallels in hippocampal plasticity, including Cushing's disease, major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

            "abstract": "Objective: Limited studies exist on the association between loss of consciousness (LOC) and altered mental state (AMS) and development of depressive and post-concussive symptoms within six months after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We tested the hypothesis that presence of both LOC and AMS predict the highest risk of symptoms within the first six months post-mTBI compared to either variable alone, and that LOC alone is more strongly associated with these symptoms. Research design: We analyzed data from 407 subjects with mTBI from the Head injury Serum Markers for Assessing Response to Trauma (HeadSMART) cohort, a prospective cohort of patients post-TBI presenting to two urban emergency departments. Results: There were higher rates of depressive (44%) and post-concussive symptoms (54%) at 1 month post-injury, among participants with both LOC and AMS compared to other groups. AMS was associated with depressive symptoms at one and six months (OR = 1.59, p = .038; OR = 1.60; p = .060) and post-concussive symptoms at one month (OR = 1.56, p = .053). LOC was associated only with post-concussive symptoms at one month (OR = 1.55;p = .048). Among those without LOC, AMS was associated with depressive symptoms at one month (OR = 2.24; p = .028). Conclusions: AMS predicts post-mTBI depressive symptoms both in the acute and chronic mTBI phases whereas LOC is a more sensitive predictor of post-concussive symptoms in the acute mTBI period."

Relatively little is known about this cohort. The study aimed to describe the impact of experiencing a mild/moderate TBI on the older adult as well as the significant other in the year post injury. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a multiple-case study using data from a larger parent study. Qualitative content analysis of interviews conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injury with 3 dyads was performed (24 interviews) and included cross-case and cross-time comparisons. RESULTS: Dyads that included persons 65 years and older with a mild-moderate TBI and their significant others were enrolled (N = 3/6 individuals). The identified themes were struggling to accept limitations and acceptance, gratitude, fear and concern, frustration/anger/guilt/resentment, broader social support, emotional coping, and the presence or absence of broader social support. CONCLUSIONS: Feelings of hope, gratitude, and acceptance serve as vital ways for couples to continue toward a path of recovery and healing. Lack of social support was a stressor, creating a barrier to recovery. Significant others tended to focus on others versus self-care needs. Nurses should integrate social support and self-care into the assessment of the spousal dyad after TBI. These findings can also inform the development of support groups and case management models for both patients after TBI and their significant others."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated potent immunomodulatory capabilities in the context of chronic inflammatory disease and injury but have yet to be evaluated in stress-based preclinical models of MDD.

Recent studies suggest that host immune cell-mediated phagocytosis of MSCs in vivo can trigger an immunomodulatory cascade, resulting in resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest that similar mechanisms may protect distal organs, including the brain, from systemic, stress-induced proinflammatory spikes and may uncover unexpected targets in the periphery for novel or adjunct treatment for a subset of patients with MDD."

Alterations in the body schema similar to the cortico-limbic disconnection syndrome of pain asymbolia are suggested to be responsible for DP. In this study we used hypnosis to induce DP in healthy subjects and to examine neural patterns of pain perception in the state of DP by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pain perception was investigated in 7 healthy subjects with high susceptibility to hypnosis in three different mental states: waking state (N-W), hypnotic relaxation (H-R) and hypnotic DP (H-DP).

Moreover, a network of cortical and subcortical areas that have been implicated in the perception of the own body was less responsive during DP, which might point to a specific neural mechanism underlying the 'out-of-body' experience. Although the small number of subjects does not allow a generalization of our findings, H-DP seems to be a promising tool for the investigation of psychological and biological mechanisms of self-inflicted injuries as well as the mind-body interplay within the realm of psychosomatic disorders."

            "abstract": "Survivors of acquired brain injury (ABI) are at risk of a range of neuropsychiatric and behavioural disorders. Emotional disturbance, with reactive elements of mood disorder, such as depression and anxiety, appear particularly common. Specific anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have also been identified. Pain syndromes are also common-particularly in those who have suffered Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). Survivors of ABI are often atrisk of substance misuse and of irritability states. Their relationships may suffer from the stresses triggered by the aftermath of injury. Intimate, in particular, sexual relationships may be particularly affected. These effects are not, necessarily, only consequent of severe injuries, as mild TBI can also have, for some, significant neuropsychiatric effects. Assessment and management of such conditions are compromised by survivors of injury often having a limited insight into the sequelae of their injuries. Interventions for such disorders and forms of distress are increasingly available. This paper introduces the special issue of Neuropsychological Rehabilitation on biopsychosocial approaches in neurorehabilitation. A range of papers provide overviews for assessing and managing such neuropsychiatric, mood and behavioural (health and habit) disorders."

To provide new insights, this study used a clinically relevant model of repeated mTBI in rats to characterize the acute and chronic neuropathological and neurobehavioral consequences of these injuries. Rats were given four sham-injuries or four mTBIs and allocated to 7-day or 3.5-months post-injury recovery groups. Behavioral analysis assessed sensorimotor function, locomotion, anxiety, and spatial memory. Neuropathological analysis included serum quantification of neurofilament light (NfL), mass spectrometry of the hippocampal proteome, and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Repeated mTBI rats had evidence of acute cognitive deficits and prolonged sensorimotor impairments. Serum NfL was elevated at 7 days post injury, with levels correlating with sensorimotor deficits; however, no NfL differences were observed at 3.5 months. Several hippocampal proteins were altered by repeated mTBI, including those associated with energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, and impaired neurogenic capacity. Diffusion MRI analysis at 3.5 months found widespread reductions in white matter integrity. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the nature and progression of repeated mTBI neuropathology that may underlie lingering or chronic neurobehavioral deficits."

Diffusion and conventional MRI were performed approximately 1- and 3-months post-injury. Whole-brain deterministic tractography followed by region of interest analyses was used to identify forceps minor (FM), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and cingulum bundle as tracts of interest. An adjusted version of the ExploreDTI Atlas Based Tractography method was used to obtain reliable tracts for every subject. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, radial and axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AD), and number of streamlines were studied per tract. Linear mixed models showed lower FA, and higher MD, and RD of the right UF in asymptomatic patients with uncomplicated mTBI relative to symptomatic patients and HC. Diffusion alterations were most pronounced in the group with frontal lesions on CT, particularly in the FM and UF; these effects increased over time. Within the group of patients with uncomplicated mTBI, there were no associations of diffusion measures with the number of symptoms nor with lesions on conventional MRI.

Patients with mTBI (n = 297; 40.4% men; mean = 38.2 years old, standard deviation [SD] = 14.0, range = 17-65), referred from an emergency department in Taipei, Taiwan, were seen in a neurosurgical outpatient clinic on average 7.7 days since injury (SD = 5.7, range = 0 - 21 days), at which time they completed a checklist of post-concussion symptoms. Patients rated their current symptom severity and retrospectively rated their pre-injury symptom severity on 15 physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. Patients were grouped based on whether they did or did not have mild or greater pre-injury anxiety or depression based on this scale. Those with pre-injury anxiety or depression had greater pre-injury (all p's < 0.001, d range: 0.92-2.03) and post-injury (all p's < 0.001, d range: 0.65-1.00) symptom severity. However, when analyzing perceived change in symptoms (i.e., post-injury ratings minus pre-injury ratings), only perceived change in cognitive symptoms differed across groups (p = 0.018, d = 0.29), which became non-significant after controlling for gender. Greater post-concussion symptom severity in patients with pre-existing mental health problems may be mostly attributable to elevated symptoms before injury. These findings demonstrate the clinical value of retrospective pre-injury symptom assessment in mTBI management. Greater post-concussion symptom severity in patients with pre-injury mental health problems may represent a continuation of greater pre-injury symptom severity rather than a greater increase in symptom severity after mTBI."

Irradiation-induced memory impairment, motor hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviour were normalized by lithium treatment. Late-onset irradiation-induced hypopituitarism was prevented by lithium treatment. Additionally, lithium appeared relatively toxic to multiple cultured tumour cell lines, and did not improve viability of radiated DAOY cells in vitro.

Clinical resources, therapeutic interventions, and clinical and return-to-play outcomes are summarized.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred seventy-four patients (mean age 14.2 years, 61.5% male) were included in the study. At least 1 emotional symptom was reported in 49.4% of the patients, and the median emotional PCSS subscore was 4 (interquartile range 1-8) among those who reported at least 1 emotional symptom. Overall, 20 (11.5%) of the patients met the study criteria for a postinjury psychiatric outcome, including 14 patients with an NPD, 2 patients with isolated suicidal ideation, and 4 patients with worsening symptoms of a preinjury psychiatric disorder. Female sex, a higher initial PCSS score, a higher emotional PCSS subscore, presence of a preinjury psychiatric history, and presence of a family history of psychiatric illness were significantly associated with postinjury psychiatric outcomes. Interventions for patients with postinjury psychiatric outcomes included pharmacological therapy alone in 2 patients (10%), cognitive behavioral therapy alone in 4 (20%), multimodal therapy in 9 (45%), and no treatment in 5 (25%). Overall, 5 (25%) of the patients with postinjury psychiatric disorders were medically cleared to return to full sports participation, whereas 5 (25%) were lost to follow-up and 9 (45%) remained in treatment by the multidisciplinary concussion program at the end of the study period. One patient who was asymptomatic at the time of initial consultation committed suicide.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Emotional symptoms were commonly reported among pediatric patients with SRC referred to a multidisciplinary pediatric concussion program. In some cases, these symptoms contributed to the development of an NPD, isolated suicidal ideation, and worsening symptoms of a preexisting psychiatric disorder. Future research is needed to clarify the prevalence, pathophysiology, risk factors, and evidence-based management of postinjury psychiatric outcomes after pediatric SRC. Successful management of these patients requires prompt recognition and multidisciplinary care by experts with clinical training and experience in concussion and psychiatry."

            "abstract": "Emotional distress after traumatic brain injury (TBI) often presents as a range of neurobehavioural and emotional reactions rather than distinct disorders. This study adopted a transdiagnostic approach with the aim of identifying psychological processes common to depression, anxiety and global distress after TBI. Fifty participants with TBI (aged 19-66 years, 12-65 months post-injury) completed measures of threat appraisals and avoidance behaviour (Appraisal of Threat and Avoidance Questionnaire), self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale III), emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), negative self-focused attention (Self-Focus Sentence Completion) and emotional distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Brief Symptom Inventory). Significant correlations were found among the proposed transdiagnostic variables (rs = .29-.82, p < .05). A principal components analysis revealed two underlying factors: (1) Threats to Self, and (2) Emotion Dysregulation. Only the Emotion Dysregulation factor accounted for significant unique variance in levels of depression, anxiety and global distress (sr(2) = .12-.17). Such findings indicate the need for interventions to target difficulties in identifying and regulating emotions after TBI to facilitate emotional adjustment."

            "abstract": "Clinical studies examining the interaction between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stress-related disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) are often complicated by methodological constraints, such as heterogeneity in injury type and severity, time post-trauma, and predisposing risk factors. Developing relevant animal models whereby many variables can be efficiently controlled is thus essential to understanding this elusive relationship. Here, we use our repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm, in combination with our established mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), to assess the impact of repeated exposures to these paradigms on behavioral and neurobiological measures. C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to RUS and r-mTBI at 3 and 6 months of age followed by batteries of behavioral testing. Mice were euthanized 10 days and 3 months post-exposure, with brain and plasma samples collected for molecular profiling. The RUS paradigm involved exposure to a predator odor (trimethylthiazoline; TMT) while under restraint, daily unstable social housing, five inescapable footshocks on separate days, and chronic social isolation. Animals receiving r-mTBI ( × 5) and stress were exposed to a single closed-head injury 1 h after each footshock. Stress-alone mice showed significant weight loss, recall of traumatic memories, and anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behavior when compared with control mice. However, in stress+r-mTBI animals, the changes in cued fear memory, anxiety, and stress-coping tests were diminished, possibly due to TBI-induced hyperactivity. We also report complex brain molecular and neuropathological findings. Stress and r-mTBI, either individually or comorbidly, were associated with a chronic reduction in dendritic spine GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in the hippocampus. While stress augmented the r-mTBI-dependent astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, it mitigated r-mTBI-induced increases in hippocampal pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We anticipate that our model will be a good platform to untangle the complex comorbid pathophysiology in stress disorders and r-mTBI."

The experiment showed that the patients continued to experience elevated levels of sadness well beyond the point in time at which they had lost factual memory for the film clips. A second experiment using a happiness induction procedure yielded similar results, suggesting that both positive and negative emotional experiences can persist independent of explicit memory for the inducing event.

Furthermore, the magnitude of the associations for positive affect and for negative affect with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were not impacted by a mTBI diagnosis.

The spinal cord inflammatory response after the initial mechanical insult substantially impacts locomotor impairment and development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. However, these psychiatric events are scarcely investigated in females. This study investigated the anxiety/depression-like behaviours and inflammatory responses related to the production/release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in female adult Wistar rats submitted to severe clip-compression SCI. Data showed that SCI impaired the locomotor performance assessment by the BBB scale, but did not alter exploratory activity in open-field test. Animals' locomotor impairment was associated with anxious and depressive-like behaviours characterised by a decreased amount of time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze test, and the motivational reduction of social interaction and anhedonia assessed by social exploration and sucrose preference tests. By contrast, SCI decreased the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Moreover, SCI caused a significant increase in local and systemic proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1β, and IL-6) and a reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally, there were significant negative correlations between depression-like behaviour, but not anxiety, and increased plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and INF-γ. Additionally, the laminectomy procedure provoked the inflammatory response associated with reduced sucrose intake in Sham animals, although less expressively than in the SCI group. Collectively, these results indicate that SCI by clip-compression in female rats promotes a neuropsychiatric-like profile associated with an imbalance in the production/release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines."

APOEε4 allele of human Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for late onset AD and has been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy and unfavorable outcome following TBI. To determine if there is an APOE isoform-specific response to TBI we performed controlled cortical impact on 3-month-old mice expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms. Following injury, we used several behavior paradigms to test for anxiety and learning and found that APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate cognitive impairments following moderate TBI. Transcriptional profiling 14days following injury revealed a significant effect of TBI, which was similar in both genotypes. Significantly upregulated by injury in both genotypes were mRNA expression and protein level of ABCA1 transporter and APOJ, but not APOE. To identify gene-networks correlated to injury and APOE isoform, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. We determined that the network mostly correlated to TBI in animals expressing both isoforms is immune response with major hub genes including Trem2, Tyrobp, Clec7a and Cd68. We also found a significant increase of TREM2, IBA-1 and GFAP protein levels in the brains of injured mice.

Mechanism is likely to influence the type, severity, and chronicity of outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the severity and time course of behavioral outcomes following blast and rotational mTBI. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Rotational Injury model and a shock tube model of primary blast injury were used to induce mTBI in rats and behavioral assessments were conducted within the first week, as well as 30 and 60 days following injury. Acute recovery time demonstrated similar increases over protocol-matched shams, indicating acute injury severity equivalence between the two mechanisms. Post-injury behavior in the elevated plus maze demonstrated differing trends, with rotationally injured rats acutely demonstrating greater activity, whereas blast-injured rats had decreased activity that developed at chronic time points. Similarly, blast-injured rats demonstrated trends associated with cognitive deficits that were not apparent following rotational injuries. These findings demonstrate that rotational and blast injury result in behavioral changes with different qualitative and temporal manifestations. Whereas rotational injury was characterized by a rapidly emerging phenotype consistent with behavioral disinhibition, blast injury was associated with emotional and cognitive differences that were not evident acutely, but developed later, with an anxiety-like phenotype still present in injured animals at our most chronic measurements."

            "abstract": "Epidemiology studies have found that a comorbidity exists between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stress-related disorders. However, the anatomical and cellular bases for this association is poorly understood. An inability to extinguish the memory of a traumatic event lies at the core of many stress-related disorders. Experimental studies have shown that the medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC), especially the infralimbic (IL) cortex, is required for extinction and for storing the memory of extinction. The output from the central nucleus of amygdala projects to the lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, and central gray to regulate heart rate, stress hormone release, and freezing behavior, respectively. Projection neurons of the IL (layers II/III pyramidal neurons) are thought to stimulate GABAergic neurons in the amygdala, which, in turn, inhibit central amygdala output and reduce fear expression. Thus, loss and/or altered morphology of projection neurons of IL as a result of a mild TBI (mTBI) can compromise their ability to effectively inhibit the central amygdala, allowing the original fear memory to drive behavior. Using lateral mild fluid percussion injury (mFPI) in rats, we found that mFPI did not reduce neuronal numbers in the IL, but caused a significant reduction in overall dendritic spine density of both basal and apical dendrites on layer II/III pyramidal neurons. Spine numbers on layer V/VI pyramidal neurons were not significantly changed as a result of mFPI. The reduction in spine density on layer II/III pyramidal neurons we observed may diminish the efficacy of these neurons to inhibit the output of the central amygdala, thereby reducing the ability of the IL to suppress fear responses after extinction training. Consistent with this, mFPI rats display enhanced freezing behavior during and after extinction training as compared to sham-operated controls, although the ability to form contextual fear memories was not impaired. These results may have implications in stress-related disorders associated with mTBI."

            "abstract": "Deficits in serotonergic (5-HT-ergic) neurotransmission and stressful life events have been implicated in affective disorders, and chronic variable stress (CVS) can elicit behavioral changes reminiscent of increased emotionality, anxiety and atypical depression after partial 5-HT depletion. This study examined the effect of chronic citalopram treatment (10 mg/kg daily) on these changes. Parachloroamphetamine (PCA) (2 mg/kg) reduced the levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the frontal cortex, increased anxiety in the social interaction test, and increased activity in the open field. CVS reduced social activity in the social interaction test and immobility time in the forced swimming test. Reduction of excrements left during immobilization indicated partial adaptation with the CVS. Specific stressors had different effects on body weight gain, shorter lasting stressors having a smaller effect in general than those that lasted longer. Combination of CVS and PCA increased sucrose intake after two weeks of stress. In addition, combination of the two treatments reduced diving in the forced swimming test. Citalopram prevented the increase in sucrose consumption in the PCA+CVS rats, and in 5-HT-depleted animals blocked the increase in struggling and reduced the number of defecations in the forced swim test. In conclusion, citalopram treatment prevented several effects of either 5-HT depletion or combined PCA+CVS treatment, suggesting that these behavioral changes could be used in studies on the neural mechanisms underlying emotional behavior that may have relevance to the neurobiology of depression."

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are elevated in diabetes and AD and have been suggested to act as mediators of the cognitive decline observed in these pathologies. Methylglyoxal (MG) is an extremely reactive carbonyl compound that propagates glycation reactions and is, therefore, able to generate AGEs. Herein, we evaluated persistent behavioral and biochemical parameters to explore the hypothesis that elevated exogenous MG concentrations, induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion, lead to cognitive decline in Wistar rats. A high and sustained administration of MG (3μmol/μL; subdivided into 6days) was found to decrease the recognition index of rats, as evaluated by the object-recognition test. However, MG was unable to impair learning-memory processes, as shown by the habituation in the open field (OF) and Y-maze tasks. Moreover, a single high dose of MG induced persistent alterations in anxiety-related behavior, diminishing the anxiety-like parameters evaluated in the OF test. Importantly, MG did not alter locomotion behavior in the different tasks performed. Our biochemical findings support the hypothesis that MG induces persistent alterations in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex, related to glyoxalase 1 activity, AGEs content and glutamate uptake. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100B content, as well as S100B secretion (astroglial-related parameters of brain injury), were not altered by ICV MG administration. Taken together, our data suggest that MG interferes directly in brain function and that the time and the levels of exogenous MG determine the different features that can be seen in diabetic patients."

Estrogen treatment ameliorates hippocampal injury associated with global ischemia. Although much is known about the impact of estrogen on neuronal survival, relatively little is known about its impact on functional outcome assessed behaviorally. We investigated whether long-term estradiol (21-day pellets implanted 14 days prior to ischemia) or acute estradiol (50 microg infused into the lateral ventricles immediately after ischemia) attenuates ischemia-induced cell loss and improves visual and spatial working memory in ovariectomized female rats. Global ischemia significantly impaired visual and spatial memory, assessed by object recognition and object placement tests at 6-9 days. Global ischemia did not affect locomotion, exploration, or anxiety-related behaviors, assessed by an open-field test at 6 days. Long-term estradiol prevented the ischemia-induced deficit in visual working memory, maintaining normal performance in tests with retention intervals of up to 1 h. Long-term estradiol also prevented ischemia-induced deficits in spatial memory tests with short (1 and 7 min), but not longer (15 min), retention intervals. Acute estradiol significantly improved visual memory assessed with short retention intervals, but did not prevent deficits in spatial memory. Acute estradiol significantly increased the number of surviving CA1 neurons, assessed either at 7 days after ischemia or after the completion of behavioral testing 9 days after ischemia. In contrast, chronic estradiol did not reduce CA1 cell death 9 days after ischemia. Thus, long-term estradiol at near physiological levels and acute estradiol administered after ischemic insult improve functional recovery after global ischemia. These findings have important implications for intervention in the neurological sequellae associated with global ischemia."

This observational cohort study enrolled patients (n = 129) within 30 days of a diagnosed concussion. Patients completed Screening for Child Anxiety Related Disorders-Child Reports (SCARED-C), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Post-concussion Symptom Scale, neurocognitive testing, and Vestibular-Ocular Motor Screening. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the role of risk factors and clinical outcomes as predictors of mild (GAD-7 > 5) and moderate levels (GAD-7 > 10) of post-injury anxiety. Twenty-two percent (n = 28) of patients reported clinical levels of pre-injury anxiety, and 13% (n = 17) reported clinical levels of post-injury anxiety. The logistic regression model predicting mild or greater anxiety was significant (R2 = 31.7%; p < 0.001) and supported pre-injury panic symptoms (OR = 1.38) and total symptom severity (OR = 1.04) as the most robust predictors.

Furthermore, although the term postconcussive syndrome is commonly used clinically and in the scientific literature, it is not clear that postconcussive symptoms constitute a syndrome per se. Instead, it may be the case that the various symptoms that commonly co-occur after TBI are relatively independent consequences of a single neurological event. In other words, because the locations and severity of injury vary between individuals despite ostensibly similar injuries, it follows that there should be variations in symptom type and severity between individuals as well. This article reviews the sequelae and natural course of recovery from mild TBI, the evidence regarding both persistent postconcussive symptoms and the postconcussive syndrome, and outlines an approach to the assessment and treatment of individuals with these symptoms after TBI."

These injuries may result in long-term consequences, especially during this critical period of development. Insomnia and sleeping difficulties are frequently reported following RmTBI and greatly impair recovery. We sought to develop an animal model of exacerbated deficits following RmTBI by disrupting the hypothalamic circadian system. To accomplish this, we conducted RmTBI on adolescent rats that had received neonatal injections of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a known hypothalamic neurotoxin. We then examined behavioral, circadian, and epigenetic changes. MSG treated rats showed lower anxiety-like behaviors and displayed poor short-term working memory. We also showed changes in the morphology of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) immunostaining. VIP optical density in the SCN increased with MSG but decreased with RmTBI. There were changes in the expression of the clock genes and upregulation of the orexin receptors in response to RmTBI. MSG treated rats had longer telomere lengths than controls. Finally, although both MSG and RmTBI alone produced attenuated circadian amplitudes of activity and body temperature, exacerbated deficits were not identified in animals that received MSG and RmTBI. In sum, both MSG and RmTBI can alter behavior, circadian rhythm amplitude, SCN morphology, and gene expression independently, but the effects do not appear to be additive. Specific damage in the hypothalamus and SCN should be considered when patients experience sleeping problems following RmTBI, as this may improve therapeutic strategies."

However, outcome is difficult to predict due to significant individual variability, likely reflecting a complex interaction between injury- and child-related variables. Among these variables are genetically determined individual differences, which can modulate TBI outcome through their influence on neuroplasticity mechanisms. In this study, we examined the effect of Val66Met, a common polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene known to be involved in neuroplasticity mechanisms, on behavioral symptoms of mild TBI (mTBI) sustained in early childhood. This work is part of a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of early TBI. The current sample consisted of 145 children between ages 18 and 60 months assigned to one of three participant groups: mild TBI, orthopedic injury, or typically developing children. Participants provided a saliva sample to detect the presence of the Val66Met polymorphism, and the Child Behavior Checklist was used to document the presence of behavioral symptoms at 6- and 18-months post-injury. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, at 6 months post-injury, non-carriers of the Val66Met polymorphism in the mTBI group presented significantly more internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety/depression and somatic complaints) than Val66Met carriers, who were similar to orthopedically injured and typically developing children. However, at 18 months post-injury, all children with mTBI presented more internalizing symptoms, independent of genotype. The results of the study provide evidence for a protective effect of the Val66Met polymorphism on internalizing behavior symptoms 6 months after early childhood mTBI."

Adolescents show a high prevalence of sports-related head injuries and may be particularly vulnerable to rmTBIs due to ongoing brain maturation. However, it remains unclear whether rmTBIs, below the threshold for acute neuronal injury or symptomology, influence long-term outcomes. To address this issue, we first defined a very mild injury in adolescent mice (postnatal day 35) as evidenced by an increase in Iba-1- labeled microglia in white matter in the acutely injured brain, in the absence of indices of cell death, axonal injury, and vasogenic edema. Using this level of injury severity and Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol) as the anesthetic, we compared mice subjected to either a single mTBI or 2 rmTBIs, each separated by 48 h. Neurobehavioral assessments were conducted at 1 week and at 1 and 3 months postimpact. Mice subjected to rmTBIs showed transient anxiety and persistent and pronounced hypoactivity compared to sham control mice, alongside normal sensorimotor, cognitive, social, and emotional function. As isoflurane is more commonly used than Avertin in animal models of TBI, we next examined long-term outcomes after rmTBIs in mice that were anesthetized with this agent. However, there was no evidence of abnormal behaviors even with the addition of a third rmTBI. To determine whether isoflurane may be neuroprotective, we compared the acute pathology after a single mTBI in mice anesthetized with either Avertin or isoflurane. Pathological findings were more pronounced in the group exposed to Avertin compared to the isoflurane group. These collective findings reveal distinct behavioral phenotypes (transient anxiety and prolonged hypoactivity) that emerge in response to rmTBIs. Our findings further suggest that selected anesthetics may confer early neuroprotection after rmTBIs, and as such mask long-term abnormal phenotypes that may otherwise emerge as a consequence of acute pathogenesis."

            "abstract": "Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8 d, but generally less than 14 d, after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-mo-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 h. We previously demonstrated that theta burst-evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP)-a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity-is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 d after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)-the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP-are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity."

To assess early mTBI effects on cortical functional and structural components of emotion processing, we assessed cortical activation to fearful faces within the first 2 weeks after motor vehicle collision (MVC) in survivors who did and did not experience mTBI. We also examined the thicknesses of cortical regions with altered activation. MVC survivors with mTBI (n = 21) had significantly less activation in left superior parietal gyrus (SPG) (-5.9, -81.8, 33.8; p = 10-3.623), left medial orbitofrontal gyrus (mOFG) (-4.7, 36.1, -19.3; p = 10-3.231), and left and right lateral orbitofrontal gyri (lOFG) (left: -16.0, 41.4, -16.6; p = 10-2.573; right: 18.7, 22.7, -17.7; p = 10-2.764) than MVC survivors without mTBI (n = 23). SPG activation in mTBI survivors within 2 weeks after MVC was negatively correlated with subsequent post-traumatic stress symptom severity at 3 months (r = -0.68, p = 0.03). Finally, the SPG region was thinner in the mTBI survivors than in the non-mTBI survivors (F = 11.07, p = 0.002). These results suggest that early differences in activation and structure in cortical emotion processing circuits in trauma survivors who sustain mTBI may contribute to the development of emotion-related symptoms."

            "abstract": "Approximately 10-15 % of people that sustain mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) develop post-concussive syndrome (PCS). PCS is a complex array of symptoms that can result in physical, cognitive and emotional impairments. Following mTBI, there are also complex changes in the oxidative stress system and engagement of the inflammatory system, within the brain. Diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2 is an organoselenium compound which can play a role in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. (PhSe)2 also has many interesting properties including anti-anxiety, anti-depressant and anti-nociception effects. We sought to determine if treatment with (PhSe)2 following repetitive mTBI could have mitigating effects on PCS. To investigate this, we induced mTBI or sham injuries using our lateral impact device in adolescent male and female Sprague Dawley rats and an hour later injected rats with vehicle, 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg (PhSe)2 i.p. Next, we conducted a behavioral assessment designed to assess PCS and then euthanized the animals to examine changes in gene expression and telomere length. (PhSe)2 decreased the time to cross the beam, distance travelled and time spent in the centre of the open field, time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, the time investigating both objects in the novel context mismatch and time immobile in the forced swim. This anxiety-like symptomology resolved spontaneously between 10 and 12 days after the third mTBI. We found (PhSe)2 groups showed increased levels of TNF alpha and longer telomeres. We also found higher levels of GPX1 in the injured animals. Our results show that (PhSe)2 exacerbates anxiety-like symptomology in contrast to previous findings."

            "abstract": "The mediators of tissue damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) such as antibodies, cytokines and activated immune cells have direct access to most organs in the body but must penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to gain access to brain tissue. We hypothesized that compromise of the BBB occurs episodically such that the brain will acquire tissue damage slowly and not at the same rate as other organs. On the basis of these assumptions, we wished to determine if duration of disease correlated with brain injury, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and if this was independent of degree of tissue damage in other organs. We investigated differences in brain activation patterns using fMRI in 13 SLE patients stratified by disease duration of ≤2 years (short-term [ST]) or ≥10 years (long-term [LT]). Two fMRI paradigms were selected to measure working memory and emotional response (fearful faces task). Performance in the working memory task was significantly better in the ST group for one and two shape recall; however, both groups did poorly with three shape recall. Imaging studies demonstrated significantly increased cortical activation in the ST group in regions associated with cognition during the two shape retention phase of the working memory task (P < 0.001) and increased amygdala (P < 0.05) and superior parietal (P < 0.01) activation in response to the fearful faces paradigm. In conclusion, analysis of activation patterns stratified by performance accuracy, differences in co-morbid disease, corticosteroid doses or disease activity suggests that these observed differences are attributable to SLE effects on the central nervous system exclusive of vascular disease or other confounding influences. Our hypothesis is further supported by the lack of correlation between regional brain abnormalities on fMRI and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) damage index."

Asphyxia was induced by immersing foetuses-containing uterine horns, removed from ready-to-deliver rats into a water bath at 37 degrees C for 20 min. Caesarean-delivered siblings were used as controls. Saline or nicotinamide (0.8 mmol/kg, i.p.) was administered to control and asphyxia-exposed animals 24, 48, and 72 h after birth. The animals were examined for morphological changes in hippocampus, focusing on delayed cell death and mossy fibre sprouting, and behaviour, focusing on cognitive behaviour and anxiety. At the age of 30-45 days, asphyxia-exposed rats displayed (1) increased apoptosis, assessed in whole hippocampus by nuclear Hoechst staining, and (2) increased mossy fibre sprouting, restricted to the stratum oriens of dorsal hippocampus, assessed by Timm's staining.

The self- and informant-report PFAB-TBI scores were moderately correlated (r = 0.51, p < 0.001). Neither measure demonstrated floor or ceiling effects. Both had strong internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.87 and 0.89, respectively). The PFAB-TBI self-report was positively correlated with somatic symptoms (r = 0.37), emotional distress (r = 0.39), and negatively associated with quality of life (r = -0.57). The PFAB-TBI informant-report was positively associated with informant reported somatic symptoms (r = 0.52) and emotional distress (r = .50) Overall, the PFAB-TBI has desirable basic measurement properties and expected correlations with clinical outcomes.

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can cause severe long-term cognitive and emotional deficits, including impaired memory, depression, and persevering fear, but the neuropathological basis of these deficits is uncertain. As medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus play important roles in memory and emotion, we used multi-site, multi-electrode recordings of oscillatory neuronal activity in local field potentials (LFPs) in awake, head-fixed mice to determine if the functioning of these regions was abnormal after mTBI, using a closed-skull focal cranial blast model. We evaluated mPFC, hippocampus CA1, and primary somatosensory/visual cortical areas (S1/V1). Although mTBI did not alter the power of oscillations, it did cause increased coherence of θ (4-10 Hz) and β (10-30 Hz) oscillations within mPFC and S1/V1, reduced CA1 sharp-wave ripple (SWR)-evoked LFP activity in mPFC, downshifted SWR frequencies in CA1, and enhanced θ-γ phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) within mPFC. These abnormalities might be linked to the impaired memory, depression, and persevering fear seen after mTBI. Treatment with the cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptor inverse agonist SMM-189 has been shown to mitigate functional deficits and neuronal injury after mTBI in mice. We found that SMM-189 also reversed most of the observed neurophysiological abnormalities. This neurophysiological rescue is likely to stem from the previously reported reduction in neuron loss and/or the preservation of neuronal function and connectivity resulting from SMM-189 treatment, which appears to stem from the biasing of microglia from the proinflammatory M1 state to the prohealing M2 state by SMM-189."

Adolescent male and female rats (35 days old) were subjected to mild TBI and evaluated for anxiety- and depression-like behaviors using the elevated plus maze and forced swim test (FST), respectively, and cellular alterations. Injured brains did not exhibit an overt lesion, atrophy of tissue or astrocytic reactivity underneath the impact site at 6-week post-injury, suggestive of the mild nature of trauma. Neither male nor female brain-injured rats exhibited anxiety-like behavior at 2 or 6 weeks, regardless of estrous phase at the time of behavior testing. Brain-injured male rats did not exhibit any alterations in immobility, swimming and climbing times in the FST compared to sham-injured rats at either 2- or 6-week post-injury. Brain-injured female rats did, however, exhibit an increase in immobility (in the absence of changes in swimming and climbing times) in the FST at 6 weeks post-injury only during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle, suggestive of a depression-like phenotype. Combined administration of the estrogen receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, and the progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone, during proestrus was able to prevent the depression-like phenotype observed during estrus. Taken together, these data suggest that female rats may be more vulnerable to exhibiting behavioral deficits following mild TBI and that estrous phase may play a role in depression-like behavior."

Typically, sport-related CTE occurs in a retired athlete with or without a history of concussion(s) who presents with a constellation of cognitive, mood, and/or behavioral symptoms and who has postmortem findings of tau deposition within the brain. There are many confounding variables, however, that can account for brain tau deposition, including genetic mutations, drugs, normal aging, environmental factors, postmortem brain processing, and toxins. To understand the roles of such factors in neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in athletes, this article reviews some neurodegenerative diseases that may present with similar findings in nonathletes. The article also reviews pathological changes identified with normal aging, and reviews the pathological findings of CTE in light of all these factors. While many of these athletes have a history of exposure to head impacts as a part of contact sport, there is insufficient evidence to establish causation between sports concussion and CTE.

Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has demonstrated some sensitivity to changes in white matter following mTBI, recent studies have suggested that more complex geometric models of diffusion, including the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model, may be more sensitive and specific. Here, we evaluate microstructural changes in white matter following mTBI using DTI and NODDI in a mouse model, and compare the time course of these changes to behavioral impairment and recovery. We also assess volumetric changes for a comprehensive picture of the structural alterations in the brain and histological staining to identify cellular changes that may contribute to the differences detected in the imaging data. Increased orientation dispersion index (ODI) was observed in the optic tracts of mTBI mice compared with shams. Changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) were not statistically significant. Volume deficits were detected in the optic tract as well as in several gray matter regions: the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the entorhinal cortex, and the superior colliculi. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) staining was increased in the optic tracts of mTBI brains, and this staining correlated with ODI values. A transient impairment in working memory was observed, which resolved by 6 weeks, whereas increased ODI, GFAP, and Iba1 persisted to 18 weeks post-injury. We conclude that the optic tracts are particularly vulnerable to damage from the closed-skull impact model used in this study, and that ODI may be a more sensitive metric to this damage than FA. Differences in ODI and in histological measures of astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and axonal degeneration persist beyond behavioral impairment in this model."

Baill. which is a functional food) against chronic liver injury in mice.Methods: Chronic liver injury was induced by the treatment of d-galactose (d-GaIN, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) for 8 weeks.Results: Administration of schizandrin (30 mg/kg, i.g.) significantly ameliorated d-GaIN-induced anxiety and depression-like behavior as evident from the results of open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. In addition, schizandrin remarkably reduced the oxidative stress due to its potential to enhance the levels of decreased CAT, GSH/GSSG, SOD, and increased MDA in peripheral and brain, the antioxidant activities might be related with the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Furthermore, schizandrin could dramatically inhibit the neuroinflammation in mice by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) through regulating NF-κB/NLRP3/Iba-1 signaling. Besides, the elevated levels of ammonia, AST, and ALT were significantly reduced by schizandrin.Conclusion: The present data revealed that hyperammonemia produced due to liver injury-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex resulting in anxiety and depression were improved by schizandrin."

Unlike in military or sports-related assessment, in general civilian settings pre-injury levels of concussion-like symptoms are lacking. Normative data are available in adolescent and college populations, but no reference data exist to guide clinical adult explorations. The purpose of this study was to use the second edition of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT2) to profile a cohort of 60 healthy community volunteers who had not sustained a head injury. Participating volunteers underwent MRI scanning and were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants reported a median of 3 concussion-like symptoms and the 97.5 percentile score was found at 10.5 symptoms, out of a total of 22. The median severity score was 4.9 points, and 28.9 was the upper limit of the reference interval. Only 10 participants (16.7%) did not endorse any symptom. The most frequently endorsed symptom was feeling difficulty in concentrating, with 41.7% of the sample reporting it. Age, sex and general distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were not associated with concussion-like symptoms. Our data yielded elevated cut-offs scores for both the number of symptoms and the symptom severity. In conclusion, postconcussive-like symptoms are frequent in the general non-concussed adult population and it should be taken into account in any future models developed for screening patients at risk of developing physical, cognitive, and psychological complaints following mild traumatic injury."

However, there exists a paucity of articles on the management of patients following failed scalp replantation attempts. The authors recognize numerous stressors that affect these patients, including the inciting traumatic event, hospitalizations, multiple surgical interventions, postsurgical therapies, and disfigurement caused by non-hair-bearing scalp. Thus, as part of the medical management for scalp replant patients, one must address the psychological factors surrounding the medical management. Over the past 25 years, the authors have experienced four cases of scalp replant failures, each posing an opportunity to examine the postoperative course of these patients. Symptoms ranging from mild anxiety to depressive symptoms have been observed in all of these patients. In fact, patient symptoms often satisfied the criteria for major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. The authors recognize the importance of informing patients and their families of the immediate and potential long-term complications following an unsuccessful scalp replant attempt. The authors advise that all patients be provided immediate psychiatric evaluation and, if necessary, counseling and medication therapy, regardless of scalp replantation outcome."

However, lack of appropriate comparison groups has clouded interpretation of the chronic effects of these conditions. The present study evaluated the neuropsychological, psychiatric/neurobehavioral, and functional outcomes associated with mTBI and PTSD in a well-characterized sample of combat-exposed Veterans. Method: Participants included 73 Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans (91.8% male; age: M = 34.00, SD = 6.39) divided into four groups: mTBI-only (n = 23), PTSD-only (n = 14), comorbid mTBI + PTSD (n = 19), and combat-control (CC; n = 17). Participants were administered a neuropsychological assessment and completed questionnaires assessing psychiatric/neurobehavioral symptoms and functional outcomes. Results: Kruskal-Wallis H-tests showed no group differences across measures of neuropsychological functioning; however, there were significant differences across groups on all psychiatric/neurobehavioral variables examined. In general, the comorbid and PTSD-only groups endorsed the most severe symptoms, followed by the mTBI-only and CC groups, respectively. As for functional outcomes, the comorbid and PTSD-only groups had higher rates of service-connection disability and greater perceived decline in work and education-related abilities, relative to the mTBI-only and CC groups, despite similar proportions of Veterans employed or in school in each group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that Veterans with comorbid mTBI + PTSD and PTSD alone are at greatest risk for experiencing long-lasting subjective distress, including negative perceptions of their ability to work or pursue an education, despite being comparable to mTBI-only and CC Veterans on objective measures of functioning.

Results provide general support for the idea that children sustaining a TBI exhibit deficits in emotional prosody and face emotion recognition performance. Further, although some gains were noted in the TBI group over the two-years following injury, factors such as SES and age at injury influenced the trajectory of recovery. The current findings indicate the relationship between TBI and emotion recognition is complex and may be influenced by a number of developmental and environmental factors.

Animals were subjected to chronic restraint stress (3 h/day for 21 days) to induce a depressive-like model. Sericin was administered at different doses (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day, gavage for 21 days) along with immobilization. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were performed to assess anxiety; while, the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were implemented to evaluate depressive-like behaviors. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and markers of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated in the PFC and HIP regions. Moreover, serum levels of corticosterone were measured. Results showed that sericin increased number of central entries in OFT and prolonged time spent in open arms of EPM apparatus, while it reduced immobility time in TST and FST. Moreover, sericin treatments decreased oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels, restored MMP, and enhanced total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and enzyme activity of GPx and SOD in both brain regions. Furthermore, sericin reduced serum corticosterone concentration and suppressed neuroinflammatory response in the HIP and PFC, shown by decreased NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β protein levels. Finally, sericin inhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway through down-regulation of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and -3, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. These findings provide evidence for the protective effect of sericin therapy against psychopathological and behavioral changes induced by restraint stress."

            "abstract": "There is growing awareness that repeated mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) can cause deficits in learning and memory performance, however there is still a paucity of preclinical data identifying the extent of these deficits. Epidemiological data shows that juveniles are at high risk to sustain r-mTBI, and these injuries may cause significant changes in cognitive abilities, as they occur during a period where the brain is still maturing. This is particularly true for the hippocampus, a brain region important for learning and memory processes. R-mTBI during the juvenile period may disrupt functional capacity of the hippocampus, and thus the normal development of cognitive processes associated with this structure. To examine this issue we used a model of awake closed head injury (ACHI) and administered 8 impacts over a 4 day period to juvenile male and female rats (P25-28). A neurological assessment was preformed after each impact, and anxiety and learning related behaviours were examined 1 and 7 days after the last impact. Our results indicate that r-mTBI was associated with sensorimotor deficits in the acute phase immediately after each procedure. R-mTBI also reduced the capacity for hippocampal-dependent learning for at least 7 days post-injury, but did not result in any long-lasting changes in anxiety-related behaviours."

            "abstract": "Residual emotional and behavioral difficulties in individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been well documented in the literature. The issues are complex, interdependent, and often include substance abuse, depression, anxiety, chronic suicidal or homicidal ideation, poor impulse control, and significant degrees of frustration and anger. Often, preexisting psychological conditions and poor coping strategies are exacerbated by the trauma. Emotional and behavioral difficulties can interfere with the neurorehabilitation process at all levels. In acute rehabilitation, these issues have traditionally been addressed on an individual basis. However, in postacute settings, an interpersonal group format can be effectively implemented. The majority of individuals with TBI have minimal funding for long-term cognitive and behavioral remediation; often the only avenue available is support groups. This article will describe group psychotherapy models used with individuals with acute or postacute TBI within a comprehensive rehabilitation center. Interdisciplinary treatment of frustration and substance abuse and a continuum of care will be emphasized. Education, social support, skills development, interpersonal process, and cognitive-behavioral approaches will also be discussed. The psychotherapy groups focus on treatment of substance abuse and frustration management through education, social support, and development of interpersonal skills. Practical considerations of running such groups are presented."

            "abstract": "Background. Identifying which patients are most likely to be at risk of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a difficult clinical challenge. Objectives. To examine the relationship between pain catastrophizing, defined as the exaggerated negative appraisal of a pain experience, and early MTBI outcome. Methods. This cross-sectional design included 58 patients diagnosed with a MTBI. In addition to medical chart review, postconcussion symptoms were assessed by self-report at 1 month (Time 1) and 8 weeks (Time 2) after MTBI. Pain severity, psychological distress, level of functionality, and pain catastrophizing were measured by self-report at Time 2. Results. The pain catastrophizing subscales of rumination, magnification, and helplessness were significantly correlated with pain severity (r = .31 to .44), number of postconcussion symptoms reported (r = .35 to .45), psychological distress (r = .57 to .67), and level of functionality (r = -.43 to -.29). Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly higher for patients deemed to be at high risk of postconcussion syndrome (6 or more symptoms reported at both Time 1 and Time 2). Conclusions. Higher levels of pain catastrophizing were related to adverse early MTBI outcomes. The early detection of pain catastrophizing may facilitate goal-oriented interventions to prevent or minimize the development of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms."

            "abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression are frequent and persistent complaints following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Modeling these symptoms in animal models of TBI affords the opportunity to determine mechanisms underlying behavioral pathologies and to test potential therapeutic agents. However, testing these symptoms in animal models of TBI has yielded inconsistent results. The goal of the current study was to employ a battery of tests to measure multiple anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms following TBI in C57BL/6J mice, and to determine if male and female mice are differentially affected by the injury. Following controlled cortical impact (CCI) at a parietal location, neither male nor female mice showed depressive-like symptoms as measured by the Porsolt forced-swim test and sucrose preference test. Conclusions regarding anxiety-like behaviors were dependent upon the assay employed; CCI-induced thigmotaxis in the open field suggested an anxiogenic effect of the injury; however, results from the elevated zero maze, light-dark box, and marble-burying tests indicated that CCI reduced anxiety-like behaviors. Fewer anxiety-like behaviors were also associated with the female sex. Increased levels of activity were also measured in female mice and injured mice in these tests, and conclusions regarding anxiety should be taken with caution when experimental manipulations induce changes in baseline activity. These results underscore the irreconcilability of results from studies attempting to model TBI-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms. Changes in injury models or better attempts to replicate the clinical syndrome may improve the translational applicability of rodent models of TBI-induced anxiety and depression."

However, few studies have systematically investigated the association between PCS and clinical outcomes in mTBI patients. Therefore, the present study attempted to examine PCS during the disease course and to determine whether PCS adversely affect outcome.\n## METHODS\nThis was a prospective, cohort and controlled study of 115 mTBI patients. The PCS checklist was used to identify PCS and the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended were used to investigate clinical outcomes. All patients were evaluated four times: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the injury.\n## RESULTS\nPhysical symptoms such as dizziness and headache were prominent in the early after injury stage (1 and 2 weeks). On the other hand, the psychosocial symptoms, such as depression and irritability, were significant at the late after injury stage (4 and 8 weeks). Dizziness adversely affected clinical outcome at both the early and late stages of the disease, whereas the impact of intracranial lesions and depression on outcome was greatest early and late, respectively.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results show that PCS during the disease course and the relationship between PCS and clinical outcome can be systematically evaluated. In fact, different postconcussion symptom domains should be monitored while the disease is progressing.\n"

The advantages of phenomenological study were that it allows flexibility to explore and understand meanings attached by people to well-studied concepts such as coping, resiliency, and adaptation or compensation. Phenomenological study was sensitive to contextual factors. It also permitted the study of in-depth dynamics of coping and adaptive strategies of TBI survivors and primary caregivers, while understanding the social and psychological implications of the phenomenon.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To explore the needs and deficits of adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors and primary caregivers; and to identify their self-initiated coping and adaptive strategies. Significant to this study was the development of coping and adaptive strategies by the participants after their discharge from inpatient and rehabilitation treatment. The compensatory skills taught in treatment settings did not transfer to the home environment. Therefore, these strategies developed independently from previous treatment recommendations contributed to the development of theory related to rehabilitation and counseling.

TBI associated cognitive impairments may pose an obstacle to development of a strong working alliance, on which therapeutic gains depend. The current study examined the association of demographic (i.e., gender, age at study entry, years of education and premorbid IQ) and injury-related (i.e., years since injury, post-trauma amnesia duration, memory and executive functioning test performance) variables with alliance in CBT adapted for TBI (CBT-ABI). The audio-recordings of 177 CBT-ABI sessions from 31 participants were assessed with an observer version of the Working Alliance Inventory at nine time-points. Multi-level mixed model regressions showed that participants and therapists maintained a relatively strong alliance across all sessions. Pre-intervention symptom severity was considered as a confounder variable and was found to have no statistically significant influence on the models. None of the demographic variables were significantly associated with alliance scores. More years since injury was associated with a stronger alliance. These findings demonstrate that TBI associated cognitive impairments do not necessarily pose an obstacle to development and maintenance of a strong working alliance, which is more likely to develop with more time post-brain injury."

However, the mechanisms underlying a potential relationship between brain integrity and mood remain unclear. The current study is aimed at examining the association between amygdala shape, mood state, and postconcussion symptoms in collegiate football players. Thirty members of 1 football team completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the postconcussion symptom scale (PCSS), and an MRI protocol during preseason camp. T1-weighted images were acquired and three-dimensional amygdala and probabilistic maps were created for shape analysis. Correlation analyses between POMS and PCSS and the relationship between POMS and amygdala shape were completed. In the amygdala, the left laterobasal subregion showed a positive relationship with the POMS total score and subscales scores. No significant relationship between PCSS and amygdala shape was found. Significant positive correlations were found between POMS subscales and PCSS. These results indicate that amygdala structure may be more closely associated with negative mood states than postconcussion symptoms. These findings suggest that premorbid individual differences in effect may provide critical insight into the relationship between negative mood and outcomes in collegiate football players with SRC."

A sample of 109 participants (52 mTBI and 57 healthy controls) completed a PCS symptom checklist, a cognitive complaint measure, and measures of information processing speed, attention, memory, executive function, depression and anxiety.Main Outcomes and Results:In the healthy control group, cognitive complaint was significantly associated with objective cognitive performance and was not associated with psychological status. In contrast, PCS endorsement was unrelated to objective cognition but was associated with psychological status. For the mTBI group, neither PCS endorsement nor cognitive complaint was associated with cognitive performance, but both measures were associated with psychological status.Conclusions:This study indicates that neither cognitive nor PCS symptom measures are reliable indicators of underlying cognitive function in the post-acute period after mTBI. Further, suffering an mTBI may affect the linear relationship that exists between cognitive symptom endorsement and cognitive function in healthy adults."

            "abstract": "Sepsis commonly results in acute and chronic brain dysfunction, which dramatically increases the morbidity associated with this common disease. Chronic brain dysfunction in animal models of sepsis survival is linked to persistent neuroinflammation and expression of multiple cytokines. However, we have found previously that microglia predominantly upregulate the damage associated molecule S100A8/A9 after sepsis. In this article, we show that S100A8/A9 is increased in the brains of patients who died of sepsis and that S100A8 is expressed in astrocytes and myeloid cells. Using a mouse model of sepsis survival, we show that S100A8/A9 is persistently expressed in the brain after sepsis. S100A9 expression is necessary for recruitment of neutrophils to the brain and for priming production of reactive oxygen species and TNF-α secretion in microglia and macrophages. However, despite improving these indices of chronic inflammation, S100A9 deficiency results in worsened anxiety-like behavior 2 wk after sepsis. Taken together, these results indicate that S100A8/A9 contributes to several facets of neuroinflammation in sepsis survivor mice, including granulocyte recruitment and priming of microglial-reactive oxygen species and cytokine production, and that these processes may be protective against anxiety behavior in sepsis survivors."

Voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) was computed with the T1-weighted images of 48 uncomplicated mTBI patients and 37 orthopedic controls. Over the period from 6 weeks to 12 months, only patients who experienced uncomplicated mTBI, but not control participants, showed significant GM decrease predominantly in the right hemisphere along the GM-CSF border in lateral and medial portions of the sensorimotor cortex extending into the rolandic operculum, middle frontal gyrus, insula, and temporal pole. Additionally, only mTBI patients, but not controls, experienced significant WM decrease predominantly in the right hemisphere in the superior fasciculus longitudinalis, arcuate fasciculus, and cortical-pontine tracts as well as a significant WM increase in left arcuate fasciculus and left capsula extrema. We did not observe any significant change in the controls for the same time interval or any significant group differences in GM and WM probability at each of the two timepoints.

The results show that FMNT administration significantly reduces anxiety-like behavior but does not affect the nociceptive threshold in CFA-injected mice. The treatment reverses the upregulation of NMDA, GluA1, and GABAA receptors, as well as PSD95 and CREB in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The effects of FMNT on NMDA receptors and CREB binding protein (CBP) were further confirmed by the potential structure combination between these compounds, which was analyzed by in silico docking technology. FMNT also inhibits the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and microglia in the BLA of mice suffering from chronic inflammatory pain. Therefore, the anxiolytic effects of FMNT are partially due to the attenuation of inflammation and neuronal hyperexcitability through the inhibition of NMDA receptor and CBP in the BLA."

            "abstract": "This study investigated unawareness of memory loss in 48 severe closed-head injury patients. Awareness was measured as the correlation of patients' memory test scores with their self-ratings on the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ). Patients who endorsed atypical memory failures on the EMQ were classified as invalid responders. Invalid responders had poorer memory test performances and a higher rate of focal left hemispheric lesions, but did not report greater emotional symptoms. Correlations between memory test scores and memory self-ratings were weaker among invalid responders or those classified as depressed, and stronger among valid responders, especially those classified as non-depressed. The results indicate that the validity of memory self-reports is influenced by both neurogenic and psychogenic factors, and suggest that invalid responding is an important problem with self-reports by brain-injured patients."

            "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in American football players has garnered increasing public attention following reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive tauopathy. While the mechanisms underlying repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-induced neurodegeneration are unknown and antemortem diagnostic tests are not available, neuropathology studies suggest a pathogenic role for microvascular injury, specifically blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Thus, our main objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI approach we have developed to detect impairments in brain microvascular function. To this end, we scanned 42 adult male amateur American football players and a control group comprising 27 athletes practicing a non-contact sport and 26 non-athletes. MRI scans were also performed in 51 patients with brain pathologies involving the blood-brain barrier, namely malignant brain tumours, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic traumatic contusion. Based on data from prolonged scans, we generated maps that visualized the permeability value for each brain voxel. Our permeability maps revealed an increase in slow blood-to-brain transport in a subset of amateur American football players, but not in sex- and age-matched controls. The increase in permeability was region specific (white matter, midbrain peduncles, red nucleus, temporal cortex) and correlated with changes in white matter, which were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging. Additionally, increased permeability persisted for months, as seen in players who were scanned both on- and off-season. Examination of patients with brain pathologies revealed that slow tracer accumulation characterizes areas surrounding the core of injury, which frequently shows fast blood-to-brain transport. Next, we verified our method in two rodent models: rats and mice subjected to repeated mild closed-head impact injury, and rats with vascular injury inflicted by photothrombosis. In both models, slow blood-to-brain transport was observed, which correlated with neuropathological changes. Lastly, computational simulations and direct imaging of the transport of Evans blue-albumin complex in brains of rats subjected to recurrent seizures or focal cerebrovascular injury suggest that increased cellular transport underlies the observed slow blood-to-brain transport. Taken together, our findings suggest dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI can be used to diagnose specific microvascular pathology after traumatic brain injury and other brain pathologies."

However, there was substantial variability in individual symptom trajectories over time. The majority of participants had symptom trajectories classified as either 'persistent' (∼32-55%) or 'asymptomatic' (∼30-36%), with a substantial minority classified as 'improved' (∼7-12%) or 'developed' (∼7-19%). Factors associated with 'persistent' PCD trajectories included cognitive complaints, PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain, and headaches at baseline; but not the presence/absence of MTBI. Factors associated with 'developed' PCD trajectories included PTSD and the number of lifetime exposures to blast. Conclusions: Reporting of 'new' PCSx over time was common in individuals with and without MTBI.

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often a result of traffic accidents, contact sports or battlefield explosions. A mild form of traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is frequently underestimated, as the immediate physical symptoms decrease rapidly and conventional neuroimaging studies often do not show visible evidence of brain lesions. However, cognitive impairments persist for weeks, months or even years after the incident. Endogenous opioids were documented to play a role in thmodulation of mTBI pathology, whereas exogenous opioids were shown to possess neuroprotective properties. In the present study, biphalin, a dimeric enkephalin analog, improved cognitive performance in the Morris Water Maze and Novel Object Recognition tests in a mouse weight-drop model of mTBI. The effect of a single systemic injection of 10 mg/kg biphalin immediately after trauma was reversed by naltrexone, suggesting an opioid receptor-mediated mechanism. Biphalin also reduced cortical and hippocampal neurodegeneration, as shown by silver staining. Our data indicates that opioid receptor activation by biphalin may provide neuroprotection of post-traumatic neurodegeneration processes and may protect against memory impairments."

The aim of this narrative review is to describe sub-concussion and the current understanding of short and long term effects of repeated minor impacts that have been found to occur in human and animal models. Here, potential mechanisms for cognitive dysfunction following sub-concussion and recommend directions for future research are discussed. The Potential mechanisms of injuries resulting from sub-concussion such as changes in blood brain barrier integrity, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, and oxidative stress damage, among other changes in central nervous system function vary considerably making understanding of the underlying causative mechanism challenging for researchers. Some evidence suggests a link between impaired cerebrovascular function and cognitive impairment which poses a potential mechanism linking the two.

Moreover, over the past years, compelling medical and technological improvements have allowed an even older patients' population, with several comorbidities, to be treated with cardiac surgery; however, the risk of brain injury after such interventions is also increased in these patients. With the aim of improving post-operative neurological outcome, a variety of neuromonitoring methods and devices have been introduced in clinical practice. These techniques allow the assessment of a number of parameters, such as cerebral blood flow, brain embolic events, cerebral cortical activity, depth of anesthesia and brain oxygenation. Some of them have been used to optimize the hemodynamic management of such patients and to select specific therapeutic interventions. Also, various pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have been proposed to minimize the incidence of brain injury in this setting.

Logistic regression (complete vs incomplete RTW) demonstrated that apart from previously identified predictors such as demographics (e.g., age and education) and injury characteristics (e.g., cause and severity of injury) and indicators of psychological distress, occupational factors were of influence on work resumption after 6 months (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82), At 12 months, however, the model was based solely on the presence of extracranial injuries and indicators of maladaptation after injury (AUC = 0.81).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      RTW after mTBI is a gradual process, with varying levels of RTW throughout the first year after injury. Different predictors were relevant for short- vs long-term work resumption, with occupational factors influencing short-term RTW. However, for both short- and long-term RTW, posttraumatic complaints and signs of psychological distress early after injury were relevant predictors, allowing early identification of patients at risk for problematic work resumption."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy as a result of neuronal phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein aggregation and neuroinflammation. Acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) may also contribute to post-TBI neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that Asm inhibition would ameliorate p-tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, and behavioral changes after TBI in a murine model. TBI was generated using a weight-drop method. Asm inhibition in wild-type mice was achieved with a single injection of amitriptyline 1 h after TBI. Genetic Asm ablation was achieved using Asm-deficient mice (Asm-/-). Thirty days after TBI, mice underwent behavioral testing with the forced swim test for symptoms of depression or were euthanized for neurohistological analysis. Neuroinflammation was quantified using the microglial markers, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 and transmembrane protein 119. Compared to sham mice, TBI mice demonstrated increased hippocampal p-tau. Mice that received amitriptyline after TBI demonstrated decreased p-tau compared to mice that received a saline control. Further, post-TBI Asm-/- mice demonstrated lower levels of p-tau compared to wild-type mice. Though a decrease in neuroinflammation was observed at 1 month post-TBI, no change was demonstrated with mice treated with amitriptyline. Similarly, TBI mice were more likely to show depression compared to mice that received amitriptyline after TBI. Utilizing a weight-drop method to induce moderate TBI, we have shown that genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of Asm prevented hippocampal p-tau aggregation 1 month after injury as well as decreased symptoms of depression. These findings highlight an opportunity to potentially reduce the long-term consequences of TBI."

            "abstract": "The consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during late adolescence (7 weeks old) on spontaneous object recognition memory and on anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze were tested in rats during adulthood. Testing took place at 2 different postinjury times, in separate groups: 3 and 6 weeks, when animals were 10 and 13 weeks old, respectively. The rats were either submitted to controlled cortical impact injury, an experimental model of focal TBI with contusion, or were sham-operated. TBI animals failed to remember the familiar object and had a significantly lower performance than sham-operated animals, indicating memory disruption, when the retention delay was 24 hr, but not when it was 3 hr. TBI did not have any significant effect on the main anxiety-related behaviors, but it reduced time in the central platform of the elevated plus maze. The effects of TBI on memory and on anxiety-like behaviors were similar at the 2 postinjury times. In both TBI and sham-operated groups, animals tested 6 weeks after surgery had lower anxiety-related indices than those tested at 3 weeks, an effect that might be indicative of reduced anxiety levels with increasing age. In summary, focal TBI with contusion sustained during late adolescence led to object recognition memory deficits in a 24-hr test during adulthood but did not have a major impact on anxiety-like behaviors. Memory deficits persisted for at least 6 weeks after injury, indicating that spontaneous modifications of these functional disturbances did not take place along this time span."

Intrahippocampal KA also results in sustained status epilepticus and continuous high frequency oscillations in the electroencephalograph (EEG), although subsequent behavioral side effects are unknown. We hypothesized that retigabine, a recently discovered anticonvulsant and potent positive modulator of Kv7 channels, may attenuate seizure-induced behavioral abnormalities. Status epilepticus was induced by administration of KA either intraperitoneally (15 mg/kg) or by single intrahippocampal injection (1.0 μg/0.5 μL). After 24 h, half of systemically KA-treated animals that reached stage 6 seizures were injected once daily with retigabine (5 mg/kg) for 14 continuous days. All groups underwent three behavioral tests--capture and handling, open field, and elevated plus maze--24 h following the last retigabine treatment and were sacrificed at 25-28 days. In the capture and handling test, systemic KA treatment resulted in frisky behavior and resistance to capture with wild attempts to escape during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks of the observation period. In contrast, these behaviors were attenuated in KA+retigabine-treated animals. In the open-field test, KA-treated animals spent more time in the center zone, but KA+retigabine-treated rats had greater overall activity compared with those having vehicle, KA, or retigabine-only treatment. In the elevated plus maze, KA+retigabine-treated animals traveled greater distances in open and closed arms (proximal and distal) compared with controls, also signifying anxiety reduction. Retigabine-only-treated rats traveled more in the open proximal arms compared with controls, indicating increased hyperlocomotion in normotensive rats. Although treatment with KA+retigabine resulted in anxiolytic-like effects in all three behavioral tasks compared with vehicle, this group did not significantly differ from systemically KA-treated rats in most measurements in open-field and elevated plus maze tasks, suggesting that retigabine may also cause hyperlocomotion unrelated to anxiety level. Despite that intrahippocampal KA-treated rats displayed comparable seizure behavior, epileptiform activity, and hippocampal injury, their behavior resembled the controls, suggesting that molecular and subsequent cellular changes are also partially responsible for anxiolytic-like effects and that these results are likely independent of the hippocampus."

Twenty-one soldiers reporting high PTSD symptoms were compared to 21 soldiers with low symptoms, and 16 soldiers who reported mTBI-consistent injury and symptoms were compared with 16 soldiers who did not sustain an mTBI. Participants viewed emotional face expressions while their neural activity was recorded (via event-related potentials) prior to and following deployment. The high-PTSD group displayed increased P1 and P2 amplitudes to threatening faces at post-deployment compared to the low-PTSD group. In contrast, the mTBI group displayed reduced face-specific processing (N170 amplitude) to all facial expressions compared to the no-mTBI group.

Furthermore, intra-individual symptom variability has not been well characterized. This pilot study examined the feasibility of a momentary data-gathering method, as well as the sensitivity of the assessment to the subtle and dynamic changes in symptoms of concussion. Six adolescents, three of whom suffered a concussion and three non-injured controls, provided symptom ratings five times per day for 5 days. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was conducted on a personal digital assistant to capture variability in symptom reports while in the natural environment. Preliminary results indicated that the EMA method showed great promise as a research tool in natural settings (e.g., school and home). Adolescents were able to comply with all tasks with little interference in their daily activities. Students with concussion showed generally higher symptom ratings across physical, cognitive, and affective domains, and temporal and diurnal patterns for symptoms emerged.

The progeny of irradiated and control animals aged 3 months were tested in Morris water maze (MWM), open field (OF) and in elevated plus maze test (PM). The prenatal irradiation negatively influenced the short-term spatial memory in MWM in female rats, although the long-term memory was not impaired. A statistically significant increase of basic locomotor activity in OF was observed in irradiated rats. The comfort behaviour was not altered. The results of PM showed an increase of anxiety in irradiated females. The level of hippocampal neurogenesis, assessed as the number of cells labelled with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine in the area of gyrus dentatus, was not statistically different in irradiated rats.

            "abstract": "Adolescents are more likely than adults to develop chronic symptoms, such as impulsivity and difficulty concentrating, following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) which may relate to disruption of pre-frontal cortex (PFC development). During adolescence the PFC is undergoing extensive remodelling, driving maturation of executive functions incorporating attention, motivation and impulse control. In part maturation of the PFC is driven by outgrowth of dopaminergic neurons to the PFC under the guidance of specific axonal targeting cues, including netrin-1. How a mTBI in adolescence may alter the expression of these axonal targeting cues, and the influence on PFC development is not yet known. As such the effects of mTBI in mid-adolescence on executive functioning in adulthood (12 weeks) were examined via the 5-choice serial reaction task in both male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Animals at p35 (n = 12-16 per group) were injured via weight drop (100 g from 0.75 m) and injury confirmed by a significant increase in righting reflex. Interestingly, while a mid-adolescence mTBI in females led to significantly higher omissions and decreased accuracy when task difficulty was high (stimulus duration 1 s), males had significantly increased premature response rate when the intertrial interval was varied. Examination of levels of TH, as a reflection of dopaminergic innervation, found no difference in either gender post-TBI in the PFC, but a significant increase in the limbic system (nucleus accumbens) in males, but not females, chronically post-TBI, suggesting an imbalance between the regions. The increase in TH was accompanied by a chronic reduction in netrin-1 within the nucleus accumbens in males only. Taken together, these results indicate that mTBI in adolescence leads to sex specific effects in different domains of PFC function in adulthood, which may relate to subtle alterations in the developmental trajectory of the mesocortical limbic pathway in males only."

These symptoms were derived from screen results of 1,549 veterans undergoing Department of Veterans Affairs postdeployment screening between April 2007 and January 2010. Veterans with positive TBI screens were approximately twice as likely to also screen positive for depression and PTSD (adjusted relative risks = 1.9 and 2.1, respectively). Irritability was a shared symptom between TBI and PTSD, and emotional numbing was a shared symptom between PTSD and depression. Symptoms unique to TBI included dizziness, headaches, memory problems, and light sensitivity. Four separate constructs emerged: TBI, PTSD, depression, and a fourth construct consisting of hypervigilance and sleep problems. These findings illuminate areas of overlap between TBI and common postdeployment mental health problems. Discriminating symptoms of TBI from mental health problems may facilitate diagnosis, triage to specialty care, and targeted symptom management. The emergence of a fourth factor consisting of sleep problems and hypervigilance highlights the need to attend to specific symptoms in the postdeployment screening process."

            "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been observed with neuropsychological tests of executive function, traditionally considered sensitive to frontal lobe damage. These impairments affect planning abilities, as well as the aptitude to initiate and regulate a goal-directed behaviour. On the other hand, negative symptoms of schizophrenia are widely suspected to reflect a frontal lobe dysfunction. Based on a review of a hundred papers, the present article analyses the anatomical and neuropsychological evidence of disturbed frontal lobe functioning in patients with negative schizophrenic symptoms. The phenomenological similarity of some schizophrenic symptoms to the clinical features of patients with prefrontal injury inspired the hypothesis of damaged frontal lobe in the former disorder. The morphological findings of neuroimaging studies brought inconsistent conclusions, with some researchers noting no differences between patients and control subjects while others observing reduced prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia. The functional neuroimaging demonstrated a reduced frontal blood flow relative to the general cerebral perfusion in patients with schizophrenia. Even though the overall neuroimaging literature provides reliable evidence of frontal impairment in schizophrenia, the average magnitude of the difference between patients and healthy controls is insufficient to defend the hypothesis of frontal lobe dysfunction, as far as brain volume, resting metabolism or blood flow are concerned. The only measure, which clearly distinguishes between the patients' and controls' distributions, is the functional neuroimaging of the frontal lobe while subjects are performing an experimentally controlled task. Schizophrenic patients fail to activate their frontal cortex when the task requires it. Analysing executive abilities in relation to symptom expression leads to recognising the fact that frontal dysfunction is a characteristic of only a sub-syndrome of schizophrenia. The factor analysis of the clinical features consistently reveals three syndromes in schizophrenia, termed disorganisation, positive and negative syndromes. The substantial body of evidence that patients exhibit more than one syndrome indicates these are dimensions within a single illness rather than discrete diseases. Liddle labelled the negative syndrome as \"psychomotor poverty\" and associated it with malfunction of the neuronal projections from dorsal prefrontal cortex to thalamus via striatum, connections involved in the initiation of mental activity. His hypothesis was supported by the work of other, independent research groups. The patients with negative symptoms, in contrast with the nonnegative symptom group, tend to demonstrate reduced neuronal activation of the frontal cortex during executive task realisation. The nonnegative patients are indistinguishable from the healthy control subjects in this region. Neuropsychological studies reveal that severity of psychomotor poverty is associated with slowing of mental processing and deficits in tasks that require planning abilities. These frontal functions are identified with the selection, the initiation and monitoring of a wide variety of behavioural processes. It was hypothesised that executive dysfunction will appear through different patterns across symptom subtypes, but few studies sought to validate this assumption. Finally, researchers make little effort to develop theoretical conceptualisations of the aetiology of negative schizophrenic symptoms, despite the growing body of evidence on its resemblance to the dorsolateral frontal lobe syndrome. Frith proposes that defects in the initiation of spontaneous action underlie these clinical phenomena, but his definition is not specific enough to be confronted to existing literature, neither has been empirically tested. Disturbed executive functioning has detrimental impact on the quality of daily living in patients with schizophrenia. Indirect observation of the latter accounts for defective long-term adaptation, which has been correlated to severity of negative symptoms and, although not consistently, to executive deficit as assessed by neuropsychological testing. Unfortunately, this area of research lacks ecologically valid studies. Measuring executive dysfunction as it occurs in the natural setting of the patient and validating dissocialbility of frontal deficits with respect to the schizophrenic symptomatology could lead to greater individualization of treatment plans and therefore to more efficient therapy outcome."

Method: At baseline, olfactory function, neuropsychological, and affective states were assessed in 42 patients (20 mild TBI; 22 orthopedic injury). At follow-up, 12 patients with mild TBI and 7 controls could be included, and we assessed olfactory function, affective states, and post-concussion symptoms. Results: At baseline, patients with mild TBI demonstrated significantly reduced olfactory function, compared to controls, with more than 55% of the patients presenting signs of hyposmia. One year later, no significant differences in olfactory scores between cases and controls were observed. However, patients with mild TBI who had exhibited hyposmia at baseline exhibited significantly higher anxiety levels and more post-concussion symptoms than patients with mild TBI with normal olfactory function at baseline. Conclusions: In the acute phase of mild TBI a majority of patients has impaired olfactory function. Further patients with olfactory dysfunction are more likely to exhibit post-concussion and anxious symptoms at follow-up. Olfactory testing in the acute phase may therefore serve as a screening tool for long-term outcome."

Focus groups of patients (four groups, 22 subjects total) and providers (three groups, 22 subjects total) were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. The findings from the focus groups were triangulated with a cognitive task analysis, including direct observation in the ED (>150 hours), and individual semistructured interviews using the critical decision method with four senior physician subject matter experts. These experts are recognized by their peers for their skill in safely minimizing testing while maintaining patient safety and engagement. Focus groups and interviews were audio recorded and notes were taken by two independent note takers. Notes were entered into ATLAS.ti and analyzed using the constant comparative method of grounded theory, an iterative coding process to determine themes. Data were double-coded and examined for discrepancies to establish consensus.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five core domains emerged from the analysis: establishing trust, anxiety (patient and provider), constraints related to ED practice, the influence of others, and patient expectations. Key themes within these domains included patient engagement, provider confidence and experience, ability to identify and manage patient anxiety, time constraints, concussion knowledge gap, influence of health care providers, and patient expectations to get a CT.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite high-quality evidence informing use of CT in minor head injury, multiple factors influence the decision to obtain CT in practice. Identifying and disseminating approaches and designing systems that help clinicians establish trust and manage uncertainty within the ED context could optimize CT use in minor head injury."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Emotional empathy is critical to successful social interactions and is often compromised after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using the Emostroop task, we investigated whether adults with moderate to severe TBI (N = 26) have problems with rapid conceptual processing of emotional stimuli compared with controls (N = 30). Further, we investigated whether rapid conceptual processing of emotions relates to emotion recognition and emotional empathy.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      In the Emostroop task, participants categorize emotional words (e.g., joyous, furious, and woeful) into three emotion categories: happy, sad, and angry. Each word is superimposed onto an image of a face, which expresses an emotion that is congruent to the word (congruent condition), incongruent to the word (incongruent condition), or is neutral (neutral condition). Slowed responding in the incongruent condition (interference) and speeded responding in the congruent condition (facilitation) indicates rapid conceptual processing of the faces. Participants also completed an emotion perception task, an empathy questionnaire (the BEES) and neuropsychological tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and executive function.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that rapid conceptual processing of emotional faces was preserved in people with TBI, despite diminished neuropsychological performance, emotion recognition, emotional empathy, and slowed responding. Further, the Emostroop effect was not correlated with self-reported emotional empathy or with emotion recognition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that in people with TBI, reduced empathy may be explained by processes downstream of the initial rapid conceptual processing of emotional information, such as flexibly attending and responding to this information in a goal-directed manner in complex environments.

            "abstract": "Poor vascular health, atherosclerosis, or cardiac procedures in the elderly result in clinically silent microvascular infarcts that increase susceptibility to larger ischemic episodes and can precipitate changes in mood and cognition. Although the mechanisms that underlie ischemia-induced behavioral changes have not been fully elucidated, chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis. Independent of brain injury, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines can lead to sickness behaviors and symptoms of depression. Furthermore, in the presence of brain injury, inflammatory activation may serve as the linchpin that precipitates dysregulation of biological systems leading to changes to behavior. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that cerebral inflammation caused by diffuse ischemia is necessary for the expression of post-injury anxiety- and depressive- like behavior. Using a microsphere embolism (ME) rodent model, we demonstrate prolonged elevations in expression of inflammatory genes in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury which are reflected in the contralateral hemisphere by two weeks following injury. Prophylactic administration of meloxicam, a preferential inhibitor of COX-2 activity, prevented both central inflammation and deficits in affective-like behaviors. Furthermore, meloxicam was more efficacious than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine in prevention of microembolism-induced changes in inflammation and behavior. These data demonstrate that inflammatory activation is necessary for microembolism-induced behavioral changes and suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments may be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with risk factors for vascular depression or prior to invasive cardiac procedures."

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of disability in adults, many of whom report a distressing combination of physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms, collectively known as post-concussion syndrome, that persist after the injury. Significant developments in magnetic resonance diffusion imaging, involving voxel-based quantitative analysis through the measurement of fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity, have enhanced our knowledge on the different stages of mTBI pathophysiology. Other diffusion imaging-derived techniques, including diffusion kurtosis imaging with multi-shell diffusion and high-order tractography models, have recently demonstrated their usefulness in mTBI. Our review starts by briefly outlining the physical basis of diffusion tensor imaging including the pitfalls for use in brain trauma, before discussing findings from diagnostic trials testing its usefulness in assessing brain structural changes in patients with mTBI. Use of different post-processing techniques for the diffusion imaging data, identified the corpus callosum as the most frequently injured structure in mTBI, particularly at sub-acute and chronic stages, and a crucial location for evaluating functional outcome. However, structural changes appear too subtle for identification using traditional diffusion biomarkers, thus disallowing expansion of these techniques into clinical practice. In this regard, more advanced diffusion techniques are promising in the assessment of this complex disease."

            "abstract": "Long-term shift work can cause circadian misalignment, which has been linked to anxiety and depression. However, the associated pathophysiologic changes have not been described in detail, and the mechanism underlying this association is not fully understood. To address these points, we used a rat model of CM induced by long-term variable photoperiod exposure [L-VP] (ie, for 90 days). We compared the numbers of neurons, astrocytes, and dendritic spines; dendrite morphology; long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and paired-pulse ratio (PPR); expression of glutamate receptor [N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)] subunits and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); and the anxiety and depression behaviors between rats in the circadian misalignment (CM) and circadian alignment (CA, with normal circadian rhythm) groups. The results showed that L-VP reduced the number of neurons and astrocytes in the mPFC and decreased the number of dendritic spines, dendrite complexity, LTP, LTD, PPR, and expression of glutamate receptors (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, NMDAR2A, and NMDAR2B) and BDNF in the mPFC. L-VP also induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, as measured by the open field test, elevated plus-maze, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test. These results suggest that CM induces a loss of neurons and astrocytes and synaptic damage in surviving pyramidal cells in the mPFC might be involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression."

This study examined 70 patients who had previously been diagnosed as having either PTSD or MTBI. Each patient was asked to provide a highly detailed chronological history of the events which preceded, followed, and occurred during the traumatic event, to indicate whether they were rendered unconscious or had amnesia for the event, and to describe the various symptoms they developed. All (100.0%) of the PTSD patients were able to provide a highly detailed and emotionally charged recollection of the events which occurred within 15 minutes of the traumatic event in comparison to none (0.0%) of the MTBI patients. None of the MTBI patients reported symptoms such as intrusive recollections of the traumatic event, nightmares, hypervigilance, phobic or startle reactions, or became upset when they were asked to describe the traumatic event or were exposed to stimuli associated with it. These data suggest that PTSD and MTBI are two mutually exclusive disorders, and that it is highly unlikely that MTBI patients develop PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, these findings suggest that clinicians should exercise considerable caution in ruling out PTSD prior to making the diagnosis of MTBI."

Low-grade systemic inflammation might contribute to the development of persistent unfavourable outcomes in patients with mTBI. We used plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as the biomarker of systemic inflammation to investigate whether elevated CRP levels were associated with persistent adverse outcomes in these patients. A total of 213 consecutive patients with mTBI were identified in our study. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP levels were measured at baseline, 1month, 2months and 3months after initial traumatic brain injury. The study endpoints included persistent postconcussion syndrome (PCS), persistent psychological problems (depression and anxiety), persistent physiological problems (frequent headache, nausea, insomnia, dizziness and fatigue) and persistent cognitive impairment, which were screened by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), Beck depression inventory (BDI) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) 3months post-injury. The associations between baseline CRP levels and persistent unfavourable outcomes were estimated from multiple regression models adjusting for various confounding covariates. Elevated baseline CRP levels were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of persistent PCS (odds ratio [OR], 2.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.609-4.594; p=0.000), persistent psychological problems (OR, 1.535; 95% CI, 1.063-2.216; p=0.022), and persistent cognitive impairment (OR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.135-2.507; p=0.010).

Some studies have reported a right hemisphere advantage irrespective of valence, whereas others have found a left hemisphere advantage for positive, and a right hemisphere advantage for negative, emotion. Differences in injury aetiology and chronicity, proportion of male participants, participant age, and the number of emotions used within a perception task may contribute to these contradictory findings. The present study therefore controlled and/or directly examined the influence of these possible moderators. Right brain-damaged (RBD; n=17), left brain-damaged (LBD; n=17), and healthy control (HC; n=34) participants completed two face perception tasks (identification and discrimination). No group differences in facial expression perception according to valence were found. Across emotions, the RBD group was less accurate thanthe HC group, however RBD and LBD group performancedid not differ. The lack of difference between RBD and LBD groups indicates that both hemispheres are involved in positive and negative expression perception. The inclusion of older adults and the well-defined chronicity range of the brain-damaged participants may have moderated these findings. Participant sex and general face perception ability did not influence performance. Furthermore, while the RBD group was less accurate than the LBD group when the identification task tested two emotions, performance of the two groups was indistinguishable when the number of emotions increased (four or six). This suggests that task demand moderates a study's ability to find hemispheric differences in the perception of facial emotion."

Inclusion criteria for mild head injury were unconsciousness <10 min or none at all, lack of overt neurological symptoms and other complications requiring intensive care. Twenty-six of the children had been unconscious for a short period. Ten had suffered a skull fracture.

Such post-traumatic symptoms did not correlate with somatic, neurological or electroencephalographic findings observed immediately after the injury or at the follow-up investigation.

            "title": "Combat TBI: History, Epidemiology, and Injury Modes.",
            "abstract": "Although types and modes of combat injury have changed over the centuries as weapons of war evolved, details about combat traumatic brain injury (TBI) date from the earliest accounts of warfare. This chapter provides a brief historical overview of combat TBI resulting from primitive blunt and penetrating head injuries to current blast-related injuries. Updated numbers of TBI events and injuring mechanisms will be considered. Brain injury causes loss or alteration of consciousness, prograde and retrograde amnesia, and immediate physical and neurological effects ranging from mild to severe. These injuries, in certain cases, cause varying chronic physical, cognitive, and behavioral issues. The most common form of brain injury, acute mild TBI or concussion (mTBI/concussion), has multiple definitions derived from various sources. Vasterling et al. have provided a useful summary of these iterations (Vasterling, 2012).\n    \n\n      \n      The operative definition selected for this review includes loss or alteration consciousness for up to 30 minutes at the time of injury, a confused or disoriented state lasting less than 24 hours, memory loss lasting less than 24 hours, and normal structural brain imaging on computed tomographic scanning. Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 13–15 characterize acute mTBI, whereas lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, 9–12, designate acute moderate TBI. Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3–8 designate acute severe TBI (Teasdale and Jennett, 1974). Current combat or military TBI/concussions most frequently are classified as mild. Although recovery from mTBI/concussion is said to be the norm, in about 15% (estimates range from 10%–25%) of cases, physical disabilities and symptoms persist beyond three months to become a chronic condition, also known as postconcussion syndrome (Vasterling, 2012). Chronic sequelae of postconcussion syndrome include headache, insomnia, fatigue, sensory, balance, and other neurologic defects as well as cognitive and emotional disorders. Symptoms can be subtle and variable in severity and frequency over time; mTBI and concussion are often used clinically as synonyms. This chapter focuses on mTBI/concussion as a combat injury.\n    \n\n      \n      Diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), first accepted as a formal diagnosis in 1980 (Horowitz et al., 1980), and other mental illness including depression are reportedly more common in combatants as compared with nondeployed service members during current ongoing military operations (Blakely, 2013). The methods used to obtain estimates affect data concerning numbers of cases of TBI, PTSD, and other mental disorders. Individuals usually are reported only once as a case within a category; data can be presented as the number of diagnoses (prevalence), rate of new diagnoses in a population (incidence), or total number of cases in a population. The total number of diagnoses changes in relation to population size, which for military conditions increases over time with continued combat activities (Blakely, 2013). This chapter uses numbers available from public sources for the Department of Defense (DOD) and updated data through 2013 from the tracking tool used by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n    \n\n      \n      PTSD results from exposure to a traumatic event with risk of serious injury or bodily harm to self or others and a response to that event involving intense fear, horror, or helplessness. Symptoms include reexperiencing of the traumatic event, including nightmares and distressing recollections, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma with diminished responsiveness and loss of interest in activities, and hyperarousal including irritability, anger, hypervigilance, insomnia, and concentration difficulties. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PTSD and depression overlap with those of mTBI; mTBI sustained during the stress of battle is believed to predispose to or accentuate PTSD (Bryant, 2011; Vasterling, 2012).\n    \n\n      \n      Historical narratives reveal connections or associations between past and current relationships (Rabins, 2013). Vignettes from past and present conflicts yield insights into the causes and sequelae of combat injuries affecting the brain. Currently, blast injuries predominate among combatants in Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Recognition of the importance of mTBI and PTSD relates to enhanced surveillance and clinical guidelines initiated by the DOD and the VA (Management of Concussion/mTBI Working Group 2009). Incidence and prevalence data from both sources provide ongoing estimates of the numbers of service members affected by TBI; the frequency of this particular injury has become a matter of increasing concern. Although the long-term effects of brain damage caused by differing modes of head injury seem to appear identical in the long term (Belanger et al., 2009), recent observations suggest that differing modes of combat injury—for example, blunt as compared with blast injuries—result in differing vestibular-ocular and spinal reflexes (Hoffer et al., 2009) and neural activation responses (Fischer et al., 2013). Behavioral disorders appear to be more common with blast as opposed to blunt injury (Mendez et al., 2013). Repeated injuries, particularly sports-related, have become a public health concern because of their long-term consequences (Jordan, 2013). These emerging observations are important for assessing treatments, outcomes, and disability determinations."

The AEM may also be applicable to persistent symptoms after concussion. In this study, we tested the AEM as an explanatory framework for concussion outcomes, by using mediation analyses through the proposed psychological mechanisms. Based on the AEM, we hypothesized that postconcussion symptoms would significantly predict avoidance behavior through catastrophizing, and endurance behavior through thought suppression and self-distraction.\n    \n\n\n          Participants and methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 84 adults seeking treatment at 2 outpatient concussion clinics (M = 41.8 years old, 63% female) who completed measures of postconcussion symptoms, catastrophizing, thought suppression, \"self-distraction\" (Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire \"Act with Awareness\" Scale reverse-scored), avoidance behavior, and endurance behavior at an average of 17.8 weeks postconcussion. We conducted 3 mediation analyses to assess each of the AEM pathways.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found a significant indirect effect of postconcussion symptoms on avoidance behavior through catastrophizing (ab = .113 (.036), 95% CI [.053, .195]).

Therefore, catastrophic thinking about concussion symptoms may be an appropriate treatment target for individuals who exhibit fear-avoidance behavior. Further research is needed to establish whether thought suppression and self-distraction are relevant for interventions aimed at reducing excessive endurance behavior.

            "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain affects 7-10 % of the population and is often accompanied by comorbid emotional disorders, which greatly reduce the quality of life of the patients, impairing physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning. Despite the higher prevalence and severity of chronic pain in women, the number of publications using female animals remains scarce. While in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model the development of mechanical/thermal hyperalgesia, allodynia and spontaneous pain has been shown in both sexes, little is known on CCI-induced emotional impairments and sciatic nerve histopathology in female rats, as well as on the contributions of ovarian hormones to peripheral nerve injury. In this work, young adult rats (Wistar Han) were assigned to one of five groups: gonadally intact females (SHAM/SHAM), ovariectomized females (SHAM/OVX), gonadally intact females with CCI (CCI/SHAM); ovariectomized females with CCI (CCI/OVX) and males with CCI (CCIM). In the postoperative period, CCI animals, both females and males, displayed visible gait abnormalities, limping and guarding the affected hind paw although locomotion was not affected. Neuropathic females developed sustained mechanical allodynia, with CCI/OVX animals displaying symptoms two weeks before CCI/SHAM females. Interestingly, regarding mechanical and cold allodynia, CCI males slowly recovered from week 3 onwards. While CCI induced neither anxiety- nor depressive-like behaviour in females, ovariectomy per se induced anhedonic-like behaviour, regardless of CCI surgery. Histopathological analysis of the sciatic nerve showed CCI induced nerve damage, fibrosis, myelin sheath degradation and inflammation. Single-cell electrophysiological data from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) suggests this area is partly involved in descending facilitation associated with experimental neuropathic pain. Altogether, our findings demonstrate CCI females display distinct sensory, emotional, electrophysiological, and histopathological impairments from males, and that ovariectomy aggravates females' responses to peripheral nerve injury."

The goal of this study was to assess whether a cognitive rehabilitation training that was applied successfully in civilian and military TBI would be effective for military Veterans with comorbid PTSD and mild TBI (mTBI). In the previous study, Veterans with a history of mild to severe TBI improved significantly after goal-oriented attentional self-regulation (GOALS) training on measures of attention/executive function, functional task performance, and emotional regulation. The objective of this study was to assess effects of GOALS training in Veterans with comorbid PTSD and mTBI. Forty Veterans with a current PTSD diagnosis and history of mTBI (6+ months post) were randomized to either five weeks of GOALS or Brain-Health Education (BHE) training matched in time and intensity. Evaluator-blinded assessments at baseline and post-training included neuropsychological and complex functional task performance, and self-report measures of emotional functioning/regulation. After GOALS but not BHE training, participants significantly improved from baseline on primary outcome measures of: overall complex attention/executive function neuropsychological performance composite (F = 12.35, p = 0.001; Cohen d = 0.48), and overall mood disturbance -POMS emotional regulation self-report (F = 4.29, p = 0.05, Cohen d = 0.41). In addition, GOALS but not BHE participants indicated a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms (PCL-M Total Score) (F = 4.80, p = 0.05, Cohen d = 0.60), and demonstrated improvement on complex functional task performance-GPS Learning and Memory (F = 5.06, p = 0.05, Cohen d = 0.56]. Training in attentional self-regulation applied to participant-defined goals may improve cognitive functioning in Veterans with comorbid PTSD and mTBI. Improving cognitive control functioning may also improve functioning in other domains such as emotional regulation and functional performance, potentially making it particularly relevant for Veterans with a history of mTBI and comorbid psychiatric symptoms."

TBI may affect emotional, sensory-motor, cognitive, and psychological functions with a consequent worsening of both patient and his/her caregiver's quality of life. In recent years, technological innovations allowed the development of new, advanced sensory stimulation systems, such as Neurowave, to further stimulate residual cognitive abilities and, at the same time, evaluate residual cognition.\n    \n\n\n          Patient concern:\n        \n      \n      An 69-year-old Italian man entered our neurorehabilitation unit with a diagnosis of minimally conscious state following severe TBI. He breathed spontaneously via tracheostomy and was fed via percutaneous gastrostomy. At the neurological examination, the patient showed severe tetraparesis as he showed fluctuating alertness and responsiveness to external stimuli and opened the eyes without stimulation.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis:\n        \n      \n      Patient was affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage and frontotemporal bilateral hematoma, which were surgically treated with decompressive craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty about 6 months before.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      The patient underwent a neuropsychological and clinical evaluation before (T0) and after a conventional rehabilitation cycle (T1), and after a Neurowave emotional stimulation-supported rehabilitative cycle (T2).\n    \n\n\n          Outcomes:\n        \n      \n      Following conventional rehabilitation (T1), the patient achieved a partial improvement in behavioral responsiveness; there was also a mild improvement in the caregiver's distress. Conversely, Neurowave emotional stimulation session determined (at T2) a significant improvement of the patient's behavioral responsiveness, cognition, and in the caregiver's distress. The P300 recording in response to the NES showed a significant change of P300 magnitude and latency.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest that emotional-integrated sensory stimulation using adequate visual stimuli represents a beneficial, complementary rehabilitative treatment for patients in minimally conscious state following a severe TBI. This may occur because stimuli with emotional salience can provide a reliable motivational resource to stimulate motor and cognitive recovery following severe TBI."

            "abstract": "In the long term after traumatic brain injury, the most disabling problems are generally related to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including personality change and cognitive impairment, rather than neurophysical sequelae. Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed."

However, to date, characterisation of rodent stroke models has concentrated mainly on the investigation of motor deficits. The aim of the present studies was therefore to investigate home cage behaviour (as assessed by a recently developed automatic behavioural classification system, LABORAS) and social behaviour (as a measure of anxiety) in rats following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Rats subjected to tMCAO (90 min) showed deficits in general home cage behaviours including locomotion, rearing, grooming and drinking for up to 7 weeks post occlusion, as compared with sham operated controls. In addition, a significant decrease in the total duration of social interaction was also observed in occluded rats compared with shams. The data shows that in addition to motor deficits, animals display changes in home cage behaviour and decreased social behaviour which, in contrast to motor function, are prolonged over time. Transient MCAO in rats may therefore provide a pre-clinical model to investigate agents offering symptomatic relief for ischaemia-induced motor deficits and anxiety over time following injury."

Postmortem discoveries show that some of these athletes have pathologic findings that are collectively termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current hypotheses suggest that concussions or perhaps blows to the head that do not cause the signs and symptoms necessary for making the diagnosis of concussion, so-called subconcussive blows, cause both the clinical and pathologic findings. There are, however, some athletes who participate in contact sports who do not develop the findings ascribed to CTE. Furthermore, there are people who have headaches, mood disorders, cognitive difficulties, suicidal ideation, and other clinical problems who have neither been exposed to repeated head trauma nor possessed the pathologic postmortem findings of those currently diagnosed with CTE. The current lack of prospective data and properly designed case-control studies limits the current understanding of CTE, leading to debate about the causes of the neuropathologic findings and the clinical observations. Given the potential for referral and recall bias in available studies, it remains unclear whether or not the pathologic findings made postmortem cause the presumed neurobehavioral sequela and whether the presumed risk factors, such as sports activity, cerebral concussions, and subconcussive blows, are solely causative of the clinical signs and symptoms.

Here we explored short- and long-term consequences of neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures in 7 day old C57BL/6J mice. Seizure activity, molecular markers of hypoxia and histological injury were investigated acutely after hypoxia and response to chemoconvulsants and animal behaviour was explored at adulthood. Hypoxia was induced by exposing pups to 5% oxygen for 15 min (global hypoxia). Electrographically defined seizures with behavioral correlates occurred in 95% of these animals and seizures persisted for many minutes after restitution of normoxia. There was minimal morbidity or mortality. Pre- or post-hypoxia injection of phenobarbital (50mg/kg) had limited efficacy at suppressing seizures. The hippocampus from neonatal hypoxia-seizure mice displayed increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and the immediate early gene c-fos, minimal histological evidence of cell injury and activation of caspase-3 in scattered neurons. Behavioral analysis of mice five weeks after hypoxia-induced seizures detected novel anxiety-related and other behaviors, while performance in a spatial memory test was similar to controls. Seizure threshold tests with kainic acid at six weeks revealed that mice previously subject to neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures developed earlier, more frequent and longer-duration seizures. This study defines a set of electro-clinical, molecular, pharmacological and behavioral consequences of hypoxia-induced seizures that indicate short- and long-term deleterious outcomes and may be a useful model to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of neonatal seizures in humans."

We selected cognitive symptoms as an important target to assess because of impact on school and employment. We evaluated cognitive complaints in a highly symptomatic (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire [PCSQ], mean [M] = 29.5) civilian sample (n = 100; age: M = 41.4; 36 male/64 female; days post-injury: range 14-154, M = 51.4) of consecutive referrals to a concussion specialty clinic. The Behavior Rating of Executive Functions-Adult version (BRIEF-A) was used to assess subjective cognitive symptoms. Independent variables were prior neurologic and psychiatric history, current neurological symptoms, objective neuropsychological tests and several measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition [BDI2]), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), and stress (Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian form). No demographic characteristic, injury measure, or past or current neurological history had any association with cognitive symptoms. Prior psychiatric history (57% of patients) was associated with abnormal BRIEF-A. Cognitive tests were overall in the average range, with only mild and sporadic associations with BRIEF-A elevations. All psychological measures showed significant associations with BRIEF-A elevations. Regression analyses for the BRIEF-A revealed depression was the significant contributor (BDI2, β = 0.73) with prior psychiatric history (β = 0.16) and age (β = 0.14) accounting to a lesser extent. In this civilian cohort, subjective cognitive symptoms appear to be due to psychological distress (in particular, depression) and prior psychiatric history more than actual cognitive impairment or other presenting symptoms. These findings illuminate the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of mood/emotional symptoms after injury."

Initial studies using a wearable camera (SenseCam) suggest long-term improvements in autobiographical retrieval of recorded events. In this study a single-case experimental design was implemented to explore the use of SenseCam as a memory aid for a man with a specific anxiety disorder and memory and executive difficulties following ABI. We predicted that SenseCam supported rehearsal of memories of events that trigger high levels of anxiety would yield improved retrieval of both factual detail and internal state information (thoughts and feelings) compared with a conventional psychotherapy aid (automatic thought record sheets, ATRs) and no strategy. The findings indicated SenseCam supported retrieval of anxiety trigger events was superior to ATRs or no strategy in terms of both detail and internal state information, with 94% of the information being recalled in the SenseCam condition, compared to 39% for the \"no strategy\" and 22% for the ATR conditions. It is concluded that SenseCam may be of use as a compensatory aid in psychotherapies relying on retrieval of emotionally salient trigger events."

Although previous studies found altered functional connectivity (FC) in mTBI patients, the alterations of brain structural properties remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed structural covariance (SC) for the acute stages of mTBI (amTBI) patients, the chronic stages of mTBI (cmTBI) patients, and healthy controls. We first extracted the mean gray matter volume (GMV) of seed regions that are located in the default-mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and the visual network (VN). Then we determined and compared the SC for each seed region among the amTBI, the cmTBI and the healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the amTBI patients showed lower SC for the ECN, and the cmTBI patients showed higher SC for the both DMN and SN but lower SC for the SMN. The results revealed disrupted ECN in the amTBI patients and disrupted DMN, SN and SMN in the cmTBI patients. These alterations suggest that early disruptions in SC between bilateral insula and the bilateral prefrontal cortices may appear in amTBI and persist into cmTBI, which might be potentially related to the cognitive and emotional impairments."

The optimal recovery time including return-to-work (RTW) after mTBI is unclear. In this single-centre parallel-group trial, patients assigned three days (3D-group) or seven days (7D-group) sick leave were compared with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) within one week, after three and 12 months post-injury. The influence of the effective time until RTW on post-concussional symptoms and cognitive performance was analysed. The 3D-group rated significantly higher mean scores in some PCSS symptoms, tended to fulfil diagnosis criteria of PCS more often and showed better cognitive performance in several neuropsychological test scores than the 7D-group at all three time-points of follow-up. Overall, patients returned to work 11.35 d post-injury, thus distinctly above both recommended sick leaves. There was a trend for longer sick leave in patients randomized into the 3D-group. Further analyses revealed that the group with an absolute RTW within one week showed lower symptom severity in fatigue at 3 and 12 months, less PCS and faster performance in fine motor speed at 12 months than the group with an absolute RTW after one week. Our data underline the heterogeneity of mTBI and show that acute and sub-acute symptoms are not prognostic factors for neuropsychological outcome at one year. Later, ability to work seems to be prognostic for long-term occurrence of PCS."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is both prevalent and potentially disabling. Extant literature has demonstrated women to report greater post-concussive symptoms (PCS) compared to men, highlighting the necessity of investigations into malleable, gender-linked risk factors for PCS that hold promise for reducing this gender disparity. Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and Distress Tolerance (DT) are gender-linked risk factors that may be related to PCS. Despite a breadth of research supporting elevated AS and reduced DT in women, no study to date has investigated whether AS and DT mediate gender differences in PCS. The current sample was composed of 59 participants selected from a larger study based on their report of a past TBI. Findings indicated that AS, but not DT, significantly mediated gender differences in PCS. The present results suggest that AS is a cognitive risk factor that can partially account for the gender disparity in the expression of PCS. AS may influence an individual's interpretation of PCS as dangerous, thereby amplifying the perception of PCS severity. This suggests that efforts to reduce the burden of TBI may benefit from targeting AS in prevention and treatment paradigms, especially among women."

Adults (≥16 years at injury) identified as part of a population-based TBI incidence study (BIONIC) who experienced mTBI 8-years ago (N = 151) and a TBI-free sample (N = 151) completed self-report measures of symptoms and symptom burden (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist), and functional outcomes (Participation Assessments with Recombined Tools, Work Limitations Questionnaire).

Utilizing a clinical sample of deployed military personnel, this study aimed to examine a serial meditation model of anger and depression in the association of mild TBI and suicide risk. A total of 149 military service members referred for evaluation/treatment of a suspected head injury at a military hospital participated in the present study (92.6% male; Mage = 27.9y). Self-report measures included the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) anger and depression subscales, and Behavioral Health Measure-20 depression subscale. A current mild TBI diagnosis was confirmed by a licensed clinical psychologist/physician. Overall, 84.6% (126/149) of participants met diagnostic criteria for a current mild TBI. Bootstrapped serial mediation analyses indicated that the association of mild TBI and suicide risk is serially mediated by anger and depression symptoms (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [CI] for the indirect effect = 0.044, 0.576). An alternate serial mediation model in which depression symptoms precede anger was not statistically significant (bias-corrected 95% CI for the indirect effect = -0.405, 0.050). Among a clinical sample of military personnel, increased anger and depression statistically mediated the association of mild TBI and suicide risk, and anger appears to precede depression in this pathway. Findings suggest that therapeutically targeting anger may serve to thwart the trajectory to suicide risk among military personnel who experience a mild TBI. Future research should investigate this conjecture within a prospective design to establish temporality."

ANS dysfunction has been reported in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its role in mild TBI (mTBI) is understudied. The objective of this review is to elucidate the role of ANS dysfunction following mTBI and the underlying pathophysiology specifically neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and altered cerebral blood flow. ANS dysfunction is thought to be one of the many factors contributing to clinical features following mTBI including headache, anxiety, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. The ANS has been shown to play a role in the production and regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules. ANS dysfunction most often results in exaggerated sympathetic neural activation (SNA) which contributes to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. SNA is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent neurodegeneration following mTBI. Additionally, changes in cerebral blood flow can be seen in patients with mTBI showing evidence of ANS dysfunction. No Level I studies have explored the relationship between mTBI and ANS dysfunction. Better understanding of the role of the ANS in mTBI will improve the evaluation and clinical management of mTBI by offering additional diagnostic and novel treatment strategies."

This prospective cohort study included 254 Vietnam War veterans: 199 with penetrating brain injuries and 55 matched control participants. Measures include DSM-IV diagnoses (from a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM), self-report measures of depression and anxiety, and CT scans. Factors underlying DSM-IV diagnoses were determined using an exploratory factor analysis and correlated with percent of brain regions affected. The ability of the factor scores, DSM-IV diagnoses, and the self-report psychiatric measures to account for the anatomical variance was compared with multiple regressions. Internalizing and externalizing factors were identified in these brain-injured patients. Damage to the left amygdala and bilateral basal ganglia was associated with lower internalizing factor scores, and damage to the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with higher, and bilateral hippocampi with lower, externalizing factor scores. Factor scores best predicted left amygdala and bilateral hippocampal involvement, whereas DSM-IV diagnoses best predicted bilateral basal ganglia and left OFC involvement. Damage to the limbic areas involved in the processing of emotional and reward information, including structures involved in the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria Negative Valence Domain, influences the development of internalizing and externalizing psychiatric symptoms.

            "abstract": "Malfunctioning synaptic plasticity is one of the major mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic pain. We studied spike-timing dependent depression (tLTD) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of male mice, a brain region involved in processing emotional aspects of pain. tLTD onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons depended on postsynaptic calcium-influx through GluN2B-containing NMDARs and retrograde signaling via nitric oxide to reduce presynaptic release probability. After chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, a model for neuropathic pain, tLTD was rapidly impaired; and this phenotype persisted even beyond the time of recovery from mechanical sensitization. Exclusion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs from the postsynaptic site specifically at projections from the anterior thalamus to the ACC caused the tLTD phenotype, whereas signaling downstream of nitric oxide synthesis remained intact. Thus, transient neuropathic pain can leave a permanent trace manifested in the disturbance of synaptic plasticity in a specific afferent pathway to the cortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic plasticity is one of the main mechanisms that contributes to the development of chronic pain. Most studies have focused on potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission, but very little is known about the reduction in synaptic strength. We have focused on the ACC, a brain region associated with the processing of emotional and affective components of pain. We studied spike-timing dependent LTD, which is a biologically plausible form of synaptic plasticity, that depends on the relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. We found a long-lasting and pathway-specific suppression of the induction mechanism for spike-timing dependent LTD from the anterior thalamus to the ACC, suggesting that this pathology might be involved in altered emotional processing in pain."

As mortality rates have declined for severe TBI, attention has turned to the cognitive, affective, and behavioral sequelae of injuries across the severity spectrum, which are often more disabling than residual physical effects. Moderate and severe TBI can cause personality changes including impulsivity, severe irritability, affective instability, and apathy. Mild TBI, once considered a largely benign phenomenon, is now known to be associated with a range of affective symptoms, with suicidality, and with worsening or new onset of several psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Repetitive head impacts, often in athletic contexts, are now believed to be associated with a number of emotional and behavioral sequelae. The nature and etiology of mental health manifestations of TBI (including a combination of brain dysfunction and psychological trauma and interrelationships between cognitive, affective, and physical symptoms) are complex and have been a focus of recent epidemiological and mechanistic studies.

Furthermore, whereas higher HADS-D scores were associated with lower connectivity within the parietal midline areas of the bilateral frontal network, higher HADS-A scores were related to lower connectivity within medial prefrontal areas of the bilateral frontal network.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Functional interactions of the executive and salience networks were related to emotion regulation and complaints after mTBI, with a key role for the bilateral frontal network.

            "abstract": "Prognostic models can guide clinical management and increase statistical power in clinical trials. The availability and adequacy of prognostic models for mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is uncertain. The present study aimed to (1) identify and evaluate multivariable prognostic models for MTBI, and (2) determine which pre-, peri-, and early post-injury variables have independent prognostic value in the context of multivariable models. An electronic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for English-language MTBI cohort studies from 1970-2013 was supplemented by Web of Science citation and hand searching. This search strategy identified 7789 articles after removing duplicates. Of 182 full-text articles reviewed, 26 met eligibility criteria including (1) prospective inception cohort design, (2) prognostic information collected within 1 month post-injury, and (3) 2+variables combined to predict clinical outcome (e.g., post-concussion syndrome) at least 1 month later. Independent reviewers extracted sample characteristics, study design features, clinical outcome variables, predictor selection methods, and prognostic model discrimination, calibration, and cross-validation. These data elements were synthesized qualitatively. The present review found no multivariable prognostic model that adequately predicts individual patient outcomes from MTBI. Suboptimal methodology limits their reproducibility and clinical usefulness. The most robust prognostic factors in the context of multivariable models were pre-injury mental health and early post-injury neuropsychological functioning. Women and adults with early post-injury anxiety also have worse prognoses. Relative to these factors, the severity of MTBI had little long-term prognostic value. Future prognostic studies should consider a broad range of biopsychosocial predictors in large inception cohorts."

Tractography was employed by seeding ROIs along 3 brainstem white matter tracts (i.e., medial lemniscus-central tegmentum tract [ML-CTT]; corticospinal tracts [CST], and pontine tegmentum [PT]), and mean DTI values were derived from fractional anisotropic (FA) maps. Results showed that there were no significant difference in FA between the MC and TBI groups across the 3 regions of interest; however, among the TBI group, CST FA was significantly negatively associated with LOC duration. Additionally, lower FA of certain tracts-most especially the PT-was significantly associated with increased PCS symptoms (i.e., more severe vestibular symptoms, poorer physical functioning, and greater levels of fatigue), even after adjusting for PTSD symptoms. Our findings show that, in our sample of veterans with mTBI, tractography-based DTI indices of brainstem white matter tracts of interest are related to the presence and severity of PCS symptoms. Findings are promising as they show linkages between brainstem white matter integrity and injury severity (LOC), and they raise the possibility that the pontine tegmentum in particular may be a useful marker of PCS symptoms. Collectively, these data point to important neurobiological substrates of the chronic and complex constellation of symptoms following the 'signature injury' of our combat-exposed veterans."

Diagnosing mild TBI is particularly challenging when assessment is not immediate, and when informed, first responder documentation or witness corroboration is absent. In this common scenario, the diagnosis is made entirely on self-report of an initial period of alteration of consciousness (AOC) associated with a plausible injury mechanism.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression and the relationship between PCS and quality of life in patients examined at the Canadian Concussion Centre. The Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale-42 (DASS-42) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) were sent to 526 adult patients diagnosed with PCS. Median with interquartile range follow-up time was 5 (4-7) years. Of the 105 respondents, 35.2% displayed mild or greater symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both. Importantly, the number of previous concussions was correlated with elevations on the DASS-42 Anxiety (p = 0.030) and Depression (p = 0.018) subscale scores, suggesting an acquired cause of symptoms. Patients with clinical elevations of depression, anxiety, or both exhibited poorer mean WHOQOL-BREF scores in each domain (p < 0.001) compared to those who scored in the normal range on the DASS-42. These findings indicate that depression and anxiety in PCS can endure for years and are associated with diminished quality of life. Consequently, depression and anxiety should be identified and treated early in PCS populations in order to optimize recovery. Although the underlying etiology of depression and anxiety cannot be ascertained with certainty in the present study, the association between depression and anxiety and the number of concussions may indicate an organic explanation. In the future, quality-of-life measures should be incorporated into treatment and research in PCS to improve intervention strategies and enhance understanding of the trajectory of recovery in this population."

            "abstract": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a form of neurodegeneration believed to result from repeated head injuries. Originally termed dementia pugilistica because of its association with boxing, the neuropathology of CTE was first described by Corsellis in 1973 in a case series of 15 retired boxers. CTE has recently been found to occur after other causes of repeated head trauma, suggesting that any repeated blows to the head, such as those that occur in American football, hockey, soccer, professional wrestling, and physical abuse, can also lead to neurodegenerative changes. These changes often include cerebral atrophy, cavum septi pellucidi with fenestrations, shrinkage of the mammillary bodies, dense tau immunoreactive inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles, and neuropil neurites), and, in some cases, a TDP-43 proteinopathy. In association with these pathologic changes, disordered memory and executive functioning, behavioral and personality disturbances (eg, apathy, depression, irritability, impulsiveness, suicidality), parkinsonism, and, occasionally, motor neuron disease are seen in affected individuals. No formal clinical or pathologic diagnostic criteria for CTE currently exist, but the distinctive neuropathologic profile of the disorder lends promise for future research into its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."

            "abstract": "The noradrenergic locus coeruleus nucleus is an important station in both the ascending and descending pain regulatory pathways. These neurons discharge in tonic and phasic modes in response to sensory stimuli. However, few studies have set out to characterize the electrophysiological response of the locus coeruleus to noxious stimuli in conditions of neuropathic pain. Thus, the effects of mechanical nociceptive stimulation of the sciatic nerve area on spontaneous (tonic) and sensory-evoked (phasic) locus coeruleus discharge were studied by extracellular recording in anesthetized rats seven, fourteen and twenty-eight days after chronic constriction injury. Minor significant electrophysiological changes were found seven and fourteen days after nerve injury. However, alterations to the spontaneous activity in both the ipsilateral and contralateral locus coeruleus were found twenty-eight days after nerve constriction, as witnessed by an increase of burst firing incidence and irregular firing patterns. Furthermore, noxious-evoked responses were exacerbated in the contralateral and ipsilateral nucleus at twenty-eight days after injury, as were the responses evoked when stimulating the uninjured paw. In addition, mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw produced a significant sensitization of neuronal tonic activity after 28 days of neuropathy. In summary, long-term nerve injury led to higher spontaneous activity and exacerbated noxious-evoked responses in the locus coeruleus to stimulation of nerve-injured and even uninjured hindpaws, coinciding temporally with the development of depressive and anxiogenic-like behavior."

The results demonstrated that including DNA methylation markers in the major depression pathway improved the prediction accuracy for quality of life but not persistent post-concussive symptom burden. Specifically, the prediction accuracy (i.e., the correlation between the predicted value and observed value) of quality of life was improved from 0.59 (p = 1.20 × 10-3) (clinical model) to 0.71 (p = 3.89 × 10-5); the identified cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites were mainly in the open sea regions and the mapped genes were related to TBI in several molecular studies.

The number and severity of symptoms can vary, with some individuals experiencing rapid recovery, and others having persistent symptoms for months to years, impacting their quality of life. Current rehabilitation is limited in its ability to treat persistent symptoms and novel approaches are being sought to improve outcomes following mTBI. Neuromodulation is one technique used to encourage adaptive neuroplasticity within the brain. Objective: To systematically review the literature on the efficacy of neuromodulation in the mTBI population. Method: A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and EBM Review. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guidelines were used and a narrative review of the selected studies was completed. Fourteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria which were published in English, investigating an adult sample and using a pre- and post-intervention design. Studies were excluded if they included non-mild TBI severities, pediatric or older adult populations. Results: Thirteen of fourteen studies reported positive reductions in mTBI symptomatology following neuromodulation. Specifically, improvements were reported in post-concussion symptom ratings, headaches, dizziness, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, general disability, cognition, return to work and quality of life. Normalization of working memory activation patterns, vestibular field potentials, hemodynamics of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and excessive delta wave activity were also seen. The studies reviewed had several methodological limitations including small, heterogenous samples and varied intervention protocols, limiting generalisability. Further research is required to understand the context in which neuromodulation may be beneficial. Conclusions: While these positive effects are observed, limitations included unequal representation of neuromodulation modalities in the literature, and lack of literature describing the efficacy of neuromodulation on the development or duration of persistent mTBI symptoms. Better clarity regarding neuromodulation efficacy could have a significant impact on mTBI patients, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers, facilitating a more productive post-mTBI population. Despite the limitations, the literature indicates that neuromodulation warrants further investigation. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020161279."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Mild TBI may lead to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including memory loss and motor impairment. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have a contributory role in several neurological disorders; however, their association with mitophagy in mild TBI is unclear. TBI was induced in female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats using a New York University Impactor (10 g, impactor head 2.5 mm diameter, weight drop 50 mm) and compared to sham surgery controls. The novel object recognition and error ladder tests were performed at 24 hours and for 6 weeks post injury, and the brains were examined histologically to confirm the extent of injury. Mitochondria manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I-V (CI-CV), as well as mitophagy markers, dynamin related protein 1 (DRP-1), LC3A/B and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK-1), were measured in the penumbra by western blot. At 24 hours sham rats performed as expected on a novel object recognition test while TBI rats showed cognitive deficits at the early time points. TBI rats also showed more early motor deficits on a horizontal ladder, compared with the sham rats. MnSOD, OXPHOS CI, CIII and CV protein levels were significantly lower in the TBI group at 24 hours. DRP-1, LC3A/B I and II, and PINK-1 were increased at 6 weeks suggesting abnormal mitophagy. Moderate TBI caused immediate cognitive and mild motor functional deficits in the rats that did not persist. Reduced antioxidative capacity and possibly compromised mitochondrial function may affect the long term functional recovery."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to the increased rates of suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder in military personnel and veterans, and it is also associated with the risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. A cross-phenotype high-resolution polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PCS) was conducted in 845 U.S. Army soldiers who sustained TBI during their deployment. We used a prospective longitudinal survey of three brigade combat teams to assess deployment-acquired TBI and persistent physical, cognitive, and emotional PCS. PRS was derived from summary statistics of large genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (MDD); and for years of schooling, college completion, childhood intelligence, infant head circumference (IHC), and adult intracranial volume. Although our study had more than 95% of statistical power to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes, no association was observed with neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, suggesting that persistent PCS does not share genetic components with these traits to a moderate-to-large degree. We observed a significant finding: subjects with high IHC PRS recovered better from cognitive/emotional persistent PCS than the other individuals (R2 = 1.11%; p = 3.37 × 10-3). Enrichment analysis identified two significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to this result: GO:0050839∼Cell adhesion molecule binding (p = 8.9 × 10-6) and GO:0050905∼Neuromuscular process (p = 9.8 × 10-5). In summary, our study indicated that the genetic predisposition to persistent PCS after TBI does not have substantial overlap with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, but mechanisms related to early brain growth may be involved."

            "abstract": "Delirium is the most common manifestation of brain dysfunction in critically ill patients. In the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of delirium is independently predictive of excess death, length of stay, cost of care, and acquired dementia. There are numerous neurotransmitter/functional and/or injury-causing hypotheses rather than a unifying mechanism for delirium. Without using a validated delirium instrument, delirium can be misdiagnosed (under, but also overdiagnosed and trivialized), supporting the recommendation to use a monitoring instrument routinely. The best-validated ICU bedside instruments are CAM-ICU and ICDSC, both of which also detect subsyndromal delirium. Both tools have some inherent limitations in the neurologically injured patients, yet still provide valuable information about delirium once the sequelae of the primary injury settle into a new post-injury baseline. Now it is known that antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications do not reliably improve brain function in critically ill delirious patients. ICU teams should systematically screen for predisposing and precipitating factors. These include exacerbations of cardiac/respiratory failure or sepsis, metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, dysnatremia, uremia and ammonemia) receipt of psychoactive medications, and sensory deprivation through prolonged immobilization, uncorrected vision and hearing deficits, poor sleep hygiene, and isolation from loved ones so common during COVID-19 pandemic. The ABCDEF (A2F) bundle is a means to facilitate implementation of the 2018 Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS) Guidelines. In over 25,000 patients across nearly 100 institutions, the A2F bundle has been shown in a dose-response fashion (i.e., greater bundle compliance) to yield improved survival, length of stay, coma and delirium duration, cost, and less ICU bounce-backs and discharge to nursing homes."

            "abstract": "The majority of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustain a mild injury (mTBI). One out of 4 patients experiences persistent complaints, despite their often normal neuropsychological test results and the absence of structural brain damage on conventional neuroimaging. Susceptibility to develop persistent complaints is thought to be affected by interindividual differences in adaptation, which can also be influenced by preinjury psychological factors. Coping is a key construct of adaptation and refers to strategies to deal with new situations and serious life events. An important element of coping is the ability to regulate emotions and stress. The prefrontal cortex is a crucial area in this regulation process, given that it exerts a top-down influence on the amygdala and other subcortical structures involved in emotion processing. However, little is known about the role of the prefrontal cortex and associated brain networks in emotion regulation and adaptation post-mTBI. Especially, the influence of prefrontal dysfunction on development of persistent postconcussive complaints is poorly understood. In this article, we aim to integrate findings from functional and structural MRI studies on this topic. Alterations within the default mode, executive and salience network have been found in relation to complaints post-mTBI. Dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex may impair network dynamics for emotion regulation and adaptation post-mTBI, resulting in persistent post-concussive complaints."

Given neuropathological changes associated with prolonged stress, such as occurs with repeated sexual abuse (SA), it seems possible that individuals who experienced SA might be predisposed to greater deficits after MTBI. Four groups of subjects were administered measures of cognitive and emotional functioning. These groups were those with MTBI (n = 10), those with a history of SA (n = 10), those with both MTBI and SA (n = 10), and normal control (NC) subjects (n = 10). Compared to the NC subjects, those with MTBI demonstrated deficits in working memory, those with SA demonstrated deficits in executive functioning, and those with both MTBI and SA demonstrated the greatest number of deficits which were in working memory, executive functioning and memory. Tests of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, while demonstrating significant symptoms in all clinical groups, did not correlate with the neuropsychological tests that differentiated the groups."

The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate clinical markers of NS in a sample of New Zealand adults following mTBI. Research design: Cross-sectional study. Methods and procedures: A community-based sample of 151 adults who had experienced a brain injury in the last two weeks completed assessments estimating cognitive functioning, postconcussion symptoms (including NS), and affective state. Results: Over half the sample (59%) reported some degree of NS. Exploratory statistical analyses indicated that NS was associated with being female, living in a rural area, number of previous brain injuries, cognitive flexibility scores, reaction time, perceptions of recovery, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses revealed that anxiety was the dominant correlate of NS (B = .120, p < .001, 95% CI [0.069, 1.71]). Conclusions: As the first study to explore the correlates of NS following mild TBI, the findings have important clinical and research implications. The present findings suggest that treatment approaches targeting anxiety may be effective in reducing NS in people who have experienced a brain injury. Moreover, evidence is presented suggesting that NS is unlikely to reflect malingering, and should be treated as a genuine somatic symptom of brain injury."

            "abstract": "The postconcussion syndrome following mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) has been regarded as a mostly benign syndrome that typically resolves in the immediate months following injury. However, in some individuals, symptoms become chronic and persistent. This has been a striking feature of the mostly blast-related mTBIs that have been seen in veterans returning from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In these veterans a chronic syndrome with features of both the postconcussion syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder has been prominent. Animal modeling of blast-related TBI has developed rapidly over the last decade leading to advances in the understanding of blast pathophysiology. However, most studies have focused on acute to subacute effects of blast on the nervous system and have typically studied higher intensity blast exposures with energies more comparable to that involved in human moderate to severe TBI. Fewer animal studies have addressed the chronic effects of lower level blast exposures that are more comparable to those involved in human mTBI or subclinical blast. Here we describe a rat model of repetitive low-level blast exposure that induces a variety of anxiety and PTSD-related behavioral traits including exaggerated fear responses that were present when animals were tested between 28 and 35 weeks after the last blast exposure. These animals provide a model to study the chronic and persistent behavioral effects of blast including the relationship of PTSD to mTBI in dual diagnosis veterans."

Although alcohol consumption itself incurs a risk of neurological damage, it is also a significant risk factor for traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI among young adults is described as a modern healthcare epidemic. The drastic changes occurring within their neurological networks put young adults at greater risk for developing long-term post-traumatic deficits. Contradictory findings have been indicated regarding the effects of alcohol consumption on TBI outcomes in adults, with some studies demonstrating detrimental effects, whereas others suggest neuroprotective abilities. However, little is known about the effects of alcohol consumption on TBI outcomes during the sensitive stage of early adulthood. Young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions: Pre-injury alcohol+TBI; Pre-injury alcohol+Sham; Pre- and Post-injury alcohol+TBI; Pre- and Post-injury alcohol+Sham; No alcohol+TBI; No alcohol+Sham. Alcohol consumption groups received an amount of 10% v/v ethanol solution based on the animals' weight. Following the injury, the rats were subjected to a behavioral test battery to assess post-concussive symptomology. Overall, chronic binge drinking significantly improved TBI outcomes related to motor coordination and balance, whereas binge drinking in general significantly decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, in many cases, chronic binge drinking appears to return the TBI animal's behavioral outcomes to levels comparable to those of the no alcohol sham animals. Thus, the results suggest that alcohol may exhibit neuroprotective abilities in the context of early adulthood TBI."

In the forced swimming test, control rats had reduced motility and showed a depression-like behavior, as expected. In contrast, rats with bilateral lesions of the lateral habenula presented (on day 2) an increased motility over that of the controls, which suggested the presence of hyperactivity and antidepression effect. In addition, the spontaneous activity of the lesioned rats was elevated. We then examined the cognitive deficits in these hyperactive rats. In the contextual fear conditioning, the habenula-lesioned rats did not show the expected freezing and remained hyperactive. In the Morris water maze test, the lesioned rats performed poorly while showing a decreased motor activity. In the active avoidance test, there was no difference in the rate of avoidance between operated and control rats; however, once they failed to change compartments upon the cue, the operated rats tended to remain in the same compartment as under shock, thus showing hypoactivity. In summary, in the lesioned animals the hyperactivity that counteracts the depression-like effect is persistent or inadequately modified in the course of cognitive tasks. We suggest that the lateral habenula is required for regulating emotional influences on locomotor activity, so that the animal's behavior is singularly adapted to different cognitive tasks."

Diffuse axonal injury is a common finding after TBI, and is presumed to contribute to outcomes, but may not always be apparent using standard neuroimaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a more recent method of assessing axonal integrity in vivo. The primary objective of the current investigation was to characterize white matter integrity utilizing DTI across the spectrum of chronic TBI of all severities. A secondary objective was to examine the relationship between white matter integrity and cognition. Twenty mild, 17 moderate to severe TBI and 18 controls underwent DTI and neuropsychological testing. Fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were calculated from the DTI data. Fractional anisotropy was the primary measure of white matter integrity. Region of interest analysis included anterior and posterior corona radiata, cortico-spinal tracts, cingulum fibre bundles, external capsule, forceps minor and major, genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and sagittal stratum. Cognitive domain scores were calculated from executive, attention and memory testing. Decreased fractional anisotropy was found in all 13 regions of interest for the moderate to severe TBI group, but only in the cortico-spinal tract, sagittal stratum and superior longitudinal fasciculus for the mild TBI group. White Matter Load (a measure of the total number of regions with reduced FA) was negatively correlated with all cognitive domains. Analysis of radial and axial diffusivity values suggested that all severities of TBI can result in a degree of axonal damage, while irreversible myelin damage was only apparent for moderate to severe TBI. The present data emphasize that white matter changes exist on a spectrum, including mild TBI. An index of global white matter neuropathology (White Matter Load) was related to cognitive function, such that greater white matter pathology predicted greater cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, mild TBI white matter changes may be primarily due to axonal damage as opposed to myelin damage. The more severe injuries impact both. DTI provides an objective means for determining the relationship of cognitive deficits to TBI, even in cases where the injury was sustained years prior to the evaluation."

The annual prevalence of NCSE is estimated to reach 10 to 20 cases in every 100,000 people. While almost half of all SE cases are nonconvulsive, there are several different types of NCSE: 1) epileptic absence SE, 2) epileptic focal seizure SE with consciousness disturbance (complex partial SE), 3) de novo NCSE of late onset, 4) NCSE due to acute brain injury or prolonged consciousness disturbance after convulsive SE. An electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation is necessary to diagnose NCSE. However, continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring over at least 24 hours is preferable to detect NCSE, as cognitive disturbances due to this condition may fluctuate over time. In addition, neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI with arterial spin labeled sequences or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate hyperperfused areas in cases of focal onset. Thus, patients presenting with alternative cognitive disturbance with or without mild confusion should be evaluated using cEEG monitoring or blood flow imaging so as not to overlook treatable NCSE."

            "abstract": "Constructs from positive psychology were employed to create an explicit model of caregiver resilience. Predictive and mediating relationships among resilience and related variables (personality, coping, self-efficacy, hope, social support) were then tested for their association with burden and psychological adjustment among family members caring for relatives with severe TBI. Family participants (n = 131) from six rehabilitation units from New South Wales and Queensland completed assessments which elicited explanatory (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Ways of Coping Questionnaire), mediating (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Herth Hope Scale, Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey), and caregiver outcome (Caregiver Burden Scale, Mental Health sub-Scale-SF36, General Health Questionnaire, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale) variables. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that resilience had a direct effect on positive affect in caregivers. Resilience also played a protective role in relation to two variables associated with caregiver vulnerability: an indirect association with caregiver burden mediated through social support; a direct effect on hope, which, in turn, was associated with positive mental health. Positive mental health then played a buffering role in relation to psychological distress and negative affect. Resilience, in combination with other psychological attributes, was associated with reduced morbidity among family caregivers after severe TBI."

The present study examined psychological flexibility, as a hypothesized psychological mechanism, in 169 treatment-seeking adults with mTBI. Research Method/Design: Participants completed self-report measures of postconcussion symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety, stress, and depression) and functional status within four weeks of entry to an mTBI outpatient clinic. A general measure (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire), as well as a context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Acquired Brain Injury) measure of psychological flexibility were administered. Results: Simple linear regression analysis showed that psychological flexibility made a significant contribution to the prediction of postconcussion symptoms and functional status. A series of multiple mediation analyses also found that psychological flexibility had a significant indirect effect on the relationships between psychological distress and postconcussion symptoms, and functional status. The context-specific, rather than the general measure of psychological flexibility, was consistently shown to contribute to these findings. Conclusions/Implications: These results suggest that psychological flexibility is a psychological mechanism that contributes to recovery outcomes in individuals with mTBI and could therefore be an important treatment target in mTBI interventions.

            "abstract": "Chronic pain with mood disorder, resulting from a peripheral nerve injury, is a serious clinical problem affecting the quality of life. A lack of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and abnormal intercellular signaling in the brain can mediate this symptom. BDNF is induced in cultured neurons by 4-methylcatechol (4-MC), but little is known about its role in pain-emotion. Thus, we characterized the actions of 4-MC on TrkB receptor-related pERK and BDNF mRNA in discreet brain regions related to pain-emotion after chronic pain in rat. Rats implanted with a stainless steel cannula into the lateral ventricular were subjected to chronic constriction injury (CCI). Pain was assessed by changes in paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to heat stimuli after CCI. Immobility time during the forced swimming testing was measured for depression-like behavior. Analgesic and antidepression modulations with 4-MC were examined by an anti-BDNF antibody (K252a, a TrkB receptor inhibitor). The animals were perfused and fixed (4% paraformaldehyde) for immunohistochemistry analysis (c-FOS/pERK). BDNF mRNA expression (anterior cingulate cortex) was determined using reverse transcription-PCR. Rats showed a sustained decrease in PWL, associated with a prolonged immobility time after CCI. 4-MC reduced decreases in PWL and increased immobility time. 4-MC reduced increases in pERK immunoreactivity and decreases in BDNF mRNA expression in regions related to pain and the limbic system. Anti-BDNF blocked effects induced by 4-MC. We suggest that a lack of BDNF associated with activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the pain-emotion network may be involved in depression-like behavior during chronic pain. 4-MC ameliorates pain-emotion symptoms by inducing BDNF and normalizing pERK activities."

Mental health measures included the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with TBI reported more dysexecutive and mental health problems, without differences in risky sexual behaviour. In individuals with TBI, risky sexual behaviour was associated with behavioural, cognitive and emotional dysexecutive problems, but not with anxiety or depression.

The consequences of TBI during pregnancy (gravida TBI; gTBI) on offspring development is unknown, for which stress and inflammation during pregnancy worsen fetal developmental outcomes. We hypothesized that gTBI would lead to increased anxiety- and depression-related behavior, altered inflammatory responses and gut pathology, and distorted brain circuitry in mixed-sex offspring compared to mice born to control mothers. Pregnant dams received either diffuse TBI or sham injury (control) 12 days post-coitum. We found that male gTBI offspring were principal drivers of the gTBI effects on health, physiology, and behavior. For example, male, but not female, gTBI offspring weighed significantly less at weaning compared to male control offspring. At post-natal day (PND) 28, gTBI offspring had significantly weaker intralaminar connectivity onto layer 5 pre-frontal pyramidal neurons compared to control offspring. Neurological performance on anxiety-like behaviors was decreased, with only marginal differences in depressive-like behaviors, for gTBI offspring compared to control offspring. At PND42 and PND58, circulating neutrophil and monocyte populations were significantly smaller in gTBI male offspring than control male offspring. In response to a subsequent inflammatory challenge at PND75, gTBI offspring had significantly smaller circulating neutrophil populations than control offspring. Anxiety-like behaviors persisted during the immune challenge in gTBI offspring. However, spleen immune response and gut histology showed no significant differences between groups.

An L1-regularization path algorithm was used to select optimal sets of baseline and concurrent symptom measures for prediction of scores on the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Multi-variable linear regression models (all n = 744-894) were then fit to evaluate associations between the empirically selected predictors and SWLS scores at each follow-up visit. Results indicated that emotional post-TBI symptoms (all b = -1.27 to -0.77, all p < 0.05), anhedonia (all b = -1.59 to -1.08, all p < 0.01), and pain interference (all b = -1.38 to -0.89, all p < 0.001) contributed to the prediction of lower SWLS scores at all follow-ups.

Studies in both acute (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI)) and chronic (e.g., dementia, Parkinson's disease) neurological disorders demonstrated a high frequency of both depression and apathy. Studies in stroke and TBI reported a significant association between lesion location and depression. Both depression and apathy are significant predictors of poor recovery among patients with brain injuries, and of steeper cognitive and functional decline among patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Poor insight and judgment are frequently found among patients with brain injury or degeneration. There is increasing evidence that damage to specific brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, is associated with inappropriate emotional reactions in social contexts and diminished anxiety and concern for the future. In severe cases, behavioural changes may also include poor decision-making in the social realm, deficits in goal-directed behavior, and lack of insight into these changes. Future studies will validate specific diagnostic criteria for the various cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems reported among patients with neurological disorders, which may result in more specific and effective treatments."

            "abstract": "Radiation therapy of the CNS, even at low doses, can lead to deficits in neurocognitive functions. Reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis is usually, but not always, associated with cognitive deficits resulting from radiation therapy. Generation of reactive oxygen species is considered the main cause of radiation-induced tissue injuries, and elevated levels of oxidative stress persist long after the initial cranial irradiation. Consequently, mutant mice with reduced levels of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD or Sod2), are expected to be more sensitive to radiation-induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions. In this study, we showed that MnSOD deficiency led to reduced generation of immature neurons in Sod2-/+ mice even though progenitor cell proliferation was not affected. Compared to irradiated Sod2+/+ mice, which showed cognitive defects and reduced differentiation of newborn cells towards the neuronal lineage, irradiated Sod2-/+ mice showed normal hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions and normal differentiation pattern for newborn neurons and astroglia. However, we also observed a disproportional decrease in newborn neurons in irradiated Sod2-/+ following behavioral studies, suggesting that MnSOD deficiency may render newborn neurons more sensitive to stress from behavioral trainings following cranial irradiation. A positive correlation between normal cognitive functions and normal dendritic spine densities in dentate granule cells was observed. The data suggest that maintenance of synaptic connections, via maintenance of dendritic spines, may be important for normal cognitive functions following cranial irradiation."

But few studies have used a broad conceptual approach to examine children's long-term psychosocial outcomes. This study examines children's psychosocial outcomes at 4-years after mild TBI and associated factors.Methods: Parents of 93 children (<16 years) with mild TBI completed subscales of age-appropriate versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and the Adolescent Scale of Participation questionnaire at 4-years post-injury.Results: Mean group-level scores were statistically significantly higher for hyperactivity/inattention and lower for emotional functioning than published norms. Levels of participation were greater compared to those observed in normative samples. More than 19% met published criteria for clinically significant hyperactivity/inattention, emotional functioning problems, peer relationship problems, and social functioning difficulties. Lower family socio-economic status and greater parental anxiety and depression were associated with overall psychosocial difficulties.Conclusions: Findings indicate that as a group, children with mild TBI are characterized by elevated rates of behavioral, emotional, and social difficulties at 4-years post-injury. Parent mental health may be an untapped opportunity to support children's psychosocial development following mild TBI, with replication required in larger samples."

            "abstract": "More than 75% of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) report chronic pain whose potential detrimental effects on cognitive recovery need to be identified. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between pain, performance on a working memory task, gray matter density, and mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-DLPFC) activation in subjects with a MTBI. For comparison purposes, we performed identical correlation analyses with a group of subjects without MTBI who sustained sports injuries. Twenty-four subjects who experienced a MTBI in the past 12 months, 16 control subjects, and 29 subjects with sport injuries were included. One hour prior to entering the magnetic resonance scanner, the subjects were asked to fill out the pain Visual Analogue Scale. Subsequently, a high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired followed by a functional magnetic resonance imaging session using the visual externally ordered working memory task. Results showed that MTBI subjects reporting severe pain in the hour preceding the testing had reduced mid-DLPFC activation during the working memory task and poorer performance on the task. Subjects with sport injuries and severe levels of pain showed the reverse pattern: pain was associated with higher activation in the mid-DLPFC and did not correlate with performance. Gray matter density measures were independent of pain level. This study showed that behavioral performance and cerebral functioning are affected by pain after a MTBI. Moreover, this study suggests that pain, cognition, and cerebral functioning interactions could not easily be generalized from one clinical population to another."

Fourteen children with TBI and 14 controls ages 10-18 had DTI scans and neurocognitive evaluations at 6-12 months post-injury. Groups did not differ in intelligence, but children with TBI showed slower processing speed, working memory and executive deficits, and greater behavioral dysregulation. The TBI group had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in three WM regions: inferior frontal, superior frontal, and supracallosal. There were no group differences in corpus callosum. FA in the frontal and supracallosal regions was correlated with executive functioning. Supracallosal FA was also correlated with motor speed. Behavior ratings showed correlations with supracallosal FA. Parent-reported executive deficits were inversely correlated with FA.

Grief associated with the death of a loved one is related to increases in proinflammatory cytokines, yet it is not clear whether this is the case for grief experienced by individuals caring for a significant other with TBI. The purpose of this cross-sectional, exploratory study was to examine grief and its association with a proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), in wives/partners caring for veterans with TBI. Participants completed written measures of grief, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms and provided morning saliva samples for TNF-α analysis. Participants reported levels of grief comparable to those reported in studies evaluating individuals grieving the death of a loved one. Path analysis revealed that grief was not associated with TNF-α; however, participants reporting high levels of blame/anger, a subscale of the grief scale, had higher levels of TNF-α. In addition, both grief and blame/anger were related to increased perceived stress and depressive symptoms; however, path analysis demonstrated that perceived stress and depressive symptoms did not mediate the influence of blame/anger on TNF-α. These findings suggest that blame/anger associated with grief may be related to the elevations in TNF-α exhibited by individuals caring for a loved one with TBI."

            "abstract": "Prior studies raise questions about whether persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS) are differentiable from mental health sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI). To investigate whether PCS represented a distinct symptom domain, we evaluated the structure of post-concussive and psychological symptoms using data from The Army STARRS Pre/Post Deployment Study, a panel survey of three U.S. Army Brigade Combat Teams that deployed to Afghanistan. Data from 1229 participants who sustained probable TBI during deployment completed ratings of past-30-day post-concussive, posttraumatic stress, and depressive symptoms three months after their return. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA; n = 300) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; n = 929) of symptom ratings were performed in independent subsamples. EFA suggested a model with 3 correlated factors resembling PCS, posttraumatic stress, and depression. CFA confirmed adequate fit of the 3-factor model (CFI = .964, RMSEA = .073 [.070, .075]), contingent upon allowing theoretically defensible cross-loadings. Bifactor CFA indicated that variance in all symptoms was explained by a general factor (λ = .36-.93), but also provided evidence of domain factors defined by (a) reexperiencing/hyperarousal, (b) cognitive/somatic symptoms, and (c) depressed mood/anhedonia. Soldiers with more severe TBI had higher cognitive/somatic scores, whereas soldiers with more deployment stress had higher general and reexperiencing/hyperarousal scores. Thus, variance in PCS is attributable to both a specific cognitive/somatic symptom factor and a general factor that also explains variance in posttraumatic stress and depression. Measurement of specific domains representing cognitive/somatic symptoms, reexperiencing/hyperarousal, and depressed mood/anhedonia may help clarify the relative severity of PCS, posttraumatic stress, and depression among individuals with recent TBI.

Eight patients with a left cortical lesion, six patients with a right cortical lesion, four patients with basal ganglia lesions (2 left and 2 right) and ten healthy volunteers were evaluated daily on measures of salivary cortisol levels and subjective feelings of joy and sadness at 0700, 1200, 1600 and 1900 hours over a 15-day period. Patients with cortical brain lesions presented higher cortisol levels and higher scores of sadness at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am), when compared to healthy volunteers and patients with basal ganglia lesions. Laterality of the lesion was not related to cortisol secretion, but frontal damage (anterior lesion) was associated with higher cortisol levels at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am) when compared to more posterior damage. There was no significant correlation between basal circulating levels of cortisol and emotional states in patients and healthy subjects. The results of this study suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation is associated with unilateral injury particularly in frontal areas.

We adopted a data-driven, exploratory analysis in source space using phase locking value across different frequency bands. We observed a significant reduction in functional connectivity in band-specific networks in mTBI compared with control subjects. These networks spanned multiple cortical regions involved in the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is thought to subserve memory and attention during periods when an individual is not engaged in a specific task, and its disruption may lead to cognitive deficits after mTBI. We further applied graph theoretical analysis on the functional connectivity matrices. Our data suggest reduced local efficiency in different brain regions in mTBI patients. In conclusion, MEG can be a potential tool to investigate and detect network alterations in patients with mTBI. The value of MEG to reveal potential neurophysiological biomarkers for mTBI patients warrants further exploration."

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) results in persistent deficits in the cognitive and emotive abilities governed by the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) neurocircuitry. In this study, we observed regional variations in the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) in the MCL neurocircuitry. Although repeated MTBI (rMTBI) is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction, the persistent changes in the mtDNAcn and its manifestations in 16S rRNA levels in the MCL neurocircuitry have not been investigated. Herein, we employed the closed head weight drop paradigm to induce rMTBI in rats. We analyzed the mtDNAcn and 16S rRNA levels in eight regions of the MCL neurocircuitry 48 h and 30 days after the rMTBI. The mtDNAcn in the prefrontal cortex, cortex, hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rMTBI-exposed rats was decreased at both the time points. Although the mtDNAcn was reduced in hypothalamus and amygdala at 48 h, it was increased at 30 days post rMTBI. The 16S rRNA levels and mtDNAcn were altered in all the regions, with the exception of bed nucleus of stria terminalis and the VTA. Moreover, the rMTBI did not affect the mtDNAcn and 16S rRNA levels in nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that the repetitive trauma induces persistent changes in the mtDNAcn which are manifested as aberrations in mitochondrial transcription in the brain areas crucial for emotion and cognition."

Previously, using several animal models, it was demonstrated that single treatment with delta-opioid receptor agonists produced an antidepressant-like effect. This study examined the antidepressant effects resulting from subchronic exposure for 8 days to the delta-opioid receptor agonist SNC80 in an OBX rat model of depression. The olfactory bulbs were removed by suction. The emotionality of rats was measured by scoring their responses to given stimuli, i.e., attack, startle, struggle, and fight responses. The OBX rats chronically treated with vehicle for 7 days at 14 days following surgery showed a significant increase in emotionality score and a decrease in the time spent and entries in the open arm of a plus-maze. In the case of OBX rats, these changes were dose- and time-dependently reversed by chronic SNC80 treatment (1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) for 7 days, as same as desipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, the concentration of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala were decreased in OBX rats, and these changes were also normalized by SNC80 treatment, rather than desipramine treatment. In addition, SNC80 also significantly reversed the loss of TH-positive cells produced by OBX in the dorsal raphe. In conclusion, we demonstrated that subchronic SNC80 treatment could completely reverse OBX-induced behavioral abnormalities and defects in serotonergic function."

Ten adolescents (three girls and seven boys) seen at the Montreal Children's Hospital Concussion Clinic participated in this case series. Adolescents who were symptomatic more than 4 weeks after the injury were provided with an active rehabilitation intervention (M = 7.9 weeks following injury; range = 3.7 to 26.2 weeks). The rehabilitation program includes gradual, closely monitored light aerobic exercise, general coordination exercises, mental imagery, as well as reassurance, normalization of recovery, and stress/anxiety reduction strategies. The program continued until complete symptom resolution and readiness to begin stepwise return to activities. The primary outcome of the study was evolution of post-concussion symptoms. Secondary outcomes included mood, energy, balance, and cognition. After the intervention, post-concussion symptoms significantly decreased for the group of participants. They also had decreased fatigue and improved mood after 6 weeks of initiating the rehabilitation intervention. This case series shows that postconcussive symptoms and functioning in adolescents following sports-related concussion can be improved after participation in an active rehabilitation intervention. The introduction of graded light intensity exercise in the post-acute period following concussion is safe, feasible and appears to have a positive impact on adolescents' functioning."

Subjective responses to the emotional stimuli were also obtained. Additionally, surface electrodes measured cardiac and respiratory signals to compute heart rate variability (HRV), from which measures of parasympathetic activity, the respiratory frequency area (RFA) and sympathetic activity, the low frequency area (LFA), of the HRV frequency spectrum were derived. The Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised (NRS-R) and the King-Devick (KD) test were administered to assess neurobehavioral dysfunction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The two groups showed no differences in subjective ratings of emotional intensity.

Most of the subjects did not show agitation, anxiety, depression, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, decreased motivation or mental fatiguability on the NRS-R. However, 13/16 subjects with TBI demonstrated attention difficulty on the NRS-R which was positively correlated with the increased sympathetic activity during sad stimuli. Both attention difficulty and abnormal autonomic responses to sad stimuli were correlated with the timing on the KD test, which reflected difficulty with visual attention shifting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The HRV spectrum may be useful to identify subclinical emotional dysfunction in individuals with TBI.

This study contained seven randomized controlled trials that published before April 5, 2020 in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. The rTMS had significant anti-depressant effect (SMD = 1.03, p = 0.02), but the effects dissipated at 1-month follow-up (SMD = 0.39, p = 0.62). In the subgroup analysis, only applying rTMS to left DLPFC area of post-TBI patients showed significant anti-depressant effect (SMD = 0.98, p = 0.04).

            "abstract": "This paper broadly reviews the study of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), across the spectrum of neuroimaging modalities. Among the range of imaging methods, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unique in its applicability to studying both structure and function. Thus we additionally performed meta-analyses of MRI results to examine 1) the issue of anatomical variability and consistency for functional MRI (fMRI) findings, 2) the analogous issue of anatomical consistency for white-matter findings, and 3) the importance of accounting for the time post injury in diffusion weighted imaging reports. As we discuss, the human neuroimaging literature consists of both small and large studies spanning acute to chronic time points that have examined both structural and functional changes with mTBI, using virtually every available medical imaging modality. Two key commonalities have been used across the majority of imaging studies. The first is the comparison between mTBI and control populations. The second is the attempt to link imaging results with neuropsychological assessments. Our fMRI meta-analysis demonstrates a frontal vulnerability to mTBI, demonstrated by decreased signal in prefrontal cortex compared to controls. This vulnerability is further highlighted by examining the frequency of reported mTBI white matter anisotropy, in which we show a strong anterior-to-posterior gradient (with anterior regions being more frequently reported in mTBI). Our final DTI meta-analysis examines a debated topic arising from inconsistent anisotropy findings across studies. Our results support the hypothesis that acute mTBI is associated with elevated anisotropy values and chronic mTBI complaints are correlated with depressed anisotropy. Thus, this review and set of meta-analyses demonstrate several important points about the ongoing use of neuroimaging to understand the functional and structural changes that occur throughout the time course of mTBI recovery. Based on the complexity of mTBI, however, much more work in this area is required to characterize injury mechanisms and recovery factors and to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for diagnosis."

Semi-structured interviews were held, during which each participant was requested to describe the communication of their spouse with MTBI. The content obtained from the interviews was subjected to a discourse analysis. The results show that both participants perceived changes in the communication of their spouse following the MTBI. The results further show that MTBI affected communication of the two individuals in different ways.

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common but accurate diagnosis and defining criteria for mild TBI and its clinical consequences have been problematic. Mild TBI causes transient neurophysiologic brain dysfunction, sometimes with structural axonal and neuronal damage. Biomarkers, such as newer imaging technologies and protein markers, are promising indicators of brain injury but are not ready for clinical use. Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria regarding depth and duration of impaired consciousness and amnesia. These criteria are particularly difficult to confirm at the least severe end of the mild TBI continuum, especially when relying on subjective, retrospective accounts. The postconcussive syndrome is a controversial concept because of varying criteria, inconsistent symptom clusters and the evidence that similar symptom profiles occur with other disorders, and even in a proportion of healthy individuals. The clinical consequences of mild TBI can be conceptualized as two multidimensional disorders: (1) a constellation of acute symptoms that might be termed early phase post-traumatic disorder (e.g., headache, dizziness, imbalance, fatigue, sleep disruption, impaired cognition), that typically resolve in days to weeks and are largely related to brain trauma and concomitant injuries; (2) a later set of symptoms, a late phase post-traumatic disorder, evolving out of the early phase in a minority of patients, with a more prolonged (months to years), sometimes worsening set of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms. The later phase disorder is highly influenced by a variety of psychosocial factors and has little specificity for brain injury, although a history of multiple concussions seems to increase the risk of more severe and longer duration symptoms. Effective early phase management may prevent or limit the later phase disorder and should include education about symptoms and expectations for recovery, as well as recommendations for activity modifications. Later phase treatment should be informed by thoughtful differential diagnosis and the multiplicity of premorbid and comorbid conditions that may influence symptoms. Treatment should incorporate a hierarchical, sequential approach to symptom management, prioritizing problems with significant functional impact and effective, available interventions (e.g., headache, depression, anxiety, insomnia, vertigo)."

Cortical brain features and fibertract data from the following regions or tracts most contributed to the classification accuracy: Bilateral superior temporal, inferior parietal and posterior cingulate; right lateral occipital, uncinate, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. A post-hoc analysis showed that compared to incorrectly classified persistent post-traumatic headache patients, those who were correctly classified as having persistent post-traumatic headache had more severe physical, autonomic, anxiety and depression symptoms, were more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and were more likely to have had mild traumatic brain injury attributed to blasts.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      A classification model that included a combination of questionnaire data and structural imaging parameters classified individual patients as having migraine versus persistent post-traumatic headache with good accuracy. The most important clinical measures that contributed to the classification accuracy included questions on mood. Regional brain structures and fibertracts that play roles in pain processing and pain integration were important brain features that contributed to the classification accuracy. The lower classification accuracy for patients with persistent post-traumatic headache compared to migraine may be related to greater heterogeneity of patients in the persistent post-traumatic headache cohort regarding their traumatic brain injury mechanisms, and physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms."

            "abstract": "Persons with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) often exhibit persistent emotional impairments, particularly depression, fearfulness, and anxiety, that significantly diminish quality of life. Studying these mood disorders in animal models of mild TBI can help provide insight into possible therapies. We have previously reported that mice show increased depression, fearfulness, and anxiety, as well as visual and motor deficits, after focal cranial blast and that treatment with the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) inverse agonist, SMM-189, reduces these deficits. We have further shown that raloxifene, which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved as an estrogen receptor modulator to treat osteoporosis, but also possesses CB2 inverse agonism, yields a similar benefit for visual deficits in this model of TBI. Here, we have extended our studies of raloxifene benefit and show that it similarly reverses depression, fearfulness, and anxiety after focal cranial blast TBI in mice, using standard assays of these behavioral end-points. These results indicate the potential of raloxifene in the broad rescue of deficits after mild TBI and support phase 2 efficacy testing in human clinical trials."

            "abstract": "While the duration and severity of post-traumatic confusional state (PTCS) after traumatic brain injury have well-established implications for long-term outcomes, little is known about the underlying pathophysiology and their role in functional outcomes. Here, we analyzed the delta-to-alpha frequency band power ratios (DAR) from localized scalp areas derived from standard resting electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during eyes closed state in 49 patients diagnosed with PTCS. Higher global, occipital, parietal, and temporal DARs were significantly associated with the severity of PTCS, as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Protocol (CAP) observed on the same day, after controlling for injury severity. Also, occipital DARs were positively associated with both the CAP disorientation score 2, and the CAP symptom fluctuation score 4, after controlling for injury severity (n = 35). Posterior DARs were significantly associated with Functional Independence Measure-cognitive subscale average score at 1 (n = 45), 2 (n = 42), and 5 (n = 34) year(s) post-injury. The associations at 1 (temporal left) and 2 (parietal left) years survive after controlling for an injury severity index. Our finding that posterior DAR is a marker of PTCS and functional recovery post-injury, likely reflects functional de-afferentation of the posterior medial complex (PMC) in PTCS. Altered function of the PMC is proposed as a unifying physiological mechanism underlying both acute and chronic confusional states. We discuss the relationship of these findings to electrophysiological markers associated with disorders of consciousness."

As such, premature consumption of high-sugar foods has been associated to early onset of detrimental outcomes, whereas underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether early and sustained exposure to high-sucrose diet promotes metabolic disturbances that ultimately might anticipate neurological injuries. At postnatal day 21, weaned male rats started to be fed a standard chow (10 % sucrose, CTR) or a high-sucrose diet (25 % sucrose, HSD) for 9 weeks prior to euthanasia at postnatal day 90. HSD did not alter weight gain and feed efficiency between groups, but increased visceral, non-visceral and brown adipose tissue accumulation. HSD rats demonstrated elevated blood glucose levels in both fasting and fed states, which were associated to impaired glucose tolerance. Peripheral insulin sensitivity did not change, whereas hepatic insulin resistance was supported by increased serum triglyceride levels, as well as higher TyG index values. Assessment of hippocampal gene expression showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways were activated in HSD rats, as compared to CTR. HSD rats had overexpression of unfolded protein response sensors, PERK and ATF6; ER chaperone, PDIA2 and apoptosis-related genes, CHOP and Caspase 3; but decreased expression of chaperone GRP78. Finally, HSD rats demonstrated impaired neuromuscular function and anxious behavior, but preserved cognitive parameters. In conclusion, our data indicate that early exposure to HSD promote metabolic disturbances, which disrupt hippocampus homeostasis and might precociously affect its neurobehavioral functions."

Understanding the long-term impact of TBI is complicated by the nonspecific nature of postconcussive symptoms (PCSs) and the high rates of co-occurrence among TBI, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. The goal of the present research was to examine the relations among TBI, persistent PCSs, and symptoms of PTSD and depression among returning OEF/OIF veterans.\n## METHOD\n213 OEF/OIF veterans (87% male) completed a semistructured screening interview assessing deployment-related TBI and current, persistent PCSs. Participants also completed self-report measures of combat exposure and current symptoms of PTSD and depression.\n## RESULTS\nNearly half (46%) of sampled veterans screened positive for TBI, the majority of whom (85%) reported at least one persistent PCS after removing PCSs that overlapped with PTSD and depression. Veterans with deployment-related TBI reported higher levels of combat exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of 3 models of the relationships among TBI, combat exposure, persistent PCSs, PTSD, and depression. Consistent with hypotheses, the best-fitting model was one in which the effects of TBI on both PTSD and depression were fully mediated by nonoverlapping persistent PCSs.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings highlight the importance of addressing persistent PCSs in order to facilitate the functional recovery of returning war veterans.\n"

In this study, we describe the profile of plasma inflammatory cytokines and explore associations between these cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes after mTBI. Patients with mTBI with negative computed tomography and orthopedic injury (OI) controls without mTBI were prospectively recruited from emergency rooms at three trauma centers. Plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured from venous whole-blood samples that were collected at enrollment (within 24 h of injury) and at 6 months after injury. Neuropsychological tests were performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the injury. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify associations between inflammatory cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes. A total of 53 mTBI and 24 OI controls were included in this study. The majority of patients were male (62.3%), and injured in motor vehicle accidents (37.7%). Plasma interleukin (IL)-2 (p = 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.01) within 24 h post-injury were significantly higher for mTBI patients compared with OI controls. Elevated plasma IL-2 at 24 h was associated with more severe 1-week post-concussive symptoms (p = 0.001). At 6 months, elevated plasma IL-10 was associated with greater depression scores (p = 0.004) and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (p = 0.001).

However, clinical observations suggest that some patients may actually show positive personality and behavioral changes following a neurological event. In the current work, we investigated neuroanatomical correlates of positive personality and behavioral changes following a discrete neurological event (e.g., stroke, benign tumor resection). Patients (N = 97) were rated by a well-known family member or friend on five domains of personality and behavior: social behavior, irascibility, hypo-emotionality, distress, and executive functioning. Ratings were acquired during the chronic epoch of recovery, when psychological status was stabilized. We identified patients who showed positive changes in personality and behavior in one or more domains of functioning. Lesion analyses indicated that positive changes in personality and behavior were most consistently related to damage to the bilateral frontal polar regions and the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal region. These findings support the conclusion that improvements in personality and behavior can occur after a neurological event, and that such changes have systematic neuroanatomical correlates. Patients who showed positive changes in personality and behavior following a neurological event were rated as having more disturbed functioning prior to the event. Our study may be taken as preliminary evidence that improvements in personality and behavior following a neurological event may involve dampening of (premorbidly) more extreme expressions of emotion."

Initial and longitudinal HRQOL outcomes were compared between patients who did and did not develop post-concussion syndrome (PCS).

The median time from injury to initial consultation was 6.5 days (interquartile range, 5, 11). At initial consultation, impairments in physical and cognitive HRQOL but not social or emotional HRQOL were observed. Initial symptom burden and length of recovery were associated with greater impairment in physical and cognitive HRQOL. Patients who went on to develop PCS had significantly worse physical and cognitive HRQOL at initial consultation and demonstrated a slower rate of recovery in these domains, compared with those who recovered in less than 30 days. Adolescent SRC was associated with HRQOL impairments that correlated with clinical outcomes. No persistent impairments in HRQOL were detected among patients who achieved physician-documented clinical recovery.

A study was conducted in nine MCS patients and 10 healthy control subjects to explore the degree to which passive stimulation of pictures with different emotional valences--intimate family pictures (FPs), high-stimulating pictures (HSPs), and medium-stimulating pictures (MSPs), all selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)--could elicit activation of large-scale visual networks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scaning. Good cortical activity was evoked in control subjects through visual networks, including the occipital, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, and orbito-frontal gyrus. Although the activation volume was less than that of normal control subjects, similar visual activation was found for MCS patients: six cases with FP, two cases with HSP, and three cases with MSP. We concluded that MCS patients can retain widely distributed visual cortical networks with the potential for visual cognitive function. Picture stimulation, especially with strong emotional FPs with which patients were familiar before brain injury, can elicit conscious brain activity. In this study, we have provided further evidence of the residual functional substrates in MCS patients with respect to increased cortical activity with emotional visual stimulation. The results of this study underscore the need for further research to confirm whether this type of stimulation can facilitate emergence from the MCS status."

            "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are frequently observed in patients suffering from neuropathic pain. The underlying mechanisms remained unclear. The ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO) has attracted considerable interest in its role in antidepressive effect in rodents. In the present study, we further investigated the role of the VLO in the anxiodepressive consequences of neuropathic pain in a chronic constriction injury of infraorbital nerve-induced trigeminal neuralgia (TN) mouse model. Elevated plus maze, open field, forced swimming, tail suspension, and sucrose preference tests were used to evaluate anxiodepressive-like behaviors. The results show that chemogenetic activation of bilateral VLO neurons, especially CaMK2A+ pyramidal neurons, blocked the TN-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors. Chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of VGLUT2+ or inhibition of VGAT+ VLO neurons was sufficient to produce an antianxiodepressive effect in TN mice. Pharmacological activation of D1-like receptors (D1Rs) but not D2Rs in the VLO significantly alleviated TN-induced depressive-like behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a decreased excitability of VLO excitatory neurons following neuropathic pain. Furthermore, activation of submedius thalamic nucleus-VLO (Sm-VLO) projection mimicked the antianxiodepressive effect of VLO excitation. Conversely, activation of VLO-periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) projection had no effect on TN-induced anxiodepressive behaviors. This study provides a potentially novel mechanism-based therapeutic strategy for the anxiodepressive consequences of neuropathic pain."

Although RHI are believed to increase risk for later-life neurological consequences (including chronic traumatic encephalopathy), quantitative analysis of this relationship has not yet been examined because of the lack of validated tools to quantify lifetime RHI exposure. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a metric to quantify cumulative RHI exposure from football, which we term the \"cumulative head impact index\" (CHII); 2) to use the CHII to examine the association between RHI exposure and long-term clinical outcomes; and 3) to evaluate its predictive properties relative to other exposure metrics (i.e., duration of play, age of first exposure, concussion history). Participants included 93 former high school and collegiate football players who completed objective cognitive and self-reported behavioral/mood tests as part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study. Using established cutoff scores, we transformed continuous outcomes into dichotomous variables (normal vs. impaired). The CHII was computed for each participant and derived from a combination of self-reported athletic history (i.e., number of seasons, position[s], levels played), and impact frequencies reported in helmet accelerometer studies.

Spatial working memory, evaluated by the Y-maze task performance, was also deleteriously affected by bTBI. Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis for glial markers indicated an alteration in the expression of myelin-related genes in the hippocampus and corpus callosum 1-8 weeks after bTBI. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses detected bTBI-related myelin and axonal damage in the hippocampus and corpus callosum.

Besides static symptoms, new symptoms may emerge or existing symptoms may worsen. TBI is also a risk factor for later development of neurodegenerative diseases. In rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast overpressure (BOP), robust and enduring cognitive and PTSD-related behavioral traits develop that are present for at least one year after blast exposure. Here we determined the time-course of the appearance of these traits by testing rats in the immediate post-blast period. Three cohorts of rats examined within the first eight weeks exhibited no behavioral phenotype or, in one cohort, features of anxiety. None showed the altered cued fear responses or impaired novel object recognition characteristic of the fully developed phenotype. Two cohorts retested 36 to 42 weeks after blast exposure exhibited the expanded behavioral phenotype including anxiety as well as altered cued fear learning and impaired novel object recognition. Combined with previous work, the chronic behavioral phenotype has been observed in six cohorts of blast-exposed rats studied at 3-4 months or longer after blast injury, and the three cohorts studied here document the progressive nature of the cognitive/behavioral phenotype. These studies suggest the existence of a latent, delayed emerging and progressive blast-induced cognitive and behavioral phenotype.

Male Long-Evans rats received either a single mild fluid percussion injury or a sham-injury, and either a short (24h) or long (4 weeks) post-injury recovery period. After recovery, rats underwent a detailed behavioral analysis consisting of tests for rodent anxiety, cognition, social behavior, sensorimotor function, and depression-like behavior. After testing all rats were sacrificed and brains were examined immunohistochemically with markers for microglia/macrophage activation, reactive astrocytosis, and axonal injury. Injured rats (mean injury force: 1.20 ±.03 atm) displayed significant short-term cognitive impairments in the water maze and significantly more anxiolytic-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze compared to sham controls. Neuropathological analysis of the brains of injured rats showed an acute increase in reactive astrogliosis and activated microglia in cortex and evidence of axonal injury in the corpus callosum. There were no significant long-term effects on any behavioral or neuropathological measure 4 weeks after injury. These short-term behavioral and neuropathological changes are consistent with findings in human patients suffering a brain concussion, and provide further evidence for the use of a single mild lateral fluid percussion injury to study concussion in the rat."

Main outcome measures were depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]), subjective cognitive functioning (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire [CFQ]), objective cognitive functioning, and HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]). Fifty of the initial 113 patients completed the 10 year follow-up. Twenty percent showed symptoms of depression (CES-D ≥ 16). These patients had more psychiatric symptoms at hospital discharge (p = 0.048) and were more often referred to rehabilitation or nursing homes (p = 0.015) than non-depressed patients. Further, they also had significantly lower scores in six of the eight subdomains of the SF-36. The non-depressed patients had equivalent scores to those of the Dutch norm-population on all subdomains of the SF-36. Cognitive problems at hospital discharge were related with worse cognitive outcome 10 years post-TBI, but not with depression or HRQoL. Ten years after moderate-severe TBI, only weak associations (p < 0.05) between depression scores and two objective cognitive functioning scores were found. However, there were moderate associations (p < 0.01) among depression scores, HRQoL, and subjective cognitive functioning. Therefore, signaling and treatment of depressive symptoms after moderate-severe TBI may be of major importance for optimizing HRQoL in the long term.

A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed atrophy in the frontal regions. This finding is significant because the patient has no known history of traumatic brain injury, inhalant or alcohol abuse, or prolonged exposure to gasoline. On the basis of the results of the brain imaging in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and neuropsychological testing, frontotemporal dementia was considered in the diagnosis and was thought to explain his chronic symptoms of apathy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy was implemented, with resolution of the patient's depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms of depression as well as improvement in his Mini Mental Status Examination scores."

            "abstract": "Conceptualizations of the nature of acquired personality disturbances after brain damage, especially to prefrontal cortex, have progressed from clinical observations of a large, disparate set of disturbances to theories concerning neuroanatomically-based subgroups with prefrontal damage. However, hypothesized subtypes have not yet been studied systematically. Based on our previous investigations of acquired personality disturbances, we hypothesized five subtypes of acquired personality disturbances: Executive Disturbances, Disturbed Social Behavior, Emotional Dysregulation, Hypo-emotionality/De-Energization, and Distress, as well as an undisturbed group. Subtypes were investigated in 194 adults with chronic, stable, focal lesions located in various aspects of prefrontal lobes and elsewhere in the brain, using two different cluster analysis techniques applied to ratings on the Iowa Scales of Personality Change. One technique was a hypothesis-driven approach; the other was a set of strictly empirical analyses to assess the robustness of clusters found in the first analysis. The hypothesis-driven analysis largely supported the hypothesized set of subtypes. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, it suggested that disturbed social behavior and emotional dysregulation are not two distinct subtypes, but two aspects of one multifaceted type of disturbance. Additionally, the so-labeled \"executive disturbances\" group also showed disturbances in other domains. Results from the second (empirical) set of cluster analyses were consistent with findings from the hypothesis-driven cluster analysis. Overall, findings across the two cluster analyses indicated four subtypes of acquired personality disturbances: (1) executive disturbances in association with generalized disturbance, (2) dysregulation of emotions and behavior, (3) hypo-emotionality and de-energization, and (4) distress/anxiety. These findings show strong correspondence with subtypes suggested by prominent models of prefrontal systems based on neuroanatomically-defined circuits. Clarification of distinctive subtypes of acquired personality disturbances is a step toward enhancing our ability to tailor rehabilitative interventions for patients with prefrontal brain injuries."

            "abstract": "Identifying patients at risk of poor outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is essential to aid prognostics and treatment. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) may be the primary pathologic feature of MTBI but is normally not detectable by conventional imaging technology. This lack of sensitivity of clinical imaging techniques has impeded a pathophysiologic understanding of the long-term cognitive and emotional consequences of MTBI, which often remain unnoticed and are attributed to factors other than the injury. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural properties of brain tissue and has been suggested to be a promising candidate for the detection of DAI in vivo. In this study, we report strong associations between brain white matter DTI and self-reported cognitive, somatic and emotional symptoms at 12 months post-injury in 134 MTBI patients. The anatomical distribution suggested global associations, in line with the diffuse symptomatology, although the strongest effects were found in frontal regions including the genu of the corpus callosum and the forceps minor. These findings support the hypothesis that DTI may provide increased sensitivity to the diffuse pathophysiology of MTBI and suggest an important role of advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in trauma care."

            "abstract": "The nature and the neurological consequences of the shell wound to the head of the famous French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, on March 17, 1916, during World War I, remain unclear. However, his contemporaries and biographers have been unanimous to state that this event was a major shift in his life. His personality and behavior changed dramatically, and his affective relationships were deeply modified, the most significant example being his rapid disinterest for his fiancée Madeleine, to whom he had written passionate letters nearly every day before the trauma. The study of Apollinaire's letters, scarce medical reports, available memories from friends, and Apollinaire's helmet allow to understand better what brain lesion he had and why neurobehavioral dysfunction developed. While an \"intracranial abscess\" had been emphasized initially, clinical manifestations, free interval, no infectious problem, and quick resolution of hemiparesis and seizures after a burr hole was performed strongly suggest a chronic subdural hematoma in the right temporal region. Irritability, susceptibility, emotional intolerance, affect flattening, anxiety, and personality change fit perfectly with right temporal lobe dysfunction involving the lateral-basal area. Sparing of mesial-temporal, parietal, and frontal regions explained the absence of significant memory, cognitive, and executive impairment, without disturbed creative skills as a poet and art writer. This cognitive-affective dissociation secondary to isolated right temporal post-traumatic lesion allows to delineate the \"deep sorrow\" of Apollinaire during the two and a half years before he died from Spanish influenza in 1918."

There were no significant differences across the three groups (i.e., TC, PCS-present, and PCS-absent) for any of the neurocognitive measures (p = .138-.810). For the self-report measures, the PCS-present group reported significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms compared with the PCS-absent and TC groups (p < .001, d = 1.63-1.89, very large effect sizes). For the DTI measures, there were no significant differences in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or mean diffusivity when comparing the PCS-present and PCS-absent groups. However, there were significant differences (p < .05) in MD and RD when comparing the PCS-present and TC groups. There were significant differences in white matter between TC subjects and the PCS-present MTBI group, but not the PCS-absent MTBI group.

The aim of this study was to explore these theoretical relationships at very late stages of recovery from traumatic brain injury.

There was no evidence that appraisal and coping variables mediated relationships between psychosocial and any of the outcome variables. However, when appraisal and coping variables were combined with psychosocial variables as direct predictors of outcome, every outcome except employment status was reliably predicted, accounting for between 31 and 46% of the variance. Personality significantly influenced all predicted outcomes. Self-efficacy contributed to the prediction of all outcomes except QoL.

            "abstract": "Millions of people suffer mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) every year, and there is growing evidence that repeated injuries can result in long-term pathology. The acute symptoms of these injuries may or may not include the loss of consciousness but do include disorientation, confusion, and/or the inability to concentrate. Most of these acute symptoms spontaneously resolve within a few hours or days. However, the underlying physiological and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are known to occur in rodents and humans following moderate and severe TBIs, and SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in more mild injuries. Using a closed skull impact model, we investigated the presence of SDs immediately following a mTBI. Animals remained motionless for multiple minutes following an impact and once recovered had fewer episodes of movement. We recorded the defining electrophysiological properties of SDs, including the large extracellular field potential shifts and suppression of high-frequency cortical activity. Impact-induced SDs were also associated with a propagating wave of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). In the wake of the SD, there was a prolonged period of reduced CBF that recovered in approximately 90 min. Similar to SDs in more severe injuries, the impact-induced SDs could be blocked with ketamine. Interestingly, impacts at a slower velocity did not produce the prolonged immobility and did not initiate SDs. Our data suggest that SDs play a significant role in mTBIs and SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs."

Despite significant advances in the understanding of TBI pathophysiology, several clinical reports indicate that multiple genetic and epigenetic factors can influence outcome. Homocysteine (HCY) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid, the catabolism of which can be dysregulated by stress, lifestyle, aging, or genetic abnormalities leading to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY). HHCY is a neurotoxic condition and a risk factor for multiple neurological and cardiovascular disorders that occurs when HCY levels is clinically > 15 µM. Although the deleterious impact of HHCY has been studied in human and animal models of neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, it has not been addressed in TBI models. This study tested the hypothesis that HHCY has detrimental effects on TBI pathophysiology. Moderate HHCY was induced in adult male Sprague Dawley rats via daily administration of methionine followed by impact-induced traumatic brain injury. In this model, HHCY increased oxidative stress, upregulated expression of proteins that promote blood coagulation, exacerbated TBI-associated blood-brain barrier dysfunction and promoted the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the cortex. We also observed an increase of brain injury-induced lesion size and aggravated anxiety-like behavior. These findings show that moderate HHCY exacerbates TBI outcomes and suggest that HCY catabolic dysregulation may be a significant biological variable that could contribute to TBI pathophysiology heterogeneity."

We investigated the contribution of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of tryptophan to neurotoxic metabolites, to this comorbidity using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. SNI resulted in unilateral mechanical allodynia, reduced social interaction, and increased immobility in the forced swim test without changes in locomotor activity. These findings indicate SNI-induced pain and comorbid depression-like behavior. These behavioral responses were accompanied by increases in plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratios and increased expression of Ido1 and Il1b mRNA in the liver. Interestingly, SNI did not induce detectable changes in spinal cord or brain Ido1 mRNA levels. SNI was associated with spinal cord inflammatory activity as evidenced by increased Il1b mRNA expression. The SNI-induced increase of liver Ido1and Il1b mRNA was abrogated by intrathecal administration of the IL-1 inhibitor IL-1RA. Intrathecal IL-1RA also inhibited both mechanical allodynia and depression-like behavior. We also show that Ido1 is required for the development of depression-like behavior because Ido1(-/-) mice do not develop increased immobility in the forced swim test or decreased social exploration in response to SNI. Mechanical allodynia was similar in WT and Ido1(-/-) mice. In conclusion, our findings show for the first time that neuropathic pain is associated with an increase of Ido1 in liver, but not brain, downstream of spinal cord IL-1β signaling and that Ido1 mediates comorbid depression. Moreover, comorbidity of neuropathic pain and depression are only partially mediated by a common mechanism because mechanical hyperalgesia develops independently of Ido1."

Although amygdala activation is most often associated with fearful or angry stimuli, there is considerable evidence that the response of the amygdala to neutral faces is both robust and reliable. This characteristic of amygdala function is of particular interest in the context of assessing populations with executive function deficits, such as traumatic brain injuries, which can be evaluated using fMRI attention modulation tasks that evaluate prefrontal control over representations, notably faces. The current study tested the hypothesis that the amygdala may serve as a marker of selective attention to neutral faces. Using fMRI, we gathered data within a chronic traumatic brain injury population. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal change within the left and right amygdalae and fusiform face areas was measured while participants viewed neutral faces and scenes, under conditions requiring participants to (1) categorize pictures of faces and scenes, (2) selectively attend to either faces or scenes, or (3) attend to both faces and scenes.

While a causality relation between pain and emotional/cognitive disturbances is generally assumed, several observations suggest a temporal dissociation and independent mechanisms. We therefore studied Sprague-Dawley rats that presented a natural resistance to pain manifestation in a neuropathy model (spared nerve injury [SNI]) and compared their performance in a battery of behavioral paradigms-anxiety, depression and fear memory-with animals that presented a pain phenotype. Afterward, we performed an extensive volumetric analysis across prefrontal, orbitofrontal and insular cortical areas. The majority of SNI animals manifested mechanical allodynia (low threshold [LT]), but 13% were similar to Sham controls (high threshold [HT]). Readouts of spontaneous hypersensivity (paw flinches) were also significantly reduced in HT and correlated with allodynia. To increase the specificity of our findings, we segregated the SNI animals in those with left (SNI-L) and right (SNI-R) lesions and the lack of association between pain and behavior still remains. Left-lesioned animals, independent of the LT or HT phenotype, presented increased anxiety-like behaviors and decreased well-being. In contrast, we found that the insular cortex (agranular division) was significantly smaller in HT than in LT. To conclude, pain and emotional disturbances observed following nerve injury are to some extent segregated phenomena. Also, HT and LT SNI presented differences in insular volumes, an area vastly implicated in pain perception, suggesting a supraspinal involvement in the manifestation of these phenotypes."

The objective of this study was to determine prevalence rates, risk factors, and functional outcome associated with PCS 6 months after mTBI, applying divergent classification methods. Follow-up questionnaires at 6 months after mTBI included the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). The RPQ was analyzed according to different classification methods: the mapped International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), the RPQ total score, the RPQ3 and the three-factor model using two different cutoff points (mild or worse and moderate or worse). Our results from a sample of 731 mTBI patients showed that prevalence rates of PCS ranged from 11.4% to 38.7% using divergent classification methods. According to all eight methods, 6.3% (n = 46) of mTBI patients experienced PCS. Applying the divergent classification methods resulted in a different set of predictors being statistically significantly associated with PCS, and a different percentage of overlap with functional impairment, measured with the GOSE. In conclusion, depending on the classification method and rating score used, prevalence rates of PCS deviated considerably. For future research, consensus regarding the diagnostic criteria for PCS and the analysis of the RPQ should be reached, to enhance comparability of studies regarding PCS after mTBI."

            "abstract": "Posttraumatic brain injury patients with depressive symptoms were compared with nondepressed mild and moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients based on their scores on the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPCSQ). A factor analysis demonstrated that the items of the RPCSQ loaded into three factors: mood and cognition, general somatic, and visual somatic symptom groups. Factor scores based on this model were calculated for each group and it was found that depressed subjects reported a greater severity of all three symptom groups compared to nondepressed patients. These results suggest that depression post-TBI may influence patient perception of postconcussion symptoms."

Concussion is a common injury in the pediatric population and its prevalence has increased with increased visibility and awareness. This chapter will discuss the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of concussions sustained by pediatric athletes, while addressing the distinctive factors that pertain to this population. Management of concussion should be tailored to patients' symptoms and should focus on an early and gradual return to both cognitive and noncontact low-risk physical activity. A multidisciplinary approach is often helpful in addressing more specific symptoms, which fall into the somatic, cognitive, vestibular, emotional, and sleep domains. A prolonged recovery is defined by symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks. Individualized return-to-play decisions should focus on the safety of the young athlete."

            "abstract": "Bilateral damage to the amygdala in a variety of animal species can impair emotional reactions to stimuli in several sensory modalities. Such damage in humans impairs visual recognition of emotion in facial expressions, but possible impairments in modalities other than vision have not been sufficiently explored. We examined two subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage, and seven with unilateral amygdala damage, on a standardized task of emotional prosody recognition. The data were compared to those from 15 brain-damaged and from 14 normal control subjects. One of the bilateral amygdala subjects, whose lesions were restricted to the amygdala, was entirely normal in recognizing emotion in prosody on all tasks, the other, whose damage included substantial lesions also in extra-amygdalar structures, especially in right hemisphere, was normal on most, albeit not all, measures of emotional prosody recognition. We suggest that the human amygdala's role in recognizing emotion in prosody may not be as critical as it is for facial expressions, and that extra-amygdalar structures in right hemisphere may be more important for recognizing emotional prosody. It remains possible that recognition of emotion in classes of auditory stimuli other than prosody will require the amygdala."

Andrew has a history of a complete atrioventricular canal that was repaired as an infant and poorly controlled infantile spasms. Currently, he struggles with constipation, esophageal strictures, medullary nephrocalcinosis, urinary retention, sleep dysregulation, G-tube dependency, and hip dysplasia.Andrew walked at 11 to 12 years of age. Currently, he ambulates on his feet at home and in a wheelchair out in the community. He is nonverbal but can imprecisely sign for \"more\" and understands a few words. His father reports that his main concern is long-standing nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and aggression. His self-injury consists of head banging against hard objects such as concrete floors and biting or scratching himself to the point of bleeding. Over the past 13 years, he has been prescribed over 10 different psychotropic medications, including various typical and atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and alpha agonists, all of which were discontinued because of the perception of undesirable side effects or lack of efficacy. His current medications include aripiprazole, olanzapine, levetiracetam, clorazepate, and trazodone. To rule out causes of irritability, you order a brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging, metabolic testing (for causes of NSSI such as Lesch-Nyhan), an autoimmune workup (for causes of pain or inflammation such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis), and hearing/vision testing, which are all normal. Previous testing by subspecialists (he is followed by gastroenterology, sleep medicine, orthopedics, nephrology, neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry) included normal renal ultrasound and no clear sources of gastrointestinal pain. However, key providers are spread among multiple institutions and do not regularly communicate.Andrew lives with his parents, who are highly educated and very dedicated to his health and wellness. His mother travels frequently for work, and his father is Andrew's full-time caregiver. Despite remaining ostensibly positive, his father reports significant caregiver burnout and fatigue.Over the next several months, Andrew continues to experience worsening NSSI necessitating medication changes despite active involvement in applied behavior analysis therapy. During this time, he presents to the emergency department multiple times for irritability and self-injury. On examination, he is aggressive, irritable, has bruises on his forehead and scratches on his skin, and has intermittent vertical gaze deviation that was noticeable to parents. The rest of his physical and neurological examination was unremarkable and revealed no asymmetry, clonus, hyperreflexia, or changes in muscle tone. While examining his extremities, joints, and abdomen, there was no obvious source of pain.What are your next steps? How would you support this family, both in the immediate management of his self-injury and long-term care needs for this medically and behaviorally complex adolescent?"

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also referred to as concussion, remains a controversial diagnosis because the brain often appears quite normal on conventional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Such conventional tools, however, do not adequately depict brain injury in mTBI because they are not sensitive to detecting diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), also described as traumatic axonal injuries (TAI), the major brain injuries in mTBI. Furthermore, for the 15 to 30 % of those diagnosed with mTBI on the basis of cognitive and clinical symptoms, i.e., the \"miserable minority,\" the cognitive and physical symptoms do not resolve following the first 3 months post-injury. Instead, they persist, and in some cases lead to long-term disability. The explanation given for these chronic symptoms, i.e., postconcussive syndrome, particularly in cases where there is no discernible radiological evidence for brain injury, has led some to posit a psychogenic origin. Such attributions are made all the easier since both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are frequently co-morbid with mTBI. The challenge is thus to use neuroimaging tools that are sensitive to DAI/TAI, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in order to detect brain injuries in mTBI. Of note here, recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, such as DTI, make it possible to characterize better extant brain abnormalities in mTBI. These advances may lead to the development of biomarkers of injury, as well as to staging of reorganization and reversal of white matter changes following injury, and to the ability to track and to characterize changes in brain injury over time. Such tools will likely be used in future research to evaluate treatment efficacy, given their enhanced sensitivity to alterations in the brain. In this article we review the incidence of mTBI and the importance of characterizing this patient population using objective radiological measures. Evidence is presented for detecting brain abnormalities in mTBI based on studies that use advanced neuroimaging techniques. Taken together, these findings suggest that more sensitive neuroimaging tools improve the detection of brain abnormalities (i.e., diagnosis) in mTBI. These tools will likely also provide important information relevant to outcome (prognosis), as well as play an important role in longitudinal studies that are needed to understand the dynamic nature of brain injury in mTBI. Additionally, summary tables of MRI and DTI findings are included. We believe that the enhanced sensitivity of newer and more advanced neuroimaging techniques for identifying areas of brain damage in mTBI will be important for documenting the biological basis of postconcussive symptoms, which are likely associated with subtle brain alterations, alterations that have heretofore gone undetected due to the lack of sensitivity of earlier neuroimaging techniques. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy to point out that detecting brain abnormalities in mTBI does not mean that other disorders of a more psychogenic origin are not co-morbid with mTBI and equally important to treat. They arguably are. The controversy of psychogenic versus physiogenic, however, is not productive because the psychogenic view does not carefully consider the limitations of conventional neuroimaging techniques in detecting subtle brain injuries in mTBI, and the physiogenic view does not carefully consider the fact that PTSD and depression, and other co-morbid conditions, may be present in those suffering from mTBI. Finally, we end with a discussion of future directions in research that will lead to the improved care of patients diagnosed with mTBI."

However, causal determinations of current symptoms cannot be conclusively determined because symptoms are often nonspecific to etiology and offer virtually no differential diagnostic value in postacute or chronic phases. This population-based study examined whether the presence of abnormalities during neurological examination would distinguish between mTBI (in the chronic phase), healthy controls, and selected psychiatric conditions. Retrospective analysis of data from 4462 community-dwelling Army veterans was conducted. Diagnostically unique groups were compared on examination of cranial nerve function and other neurological signs. Results demonstrated that individuals with mTBI were no more likely than those with a major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or somatoform disorder to show any abnormality. Thus, like self-reported cognitive and emotional symptoms, the presence of cranial nerve or other neurological abnormalities offers no differential diagnostic value. Clinical implications and study limitations are presented."

Outcome measures included cognition, post-concussion symptoms, depression, traumatic stress, quality of life, satisfaction with life, resilience, and return to work. Patients with MTBI reported more post-concussion symptoms and fatigue than the controls at the beginning of recovery, but by 6 months after injury, did not differ as a group from nonhead injury trauma controls on cognition, fatigue, or mental health, and by 12 months, their level of post-concussion symptoms and quality of life was similar to that of controls. Almost all (96%) patients with MTBI returned to work/normal activities (RTW) within the follow-up of 1 year. A subgroup of those with MTBIs and controls reported mild post-concussion-like symptoms at 1 year. A large percentage of the subgroup who had persistent symptoms had a modifiable psychological risk factor at 1 month (i.e., depression, traumatic stress, and/or low resilience), and at 6 months, they had greater post-concussion symptoms, fatigue, insomnia, traumatic stress, and depression, and worse quality of life. All of the control subjects who had mild post-concussion-like symptoms at 12 months also had a mental health problem (i.e., depression, traumatic stress, or both).

The number of individuals who experience persistent symptoms appears to be low despite clear evidence of longer-term pathophysiological changes resulting from mTBI. In light of the incongruency between these longer-term changes in brain pathology and the number of individuals with longer-term mTBI-related symptoms, particularly impaired cognitive function, we performed a scoping review of the literature that behaviourally assessed short- and long-term cognitive function in individuals with a single mTBI, with the goal of identifying the impact of a single concussion on cognitive function in the chronic stage post-injury. CINAHL, Embase, and Medline/Ovid were searched July 2015 for studies related to concussion and cognitive impairment. Data relating to the presence/absence of cognitive impairment were extracted from 45 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Results indicate that, in contrast to the prevailing view that most symptoms of concussion are resolved within 3 months post-injury, approximately half of individuals with a single mTBI demonstrate long-term cognitive impairment.

Concordance of both conditions corresponded to a greater than additive effect and greater odds of mild roadway aggression, than either condition alone.

            "abstract": "Reduced expression of somatostatin (SST) is reported across chronic brain conditions including major depression and normal aging. SST is a signaling neuropeptide and marker of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons, which specifically inhibit pyramidal neuron dendrites. Studies in auditory cortex suggest that chronic reduction in dendritic inhibition induces compensatory homeostatic adaptations that oppose the effects of acute inhibition. Whether such mechanisms occur in frontal cortex (FC) and affect behavioral outcome is not known. Here, we used two complementary viral vector strategies to examine the effects of acute vs chronic inhibition of SST-positive neurons on behavioral emotionality in adult mice. SST-IRES-Cre mice were injected in FC (prelimbic/precingulate) with CRE-dependent adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding the engineered Gi/o-coupled human muscarinic M4 designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD-hM4Di) or a control reporter (AAV-DIO-mCherry) for acute or chronic cellular inhibition. A separate cohort was injected with CRE-dependent AAV vectors expressing diphtheria toxin (DTA) to selectively ablate FC SST neurons. Mice were assessed for anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors (defined as emotionality). Results indicate that acute inhibition of FC SST neurons increased behavioral emotionality, whereas chronic inhibition decreased behavioral emotionality. Furthermore, ablation of FC SST neurons also decreased behavioral emotionality under baseline condition and after chronic stress. Together, our results reveal opposite effects of acute and chronic inhibition of FC SST neurons on behavioral emotionality and suggest the recruitment of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that have implications for understanding the neurobiology of chronic brain conditions affecting dendritic-targeting inhibitory neurons."

            "abstract": "The effects of slight variations in brain temperature on the pathophysiological consequences of acute brain injury have been extensively described in models of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In contrast, limited information is available regarding the potential consequences of temperature elevations on outcome following mild TBI (mTBI) or concussions. One potential confounding variable with mTBI is the presence of elevated body temperature that occurs in the civilian or military populations due to hot environments combined with exercise or other forms of physical exertion. We therefore determined the histopathological effects of pre- and post-traumatic hyperthermia (39°C) on mTBI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: pre/post-traumatic hyperthermia, post-traumatic hyperthermia alone for 2 h, and normothermia (37°C). The pre/post-hyperthermia group was treated with hyperthermia starting 15 min before mild parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (1.4-1.6 atm), with the temperature elevation extending for 2 h after trauma. At 72 h after mTBI, the rats were perfusion-fixed for quantitative histopathological evaluation. Contusion areas and volumes were significantly larger in the pre/post-hyperthermia treatment group compared to the post-hyperthermia and normothermic groups. In addition, pre/post-traumatic hyperthermia caused the most severe loss of NeuN-positive cells in the dentate hilus compared to normothermia. These neuropathological results demonstrate that relatively mild elevations in temperature associated with peri-traumatic events may affect the long-term functional consequences of mTBI. Because individuals exhibiting mildly elevated core temperatures may be predisposed to aggravated brain damage after mTBI or concussion, precautions should be introduced to target this important physiological variable."

This included 42% who were found not to have sustained combat-related mild TBI (mTBI). In contrast, 70.0% received a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and 45.8% received a depression diagnosis. Compared with Veterans without mTBI, PTSD, or depression diagnoses, the lowest risk for self-reported cognitive impairment was in Veterans with confirmed mTBI only; a greater risk was found in those with PTSD diagnoses, with the greatest risk in Veterans with PTSD, depression, and confirmed mTBI, suggesting only a weakly additive effect of mTBI. These findings suggest that Veterans with multiple mental health comorbidities, not just those with TBI, report moderate to very severe cognitive impairment.

Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated innate immune cell activation in blood, brain, and spleen post-LPS; however, this was not potentiated by TBI.

Silencing this nociceptive ensemble alleviated pain affective-motivational behaviors without altering the detection of noxious stimuli, withdrawal reflexes, anxiety, or reward. Following peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimuli activated this nociceptive ensemble to drive dysfunctional perceptual changes associated with neuropathic pain, including pain aversion to light touch (allodynia).

With no overt lesions on structural MRI, diagnosis of chronic mild TBI in military veterans relies on obtaining an accurate history and assessment of behavioral symptoms that are also associated with frequent comorbid disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Military veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan with mild TBI (n = 30) with comorbid PTSD and depression and non-TBI participants from primary (n = 42) and confirmatory (n = 28) control groups were assessed with high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). White matter-specific registration followed by whole-brain voxelwise analysis of crossing fibers provided separate partial volume fractions reflecting the integrity of primary fibers and secondary (crossing) fibers. Loss of white matter integrity in primary fibers (P < 0.05; corrected) was associated with chronic mild TBI in a widely distributed pattern of major fiber bundles and smaller peripheral tracts including the corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), forceps minor, forceps major, superior and posterior corona radiata, internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and others. Distributed loss of white matter integrity correlated with duration of loss of consciousness and most notably with \"feeling dazed or confused,\" but not diagnosis of PTSD or depressive symptoms. This widespread spatial extent of white matter damage has typically been reported in moderate to severe TBI. The diffuse loss of white matter integrity appears consistent with systemic mechanisms of damage shared by blast- and impact-related mild TBI that involves a cascade of inflammatory and neurochemical events."

These vulnerable animals expressed distinct molecular profiles in the corticolimbic network, with downregulation in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate and upregulation in neuropeptide Y markers. Indeed, among vulnerable animals, not resilient or sham controls, severity of anxiety-related outcomes correlated strongly with expression of molecular markers.

However, assessment of emotion responsivity is often difficult because many patients lack insight into their altered personality. To overcome this obstacle, we used a physiological measure of emotion responsivity, the startle reflex, to examine how this can vary according to the affective valence of stimuli by comparing a TBI group with a matched control group. The study also examined whether weaknesses of attention and speed of information processing could account for differences in startle modulation across groups. Sixty-four TBI patients and controls completed the startle reflex procedure. Participants were presented with pictures that differed in affective valence, and measures were taken of eyeblink startle responses to an acoustic probe. Subjective ratings of affect and arousal for each picture were obtained, and TBI patients completed measures of attention and information processing. Results revealed that the TBI group did not show the pattern of startle modulation observed in the control group. Whilst pleasant pictures produced the usual attenuation of the startle response, startle responses to unpleasant pictures were significantly lower in the TBI group than in controls. No significant correlations emerged between startle responses and performance on neuropsychological measures in the TBI group. The TBI group also rated unpleasant pictures as significantly less arousing than did controls. The results provide partial support for a growing body of evidence that has proposed impaired emotion responsivity following TBI."

It is known that the median raphe nucleus (MRN) is the origin of a serotonergic pathway and mainly innervates septo-hippocampal formation which plays an important role in emotional cognition. However, its regulatory role in different types of fear conditioning is still unclear. In the present study, the animals underwent ibotenic acid or sham lesions of the median raphe nucleus and the effects of MRN lesions on immediate and delayed fear conditioning to multiple contextual cues were studied. Freezing behaviour served as a measure of contextual fear. Sham-lesioned animals showed reliable conditional freezing when observed immediately following foot-shock (1.0 mA) for 3-min test and 48 h after the shock for 12-min test. Rats with MRN lesions displayed robust freezing behaviour immediately after the shock, even though they showed a marked deficit in freezing 48 h following the shock. These findings indicate that the MRN-serotonergic septo-hippocampal pathway is involved in the regulation of anxiety related to fear conditioning triggered by contextual cues, suggesting that short-term contextual fear is independent on the MRN while long-term contextual fear depends on the MRN."

            "abstract": "A thorough understanding of the relationship between cognitive test performance and symptoms of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important given the high prevalence of these emotional symptoms following injury. It is also important to understand whether these relationships are affected by TBI severity, and the validity of test performance and symptom report. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether these symptoms are associated with cognitive test performance alterations in adults with a TBI. This meta-analysis was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews website (registration number: CRD42018089194). The electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for journal articles published up until May 2020. In total, 61 studies were included, which enabled calculation of pooled effect sizes for the cognitive domains of immediate memory (verbal and visual), recent memory (verbal and visual), attention, executive function, processing speed, and language. Depression had a small, negative relationship with most cognitive domains. These relationships remained, for the most part, when samples with mild TBI (mTBI)-only were analysed separately, but not for samples with more severe TBI (sTBI)-only. A similar pattern of results was found in the anxiety analysis. PTSD had a small, negative relationship with verbal memory, in samples with mTBI-only. No data were available for the PTSD analysis with sTBI samples. Moderator analyses indicated that the relationships between emotional symptoms and cognitive test performance may be impacted to some degree by exclusion of participants with atypical performance on performance validity tests (PVTs) or symptom validity tests (SVTs), however there were small study numbers and changes in effect size were not statistically significant. These findings are useful in synthesising what is currently known about the relationship between cognitive test performance and emotional symptoms in adults with TBI, demonstrating significant, albeit small, relationships between emotional symptoms and cognitive test performance in multiple domains, in non-military samples. Some of these relationships appeared to be mildly impacted by controlling for performance validity or symptom validity, however this was based on the relatively few studies using validity tests. More research including PVTs and SVTs whilst examining the relationship between emotional symptoms and cognitive outcomes is needed."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in the United States. With decreasing mortality rates, a higher number of patients are impacted by long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae, such as cognitive deficits, depression, anxiety, and sleep-wake disorders. These sequelae are primarily driven by the disruption of key neurotransmitter homeostasis including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Neurostimulants are centrally acting medications used to assist in restoring these neurotransmitter abnormalities and are pharmacologic options to ameliorate symptoms in post-TBI patients. Examples of neurostimulants include amantadine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, central stimulants (ie, methylphenidate), modafinil, and donepezil. Large, well-powered studies have not been performed to validate their use in patients with TBI, leaving uncertainty for these agents' place in therapy. Current practice is driven by consideration of patient-specific factors to select the most appropriate agent. This review provides clinicians with a summary of the available literature on neurostimulants following TBI to guide appropriate usage to help improve patients' symptoms and optimize safety."

            "abstract": "The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) only assesses orientation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). 'Post-traumatic amnesia' (PTA) comprises orientation, anterograde amnesia (AA) and retrograde amnesia (RA). However, RA is often disregarded in formalized PTA assessment. Drugs can potentially confound PTA assessment: e.g. midazolam can cause AA. However, potential drug confounders are also often disregarded in formalized PTA testing. One study of medium-stay elective-surgery orthopaedic patients (without TBI) demonstrated AA in 80% taking opiates after general anesthesia. However, RA was not assessed. Opiates/opioids are frequently administered after TBI. We compared AA and RA in short-stay orthopaedic surgery in-patients (without TBI) taking post-operative opioids after opiate/opioid/benzodiazepine-free spinal anesthesia. In a prospective cohort, the Westmead PTA Scale (WPTAS) was used to assess AA (WPTAS<12), whilst RA was assessed using the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test RA item. Results were obtained in n=25 (60±14yrs, M:F 17:8). Surgery was uncomplicated: all were discharged by Day-4. All were taking regular oxycodone as a new post-operative prescription. Only one co-administered non-opioid was potentially confounding (temezepam, n=4). Of 25, 14 (56%) demonstrated AA: five (20%) were simultaneously disorientated. Mean WPTAS was 11.08±1.22.

Caution should therefore be applied in assessing AA/orientation in TBI in-patients taking opioids. By contrast, retrograde memory was robust and more reliable: even in older patients with iatrogenic AA and disorientation. RA assessment should therefore be integral to assessing TBI severity in all formalized PTA and GCS testing."

            "abstract": "The effects on the human brain of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), which is defined as a brief alteration (AOC) or loss of consciousness (LOC), are incompletely understood. Major psychiatric illnesses such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common after mTBI. Prior research suggests that individuals who develop MDD after blast-related mTBI versus those who do not show significant white matter disruption and higher rates of LOC, suggesting that LOC might be uniquely associated with brain changes that increase the risk of developing mental illness after neurotrauma. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of LOC, MDD, and PTSD on white matter integrity in individuals who reported experiencing mTBI during combat in Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. We hypothesized that LOC would be associated with significant disruption of white matter, above and beyond putative effects of MDD and PTSD. To test this hypothesis, 46 individuals who experienced blast-related mTBI underwent a detailed clinical assessment and diffusion tensor imaging. As hypothesized, LOC versus AOC individuals displayed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in 14 regions, which included the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum. No regions of significant FA difference were identified between individuals with and without PTSD, or between individuals with and without MDD. These preliminary results show that LOC is associated with detectable alterations in brain microstructure and may suggest a brain basis for psychiatric symptoms and mental illness after mTBI."

            "abstract": "OBJECT Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a major public health problem. Approximately 90% of SRCs in high school athletes are transient; symptoms recover to baseline within 1 week. However, a small percentage of patients remain symptomatic several months after injury, with a condition known as postconcussion syndrome (PCS). The authors aimed to identify risk factors for PCS development in a cohort of exclusively young athletes (9-18 years of age) who sustained SRCs while playing a sport. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective case-control study by using the Vanderbilt Sports Concussion Clinic database. They identified 40 patients with PCS and matched them by age at injury and sex to SRC control patients (1 PCS to 2 control). PCS patients were those experiencing persistent symptoms at 3 months after an SRC. Control patients were those with documented resolution of symptoms within 3 weeks of an SRC. Data were collected in 4 categories: 1) demographic variables; 2) key medical, psychiatric, and family history; 3) acute-phase postinjury symptoms (at 0-24 hours); and 4) subacute-phase postinjury features (at 0-3 weeks). The chi-square Fisher exact test was used to assess categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate continuous variables. Forward stepwise regression models (Pin = 0.05, Pout = 0.10) were used to identify variables associated with PCS. RESULTS PCS patients were more likely than control patients to have a concussion history (p = 0.010), premorbid mood disorders (p = 0.002), other psychiatric illness (p = 0.039), or significant life stressors (p = 0.036). Other factors that increased the likelihood of PCS development were a family history of mood disorders, other psychiatric illness, and migraine. Development of PCS was not predicted by race, insurance status, body mass index, sport, helmet use, medication use, and type of symptom endorsement. A final logistic regression analysis of candidate variables showed PCS to be predicted by a history of concussion (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8, p = 0.016), preinjury mood disorders (OR 17.9, 95% CI 2.9-113.0, p = 0.002), family history of mood disorders (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.5, p = 0.026), and delayed symptom onset (OR 20.7, 95% CI 3.2-132.0, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this age- and sex-matched case-control study of risk factors for PCS among youth with SRC, risk for development of PCS was higher in those with a personal and/or family history of mood disorders, other psychiatric illness, and migraine. These findings highlight the unique nature of SRC in youth. For this population, providers must recognize the value of establishing the baseline health and psychiatric status of children and their primary caregivers with regard to symptom reporting and recovery expectations. In addition, delayed symptom onset was an unexpected but strong risk factor for PCS in this cohort. Delayed symptoms could potentially result in late removal from play, rest, and care by qualified health care professionals. Taken together, these results may help practitioners identify young athletes with concussion who are at a greater danger for PCS and inform larger prospective studies for validation of risk factors from this cohort."

            "abstract": "Substantial evidence indicates involvement of microglia/macrophages in chronic neuropathic pain. However, the temporal-spatial features of microglial/macrophage activation and their pain-bound roles remain elusive. Here, we evaluated microglia/macrophages and the subtypes in the lumbar spinal cord (SC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and analgesic-anxiolytic effect of minocycline at different stages following spared nerve injury (SNI) in rats. While SNI enhanced the number of spinal microglia/macrophages since post-operative day (POD)3, pro-inflammatory MHCII+ spinal microglia/macrophages were unexpectedly less abundant in SNI rats than shams on POD21. By contrast, less abundant anti-inflammatory CD172a (SIRPα)+ microglia/macrophages were found in the PFC of SNI rats. Interestingly in naïve rats, microglial/macrophage expression of CD11b/c, MHCII and MHCII+/CD172a+ ratio were higher in the SC than the cortex. Consistently, multiple immune genes involved in anti-inflammation, phagocytosis, complement activation and M2 microglial/macrophage polarization were upregulated in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia but downregulated in the PFC of SNI rats. Furthermore, daily intrathecal minocycline treatment starting from POD0 for two weeks alleviated mechanical allodynia most robustly before POD3 and attenuated anxiety on POD9. Although minocycline dampened spinal MHCII+ microglia/macrophages until POD13, it failed to do so on cortical microglia/macrophages, indicating that dampening only spinal inflammation may not be enough to alleviate centralized pain at the chronic stage. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that basal microglial/macrophage traits underlie differential region-specific responses to SNI and minocycline treatment, and suggest that drug treatment efficiently targeting not only spinal but also brain inflammation may be more effective in treating chronic neuropathic pain."

Behavioural Activation (BA) could help because it has been demonstrated to be as effective as cognitive-behaviour therapy but is less cognitively demanding and more suitable for people with brain impairment. The current study evaluated BA using a multiple-baseline design across behaviours with replication. Three male participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms (two with traumatic brain injury aged 26 and 46, one who experienced strokes in infancy, aged 26) engaged in a 10-14-week trial of BA focusing on three activity domains: physical, social and functional activities. Participants completed an online form three times a day which recorded activity participation and responses to a single-item mood scale. There was little evidence in support of BA for increasing participation. There was also a lack of change in average mood, but some positive effects were found on measures of depression symptoms and quality of life in these participants. Various factors affected participation which might have been mitigated by extended treatment contact, greater use of prompts or electronic aids or the addition of other therapy modes."

The current study outlined acute and chronic changes in behavioral metrics following rotational acceleration-induced concussion in rats. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) rotational injury model independently controlled magnitude and duration of the rotational acceleration pulse. Increasing rotational acceleration magnitude produced longer recovery times, which were used in this study and our prior work as an assessment of acute injury severity. However, longer duration rotational accelerations produced changes in emotionality as measured using the elevated plus maze. Cognitive deficits were for the most part not apparent in the Morris water maze assessment, possibly due to the lower severity of rotational acceleration pulses incorporated in this study. Changes in emotionality evolved between acute and chronic assessments, in some cases increasing in severity and in others reversing polarity. These findings highlight the complexity of quantifying injury tolerance for concussion and demonstrate a need to incorporate rotational acceleration magnitude and duration in proposed injury tolerance metrics. Rotational velocity on its own was not a strong predictor of the magnitude or type of acute behavioral changes following concussion, although its combination with rotational acceleration magnitude using multivariate analysis was the strongest predictor for acute recovery time and some chronic emotional-type behavioral changes."

Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, reduced neurogenesis, and apoptosis are critical factors for the development of anxiety and depression. The present study was aimed to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of matrine against acute liver injury in the rodent model. Acute liver injury in mice was induced by administration of the acute hepatotoxic dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (1 ml/kg, i.p.). Pretreatment of mice with matrine (50 mg/kg i.p.) remarkably ameliorated CCl4-induced anxiety and depression-like behavior as evident from the results of open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPM), light-dark box test (LDB), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). Moreover, matrine significantly inhibited CCl4-induced neuroinflammation in mice by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). CCl4-induced oxidative stress was reduced by matrine due to its potential to enhance the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrite level in the PFC and HC of mice brain. Matrine remarkably reduced the levels of corticosterone, ammonia, AST, ALT, and creatinine. Matrine pretreatment remarkably ameliorated CCl4-induced morphological liver injury. Acute pretreatment of matrine enhanced neurogenesis by increasing the number of GFAF (glial fibrillary acidic protein) positive astrocyte, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in the hippocampus of CCl4-treated mice. Pretreatment of matrine inhibited apoptosis and DNA damage in the hippocampus. The present data revealed that hyperammonemia produced due to liver injury induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, reduced neurogenesis and apoptosis in the hippocampus, thus, resulting in anxiety and depression. Taken together, the present results suggested that matrine has a significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects through modulation of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, reduced neurogenesis and apoptosis induced by CCl4 administration."

There may be two types: neurobehavioral problems, manifesting as inadequate social behavior resulting from prefrontal system damage, and affective behavioral problems, resulting from emotional distress as a reaction to the brain injury. In the present study we investigated whether these two types of behavioral problems, as indicated by proxies, could be distinguished in a group of chronic TBI patients and whether early indicators of prefrontal damage on imaging could predict long-term neurobehavioral problems. Computed tomography (CT) imaging data on admission were used to identify frontal lesions. Three hundred twenty-three moderate to severe TBI survivors received 2 to 16 years post-trauma an aftercare survey with seven questions asking for changes in behavior and affect, presented both to patients and their proxies. One hundred eighty-six patients (59%) answered the behavioral questions; 42% had frontal lesions on CT. Ordinal common factor analysis on proxy scores yielded two factors, with behavior and affective items clearly separated and the anger item mediocre related to both factors. Three scales were created: Behavior, Affective and Anger. Frontal patients scored significantly higher on the Behavior and Anger scales. Logistic regression analysis showed a fourfold increase of long-term neurobehavioral problems in patients with frontal lesions. Long-term neurobehavioral problems were significantly correlated to one-year outcome and return to work in the long term. We conclude that in patients with moderate to severe TBI neurobehavioral and affective problems can be distinguished. Early CT frontal abnormalities predict long-term neurobehavioral problems, but not affective problems."

            "abstract": "Damage to the prefrontal cortex in childhood can produce long-term impairments of emotion, behavior regulation, and executive functions, but little is known regarding the earliest expression of these impairments. We describe here detailed behavioral studies of a boy at 14 months of age ('PF1') who sustained focal damage in the right inferior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex due to resection of a vascular malformation on day 3 of life. The surgery was followed by a good medical recovery, and he reached developmental milestones at a normal rate. His neurological examination was normal, as were his mother's ratings of communication abilities, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills. Multiple standardized laboratory paradigms were used to evaluate his behavior in structured and relatively unstructured situations designed to elicit positive and negative emotions and to place demands on attention. Relative to a comparison group of 50 age-matched boys with no neurological history, PF1 demonstrated significant impairments in the regulation of emotion and engagement of attention, particularly in unstructured conditions. These findings indicate that damage to prefrontal cortex in infancy begins to impact on emotional and cognitive development already during the first months of life."

Fear avoidance behavior also may impact recovery from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but no measure of this construct has been psychometrically validated for the mTBI population. Adults who sustained an mTBI (n = 159) were recruited from three outpatient mTBI clinics. Participants completed the new Fear Avoidance Behavior after Traumatic Brain Injury Questionnaire (FAB-TBI). The FAB-TBI includes 16 items drawn from well-established fear avoidance scales, primarily in the chronic pain literature. An exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis were conducted to evaluate the factor structure, dimensionality, and differential item functioning of the FAB-TBI. The FAB-TBI scale was found to have strong internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.9). Exploratory factor analysis suggested at least two distinct factors (activity avoidance and cogniphobia). Initial fit to the Rasch model was adequate, with one misfitting item. The model was not improved after removing the misfitting item. Best fit to the unidimensional Rasch model was achieved after items were combined into three super items based on exploratory factor analysis and retaining the misfitting item χ2(6, n = 159) = 2.1, p = 0.06). The FAB-TBI appears to be a psychometrically sound measure of fear avoidance behavior after mTBI. Conversion tables are made available to convert scores into interval-level data for future research."

Personality traits have always been viewed as one of the most important explanations for persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). Unfortunately, studies on the association between preinjury personality traits and the PPCS are still limited. This study thus aimed to examine the relationship between the preinjury personality and PCS in patients with mTBI. A total of 106 participants including 53 healthy participants were recruited. All participants complete the modified Checklist of Postconcussion Symptoms and the Health, Personality, & Habit Scale. Participants were evaluated within 4 weeks and at 4 months, respectively, after injury. The results showed patients reported significantly more PCS than healthy participants did within 4 weeks postinjury. A significant positive association between PCS and retrospectively evaluated preinjury personality was found. Specifically, patients who reported that their preinjury personality was depressive or anxious-related presented more PCS. This study might be the first to directly demonstrate that preinjury personality traits are closely linked to PCS reporting in patients with mTBI. Importantly, PCS reporting might be associated with different personality traits at different periods after injuries, and thus, a careful evaluation for personality characteristics is merited after mTBI."

The same factors, with the exception of marital status, emerged as significant in relation to anxiety. Deployment-related stressors had a stronger association with both depression and anxiety than any other variable, including combat exposure.

While past blast injury studies have provided insights into TBI with moderate- to high-intensity explosions, the impact of primary low-intensity blast (LIB)-mediated pathobiology on neurological deficits requires further investigation. Our prior considerations of blast physics predicted ultrastructural injuries at nanoscale levels. Here, we provide quantitative data using a primary LIB injury murine model exposed to open field detonation of 350 g of high-energy explosive C4. We quantified ultrastructural and behavioral changes up to 30 days post blast injury (DPI). The use of an open-field experimental blast generated a primary blast wave with a peak overpressure of 6.76 PSI (46.6 kPa) at a 3-m distance from the center of the explosion, a positive phase duration of approximate 3.0 milliseconds (ms), a maximal impulse of 8.7 PSI × ms and a sharp rising time of 9 × 10-3 ms, with no apparent impact/acceleration in exposed animals. Neuropathologically, myelinated axonal damage was observed in blast-exposed groups at 7 DPI. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed and quantified myelin sheath defects and mitochondrial abnormalities at 7 and 30 DPI. Inverse correlations between blast intensities and neurobehavioral outcomes including motor activities, anxiety levels, nesting behavior, spatial learning and memory occurred. These observations uncover unique ultrastructural brain abnormalities and associated behavioral changes due to primary blast injury and provide key insights into its pathogenesis and potential treatment."

            "abstract": "Quality nutrition during the period of brain formation is a predictor of brain functional capacity and plasticity during adulthood; however it is not clear how this conferred plasticity imparts long-term neural resilience. Here we report that early exposure to dietary omega-3 fatty acids orchestrates key interactions between metabolic signals and Bdnf methylation creating a reservoir of neuroplasticity that can protect the brain against the deleterious effects of switching to a Western diet (WD). We observed that the switch to a WD increased Bdnf methylation specific to exon IV, in proportion to anxiety-like behavior, in Sprague Dawley rats reared in low omega-3 fatty acid diet, and these effects were abolished by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Blocking methylation also counteracted the reducing action of WD on the transcription regulator CTCF binding to Bdnf promoter IV. In vitro studies confirmed that CTCF binding to Bdnf promoter IV is essential for the action of DHA on BDNF regulation. Diet is also intrinsically associated to cell metabolism, and here we show that the switch to WD downregulated cell metabolism (NAD/NADH ratio and SIRT1). The fact that DNA methyltransferase inhibitor did not alter these parameters suggests they occur upstream to methylation. In turn, the methylation inhibitor counteracted the action of WD on PGC-1α, a mitochondrial transcription co-activator and BDNF regulator, suggesting that PGC-1α is an effector of Bdnf methylation. Results support a model in which diet can build an \"epigenetic memory\" during brain formation that confers resilience to metabolic perturbations occurring in adulthood."

These injuries lead to internal bleeding in multiple organs and, in the case of bTBI, long term neurological deficits. Currently, there are no treatments for internal bleeding beyond fluid resuscitation and surgery. There is also a dearth of treatments for TBI. We have developed a novel approach using hemostatic nanoparticles that encapsulate an anti-inflammatory, dexamethasone, to stop the bleeding and reduce inflammation after injury. We hypothesize that this will improve not only survival but long term functional outcomes after blast polytrauma. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) hemostatic nanoparticles encapsulating dexamethasone (hDNPs) were fabricated and tested following injury along with appropriate controls. Rats were exposed to a single blast wave using an Advanced Blast Simulator, inducing primary blast lung and bTBI. Survival was elevated in the hDNPs group compared to controls. Elevated anxiety parameters were found in the controls, compared to hDNPs. Histological analysis indicated that apoptosis and blood-brain barrier disruption in the amygdala were significantly increased in the controls compared to the hDNPs and sham groups.

Mild TBI results in several biopsychosocial impairments, with pronounced cognitive deficits thought to resolve within 3 months of injury. Previous research suggests that these impairments are due to a temporary inability to appropriately allocate neural resources in response to cognitive demands. Our study questioned this assumption and instead hypothesized that mTBI was associated with long-term neural disruptions and compromised brain structure integrity. By extension, we investigated the likelihood that functional restitution and cognitive resolution following mTBI may be due to some form of neurofunctional reorganization. To this end, we examined abnormalities in resting state functional connectivity and structure (volume, thickness, and fractional anisotropy) in two groups of mTBI-those with 1-10 years time post-injury (mTBI1-10), and those with 20-65 years time post-injury, relative to age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. We observed abnormalities in brain architecture only in the mTBI1-10 group, characterized by functional hypo-activation in the right frontal pole, smaller frontal pole volume, and lesser fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum that extended near the right frontal pole. This frontal region is laterally specialized to regulate function specific to socio-emotional processes. Collectively, neural disruptions and structural insult in mTBI may persist up to 10 years following injury, but injury-related pathology may resolve with longer recovery time. Disruption to frontal-dependent function that supports socio-emotional processes also may interfere with cognitive functioning, as in the case of chronic mTBI."

Clinical management of mTBI is challenging due to the heterogeneous, subjective and transient nature of symptoms, and thus would be aided by objective biomarkers. Promising biomarkers including advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma levels of select proteins were examined here in a rat model of RmTBI. Rats received either two mild fluid percussion or sham injuries administered five days apart. Rats underwent MRI and behavioral testing 1, 3, 5, 7, and 30 days after the second injury and blood samples were collected on days 1, 7, and 30. Structural and diffusion-weighted MRI revealed that RmTBI rats had abnormalities in the cortex and corpus callosum. Proteomic analysis of plasma found that RmTBI rats had abnormalities in markers indicating axonal and vascular injury, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, and glial reactivity. These changes occurred in the presence of ongoing cognitive and sensorimotor deficits in the RmTBI rats. Our findings demonstrate that RmTBI can result in chronic neurological abnormalities, provide insight into potential contributing pathophysiological mechanisms, and supports the use of MRI and plasma protein measures as RmTBI biomarkers."

The goal of this study was to assess whether cognitive rehabilitation training that was successfully applied in chronic civilian brain injury would be effective for military veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a prior study, participants with chronic acquired brain injury significantly improved after training in Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS) on measures of attention/executive function, functional task performance, and goal-directed control over neural processing on functional magnetic resonance imaging. The objective of this study was to assess effects of GOALS training in veterans with chronic TBI. A total of 33 veterans with chronic TBI and executive difficulties in their daily life completed either 5 weeks of manualized GOALS training or Brain-Health Education (BHE) matched by time and intensity. Evaluator-blinded assessments at baseline and post-training included neuropsychological and complex functional task performance and self-report measures of emotional regulation. After GOALS, but not BHE training, participants significantly improved from baseline on primary outcome measures of Overall Complex Attention/Executive Function composite neuropsychological performance score (F = 7.10, p = 0.01; partial η2 = 0.19), and on overall complex functional task performance (Goal Processing Scale Overall Performance; F = 6.92, p = 0.01, partial η2 = 0.20). Additionally, post-GOALS participants indicated significant improvement on emotional regulation self-report measures (Profile of Mood States Confusion Score; F = 6.05, p = 0.02, partialη2 = 0.20). Training in attentional self-regulation applied to participant-defined goals may improve cognitive functioning in veterans with chronic TBI. Attention regulation training may not only impact executive control functioning in real-world complex tasks, but also may improve emotional regulation and functioning. Implications for treatment of veterans with TBI are discussed."

Three key features of fear and epilepsy emerged through the analysis; harm, temporality and action. The fear experienced was not only external, relating to immediate injury, but also internal in terms of potential damage to the brain. The embodied nature of epilepsy can, therefore, present a threat to conceptions of the self. Underlying this internal dimension of fear is an understanding of the brain as central to the sense of self.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The experience of epilepsy does not only involve fear of physical harm but also fear of a loss of self.

Changes induced in specific brain regions by sustained pain may alter the processing of affective information, thus resulting in anxiodepressive disorders. Here, we compared the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the posterior insular cortex in the anxiodepressive, sensory, and affective aspects of chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Neuropathic pain was induced by cuffing the right sciatic nerve of C57BL/6J mice. Lesions were performed by local injection of ibotenic acid and chronic activation of the ACC by optogenetic stimulation. Anxiodepressive-related behaviors were evaluated through the novelty suppressed feeding, marble burying, splash, and forced swimming tests. Mechanical thresholds were determined using von Frey filaments, and the relief of spontaneous pain was determined by using place conditioning.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The ACC lesion prevented the anxiodepressive consequences of chronic pain without affecting the sensory mechanical allodynia. Conversely, the tonic or spontaneous pain and the anxiodepressive consequences of pain remained present after posterior insular cortex lesion, even though the mechanical allodynia was suppressed. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of the ACC was sufficient to induce anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in naïve animals.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results show that, at cortical level, the sensory component of chronic pain remains functionally segregated from its affective and anxiodepressive components. Spontaneous tonic pain and evoked allodynia can be experimentally dissociated. Furthermore, the ACC appears as a critical hub for mood disorders, including for the anxiodepressive consequences of chronic pain, and thus constitutes an important target for divulging the underlying mechanism."

The purpose of this study was to determine the behavioural and neuropathological phenotypes induced by the Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) model of mTBI in both wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice up to 8 months post-injury.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Male WT and APP/PS1 littermates were randomized to sham or repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI; 2 × 0.5 J impacts 24 h apart) groups at 5.7 months of age.

Neuropathological assessments included white matter damage; grey matter inflammation; and measures of Aβ levels, deposition, and aducanumab binding activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The very mild CHIMERA rmTBI conditions used here produced no significant acute neurological or motor deficits in WT and APP/PS1 mice, but they profoundly inhibited extinction of fear memory specifically in APP/PS1 mice over the 8-month assessment period. Spatial learning and memory were affected by both injury and genotype. Anxiety and risk-taking behaviour were affected by injury but not genotype. CHIMERA rmTBI induced chronic white matter microgliosis, axonal injury and astrogliosis independent of genotype in the optic tract but not the corpus callosum, and it altered microgliosis in APP/PS1 amygdala and hippocampus. Finally, rmTBI did not alter long-term tau, Aβ or amyloid levels, but it increased aducanumab binding activity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CHIMERA is a useful model to investigate the chronic consequences of rmTBI, including behavioural abnormalities consistent with features of post-traumatic stress disorder and inflammation of both white and grey matter.

This study investigated the chronic effects of moderate-to-severe TBI on brain reserve (BR), cognitive reserve (CR), and neuropsychological and functional outcome. Method The group with TBI consisted of 41 male participants with a primary diagnosis of moderate-to-severe closed head injury (time since injury [TSI], M = 6.12 years, range: 1-23, SD = 5.99, Mdn = 4). TBI survivors were compared to 24 neurotypical male participants, matched on age and education. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 anatomical images were used to calculate gray and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volume. BR was calculated using the ventricle-to-brain ratio. CR was assessed using two hold measures: the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Pseudowords task. Functional outcome was measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Results Neuropsychological performance of TBI survivors was significantly lower than their neurotypical controls, as measured by theoretically driven composites of verbal and visual memory, executive functions, attention, and CR. They presented greater ventricle-to-brain ratio volume, compared to noninjured controls, with higher scores indicating lower BR levels. Both BR and TSI were significantly associated with CR. Also, a median-split analysis revealed a TSI effect on CR. Significant associations were evident between the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended and the BR and CR measures. Conclusions Lingering neuropsychological deficits in chronic TBI support the role of BR and CR in functional outcome. Furthermore, TSI interferes with CR supporting the notion that TBI sets off a chronic neurodegenerative and progressive course that interferes with semantic knowledge.

Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) high Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) scores at the time of injury and repair are associated with pain and cold sensitivity after 1-year recovery and (2) insula gray matter changes reflect the course of injury and improvements over time. Ten patients with complete median and/or ulnar nerve transections and surgical repair were tested ∼3 weeks after surgical nerve repair (time 1) and ∼1 year later for 6 of the 10 patients (time 2). Patients and 10 age-/sex-matched healthy controls completed questionnaires that assessed pain (patients) and personality and underwent quantitative sensory testing and 3T MRI to assess cortical thickness. In patients, pain intensity and neuropathic pain correlated with pain catastrophizing. Time 1 pain catastrophizing trended toward predicting cold pain thresholds at time 2, and at time 1 cortical thickness of the right insula was reduced. At time 2, chronic pain was related to the time 1 pain-PCS relationship and cold sensitivity, pain catastrophizing correlated with cold pain threshold, and insula thickness reversed to control levels. This study highlights the interplay between personality, sensory function, and pain in patients following PNI and repair. The PCS-pain association suggests that a focus on affective or negative components of pain could render patients vulnerable to chronic pain. Cold sensitivity and structural insula changes may reflect altered thermosensory or sensorimotor awareness representations."

Particularly in the elderly with mTBI, the pre-injury status might play a relevant role in the recovery process. In most mTBI studies, however, pre-injury complaints are neither analyzed nor are the elderly included. Here, we aimed to identify which individual pre- and post-injury complaints are potential prognostic markers for incomplete recovery (IR) in elderly patients who sustained an mTBI. Since patients report many complaints across several domains that are strongly related, we used an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to robustly deal with correlated predictors and boost classification performance. Pre- and post-injury levels of 20 individual complaints, as self-reported in the acute phase, were analyzed. We used data from two independent studies separately: UPFRONT study was used for training and validation and ReCONNECT study for independent testing. Functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomized functional outcome into complete recovery (CR; GOSE = 8) and IR (GOSE ≤ 7). In total 148 elderly with mTBI (median age: 67 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 9 years; UPFRONT: N = 115; ReCONNECT: N = 33) were included in this study. IR was observed in 74 (50%) patients. The classification model (IR vs. CR) achieved a good performance (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC-AUC] = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74-0.86) based on a subset of only 8 out of 40 pre- and post-injury complaints. We identified increased neck pain (p = 0.001) from pre- to post-injury as the strongest predictor of IR, followed by increased irritability (p = 0.011) and increased forgetfulness (p = 0.035) from pre- to post-injury. Our findings indicate that a subset of pre- and post-injury physical, emotional, and cognitive complaints has predictive value for determining long-term functional outcomes in elderly patients with mTBI. Particularly, post-injury neck pain, irritability, and forgetfulness scores were associated with IR and should be assessed early. The application of an ML approach holds promise for application in self-reported questionnaires to predict outcomes after mTBI."

The magnitude of impairment for individuals with TBI severity classified as moderate/severe TBI was moderate, whereas severe TBI was large. Moderate/large effect sizes were observed across the different modalities of presentation. This meta-analysis provides evidence for marked global impairments in emotion recognition, with the magnitude of impairment greatest for negative emotions (i.e., anger and fear). This meta-analysis provided no evidence to suggest that the magnitude of impairment is influenced by injury severity or modality of stimulus presentation.

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading cause of psychiatric conditions in patients, amongst which, depression and anxiety are more frequent. Despite the preclinical antidepressant-like effects, clinical development of Phospodiesterase-4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibitors has been hampered due to serious side effect profiles, such as nausea and vomiting. Etazolate (ETZ) is a new generation PDE4 inhibitor with encouraging safety and tolerance profiles. In our previous studies we have addressed that ETZ produces antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression, however, the underlying mechanism(s) following TBI have not been completely explored. Impact accelerated TBI by weight drop method causes depression-like behavioral deficits in modified open field exploration, hyper-emotionality and sucrose consumption paradigms. TBI not only causes immediate mechanical damage to the brain, but also induces biochemical changes that lead to delayed neural cell loss leading to a secondary injury. The present study examines the antidepressant effects of ETZ on the TBI-induced depression-like behavior deficits and attempts to explore the underlying mechanism. In order to understand the underlying pathology of TBI and mechanism(s) of ETZ in TBI molecular markers namely, brain cAMP, cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were estimated. Additionally, the level of oxidative (lipid peroxidation) & nitrosative (nitrite) stress markers, along with antioxidant enzymes markers, such as, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Furthermore, the involvement of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity in underlying mechanism was also investigated by measuring serum corticosterone (CORT) level. The results revealed that TBI significantly altered cAMP, pCREB and BDNF levels. Moreover, a significant increase in oxidative-nitrosative stress markers levels, while, significant decreases in antioxidant enzymes markers level were observed. However, no significant change was observed in serum CORT level. Chronic ETZ (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated TBI-induced behavioral deficits and restored the TBI induced derangements in molecular and biochemical markers. This study indicates that ETZ modulates cAMP signaling and oxidative/antioxidant markers in the TBI model suggesting its prospect as a potential candidate for the pharmacotherapy of depression."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health epidemic. It represents the principal cause of death and disability in individuals aged under 35 in the USA. In the subacute phase, severe TBI patients who recover consciousness go through a state of agitation and delirium. However, there is only limited research exploring the characteristics of post-traumatic delirium (PTD) although it is likely to be more frequent than in general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Evidence suggest the incidence of delirium in non-TBI ICU patients is up to 86%. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development and progression of delirium in critically ill patients is still unclear. Many hypotheses have been proposed to play a role: neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance, structural and functional brain damage. TBI patients are at high risk of post-traumatic cognitive impairment, and up to two thirds of patients who survive TBI develop agitation and delirium which is associated with increased disability and long term cognitive impairment. Recommendation for the treatment of PTD in patients admitted to ICU are not clearly identified. Despite the high prevalence of PTD, the condition often goes misrecognized and attributed primarily to the injury itself. There is increasing evidence that certain drugs such as antipsychotics can reduce the incidence and severity of delirium, whereas other drugs such as dexmedetomidine and remifentanil are associated with decreased risk of developing delirium in general ICU patients. However, there is a lack of high quality studies exploring treatment strategies for PTD in the acute setting."

In recent years, suicide has been widely cited as being associated with CTE, and now depression has been proposed to be one of three core diagnostic features alongside cognitive impairment and anger control problems. This evolution of the clinical features has been reinforced by thousands of media stories reporting a connection between mental health problems in former athletes and military veterans, repetitive neurotrauma, and CTE. At present, the science underlying the causal assumption between repetitive neurotrauma, depression, suicide, and the neuropathology believed to be unique to CTE is inconclusive. Epidemiological evidence indicates that former National Football League players, for example, are at lower, not greater, risk for suicide than men in the general population.

Seventy-one university students with a negative concussion history completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). A multiple regression was conducted using the three DASS subscale scores as predictors of postconcussion-like symptoms. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress were significantly positively correlated with postconcussion-like symptoms at the bivariate level. When these three factors were examined together 72.9% of variance in BC-PSI total scores was explained overall. Stress and depressive symptoms emerged as significant multivariate predictors explaining 15% and 3% of unique variance, respectively. Anxiety was not a significant multivariate predictor. These results suggest that stress may be a more important predictor of postconcussion-like symptoms than previously identified.

Consequently, there is a need to focus on means to prevent or ameliorate these morbidities. Animal models provide important data regarding the neurobiological effects of physical activity, including angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and release of neurotrophic factors that enhance plasticity. Studies in noncritically ill patients demonstrate that exercise is associated with increased cerebral blood flow, neurogenesis, and brain volume, which are associated with improved cognition. Clinically, research in both healthy and diseased human subjects suggests that exercise improves neuropsychiatric outcomes. In the critical care setting, early physical rehabilitation and mobilization are safe and feasible, with demonstrated improvements in physical functional outcomes. Such activity may also reduce the duration of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) and improve neuropsychiatric outcomes, although data are limited. Barriers exist regarding implementing ICU rehabilitation in routine care, including use of sedatives and lack of awareness of post-ICU cognitive impairments. Further research is necessary to determine whether prior animal and human research, in conjunction with preliminary results from existing ICU studies, can translate into improvements for neuropsychiatric outcomes in critically ill patients. Studies are needed to evaluate biological mechanisms, risk factors, the role of pre-ICU functional level, and the timing, duration, and type of physical activity for optimal patient outcomes."

We previously demonstrated that inhibiting endocannabinoid degradation post-TBI with JZL184 attenuates neuroinflammation and neuronal hyperexcitability at the site of injury and improves neurobehavioral recovery. This study aimed to determine the effect of JZL184 on post-TBI behavioral changes related to psychiatric dysfunction and post-TBI neuroadaptations in brain regions associated with these behaviors. We hypothesized that JZL184 would attenuate post-TBI behavioral and neural changes in alcohol-drinking rats. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to operantly self-administer alcohol before receiving lateral fluid percussion injury. Thirty minutes post-TBI, rats received JZL184 (16 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. Spatial memory (Y-maze), anxiety-like behavior (open field), alcohol motivation (progressive ratio responding), and mechanosensitivity (Von Frey) were measured 3-10 days post-injury, and ventral striatum (VS) and central amygdala (CeA) tissue were collected for western blot analysis of phosphorylated glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). TBI impaired spatial memory, increased anxiety-like behavior, and increased motivated alcohol drinking. JZL184 prevented these changes. TBI also increased phosphorylated GluR1 and GR in the CeA (but not the VS) compared with sham controls. JZL184 attenuated post-TBI GR phosphorylation in the CeA. These findings suggest that TBI produces comorbid cognitive dysfunction, increased alcohol motivation, and anxiety-like behavior, possibly related to amygdala dysfunction, and these changes are prevented by systemic post-TBI endocannabinoid degradation inhibition. Thus, boosting endocannabinoid tone post-TBI may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for TBI-related psychiatric comorbidities such as alcohol use disorder and anxiety."

Data were obtained by independent review of clinical notes, objective outcomes, and validated questionnaires from 214 SMs (208 males) with a history of TBI assessed in the CAREN from 2010 to 2015. Three preliminary VEs acclimatized patients to the CAREN: Balance Balls, weight shifting on a static platform (timed); Balance Cubes, step shifting with and without platform motion (timed); and Continuous Road, flat ambulation (self-selected speed). Multiple regression analyses revealed that patients with comorbid TBI-PTSD were significantly slower in completing the VE tasks than patients without PTSD. Logistic regression showed that the Balance Cubes VE without platform motion significantly predicted diagnostic category (i.e., no PTSD vs. comorbid PTSD). In conclusion, in SMs with a history of TBI, physical performance on the CAREN effectively distinguished those with comorbid PTSD, as their performance was significantly slower than SMs without PTSD.

            "abstract": "This review demonstrates essential issues to consider when caring for older trauma patients, including baseline physical status, mental health, comorbidities, and risk factors for sequelae and future injuries. The impact of a traumatic injury on older adults is complex. Issues of normal aging, functional status, chronic health conditions, and response to treatment affect health care and related decisions. Studies that have examined outcomes for older trauma patients to date have been mainly descriptive or confined to a single institution, limiting our ability to generalize. Other studies, using large data sets, have provided some information regarding possible primary prevention strategies, yet have limitations in the individual level detail collected. Nevertheless, this review also demonstrates the dearth of available evidence-based recommendations that provides support to treatment protocols in this complex and diverse patient population. The lack of an evidence base to use in the management of older trauma patients demonstrates the critical need for research in this rapidly growing population. An example of one such area includes the use of pulmonary artery catheters in older trauma patients. Although evidence to date suggests that pulmonary artery catheters are of benefit in the management of patients with physiologic compromise, it is unclear whether using these published cardiac output management recommendations leads to improved outcomes. In light of newly published data suggesting equivocal benefit from use of pulmonary artery catheters, with increased side effects, this controversy is an important area for future research. Critical care nurses, with their emphasis on multidisciplinary, holistic practice, can expand their influence as essential members of the interdisciplinary team caring for older trauma patients by cultivating geriatric specialty knowledge. Older trauma patients would benefit greatly from this type of specialty nursing care during all phases of the recovery trajectory, particularly in terms of adequate symptom management and prevention of sequelae, as well as with timely and appropriate initiation of consultative services. Using the intersection of primary and secondary prevention as the overall guide for practice, critical care nurses and other health care providers who possess an understanding of aging processes and comorbid conditions can significantly improve outcomes for older adults with traumatic injuries."

Results indicated pain was the most common complaint, with 87 percent experiencing pain during the prior week and 56 percent reporting moderate or severe pain. Eighty percent of participants met criteria for at least one of seven assessed comorbid problems (moderate or severe pain, postconcussional disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], anxiety disorder, mood disorder, substance use disorder, psychosis), and 59 percent met criteria for two or more problems. PTSD and postconcussional disorder rarely occurred in the absence of pain or other comorbidities (0.3% and 0%, respectively).

            "abstract": "Anxiety disorder is a comorbid condition of chronic pain. Analgesics and anxiolytics, subject to addiction and abuse, are currently used to manage pain and anxiety symptoms. However, the cellular mechanism underlying chronic pain and anxiety interaction remains to be elucidated. We report that persistent nociception following peripheral nerve injury induced anxiety-like behavior in rodents. Brain expression and release of neuropeptide S (NPS), a proposed endogenous anxiolytic peptide, was diminished in rodents with coexisting nociceptive and anxiety-like behaviors. Intracerebroventricular administration of exogenous NPS concurrently improved both nociceptive and anxiety-like behaviors. At the cellular level, NPS enhanced intra-amygdaloidal inhibitory transmission by increasing presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from interneurons. These findings indicate that the interaction between nociceptive and anxiety-like behaviors in rodents may be regulated by the altered NPS-mediated intra-amygdaloidal GABAergic inhibition. The data suggest that enhancing the brain NPS function may be a new strategy to manage comorbid pain and anxiety."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7 million people in the United States every year, resulting in increased risk of death and disabilities. A significant portion of TBIs experienced by military personnel are induced by explosive blast devices. Active duty military personnel are especially vulnerable to mild blast-induced (mb)TBI and the associated long-term effects, such as anxiety disorders. Additionally, females are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety-related disorders. The mechanism by which mbTBI results in anxiety disorders in males and females is unknown. The sexually dimorphic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a brain signaling system linked to anxiety. CRF and its family of related peptides modulate anxiety-related behaviors by binding to CRF receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (CRFR1, CRFR2, respectively). These receptors are distributed throughout limbic structures that control behaviors related to emotion, memory, and arousal. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the link between mbTBI and anxiety by examining the impact of mbTBI on the CRFR system in male and female mice. mbTBI increased anxiety-like behaviors in both males and females (p < 0.05). In the present study, mbTBI did not alter CRFR1 gene expression in males or females. However, mbTBI disrupted CRFR2 gene expression in different limbic structures in males and females. In males, mbTBI increased baseline CRFR2 gene expression in the ventral hippocampus (p < 0.05) and decreased restraint-induced expression in the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST) and amygdala (p < 0.05). In females, mbTBI decreased restraint-induced CRFR2 gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus (p < 0.05). The inherent sex differences and the mbTBI-induced decrease in restraint-induced CRFR2 gene expression may contribute to anxiety-like behaviors. The results of the present study show that the response to mbTBI within the limbic structures modulates anxiety in a sex-dependent manner. The studies further suggest that CRFR2 may serve as a potential target to mitigate mbTBI effects."

Theories about the pathophysiology of CMS have evolved along with our understanding of the cerebellum as an important structure in the distributive neurocircuitry underlying complex speech, cognition, and behavior. CMS shares many similarities with the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome, more commonly described in adults and consisting of disturbances of executive function, visuospatial skills, nonmotor language, and affect regulation.

Greater post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were the only consistent predictor of belonging to all the subgroups who had IAA compared with the no IAA subgroup. We conclude that IAA had different trajectories after a TBI. The majority of V/SM had persistent impairment from IAA, a quarter of the sample had no impairment from IAA, and fewer participants had resolving or worsening IAA. Findings emphasize the importance of educating providers and family of the different ways and times that IAA can manifest after TBI.

            "abstract": "Changes in brain structure and cortical function are associated with many chronic pain conditions including low back pain and fibromyalgia. The magnitude of these changes correlates with the duration and/or the intensity of chronic pain. Most studies report changes in common areas involved in pain modulation, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and pain-related pathological changes in the PFC can be reversed with effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown, they must be dynamically regulated. Epigenetic modulation of gene expression in response to experience and environment is reversible and dynamic. Epigenetic modulation by DNA methylation is associated with abnormal behavior and pathological gene expression in the central nervous system. DNA methylation might also be involved in mediating the pathologies associated with chronic pain in the brain. We therefore tested a) whether alterations in DNA methylation are found in the brain long after chronic neuropathic pain is induced in the periphery using the spared nerve injury modal and b) whether these injury-associated changes are reversible by interventions that reverse the pathologies associated with chronic pain. Six months following peripheral nerve injury, abnormal sensory thresholds and increased anxiety were accompanied by decreased global methylation in the PFC and the amygdala but not in the visual cortex or the thalamus. Environmental enrichment attenuated nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity and reversed the changes in global PFC methylation. Furthermore, global PFC methylation correlated with mechanical and thermal sensitivity in neuropathic mice. In summary, induction of chronic pain by peripheral nerve injury is associated with epigenetic changes in the brain. These changes are detected long after the original injury, at a long distance from the site of injury and are reversible with environmental manipulation. Changes in brain structure and cortical function that are associated with chronic pain conditions may therefore be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms."

To this end, twelve Iraq war Veterans (32.0 ± 8.5 [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] years of age) reporting one or more blast exposures meeting American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for mTBI and persistent PCS and 12 cognitively normal community volunteers (53.0 ± 4.6 years of age) without history of head trauma underwent brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and neuropsychological assessments and completed PCS and psychiatric symptom rating scales. Compared to controls, Veterans with mTBI (with or without PTSD) exhibited decreased cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in the cerebellum, vermis, pons, and medial temporal lobe. They also exhibited subtle impairments in verbal fluency, cognitive processing speed, attention, and working memory, similar to those reported in the literature for patients with cerebellar lesions. These FDG-PET imaging findings suggest that regional brain hypometabolism may constitute a neurobiological substrate for chronic PCS in Iraq combat Veterans with repetitive blast-trauma mTBI. Given the potential public health implications of these findings, further investigation of brain function in these Veterans appears warranted."

Participants were 227 adults who were hospitalized post-TBI (76% male; mean age = 41 years; 50% mild, 33% moderate, and 17% severe TBI). Major and minor depressive episodes were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at three time points (4, 8, and 12 months after TBI). Overall, 29% of participants had a major depressive episode in at least one of the three assessments, with fairly stable rates across assessments. Participants with mild TBI were more likely than those with moderate/severe TBI to be diagnosed with major depression, as were individuals with a positive pre-morbid history of depression compared to those without such history. In addition, 13% of participants had a minor depressive episode in at least one of the three assessments. Rates of minor depression significantly decreased from 4 to 8-12 months post-injury. Results also revealed a wide variety of trajectories of depressive episodes across assessments. Of note, 52% of major depression cases still fulfilled diagnostic criteria 4 months later, whereas 38% of minor depression cases deteriorated to major depression at the following assessment. These findings suggest that depression is highly prevalent after TBI, and monitoring of patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms is warranted in order to prevent the development of full-blown major depressive episodes."

Herein, we examined the effect of comorbid depression on the detection of persistent PCS using EVestG. To validate our previously developed EVestG classifier for PCS detection, the classifier was tested with a new blind dataset (N = 21). The unbiased accuracy for identifying the new PCS from controls was found to be >90%. Next, the PCS group (N = 59) was divided into three subgroups: PCS with no-depression (n = 18), PCS with mild-depression (n = 27) and PCS with moderate/severe-depression (n = 14). When moderate/severe depression was present, PCS classification accuracy dropped to 83%. By adding an EVestG depression feature from a previous study, separation accuracy of each PCS subgroup from controls was >90%. A four and three-group (excluding mild-depression subgroup) classification, achieved an accuracy of 74% and 81%, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation (R = 0.67) between the depression feature and the MADRS depression score as well as between the PCS-specific feature and Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) (R = -0.48). No significant correlation was found between the PCS-specific feature and the MADRS score (R = 0.20) or between RPQ and the depression feature (R = 0.12). The (PCS-specific and depression-specific) EVestG features used herein have the potential to robustly detect and monitor changes, relatively independently, in both persistent PCS and its depression comorbidity. Clinically, this can be particularly advantageous."

This evolution has resulted in difficulty disentangling the physical trauma of mild TBI from the emotional trauma of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Advances in stress neurobiology and knowledge of brain injury at the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, and molecular levels call for a redefinition of TBI that encompasses both physical and emotional TBI. Conceptualizing a spectrum of TBI with both physical and emotional causation resolves the irreconcilable tangle between diagnostic categories and acknowledges overlapping forms of brain injury and shared systemic effects due to hormonal and inflammatory mediators. Recognizing emotional TBI shifts the interpretation of emotional trauma from a confound to a comorbid, related cause of brain injury. The mechanism of emotional TBI includes the intricate actions of stress hormones on diverse brain functions due to changes in synaptic plasticity, where chronically elevated hormone levels reduce neurogenesis, resulting in dendritic atrophy and impaired cognition. The overlapping effects of physical and emotional trauma are seen in neuropathology (ie, reduction of hippocampal volume in TBI and PTSD); fMRI (similar regional activations in physical and emotional pain); and systemic sequelae, including changes in proinflammatory cytokine levels and immune cell function. Accumulating evidence favors a change in the definition of TBI to encompass emotional TBI. The definition of TBI will be strengthened by the inclusion of both physical and emotional trauma that result in diverse and overlapping forms of brain injury with sequelae for physical and mental health."

Mental fatigue in patients in acute phase was more severe than in chronic phase patients and healthy controls. The first 5-min-PVT increased CBF of patients in acute phase in \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" attention areas, and decreased CBF in default mode network (DMN) areas. Twenty-min-PVT results showed that sustained attention of patients was more fragile than in healthy subjects, while sustained attention in the acute phase was less stable than that in the chronic phase. CBF results showed that in patients in the acute phase, the second, third, and last 5-min-PVT decreased CBF in DMN areas, increased CBF of \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" areas; in the chronic phase, the third and last 5-min-PVT increased CBF of \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" cortex, while the second 5-min-PVT only increased CBF of the \"top-down\" cortex. Mental fatigue of MTBI patients persists for more than 12 months, and can be mitigated partly within the first year after injury.

            "abstract": "A barrier in the diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) stems from the lack of measures that are adequately sensitive in detecting mild head injuries. MRI and CT are typically negative in mTBI patients with persistent symptoms of post-concussive syndrome (PCS), and characteristic difficulties in sustaining attention often go undetected on neuropsychological testing, which can be insensitive to momentary lapses in concentration. Conversely, visual tracking strongly depends on sustained attention over time and is impaired in chronic mTBI patients, especially when tracking an occluded target. This finding suggests deficient internal anticipatory control in mTBI, the neural underpinnings of which are poorly understood. The present study investigated the neuronal bases for deficient anticipatory control during visual tracking in 25 chronic mTBI patients with persistent PCS symptoms and 25 healthy control subjects. The task was performed while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG), which allowed us to examine whether neural dysfunction associated with anticipatory control deficits was due to altered alpha, beta, and/or gamma activity. Neuropsychological examinations characterized cognition in both groups. During MEG recordings, subjects tracked a predictably moving target that was either continuously visible or randomly occluded (gap condition). MEG source-imaging analyses tested for group differences in alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The results showed executive functioning, information processing speed, and verbal memory deficits in the mTBI group. Visual tracking was impaired in the mTBI group only in the gap condition. Patients showed greater error than controls before and during target occlusion, and were slower to resynchronize with the target when it reappeared. Impaired tracking concurred with abnormal beta activity, which was suppressed in the parietal cortex, especially the right hemisphere, and enhanced in left caudate and frontal-temporal areas. Regional beta-amplitude demonstrated high classification accuracy (92%) compared to eye-tracking (65%) and neuropsychological variables (80%). These findings show that deficient internal anticipatory control in mTBI is associated with altered beta activity, which is remarkably sensitive given the heterogeneity of injuries."

Most studies found the occurrence of posttraumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) to be unrelated to injury severity. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and hypogonadism were reported most frequently. Hypopituitarism, and in particular adult GHD, is associated with symptoms that resemble those of PTSD, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, cognitive deficiencies, and decreased quality of life. However, the prevalence of PTHP after blast-related mild TBI (mTBI), an extremely common injury in modern military operations, has not been characterized. We measured concentrations of 12 pituitary and target-organ hormones in two groups of male US Veterans of combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. One group consisted of participants with blast-related mTBI whose last blast exposure was at least 1 year prior to the study. The other consisted of Veterans with similar military deployment histories but without blast exposure. Eleven of 26, or 42% of participants with blast concussions were found to have abnormal hormone levels in one or more pituitary axes, a prevalence similar to that found in other forms of TBI. Five members of the mTBI group were found with markedly low age-adjusted insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels indicative of probable GHD, and three had testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations consistent with hypogonadism. If symptoms characteristic of both PTHP and PTSD can be linked to pituitary dysfunction, they may be amenable to treatment with hormone replacement. Routine screening for chronic hypopituitarism after blast concussion shows promise for appropriately directing diagnostic and therapeutic decisions that otherwise may remain unconsidered and for markedly facilitating recovery and rehabilitation."

These deficits are intrinsically associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) functionality. Currently, there is a lack of analogous, behaviorally characterized TBI models for investigating frontal lobe injuries despite the prevalence of focal contusions to the frontal lobe in TBI patients. We used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice to generate a frontal lobe contusion and studied behavioral changes associated with PFC function.

We used data from a prospective longitudinal survey of soldiers assessed 1-2 months before a 10-month deployment to Afghanistan (T0), on redeployment to the United States (T1), approximately 3 months later (T2), and approximately 9 months later (T3). Outcomes of interest were PCS at T2 and T3. Predictors considered were: sociodemographic factors, number of previous deployments, pre-deployment mental health and TBI history, and mTBI and other military-related stress during the index deployment. The study sample comprised 4518 soldiers, 822 (18.2%) of whom experienced mTBI during the index deployment. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and deployment-related factors, deployment-acquired mTBI was associated with nearly triple the risk of reporting any PCS and with increased severity of PCS when symptoms were present. Among those who sustained mTBI, severity of PCS at follow-up was associated with history of pre-deployment TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, more severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory (versus being \"dazed\" only) as a result of deployment-acquired mTBI. In summary, we found that sustaining mTBI increases risk for persistent PCS. Previous TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory resulting from mTBI(s) are prognostic indicators of persistent PCS after an index mTBI.

Compared with those with AFE >12 years, a similar proportion of former high school football players who began playing tackle football before age 12 reported that they had been prescribed medications for mental health problems or that they had recently experienced symptoms of anxiety, depression, memory loss, chronic pain, or headaches. Moreover, there was no significant difference in their lifetime history of treatment by a mental health professional. The groups did not differ significantly on PHQ-8 (U = 1839.0, p = 0.791) or BC-PSI total scores (U = 1828.5, p = 0.751). These findings suggest that earlier AFE to football is not associated with worse brain health in middle-aged men in this sample who played high school football."

            "title": "Aging with Traumatic Brain Injury: Effects of Age at Injury on Behavioral Outcome following Diffuse Brain Injury in Rats.",
            "abstract": "Development and aging are influenced by external factors with the potential to impact health throughout the life span. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can initiate and sustain a lifetime of physical and mental health symptoms. Over 1.7 million TBIs occur annually in the USA alone, with epidemiology suggesting a higher incidence for young age groups. Additionally, increasing life spans mean more years to age with TBI. While there is ongoing research of experimental pediatric and adult TBI, few studies to date have incorporated animal models of pediatric, adolescent, and adult TBI to understand the role of age at injury across the life span. Here, we explore repeated behavioral performance between rats exposed to diffuse TBI at five different ages. Our aim was to follow neurological morbidities across the rodent life span with respect to age at injury. A single cohort of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 69) was received at postnatal day (PND) 10. Subgroups of this cohort (n = 11-12/group) were subjected to a single moderate midline fluid percussion injury at age PND 17, PND 35, 2 months, 4 months, or 6 months. A control group of naïve rats (n = 12) was assembled from this cohort. The entire cohort was assessed for motor function by beam walk at 1.5, 3, 5, and 7 months of age. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed with the open field test at 8 months of age. Cognitive performance was assessed using the novel object location task at 8, 9, and 10 months of age. Depression-like behavior was assessed using the forced swim test at 10 months of age. Age at injury and time since injury differentially influenced motor, cognitive, and affective behavioral outcomes. Motor and cognitive deficits occurred in rats injured at earlier developmental time points, but not in rats injured in adulthood. In contrast, rats injured during adulthood showed increased anxiety-like behavior compared to uninjured control rats. A single diffuse TBI did not result in chronic depression-like behaviors or changes in body weight among any groups. The interplay of age at injury and aging with an injury are translationally important factors that influence behavioral performance as a quality of life metric. More complete understanding of these factors can direct rehabilitative efforts and personalized medicine for TBI survivors."

No definitive clinical diagnosis for this condition exists. In this work, we used [F-18]FDDNP PET to detect brain patterns of neuropathology distribution in retired professional American football players with suspected CTE (n = 14) and compared results with those of cognitively intact controls (n = 28) and patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (n = 24), a disease that has been cognitively associated with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging results in the retired players suggested the presence of neuropathological patterns consistent with models of concussion wherein brainstem white matter tracts undergo early axonal damage and cumulative axonal injuries along subcortical, limbic, and cortical brain circuitries supporting mood, emotions, and behavior. This deposition pattern is distinctively different from the progressive pattern of neuropathology [paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and amyloid-β] in AD, which typically begins in the medial temporal lobe progressing along the cortical default mode network, with no or minimal involvement of subcortical structures. This particular [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging pattern in cases of suspected CTE also is primarily consistent with PHF-tau distribution observed at autopsy in subjects with a history of mild TBI and autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of CTE."

This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) aimed at improving the HRQOL of care partners. Participants are randomized either to a control group, where they wear the Fitbit® and provide daily reports of HRQOL over a six-month (180 day) period (without the personalized feedback), or the JITAI group, where they wear the Fitbit®, provide daily reports of HRQOL and receive personalized self-management pushes for 6 months. 240 participants will be enrolled (n = 120 control group; n = 120 JITAI group). Outcomes are collected at baseline, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- & 6-months, as well as 3- and 6-months post intervention. We hypothesize that the care partners who receive the intervention (JITAI group) will show improvements in caregiver strain (primary outcome) and mental health (depression and anxiety) after the 6-month (180 day) home monitoring period. Participant recruitment for this study started in November 2020. Data collection efforts should be completed by spring 2025; results are expected by winter 2025.

            "abstract": "Objective: Fear-avoidance and endurance behavior are well-established maladaptive coping styles in several chronic health conditions. There is also emerging evidence that both fear-avoidance and endurance coping are associated with poor outcome from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The current study sought to characterize the early trajectories of avoidance and endurance behavior and confirm their association with disability outcomes. Method: Adults with mTBI (N = 88) completed measures of avoidance, endurance, and postconcussive symptoms at clinic intake (M = 40.2 days since injury). Avoidance and endurance measures were readministered 1 month later (N = 79), and a measure of perceived functional disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0) was completed 3 months after clinic intake (N = 69). Results: Avoidance and endurance coping were weakly positively correlated with each other at intake (r = .28) and at 1 month postintake (r = .28). Change scores on these two measures over time were not significantly correlated (r = .04). Avoidance coping tended to decrease over time (95% CI [0.6, 2.5]; p = .002), whereas changes in endurance coping were variable. In generalized linear modeling, higher avoidance and endurance at clinic intake and increasing (or less rapidly decreasing) levels of these coping styles over 1 month was associated with greater perceived disability ratings at 3 months, even after controlling for postconcussion symptom severity at intake. Conclusion: These findings suggest that avoidance and endurance behavior are distinct coping styles with unique trajectories during the subacute recovery period. The results also support the need for psychologically informed early interventions that target specific profiles of maladaptive coping to mitigate risk for poor outcomes post-mTBI.

            "abstract": "Understanding the neuropathological underpinnings of sport-related concussion are critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and remediation. Although electro-encephalographic (EEG) methods have proven invaluable for understanding psycho-affective pathologies in various clinical conditions, they have not been used to understand the psycho-affective outcomes of concussive injuries. Accordingly, we evaluated the relation of electroencephalographic (EEG) power in collegiate athletes to psycho-affective measures. We predicted that athletes with a history of concussion would exhibit alterations in frontal EEG asymmetries indicative of increased depression, anxiety and more general mood disturbance. During this cross-sectional study, resting EEG and measures of mood and affect, including the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) were collected in 81 young-adult male athletes (52 concussion history; 29 controls). All athletes with a history of concussion (9+ months from injury) reported to be symptom free, and all participants were actively taking part in their sport at the time of testing. Compared to control athletes, the athletes with a history of concussion exhibited alterations in frontal-alpha and frontal-beta asymmetry (p's < .05). Correlational analyses revealed that alterations in frontal-alpha asymmetry were related to self-reported depression and anxiety, and alterations in beta-asymmetry were related to self-reported anger/aggression, but these relations were only significant for athletes with a history of concussion. The current study suggests that athletes with a history of concussion who made a complete return to play and reported to be asymptomatic on a commonly used symptom checklist may still exhibit neural activity associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety and anger/hostility. The current results reinforce the clinical necessity for long-term evaluations of athletes irrespective of apparent symptom resolution, and suggest that EEG may serve as a sensitive tool to identify and track concussion-related alterations in psycho-affective health before they manifest as clinical disorders."

An accurate differential diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of mTBI and PTSD are challenging due to significant symptom overlap and the absence of clearly established biomarkers. The objective of this work is to examine how post-traumatic stress influences task-free default mode network in chronic mTBI subjects. Control subjects (N = 44) were compared with chronic mTBI subjects with low (N = 58, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version [PCL-C] total < 30), medium (N = 124, PCL-C total = 31-49), and high (N = 105, PCL-C total ≥ 60) post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The results indicate significant differences in Brodmann area 10 for all mTBI subject groups, indicating potential mTBI-related disruptions with regulation of emotions and decision-making. The effects of PTSS were observed in the anterior cingulate and parahippocampus, suggesting possible disruptions pertaining to memory regulation, encoding, and retrieval. The overall results indicate the presence of aberrant connectivity patterns between controls and chronic mTBI subjects with low, medium, and high PTSS. Furthermore, the findings suggest a disruption in attention relating to a network of brain regions involved with emotional regulation and memory coding, rather than a fear-related response. Taken together, the results suggest these regions form a network that could be a target for future research pertaining to PTSD and chronic mTBI. Furthermore, the use of clinical measures, task-based imaging studies, or multimodal imaging could help further elucidate specific neural correlates of PTSS and mTBI."

Also, the frequent co-occurrence of blast-related mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) among recently deployed U.S. military personnel complicates efforts to understand the basis for emotional disruption. We studied a cross-sectional sample (enriched for PTSD and mTBI) of 123 U.S. veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We measured subjective affective evaluations and peripheral psychophysiological responses to images with pleasant, neutral, unpleasant, and combat-related aversive content. When compared with other postdeployment participants, those who had combat-related PTSD rated pleasant image content as less positive (ηp2 = .04) and less arousing (ηp2 = .06), and exhibited heightened physiological responsivity to combat image content (ηp2 = .07). Symptoms of PTSD were associated with elevated skin conductance responses (β = .28), reduced heart rate deceleration (β = .44 to .47), and increased corrugator facial muscle electromyography (β = .47). No effects for blast-related mTBI were observed across any affective modulation measures. These findings point to a greater impact of PTSD symptomatology than blast-related mTBI on emotional functioning and highlight the utility of dimensional assessments of psychopathology for understanding the effects of combat-stress conditions on adjustment to civilian life."

Although spinal cord microglia are involved in abnormal sensitivity to neuropathic pain, no previous studies have examined the mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced anxiety. Here, we examined the involvement of bone marrow (BM)-derived microglia aggregated in the amygdalae of mice with chronic neuropathic pain in the development of anxiety-like behavior. We prepared partial sciatic nerve ligations (PSNL) in mice that received bone marrow transplantation from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Tg mice after irradiation with head protection, and examined GFP-positive microglia in the central nuclei of the amygdalae (CeA). On day 28 after PSNL, BM-derived microglia aggregated in the CeA concurrent with anxiety-like behavior. BM-derived microglia in the CeA highly expressed interleukin (IL)-1β and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2). In addition, neurons in the CeA highly expressed monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a ligand for CCR2, in PSNL-treated mice compared to sham-operated mice, suggesting that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis is involved in the recruitment of BM-derived microglia. Oral administration of a CCR2 antagonist decreased the number of BM-derived microglia in the CeA, and successfully reversed the anxiety-like behavior and hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli in PSNL-treated mice. Microinjections of an IL-1β receptor antagonist directly into the CeA successfully reversed the anxiety-like behavior in the PSNL-treated mice even though the neuropathic pain persisted. These results suggest that the recruitment of BM-derived microglia to the CeA via the MCP-1/CCR2 axis and neuron-microglia interactions might be important in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain-induced anxiety."

TBI is also a common cause of acquired epilepsy, which is itself associated with significant behavioral morbidity. This review considers the clinical and preclinical evidence that post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) acts as a 'second-hit' insult to worsen chronic behavioral outcomes for brain-injured patients, across the domains of emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. Surprisingly, few well-designed studies have specifically examined the relationship between seizures and behavioral outcomes after TBI. The complex mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain incompletely understood, although many of the biological processes that precipitate seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis may also contribute to the development of chronic behavioral deficits. Further, the relationship between PTE and behavioral dysfunction is increasingly recognized to be a bidirectional one, whereby premorbid conditions are a risk factor for PTE. Clinical studies in this arena are often challenged by the confounding effects of anti-seizure medications, while preclinical studies have rarely examined an adequately extended time course to fully capture the time course of epilepsy development after a TBI. To drive the field forward towards improved treatment strategies, it is imperative that both seizures and neurobehavioral outcomes are assessed in parallel after TBI, both in patient populations and preclinical models."

Central synapses, especially excitatory synapses, are undergoing long-term memory-like plastic changes after peripheral injury. These changes not only occur at the single synaptic level, but also take place at cortical and subcortical circuits. Consequently, neuronal responses to peripheral sensory stimuli, or even to sensory inputs triggered by normal physiological signals such as touch and movement, are significantly potentiated or increased. Such prolonged cortical excitation likely contributes to chronic pain and its related emotional changes. In this short review article, I will summarize recent progress using animal models and explore possible different mechanisms that may contribute to chronic pain in the brain."

However, research suggests that those with a history of mTBI can benefit from evidence-based PTSD treatment. To extend these findings, we examined whether specific mTBI injury markers were associated with PTSD treatment attendance and response. Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans with PTSD and history of mTBI (N = 88) all received Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; either standard CPT without the trauma account or SMART-CPT, a modified version of CPT that included cognitive rehabilitation strategies). Analyses examined whether time since injury, presence of loss of consciousness (LOC) or posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), and number and mechanism of mTBIs were associated with treatment attendance or response. None of the five injury variables examined were associated with number of treatment sessions attended. Multilevel modeling indicated that injury variables did not moderate treatment response (across treatment conditions) in terms of change in PTSD and depression symptoms. There was a three-way interaction showing that individuals who denied ever experiencing LOC exhibited a greater decrease in PTSD and depression symptoms in standard CPT relative to those in the SMART-CPT. Thus, a history of mTBI should not preclude individuals from receiving standard CPT, regardless of injury characteristics. In fact, PTSD treatment should often be a first line of treatment for these veterans, given evidence of a mental health etiology to persistent post-concussive symptoms."

Historically, this was largely considered a phenomenon restricted to boxers, with more recent case series identifying further 'high risk' individuals, such as former American footballers, or military personnel. However, in all cases thus far reported, it is clear that it is the exposure to head injury which is associated with increased dementia risk, and not the circumstances or environment of exposure. As such, there is considerable potential for under-recognition of CTE in patients presenting with neurodegenerative disease, particularly where head injury exposure might have been historical and through sport. This article reviews current understanding of CTE and, via an illustrative case in rugby union, highlights the value of a detailed history on head injury and also draws attention to imaging studies in assessing patients with neurodegenerative disease."

            "abstract": "Impaired attention and memory represent some of the major long-term consequences of brain injuries. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of brain trauma-induced cognitive decline. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the hippocampus are believed to impact learning and memory. Herein, we have induced repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rMTBI) in rats by using weight-drop paradigm, examined the recognition memory using novel object recognition task, and assessed the HDAC activities in the hippocampus post 48 h and 30 days of rMTBI. The recognition memory was significantly compromised in the rMTBI-exposed rats at both the time points. The rMTBI increased mRNA levels of different isoforms of HDACs (HDAC2-5 and HDAC11) at different time points coupled with rise in nuclear and cytosolic HDAC activities. However, a mild decrease in HDAC8 mRNA levels was observed at 30 days time point. As a corollary, rMTBI also caused persistent decrease in the levels of acetylated histone H3-Lys 9 (H3-K9ac) in promoter region of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) gene with concurrent decline in CART mRNA and peptide (CARTp) levels. Furthermore, the treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), a pan HDAC inhibitor, restored the rMTBI-induced deficits in recognition memory and HDAC activities with commensurate changes in the H3-K9ac and CART mRNA levels. Together, these results suggest that rMTBI may trigger persistent changes in HDAC-mediated histone acetylation at the CART gene promoter culminating into deficits in learning and memory. Further, the present study also identifies therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors in rescuing MTBI-induced cognitive deficits."

Recent research indicated that anxiety is associated with abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) which can be evaluated by a power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, we investigated whether a frequency-domain analysis of HRV could correlate with the occurrence of anxiety in mTBI patients. We recruited 165 Taiwanese patients diagnosed with an mTBI and 82 volunteer healthy controls from three affiliated hospitals of Taipei Medical University during 2010-2014. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was assessed at the 1st, 6th, and 12th weeks. We found that mTBI patients were more vulnerable to anxiety compared to healthy controls. The power spectral density of HRV was significantly lower in mTBI patients than in healthy controls. A correlation analysis indicated that anxiety was negatively significantly correlated with low- and high-frequency power at the 6th week.

Physical system changes, for example following injury, can result in alterations of psychological processes and are accompanied by changes in corticolimbic circuits, which have been shown to be essential in emotional learning and memory, as well as reward processing and related behavior. In the present review, we thus highlight the importance of motivational, reward/pain relief, and fear learning processes in the context of chronic pain and discuss the potential of a mechanistic understanding of chronic pain within a clinical perspective, for example for the development of therapeutic strategies. We argue that changes in these mechanisms are not only characteristic for chronic pain, reflecting consequences of the disorder, but are also critically involved in the transition from acute to chronic pain states."

Dextromethorphan/quinidine 20 mg/10 mg twice daily was associated with a significantly greater decrease in the rate of pseudobulbar affect episodes per day (primary endpoint) than placebo in the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre STAR trial (Safety, Tolerability, And efficacy Results trial of AVP-923 in PBA [pseudobulbar affect]) involving patients with pseudobulbar affect and ALS or multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the mean change from baseline in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale score at 12 weeks was significantly greater among recipients of dextromethorphan/quinidine 20 mg/10 mg twice daily than those receiving placebo. Dextromethorphan/quinidine 20 mg/10 mg twice daily was generally well tolerated. The drug has been shown to cause dosage-dependent corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation; however, in the STAR trial, dextromethorphan/quinidine 20 mg/10 mg twice daily appeared to be well tolerated with regard to QTc prolongation."

The authors sought to better characterize the role of impaired sleep in each clinical subtype and to identify other risk factors for sleep impairment after SRC. 281 patients (15.3 ± 2.1 years) aged 10-22 years within 21 days of SRC completed the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS), and a clinical assessment to identify clinical subtype. Subjects were then divided into HIGH (≥7; n = 82) and LOW (≤3; n = 132) sleep symptom groups for comparison. HIGH participants had greater proportions of females (p < 0.001), history of psychiatric disorder (p < 0.001); total PCSS (p < 0.001); and impairment on all VOMS items (p < 0.001).

            "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may be associated with compromised executive functioning and altered emotional reactivity. Despite frequent affective and cognitive symptoms in mTBI, objective evidence for brain dysfunction is often lacking. Previously we have reported compromised performance in symptomatic mTBI patients in an executive reaction time (RT) test, a computer-based RT test engaging several executive functions simultaneously. Here, we investigated the cognitive control processes in mTBI in context of threat-related stimuli. We used behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate attentional capture by task-relevant and task-irrelevant emotional stimuli during a Go-NoGo task requiring cognitive control. We also assessed subjective cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms with questionnaires. Twenty-seven subjects with previous mTBI and 17 controls with previous ankle injury participated in the study over 9 months post-injury. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while patients performed a modified executive RT-test. N2-P3 ERP component was used as a general measure of allocated attentional and executive processing resources. Although at the time of the testing, the mTBI and the control groups did not differ in symptom endorsement, mTBI patients reported having had more emotional symptoms overall since the injury than controls. The overall RT-test performance levels did not differ between groups. However, when threat-related emotional stimuli were used as Go-signals, the mTBI group was faster than the control group. In comparison to neutral stimuli, threat-related stimuli were associated with increased N2-P3 amplitude in all conditions. This threat-related enhancement of the N2-P3 complex was greater in mTBI patients than in controls in response to Go signals and NoGo signals, independent of relevance. We conclude that mTBI may be associated with enhanced attentional and executive resource allocation to threat-related stimuli. Along with behavioral evidence for enhanced attention allocation to threat stimuli, increased brain responses to threat were observed in mTBI. Enhanced attention capture by threat-related emotional stimuli may reflect inefficient top-down control of bottom-up influences of emotion, and might contribute to affective symptoms in mTBI."

We tested this hypothesis in 32 patients with frontal lesions, verified by computer assisted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and 45 healthy controls. Patients and controls were given a protocol which included a rest period, a series of innocuous tones, and a reaction time task. Patients were given a second protocol in which they viewed slides with positive and negative emotional content and neutral slides. Results showed attenuated electrodermal activity (EDA) during task instructions and smaller skin conductance responses to reaction-time stimuli in patients compared to controls but few differences under passive conditions or in orienting responses to simple tones. Patients with lateral prefrontal and paraventricular lesions were especially low in EDA in the reaction time task, and those with right and bilateral lesions in the cingulate gyrus and/or frontal operculum had attenuated EDA in both protocols. We conclude that the effects of certain frontal lesions are on the psychological response to significance which is indexed by EDA rather than directly on EDA per se."

Each participant had previously undergone psychometric evaluation of each of the above areas as part of a routine presurgical neuropsychological assessment. Commensurate measures were employed at a follow-up assessment at least 6 months postsurgery. DBS significantly improved mood, anxiety, and aspects of quality of life. Improvements correlated with reduced pain severity. However, the sample continued to show impairments in most areas when compared against normative data published on nonclinical samples. There was little change in general cognitive functioning, aside from deterioration in spatial working memory. However, improvements in pain severity were associated with less improvement (and even deterioration) on measures of executive cognitive functioning. Improvements in emotional well-being also were correlated with changes in cognition.

Using paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a model, this study investigated the sub-acute effect of paediatric traumatic brain injury on grey-matter volume of three large-scale, domain-general brain networks (the Default Mode Network, DMN; the Central Executive Network, CEN; and the Salience Network, SN), as well as two domain-specific neural networks implicated in social-affective processes (the Cerebro-Cerebellar Mentalizing Network, CCMN and the Mirror Neuron/Empathy Network, MNEN). We also evaluated prospective structure-function relationships between these large-scale neural networks and cognitive, affective and conative ToM. 3D T1- weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were acquired sub-acutely in 137 children [TBI: n = 103; typically developing (TD) children: n = 34]. All children were assessed on measures of ToM at 24-months post-injury. Children with severe TBI showed sub-acute volumetric reductions in the CCMN, SN, MNEN, CEN and DMN, as well as reduced grey-matter volumes of several hub regions of these neural networks. Volumetric reductions in the CCMN and several of its hub regions, including the cerebellum, predicted poorer cognitive ToM. In contrast, poorer affective and conative ToM were predicted by volumetric reductions in the SN and MNEN, respectively. Overall, results suggest that cognitive, affective and conative ToM may be prospectively predicted by individual differences in structure of different neural systems-the CCMN, SN and MNEN, respectively. The prospective relationship between cerebellar volume and cognitive ToM outcomes is a novel finding in our paediatric brain injury sample and suggests that the cerebellum may play a role in the neural networks important for ToM. These findings are discussed in relation to neurocognitive models of ToM. We conclude that detection of sub-acute volumetric abnormalities of large-scale neural networks and their hub regions may aid in the early identification of children at risk for chronic social-cognitive impairment."

In this article, we discuss types of neuroimaging not discussed in the guideline in terms of their safety for pediatric populations, their potential application, and the research investigating the future use of certain modalities to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI in children. The role of neuroimaging in pediatric mTBI cases should be considered for the potential contribution to children's neural and social development, in addition to the immediate clinical value (as in the case of acute structural findings). Selective use of specific neuroimaging modalities in research has already been shown to detect aspects of diffuse brain injury, disrupted cerebral blood flow, and correlate physiological factors with persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, cognitive decline, headache, and mood changes, following mTBI. However, these advanced neuroimaging modalities are currently limited to the research arena, and any future clinical application of advanced imaging modalities in pediatric mTBI will require robust evidence for each modality's ability to provide measurement of the subtle conditions of brain development, disease, damage, or degeneration, while accounting for variables at both non-injury and time-post-injury epochs.

            "abstract": "Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) can affect up to 20%-30% of patients with mild closed head injury (mCHI), comprising incomplete recovery and debilitating persistence of post-concussional symptoms. Eye movements relate closely to the functional integrity of the injured brain and eye movement function is impaired post-acutely in mCHI. Here, we examined whether PCS patients continue to show disparities in eye movement function at 3-5 months following mCHI compared with patients with good recovery. We hypothesized that eye movements might provide sensitive and objective functional markers of ongoing cerebral impairment in PCS. We compared 36 PCS participants (adapted World Health Organization guidelines) and 36 individually matched controls (i.e. mCHI patients of similar injury severity but good recovery) on reflexive, anti- and self-paced saccades, memory-guided sequences and smooth pursuit. All completed neuropsychological testing and health status questionnaires. Mean time post-injury was 140 days in the PCS group and 163 days in the control group. The PCS group performed worse on anti-saccades, self-paced saccades, memory-guided sequences and smooth pursuit, suggesting problems in response inhibition, short-term spatial memory, motor-sequence programming, visuospatial processing and visual attention. This poorer oculomotor performance included several measures beyond conscious control, indicating that subcortical functionality in the PCS group was poorer than expected after mCHI. The PCS group had poorer neuropsychological function (memory, complex attention and executive function). Analysis of covariance showed oculomotor differences to be practically unaffected by group disparities in depression and estimated intellectual ability. Compared with neuropsychological tests, eye movements were more likely to be markedly impaired in PCS cases with high symptom load. Poorer eye movement function, and particularly poorer subcortical oculomotor function, correlated more with post-concussive symptom load and problems on activities of daily living whilst poorer neuropsychological function exhibited slightly better correlations with measures of mental health. Our findings that eye movement function in PCS does not follow the normal recovery path of eye movements after mCHI are indicative of ongoing cerebral impairment. Whilst oculomotor and neuropsychological tests partially overlapped in identifying impairment, eye movements showed additional dysfunction in motor/visuospatial areas, response inhibition, visual attention and subcortical function. Poorer subconscious oculomotor function in the PCS group supports the notion that PCS is not merely a psychological entity, but also has a biological substrate. Measurement of oculomotor function may be of value in PCS cases with a high symptom load but an otherwise unremarkable assessment profile. Routine oculomotor testing should be feasible in centres with existing access to this technology."

            "abstract": "This study examined whether children's coping strategies are related to post-concussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) versus orthopedic injury (OI). Participants were 8- to 15-year-old children with mild TBI (n = 167) or OI (n = 84). They rated their current preferred coping strategies and post-injury symptoms at 2 weeks (baseline) and 1, 3, and 12 months post-injury. Children's reported use of coping strategies did not vary significantly over time, so their baseline coping ratings were examined as predictors of post-concussive symptoms across time. Self-ratings of symptoms were positively related to emotion-focused strategies and negatively related to problem-focused engagement after both mild TBI and OI. Higher problem-focused disengagement predicted larger group differences in children's ratings of symptoms, suggesting that problem-focused disengagement moderates the effects of mild TBI. Coping strategies collectively accounted for approximately 10-15% of the variance in children's post-concussive symptoms over time. The findings suggest that coping may play an important role in accounting for children's perceptions of post-concussive symptoms after mild TBI."

Genetic and other biological variables may contribute to PCS etiology, and the emergence of biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) offers new opportunities for research on PCS. We sought to validate the EHR data of PCS patients by comparing two diagnostic algorithms deployed in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center de-identified database of 2.8 million patient EHRs. The algorithms identified individuals with PCS by: 1) natural language processing (NLP) of narrative text in the EHR combined with structured demographic, diagnostic, and encounter data; or 2) coded billing and procedure data. The predictive value of each algorithm was assessed, and cases and controls identified by each approach were compared on demographic and medical characteristics. The NLP algorithm identified 507 cases and 10,857 controls. The negative predictive value in controls was 78% and the positive predictive value (PPV) in cases was 82%. Conversely, the coded algorithm identified 1142 patients with two or more PCS billing codes and had a PPV of 76%. Comparisons of PCS controls to both case groups recovered known epidemiology of PCS: cases were more likely than controls to be female and to have pre-morbid diagnoses of anxiety, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In contrast, controls and cases were equally likely to have attention deficit hyperactive disorder and learning disabilities, in accordance with the findings of recent systematic reviews of PCS risk factors. We conclude that EHRs are a valuable research tool for PCS. Ascertainment based on coded data alone had a predictive value comparable to an NLP algorithm, recovered known PCS risk factors, and maximized the number of included patients."

The right hemisphere (RH) appears to be dominant for affective prosody in adults, while the left hemisphere (LH) mediates the more linguistic aspects of nonverbal communication. Few similar studies have been reported of individuals who suffered early unilateral brain damage, when brain reorganization or plasticity might be expected to play a role in ameliorating the adverse effects of focal brain damage. In this study, comprehension and expression of affective and linguistic prosody were tested in subjects with documented unilateral brain damage of pre- or perinatal onset and in matched controls. Both RH- and LH-lesion groups demonstrated difficulty on tasks involving expression of affective prosody, and on tests of linguistic prosody, compared with controls. Only the RH-lesion group was impaired on an affective comprehension task. The results indicate that even after very early unilateral brain damage, prosodic deficits may be present. However, only for affective comprehension does the side of the lesion appear to determine such deficits. The findings suggest that during brain development there is not clear brain lateralization for prosody and there may be bilateral representation for these skills during early development. There may be limitations to the ability of the developing brain to reorganize after early injury."

The amygdala is another structure that has been widely implicated in emotion processing and social decision-making, and the question arises as to whether the amygdala, in a manner akin to what has been observed for the prefrontal cortex, might have sex-related functional asymmetry in regard to social and emotional functions. A preliminary test of this question was carried out in the current study, where we used a case-matched lesion approach and contrasted a pair of men cases and a pair of women cases, where in each pair one patient had left amygdala damage and the other had right amygdala damage. We investigated the domains of social conduct, emotional processing and personality, and decision-making. The results provide support for the notion that there is sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala in regard to these functions - in the male pair, the patient with right-sided amygdala damage was impaired in these functions, and the patient with left-sided amygdala damage was not, whereas in the female pair, the opposite pattern obtained, with the left-sided woman being impaired and the right-sided woman being unimpaired. These data provide preliminary support for the notion that sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala may entail functions such as social conduct, emotional processing, and decision-making, a finding that in turn could reflect (as either a cause or effect) differences in the manner in which men and women apprehend, process, and execute emotion-related information."

            "abstract": "Most gastrointestinal diseases and disorders (GIDD) are associated with depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction. This suggests that shared features of GIDD, particularly chronic pain and inflammation, affect specific neural targets. The critical review of clinical and animal research presented here reveals that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a primary target. It is particularly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and its function accounts for altered mental function emergent in GIDD. We propose that peripherally-triggered neuroinflammation normally signals injury/illness to ACC, which increases threat assessment and pain sensitivity to cope with increased vulnerability. Chronic peripheral inflammation over-drives this process, leading to long-term ACC structural remodeling, and excessive threat signaling. This evokes anxiodepressive phenotypes even without direct evidence of threats because ACC utilizes schemas to infer affective outcomes (e.g. pain) based on complex contextual information. This activates the autonomic nervous system, exacerbates immune dysfunction, and promotes further gut pathology. This theory provides a mechanistic account of bidirectional interactions among gastrointestinal, immunological, and neural systems in GIDD, and is likely applicable to other chronic inflammatory conditions."

After brain trauma, transit syndrome may occur during the acute to subacute phase when consciousness disorder improves. If the patient is difficult to control, it is recommended that treatment be performed in cooperation with a psychiatrist. For agitation caused by brain trauma, administration of mood stabilizers(valproic acid, carbamazepine)and Chinese herbs(yokukansan)may be considered. For depressive symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, irritability, etc., administration of SSRI as an antidepressant may be considered.

To test the hypothesis that TLR4 has a role in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory, we used mice deficient for TLR4 and mice receiving chronic TLR4 antagonist infusion to the lateral ventricles in the brain. We found that developmental TLR4 deficiency enhances spatial reference memory acquisition and memory retention, impairs contextual fear-learning and enhances motor functions, traits that were correlated with CREB up-regulation in the hippocampus. TLR4 antagonist infusion into the cerebral ventricles of adult mice did not affect cognitive behavior, but instead affected anxiety responses. Our findings indicate a developmental role for TLR4 in shaping spatial reference memory, and fear learning and memory. Moreover, we show that central TLR4 inhibition using a TLR4 antagonist has no discernible physiological role in regulating spatial and contextual hippocampus-dependent cognitive behavior."

Given the consistent associations found between catastrophizing and both (1) approach versus avoidance pain coping style; and (2) affective responses to pain, the AAE model would predict that more left (vs. right) anterior brain activity would prospectively predict future catastrophizing.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Anterior asymmetry measures computed using electroencephalogram data from 30 individuals with spinal cord injury were correlated with catastrophizing scores obtained 2 years after the electroencephalograph recording.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Consistent with the AAE model, anterior asymmetry scores reflecting greater left than right anterior activity were negatively associated with subsequent catastrophizing.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study findings identify a biological factor that may be associated with greater vulnerability to pain-related catastrophizing. If replicated in future research, the findings suggest new possibilities for treating catastrophizing, which may then contribute to improved pain treatment outcomes."

We sought to develop an animal model of CTE. Our novel model is a modification and fusion of two of the most popular models of TBI and allows for controlled closed-head impacts to unanesthetized mice. Two-hundred and eighty 12-week-old mice were divided into control, single mild TBI (mTBI), and repetitive mTBI groups. Repetitive mTBI mice received six concussive impacts daily for 7 days. Behavior was assessed at various time points. Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was computed and vestibulomotor function tested with the wire grip test (WGT). Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), anxiety/risk-taking behavior with the elevated plus maze, and depression-like behavior with the forced swim/tail suspension tests. Sleep electroencephalogram/electromyography studies were performed at 1 month. NSS was elevated, compared to controls, in both TBI groups and improved over time. Repetitive mTBI mice demonstrated transient vestibulomotor deficits on WGT. Repetitive mTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. Both mTBI groups demonstrated increased anxiety at 2 weeks, but repetitive mTBI mice developed increased risk-taking behaviors at 1 month that persist at 6 months. Repetitive mTBI mice exhibit depression-like behavior at 1 month. Both groups demonstrate sleep disturbances. We describe the neurological sequelae of repetitive mTBI in a novel mouse model, which resemble several of the neuropsychiatric behaviors observed clinically in patients sustaining repetitive mild head injury."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairment in military and civilian populations. However, mild TBI (mTBI) can be difficult to detect using conventional MRI or CT. Injured brain tissues in mTBI patients generate abnormal slow-waves (1-4 Hz) that can be measured and localized by resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). In this study, we develop a voxel-based whole-brain MEG slow-wave imaging approach for detecting abnormality in patients with mTBI on a single-subject basis. A normative database of resting-state MEG source magnitude images (1-4 Hz) from 79 healthy control subjects was established for all brain voxels. The high-resolution MEG source magnitude images were obtained by our recent Fast-VESTAL method. In 84 mTBI patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms (36 from blasts, and 48 from non-blast causes), our method detected abnormalities at the positive detection rates of 84.5%, 86.1%, and 83.3% for the combined (blast-induced plus with non-blast causes), blast, and non-blast mTBI groups, respectively. We found that prefrontal, posterior parietal, inferior temporal, hippocampus, and cerebella areas were particularly vulnerable to head trauma. The result also showed that MEG slow-wave generation in prefrontal areas positively correlated with personality change, trouble concentrating, affective lability, and depression symptoms. Discussion is provided regarding the neuronal mechanisms of MEG slow-wave generation due to deafferentation caused by axonal injury and/or blockages/limitations of cholinergic transmission in TBI. This study provides an effective way for using MEG slow-wave source imaging to localize affected areas and supports MEG as a tool for assisting the diagnosis of mTBI."

This study related outcome assessed across several domains to brain structure derived from quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixty individuals spanning a wide range of TBI severity participated 1-year post-injury as part of the Toronto TBI study. Volumetric data over 38 brain regions were derived from high resolution T1-weighted MRI scans. Functioning was assessed with a battery of self- and significant-other rated measures. Multivariate analysis (partial least squares) was used to identify shared variance between the neuroimaging and outcome measures. TBI was associated with item endorsement on outcome questionnaires without strong evidence for severity or focal lesion effects. Prefrontal midline, cingulate, medial temporal, right inferior parietal and basal ganglia/thalamic volumes were associated with measures of initiative, energization, and physical complaints. In the chronic stage of TBI, self-initiation, energization, and physical complaints related to a specific pattern of volume loss in midline and lateral regions known to be involved in motivation, apathy, and attention. These results suggest that crucial functional changes in chronic TBI may be associated with volume loss in established midline-frontal and attentional circuits."

            "abstract": "Chronic pain often predicts the onset of psychological distress. Symptoms including anxiety and depression after pain chronification reportedly are caused by brain remodeling/recruitment of the limbic and reward/aversion circuitries. Pain is the primary precipitating factor that has caused opioid overprescribing and continued overuse of opioids leading to the current opioid epidemic. Yet experimental pain therapies often fail in clinical trials. Better understanding of underlying pathologies contributing to pain chronification is needed to address these chronic pain related issues. In the present study, a chronic neuropathic pain model persisting 10 weeks was studied. The model develops both anxiety- and pain-related behavioral measures to mimic clinical pain. The manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) utilized improved MRI signal contrast in brain regions with higher neuronal activity in the rodent chronic constriction trigeminal nerve injury (CCI-ION) model. T1-weighted MEMRI signal intensity was increased compared to controls in supraspinal regions of the anxiety and aversion circuitry, including anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), amygdala, habenula, caudate, ventrolateral and dorsomedial periaqueductal gray (PAG). Despite continuing mechanical hypersensitivity, MEMRI T1 signal intensity as the neuronal activity measure, was not significantly different in thalamus and decreased in somatosensory cortex (S1BF) of CCI-ION rats compared to naïve controls. This is consistent with decreased fMRI BOLD signal intensity in thalamus and cortex of patients with longstanding trigeminal neuropathic pain reportedly associated with gray matter volume decrease in these regions. Significant increase in MEMRI T2 signal intensity in thalamus of CCI-ION animals was indication of tissue water content, cell dysfunction and/or reactive astrogliosis. Decreased T2 signal intensity in S1BF cortex of rats with CCI-ION was similar to findings of reduced T2 signals in clinical patients with chronic orofacial pain indicating prolonged astrocyte activation. These findings support use of MEMRI and chronic rodent models for preclinical studies and therapeutic trials to reveal brain sites activated only after neuropathic pain has persisted in timeframes relevant to clinical pain and to observe treatment effects not possible in short-term models which do not have evidence of anxiety-like behaviors. Potential improvement is predicted in the success rate of preclinical drug trials in future studies with this model."

            "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that a mild traumatic brain injury occurring at a juvenile age (jmTBI) may be sufficient to elicit pathophysiological modifications. However, clinical reports are not adequately integrated with experimental studies examining brain changes occurring post-jmTBI. We monitored the cerebrovascular modifications and assessed the long-term behavioral and electrographic changes resulting from experimental jmTBI. In vivo photoacoustic imaging demonstrated a decrease of cerebrovascular oxygen saturation levels in the impacted area hours post-jmTBI. Three days post-jmTBI oxygenation returned to pre-jmTBI levels, stabilizing at 7 and 30 days after the injury. At the functional level, cortical arterioles displayed no NMDA vasodilation response, while vasoconstriction induced by thromboxane receptor agonist was enhanced at 1 day post-jmTBI. Arterioles showed abnormal NMDA vasodilation at 3 days post-jmTBI, returning to normality at 7 days post injury. Histology showed changes in vessel diameters from 1 to 30 days post-jmTBI. Neurological evaluation indicated signs of anxiety-like behavior up to 30 days post-jmTBI. EEG recordings performed at the cortical site of impact 30 days post-jmTBI did not indicate seizures activity, although it revealed a reduction of gamma waves as compared to age matched sham. Histology showed decrease of neuronal filament staining. In conclusion, experimental jmTBI triggers an early cerebrovascular hypo‑oxygenation in vivo and faulty vascular reactivity. The exact topographical coherence and the direct casualty between early cerebrovascular changes and the observed long-term neurological modifications remain to be investigated. A potential translational value for cerebro-vascular oxygen monitoring in jmTBI is discussed."

            "abstract": "Mild sports-related concussions, in which there is no loss of consciousness, account for >75% of all sports-related brain injury. Universal agreement on concussion definition and severity grading does not exist. Grading systems represent expertise of clinicians and researchers yet scientific evidence is lacking. Most used loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia as markers for grading concussion. Although in severe head injury these parameters may have been proven important for prognosis, no study has done the same for sport-related concussion. Post-concussion symptoms are often the main features to help in the diagnosis of concussion in sport. Neuropsychological testing is meant to help physicians and health professionals to have objective indices of some of the neurocognitive symptoms. It is the challenge of physicians, therapists and coaches involved in the care of athletes to know the symptoms of concussion, recognise them when they occur and apply basic neuropsychological testing to help detect this injury. It is, therefore, recommended to be familiar with one grading system and use it consistently, even though it may not be scientifically validated. Then good clinical judgement and the ability to recognise post-concussion signs and symptoms will assure that an athlete never returns to play while symptomatic."

Olfactory stimulation (OS) triggers emotional and cardiovascular-autonomic responses that might be compromised in post-mTBI patients. We therefore evaluated these responses to OS in post-mTBI patients. In 17 post-mTBI patients (interval since mTBI: 32.4 ± 6.8 months) and 17 age- and sex-matched controls, we recorded respiration, electrocardiographic RR intervals, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPsys, BPdia) before and during pleasant vanilla stimulation and unpleasant hydrogen sulphide (H2S) stimulation. Participants rated OS-related pleasantness, arousal, intensity, and familiarity on 9-point Likert scales. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with post hoc analyses compared parameters within each group before and during OS. To assess associations between pleasantness, arousal, intensity, and familiarity, we correlated OS scores within groups (significance: p < 0.05). Baseline parameters were similar between groups. Only in controls, vanilla stimulation significantly lowered BPsys and BPdia, whereas H2S stimulation lowered RR intervals. Vanilla-related pleasantness scores were lower, intensity scores were higher in patients than controls. During vanilla stimulation, pleasantness scores correlated negatively with arousal scores in controls, whereas familiarity scores correlated positively with intensity scores in patients. During H2S stimulation, familiarity scores correlated negatively with pleasantness scores in controls, whereas pleasantness scores correlated negatively with arousal scores in mTBI patients. Post-mTBI patients could not change BP or RR intervals during OS but perceived vanilla stimuli as less pleasant and more intense than did controls. Associations between pleasantness, arousal, intensity, and familiarity differed between groups suggesting different activation of the olfactory network and the central autonomic network upon OS. Subtle lesions within these networks might cause persistent changes in emotional and cognitive odor perception and cardiovascular responses."

Methods: A web-based survey including the RPQ and EQ-5D was conducted among representative samples in three European countries. Results: A total of 11,759 respondents completed the questionnaire. The most frequently reported symptom was fatigue (49.9%). Almost half (45.1%) of the respondents were classified as having PCS considering rating score 2 (three RPQ items with score ≥ 2) as a cut-off. Chronic health complaints were found as a significant risk factor for PCS. All items of the RPQ were positively correlated with the EQ-5D and the strongest positive correlation (0.633, p<0.001) was between RPQ item 'feeling depressed or tearful' and EQ-5D domain 'anxiety/depression'. Conclusions: We found a high frequency of post-concussion-like symptoms and PCS in the general population, indicating that these symptoms are not specific for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and PCS is not a unique syndrome after TBI. Therefore, the use of post-concussion symptoms and PCS as outcome following mild TBI should be interpreted with caution."

This paper aims to illustrate a novel framework for conceptualizing, collecting, and analyzing concussion symptom data. To that end, we describe the temporal and structural dynamics of acute concussion symptoms at the individual-patient level. Ten recently concussion adolescents and young adults completed 20 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of post-concussion symptoms. Follow-up assessments were completed at 3 months post-injury. Network modeling revealed marked heterogeneity across participants. In the overall sample, temporal patterns explained the most variance in light sensitivity (48%) and the least variance in vomiting (5%). About half of the participants had symptom networks that were sparse after controlling for temporal variation. The other individualized symptom networks were densely interconnected clusters of symptoms. Networks were highly idiosyncratic in nature, yet emotional symptoms (nervousness, emotional, sadness), cognitive symptoms (mental fogginess, slowness), and symptoms of hyperacusis (sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise) tended to cluster together across participants. Person-specific analytic techniques revealed a number of idiosyncratic features of post-concussion symptomatology. We propose applying this framework to future research to better understand individual differences in concussion recovery."

Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes.

            "abstract": "Objective: Establish the factor structure of the Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool (BAST), a self-reported emotional/behavioral symptom measure for adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI).Setting: Community.Participants: Community-dwelling adults with moderate-severe TBI (n = 162; n = 110).Design: Assessment development (cohort study).Main measures: Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool.Results: The original BAST included 61 items (55 primary, six secondary), an Environmental Context checklist including recent major life events, and three open-ended questions about other relevant factors. Two rounds of pilot testing and exploratory factor analysis of the BAST (n = 162; n = 110) reduced the total items to 37 primary items and six secondary coping items. The final BAST had a five-factor solution with communalities ranging from 0.323 to 0.771. Internal consistency reliabilities ranged from acceptable to excellent for all factors (Cronbach's α = 0.76-0.90). The items related to coping, given only to those endorsing stress, had a two-factor solution with communalities ranging from 0.224 to 0.605, but demonstrated acceptable to poor internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.46-0.68). Participants rated ease of use and overall satisfaction with completing the scale as high, with mean scores of 6.42 and 6.22 out of 7, respectively.Conclusions: The BAST, a measure of behavioral and emotional symptoms after TBI, has a multidimensional factor structure with evidence of good internal consistency reliability. Future work will evaluate the convergent, discriminant, and discriminative validity of the BAST and employ item response theory analyses to further develop a short version for mobile health assessment.Implications for RehabilitationLong-term monitoring of behavioral and emotional symptoms after traumatic brain injury could improve clinical management and reduce negative participation and quality of life outcomes.The Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool demonstrates reliability for use among adults with chronic traumatic brain injury, through its factor structure and internal consistency reliabilities, to measure chronic behavioral and emotional symptoms.The Behavioral Assessment Screening Tool is a screening tool to identify potential behavioral and emotional problems that individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury may be experiencing; it could be implemented in a proactive, rather than reactive, system for long-term monitoring of these symptoms to improve early identification of clinical disorders."

            "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with psychiatric illness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide. We investigated the relationship between mild TBI and other risk factors for suicidal behavior in major depressive episode. We hypothesized that mild TBI would be associated with suicidal behavior at least partly because of shared risk factors that contribute to the diathesis for suicidal acts. Depressed patients (N = 325) presenting for treatment were evaluated for psychopathology, traumatic history, and suicidal behavior. Data were analyzed using Student t -test, chi-square statistic, or Fisher exact test. A backward stepwise logistic regression model (N = 255) examined the relationship between attempter status and variables that differed in the TBI and non-TBI patients. Forty-four percent of all subjects reported mild TBI. Subjects with TBI were more likely to be male, have a history of substance abuse, have cluster B personality disorder, and be more aggressive and hostile compared with subjects without TBI. They were also more likely to be suicide attempters, although their suicidal behavior was not different from that of suicide attempters without TBI. Attempt status was mostly predicted by aggression and hostility, but not the presence of TBI. Of note, for males, a history of TBI increased the likelihood of being a suicide attempter, whereas the risk was elevated for females regardless of TBI history. Our data suggest that suicidal behavior and TBI share antecedent risk factors: hostility and aggression. Future studies may yield confirmation using a prospective design."

            "abstract": "The benefits of regular exercise, physical fitness and sports participation on cardiovascular and brain health are undeniable. Physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and stroke, and produces beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, antioxidant systems, inflammation, and vascular function. Exercise also enhances psychological health, reduces age-related loss of brain volume, improves cognition, reduces the risk of developing dementia, and impedes neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, the play of sports is associated with risks, including a risk for mild TBI (mTBI) and, rarely, catastrophic traumatic injury and death. There is also growing awareness that repetitive mTBIs, such as concussion and subconcussion, can occasionally produce persistent cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric problems as well as lead to the development of a neurodegeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this review, we summarize the beneficial aspects of sports participation on psychological, emotional, physical and cognitive health, and specifically analyze some of the less common adverse neuropathological outcomes, including concussion, second-impact syndrome, juvenile head trauma syndrome, catastrophic sudden death, and CTE. CTE is a latent neurodegeneration clinically associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairments, and pathologically characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, neuronal and axonal loss, and abnormal deposits of paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and 43 kDa TAR deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-binding protein (TDP-43). CTE often occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including motor neuron disease (CTE-MND). Although the incidence and prevalence of CTE are not known, CTE has been reported most frequently in American football players and boxers. Other sports associated with CTE include ice hockey, professional wrestling, soccer, rugby, and baseball."

The purpose of this study was to examine this relationship in service members and veterans (SMVs) following MTBI. Participants were 151 SMVs (103 uncomplicated MTBI; 48 Injured Controls [IC]) prospectively enrolled in the DVBIC-TBICoE 15-Year Longitudinal TBI Study. Participants completed a battery of self-reported neurobehavioral symptom measures on average 76.2 months post-injury (SD = 31.8). APOE genotyping was undertaken using non-fasting blood samples. Participants were classified into four subgroups based on injury (MTBI vs. IC) and APOE e4 allele status (e4 present/absent). In the IC group, there were no significant differences across APOE e4 status subgroups for all measures. In the MTBI group, participants with the APOE e4 allele had significantly worse scores on measures of depression, pain, anxiety, grief, positive well-being, social participation, and resilience compared to those without the e4 allele (d = .44 to d = .69). When comparing the number of 'clinically elevated' neurobehavioral measures simultaneously, the MTBI/e4 present subgroup consistently had a higher number of elevated measures compared to the MTBI/e4 absent, IC/e4 present, and IC/e4 absent subgroups. The APOE e4 allele was associated with poorer neurobehavioral outcome in SMVs in the chronic phase of recovery following MTBI. APOE e4 could be incorporated into screening tools to predict SMVs at risk for poor long-term neurobehavioral outcome in an effort to provide early intervention to improve long-term clinical outcome."

Since rats with electrolytic lesion in the area of the median raphe nucleus displayed high frequencies of HD in a previous study, the present investigation was undertaken to confirm this observation and to determine its anxiety-related origin. HD episodes were counted in adult male Wistar rats (270-350 g) with electrolytic lesion (N = 11) and sham-lesioned controls (N = 12). When HD was measured for 60 min on an elevated open platform, lesioned rats emitted 13 times more HD than controls (264.7 +/- 93.3 vs 20.3 +/- 7.6 episodes), with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). HD counts during 10-min sessions held 7, 14, 21, 27, and 63 days after lesion showed significantly higher means (range: 28.14 +/- 5.38 to 62.85 +/- 9.48) compared to sham-lesioned controls (range: 7.37 +/- 1.13 to 8.5 +/- 1.45). Normal rats stepped down into their home cages when the vertical distance between them and the cage was short (16 cm), and the step-down latencies increased with increasing depths (36.7 +/- 7.92 to 185.87 +/- 35.44 s). Lesioned rats showed a similar behavior when facing the shortest depth, but had a significantly increased number (23.28 +/- 2.35 episodes) and latency (300 +/- 0.00 s) of HD compared to normal rats (9.25 +/- 1.37 episodes and 185.87 +/- 35.44 s) when facing the greatest depth (30 cm).

POD is underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated condition which can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions. Prevention and treatment of POD include adequate perioperative pain control, maintenance of optimal blood pressure, water-electrolyte balance, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, sleep hygiene. Despite POD has been extensively studied in various types of surgery, there is not enough evidence on POD in intracranial neurosurgery. Patients undergoing open craniotomy might be at particular risk because on top of the above-mentioned factors, they also can have a direct neurosurgical brain injury. Future research on the POD in neurosurgical patients after intracranial interventions is needed. A bibliographic search was performed in the MEDLINE and PubMed virtual library. The following descriptors were used: POD, neurosurgery, anesthesia and POD, postoperative pain management and POD, water and electrolyte imbalance and POD, neurochemistry of POD. We included in this review original and review articles in the English language. Majority of non-neurosurgical patients have multiple risk factors for POD (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative); patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgery might have additional risks associated with neurosurgical pathology (brain tumor, cerebral hemorrhage, and severe traumatic brain injury) as well as neurosurgery-induced brain injury can also appear to be a contributing factor."

A number of sensory types of pain also significantly related to cognition (p < .05), with these relationships varying between the different sensory pain types. Continuous type sensory pain also independently predicted memory and executive function. No independent linear relationships were evident between any type of pain and level of complaint.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings show for the first time that it is important to examine both affective and sensory aspects of pain in individuals after mTBI, as pain subtypes show differential relationships with cognition. The study also suggests that the relationship between pain and complaint is not an independent one. This study has implications for treatment and management of individuals experiencing cognitive difficulties after mTBI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)."

            "abstract": "A small but significant proportion of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) sufferers will report persistent symptoms, including depression, anxiety and cognitive deficits, in the months, or even years, following the initial event. This is known as post-concussion syndrome and its pathogenesis is not yet known. This study sought to investigate the role of a peripheral inflammatory insult in the development of ongoing behavioral symptoms following a mTBI. To investigate, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single mTBI using the diffuse impact-acceleration model to generate ∼100G of force. Sham animals underwent surgery only. At 5days following surgery, rats were given either the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1mg/kg), or saline via an intraperitoneal injection. mTBI animals showed an exaggerated response to LPS, with an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the hippocampus at 24h post-dose, an effect not seen in sham animals. This was associated with the development of persistent behavioral deficits in the mTBI:LPS animals at 3 months post-injury. These behavioral deficits consisted of increased time spent immobile on the forced swim-test, indicative of depressive like behavior, impaired cognitive performance on the Barnes Maze and decreased anxiety on the Elevated Plus Maze. In contrast, animals administered mTBI alone had no deficits. This study provides evidence that a peripheral inflammatory stimulus can facilitate ongoing symptoms following a mTBI. As such this provides a basis for further exploration of exogenous factors which promote immune system activation as potential targets for intervention to allow the resolution of symptoms following a mTBI."

            "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is most often induced by traumatic events and serious public health problems. PTSD is characterized by excessive response to contextual memory and impaired fear extinction and also associated with mild cognitive impairment, attention and learning deficits. Clinical and animal studies suggest that increased susceptibility of emotion- and fear-related neuronal circuits, including those in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contributes to development and retention of PTSD symptoms. However, mechanisms underlying this susceptibility to fear are not known and the useful therapeutic approaches are limited. Recently, there have been reports that ω3 LCPUFA supplementation can prevent development of PTSD and significantly ameliorate symptoms in patients with PTSD after accidental injury such as motor vehicle accidents and natural calamities. Importantly, Fabp7 null mice exhibit enhancement of fear memory consolidation and anxiety-related behaviors that resemble PTSD-like behaviors in humans. In this review, we focused behavioral phenotype of PTSD in Fabp3 null mice. The Fabp3 null mice exhibit cognitive deficits, hyperlocomotion and impaired fear extinction, and thus show PTSD-like behaviors. Chronic administration of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, improved all PTSD-like behaviors tested in Fabp3－/－ mice. Relevant to mechanisms underlying impaired fear extinction, we observed that Ca2＋/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation increases in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) but remained unchanges in the hippocampus of Fabp3－/－ mice. Likewise, the number of c-Fos positive neurons in BLA significantly increased after exposure to contextual fear conditions. Finally, chronic ramelteon administration restored abnormal c-Fos expression and CaMKII autophosphorylation in the BLA of Fabp3－/－ mice. Taken together, Fabp3－/－ mice show PTSD-like behaviors, and ramelteon is an attractive candidate for PTSD therapeutics in human."

            "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a major concern in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While different experimental models have been used to characterize TLE-related cognitive deficits, little is known on whether a particular deficit is more associated with the underlying brain injuries than with the epileptic condition per se. Here, we look at the relationship between the pattern of brain damage and spatial memory deficits in two chronic models of TLE (lithium-pilocarpine, LIP and kainic acid, KA) from two different rat strains (Wistar and Sprague-Dawley) using the Morris water maze and the elevated plus maze in combination with MRI imaging and post-morten neuronal immunostaining. We found fundamental differences between LIP- and KA-treated epileptic rats regarding spatial memory deficits and anxiety. LIP-treated animals from both strains showed significant impairment in the acquisition and retention of spatial memory, and were unable to learn a cued version of the task. In contrast, KA-treated rats were differently affected. Sprague-Dawley KA-treated rats learned less efficiently than Wistar KA-treated animals, which performed similar to control rats in the acquisition and in a probe trial testing for spatial memory. Different anxiety levels and the extension of brain lesions affecting the hippocampus and the amydgala concur with spatial memory deficits observed in epileptic rats. Hence, our results suggest that hippocampal-dependent spatial memory is not necessarily affected in TLE and that comorbidity between spatial deficits and anxiety is more related with the underlying brain lesions than with the epileptic condition per se."

A total of seventy college students participated in this study. Participants were divided into two groups based on self-reported history of MTBI. Participants with a history of MTBI (n = 22) performed significantly higher (p < .05) on the RBANS Delayed Memory Index and endorsed significantly fewer (p < .05) trait anxiety symptoms on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) than students without a history of head injury (n = 48).

This debate is examined by reviewing meta-analytic studies that found no significant effect sizes between large samples of patients with and without MTBI at three months post-accident. In contrast, research studies with MTBI patients have captured cognitive deficits corroborated by positive neuroimaging, which supports the viewpoint that brain-based postconcussive disorders likely exist in a small minority of individuals. Ongoing hurdles that likely contribute to this debate are identified. This includes the lack of agreed upon definitions; substantial differences exist between the ICD-10 definition for Postconcussion Syndrome and the DSM-IV-TR definition for Postconcussional Disorder. Confining the debate to brain-based versus psychologically-based viewpoints results in a false dichotomy. Instead, a more refined sub-classification of the postconcussive complex is proposed that captures different constellations across the physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms complex.

For this purpose, male albino CF-1 mice were pre-treated with NMDA (75 mg/kg) and subjected to brain trauma, and after 24h submitted to memory tasks and anxiety and depression-like behavioral tests. The memory tests were evaluated at 1.5h, 24h, and 7 days after the training. In addition, the cellular viability was evaluated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 96 h after the trauma. It was observed that the cellular viability was reduced in the hippocampus of the mice subjected to trauma and the preconditioning with NMDA was able to protect this damage. All mice learnt the task in the habituation test, but in the object recognition task the mice preconditioned with NMDA were protected against impairment induced by TBI in both short and long-term memory. On the other hand, in the step-down inhibitory avoidance test, only the mice treated with NMDA showed impairment of long-term memory (7 days after training session). The evaluation of anxiety/depression behavior showed no changes after TBI.

Postinjury, 65% received a diagnosis, of which major depression became the most common (45%), followed by anxiety (38%) and substance use disorder (21%). Frequency of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and phobias rose from preinjury to postinjury. More than two-thirds of postinjury depression and anxiety cases were novel and showed poor resolution rates. Few novel cases of substance use disorder were noted. Psychotic disorders, somatoform disorders, and eating disorders occurred at frequencies similar to those in the general population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A high frequency of postinjury psychiatric disorders was evident up to 5.5 years postinjury, with many novel cases of depression and anxiety. Individuals with TBI should be screened for psychiatric disorders at various time points post-injury without reliance on history of psychiatric problems to predict who is at risk, so that appropriate intervention can be offered."

            "abstract": "This study aims to characterize the patterns of functional change experienced between 5 and 10 years after moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study included TBI Model Systems national database participants (N = 372) at six sites who experienced TBI, received inpatient rehabilitation, and were followed at 5 and 10 years post-TBI. Outcome measures included self- or proxy-reported Functional Independence Measure (FIMTM) structured interview at 5 and 10 years post-TBI and domain change indices (DCIs) at 10 years to assess subjective change over the previous 5 years. When all seven FIM and subjective DCI subscales were considered together, 69% reported improvement in at least one subscale and 41% reported decline in at least one subscale; 51% reported more domains improved than declined, and 20% reported more domains declined than improved. Age at injury, post-traumatic amnesia duration, FIM, and depression and anxiety at year 5 were associated with FIM change and DCI measures. Although most persons with moderate-severe TBI do not experience widespread change from year 5 to 10 on individual FIM subscales or perceived domain-specific subscales, the vast majority do report change in one or more domains, with more improvement than decline and more change in subjective DCI than in FIM. Clinicians and researchers should be alert to the possibility of both positive and deleterious changes many years after TBI."

            "abstract": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts. CTE has been linked to disruptions in cognition, mood, and behavior. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of CTE can only be made post-mortem. Neuropathological evidence suggests limbic structures may provide an opportunity to characterize CTE in the living. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we compared select limbic brain regional volumes - the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus - between symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players (n = 86) and controls (n = 22). Moreover, within the group of former NFL players, we examined the relationship between those limbic structures and neurobehavioral functioning (n = 75). The former NFL group comprised eighty-six men (mean age = 55.2 ± 8.0 years) with at least 12 years of organized football experience, at least 2 years of active participation in the NFL, and self-reported declines in cognition, mood, and behavior within the last 6 months. The control group consisted of men (mean age = 57.0 ± 6.6 years) with no history of contact-sport involvement or traumatic brain injury. All control participants provided neurobehavioral data. Compared to controls, former NFL players exhibited reduced volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Within the NFL group, reduced bilateral cingulate gyrus volume was associated with worse attention and psychomotor speed (r = 0.4 (right), r = 0.42 (left); both p < 0.001), while decreased right hippocampal volume was associated with worse visual memory (r = 0.25, p = 0.027). Reduced volumes of limbic system structures in former NFL players are associated with neurocognitive features of CTE. Volume reductions in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus may be potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration in those at risk for CTE."

            "abstract": "What brain regions are involved in regulating behavior when the emotional consequence of a stimulus changes from harmful to harmless? One way to address this question is to study the neural mechanisms underlying extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning, an important form of emotional regulation that has direct relevance to the treatment of human fear and anxiety disorders. In fear extinction, the capacity of a conditioned stimulus to elicit fear is gradually reduced by repeatedly presenting it in the absence of any aversive consequence. In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in research on the brain mechanisms of fear extinction. One region that has received considerable attention as a component of the brain's extinction circuitry is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In the present article, we review the historical foundations of the modern notion that the mPFC plays a critical role in emotional regulation, a literature that was largely responsible for studies that explored the role of the mPFC in fear extinction. We also consider the role of the mPFC in a broader neural circuit for extinction that includes the amygdala and hippocampus."

Independent reviewers critically appraised eligible guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We retrieved 9863 citations. Of those, 16 guidelines were eligible for critical appraisal and eight were scientifically admissible (four targeting whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), one addressing anxiety and three addressing MTBI). The inadmissible guidelines had inadequate literature searches, inexplicit links between evidence and recommendations, and ambiguous recommendations. The literature used to develop most of the admissible guidelines was outdated. Major recommendations included: (1) Advice, education and reassurance for all conditions; (2) Exercise, return-to-activity, mobilization/manipulation, analgesics and avoiding collars for WAD; (3) Psychological first aid, pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy as first-line interventions for anxiety; and (4) Monitoring for complications, discharge criteria, advice upon discharge from the emergency room and post-discharge care for MTBI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Fifty percent of appraised guidelines were scientifically admissible, but most need updating. Most guidelines focus on WAD and MTBI. Few guidelines make comprehensive recommendations on a wide range of consequences from traffic collisions.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for rehabilitation:\n        \n      \n      The core components of a program of care designed to manage common traffic injuries (whiplash-associated disorders - WAD, anxiety and mild traumatic brain injuries) should include advice, education and reassurance. Depending on the condition, the following specific interventions should be considered: (1) WAD: exercise, early return to activity, mobilization/manipulation, analgesics and avoidance of collars; (2) Anxiety: psychological first aid, pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy; and (3) Mild traumatic brain injuries: use of specific discharge criteria (including no factors warranting hospital admission and support structures for subsequent care), education upon discharge from emergency room and post-discharge care (e.g. monitoring for complications, gradual return to normal activity based on tolerance of individual). The methodological quality of guidelines varies greatly; therefore, guideline developers need to adhere to established methodological standards and conform to the evaluation criteria outlined in the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument."

            "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common childhood-onset motor disabilities, attributed to injuries of the immature brain in the foetal or early postnatal period. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, rendering prevention and treatment strategies challenging. The aim of the present study was to establish a mouse model of CP for preclinical assessment of new interventions. For this purpose, we explored the impact of a double neonatal insult (i.e. systemic inflammation combined with hypoxia) on behavioural and cellular outcomes relevant to CP during the prepubertal to adolescent period of mice. Pups were subjected to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections from postnatal day (P) 3 to P6 followed by hypoxia at P7. Gene expression analysis at P6 revealed a strong inflammatory response in a brain region-dependent manner. A comprehensive battery of behavioural assessments performed between P24 and P47 showed impaired limb placement and coordination when walking on a horizontal ladder in both males and females. Exposed males also displayed impaired performance on a forelimb skilled reaching task, altered gait pattern and increased exploratory activity. Exposed females showed a reduction in grip strength and traits of anxiety-like behaviour. These behavioural alterations were not associated with gross morphological changes, white matter lesions or chronic inflammation in the brain. Our results indicate that the neonatal double-hit with LPS and hypoxia can induce subtle long-lasting deficits in motor learning and fine motor skills, which partly reflect the symptoms of children with CP who have mild gross and fine motor impairments."

            "abstract": "Sport-related concussions in youth and adolescent athletes most commonly resolve within one week without residual symptoms, with athletes resuming full participation following return to play guidelines. A small percentage of athletes have persistent symptoms that cause significant morbidity, some of whom are ultimately diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. In these athletes, symptoms in the emotional domain can be more prolonged than other domains, with athletes reporting anxiety and depression months to years following injury. A prior personal or family history of pre-existing mood disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder increases the risk of a prolonged duration of symptoms. In this case series, we discuss two cases of post-concussion syndrome in adolescent athletes with a past personal or family history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression treated by a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication with ongoing persistent symptoms. There is increased need for mental health screening in all athletes to identify individuals at risk for post-concussion syndrome. Early identification of at-risk individuals allows the interdisciplinary care team to discuss expectations for the athlete and family regarding duration of symptoms."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of injury site and severity as predictors of mental health outcomes in the initial 12 months following traumatic injury. Using a multisite, longitudinal study, participants with a traumatic physical injury (N = 1,098) were assessed during hospital admission and followed up at 3 months (N = 932, 86%) and at 12 months (N = 715, 71%). Injury site was measured using the Abbreviated Injury Scale 90, and objective injury severity was measured using the Injury Severity Score. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Clinician Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. A random intercept mixed modelling analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of site and severity of injury in relation to anxiety, PTSD, and depressive symptoms. Injury severity, as well as head and facial injuries, was predictive of elevated PTSD symptoms, and external injuries were associated with both PTSD and depression severity. In contrast, lower extremity injuries were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The findings suggest that visible injuries are predictive of reduced mental health, particularly PTSD following traumatic injury. This has clinical implications for further advancing the screening for vulnerable injured trauma survivors at risk of chronic psychopathology."

            "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe, highly effective, and rapidly acting treatment for certain major psychiatric illnesses, most notably severe mood disorders. Disturbances in mood and behavior as symptoms of delirium may complicate recovery from traumatic brain injury, but virtually no data exist on the role of ECT as a treatment modality in such clinical situations. We describe a patient with severe, unremitting, agitated behavior following a severe closed head injury from a motor vehicle accident. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3, with computed tomographic evidence of bilateral frontal and left thalamic contusions. After awakening from a 21-day coma, the patient failed to improve beyond a Ranchos Los Amigos level 4 recovery stage. He exhibited persistent severe agitation with vocal outbursts and failed to assist in performing activities of daily living. His difficulties proved unresponsive to combined behavioral therapy and multiple trials of various psychopharmacologic agents. As an intervention of \"last resort,\" he then received six brief-pulse, bilateral ECT treatments that resulted in marked lessening of his agitation and improvement in his ability to express his needs and participate in his self-care. Also, following the ECT, he showed a markedly enhanced response to psychopharmacologic agents. These findings may have important clinical implications for treatment of prolonged delirium after traumatic brain injury."
