Patients randomized to the intervention group completed 10 weekly CBSM modules; those in the control group received a generic healthy lifestyle app. Measures included HIV-related fatigue, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, CD4 count, HIV viral load, credibility and acceptability of the intervention, and barriers to treatment participation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We were able to recruit participants for this study, and they were able to complete the required measures. They found the intervention to be credible and acceptable and reported few barriers to treatment participation. The direction of change in the primary outcome, a decrease in fatigue, is in the expected direction and provides evidence of the promise of the intervention, which still needs to be tested in an adequately powered trial. For completers (randomized to the intervention group and completed at least 80% of the modules), there were significant changes (95% CI; lower scores indicate improvement) in fatigue intensity (from 64.2 to 59.7) and overall fatigue-related functioning (from 6.6 to 4.2).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We have proof of concept as to the feasibility, acceptability, and initial signals of efficacy for an mHealth intervention to help people with HIV-related fatigue better cope with stress and reduce their fatigue."

Despite having the potential to overcome barriers to treatment uptake and adherence, there are very few CBT-based smartphone apps for adolescents. To address this gap, we developed ClearlyMe®, a self-guided CBT smartphone app for adolescent depression and anxiety. ClearlyMe® consists of 37 brief lessons containing core CBT elements, accessed either individually or as part of a 'collection'. Here, we describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of ClearlyMe® on depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes, including engagement, anxiety and wellbeing, when delivered with and without guided support compared to an attention matched control.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We aim to recruit 489 adolescents aged 12-17 years with mild to moderately-severe depressive symptoms.

Depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 6-weeks (primary endpoint) and 4-months post-baseline (secondary endpoint). Engagement, conceptualised as uptake, adherence and completion, will also be assessed 6-weeks post-baseline. Mixed-effects linear modelling will be used to conduct intention-to-treat analyses to determine whether reductions in depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes are greater for conditions receiving ClearlyMe® relative to control at 6-weeks and 4-months post-baseline and greater for intervention adherers relative to non-adherers. To minimise risk, participants will be encouraged to use the Get Help section of the app and can also opt to receive a call from the team clinical psychologist at baseline, and at the 6-week and 4-month post-baseline assessments when reporting suicidal ideation.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first clinical trial examining a CBT smartphone app specifically designed for adolescent depression.

Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: CBT2go, which combined one individual session of cognitive behavioral therapy with automated thought challenging/adaptive behavior delivered through mobile devices; Self-Monitoring (SM), which combined single-session illness psychoeducation with self-monitoring of symptoms; and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (midpoint), 12 weeks (posttreatment), and 24 weeks (follow-up) with our primary outcome global psychopathology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded version [BPRS-24]), and secondary outcomes community functioning (Specific Level of Function; SLOF) and defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs). We also collected data on adverse events. Outcome analyses on the primary outcome, BPRS Total score, indicated a significant time (0-24 wk) by group interaction with significant but modest improvement comparing two active conditions (CBT2go and SM) relative to TAU. Effects of CBT2go were not different from SM. There was a significant time × group interaction with better SLOF scores in CBT2go across 24 weeks, but not in SM. There were no time-by-group effects on DPBs. DPBs decreased in the CBT2go condition but not in SM.

In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed that process factors were more influential than the content factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      It has been shown that mindfulness practice can be helpful in preventing relapse from depression. However, practicing mindfulness regularly at home is often a challenge for people with depression. Mobile phone text messaging (short message service, SMS) may be a feasible approach to assist regular mindfulness home practice.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of text message-based feedback to support mindfulness practice in people with depressive symptoms after inpatient psychiatric treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants received a manualized group introduction to three mindfulness exercises during inpatient treatment and were randomized at hospital discharge. All participants were asked to practice the exercises daily during the 4-month follow-up period. Only participants allocated to the intervention group received reinforcing feedback via mobile phone text messages after reporting their mindfulness practice via text message. Participation rates and satisfaction with the interventions were evaluated, and effects on relevant outcomes were explored.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 176 eligible inpatients invited to participate, 65.9% (116/176) attended the introductory mindfulness group at least once, 33.0% (58/176) were willing to participate in the study, and 41 were randomized. The majority 85% (35/41) of these participants completed the study. Among the participants allocated to the intervention group (n=21), 81% (17/21) used the text message support at least once. The average number of text messages sent during the intervention period was 14 (SD 21, range 0-91). Satisfaction rates were high. Preliminary analyses of the effects of the intervention yielded mixed results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings indicate that text messaging following inpatient treatment is feasible for some, but not for all people with depressive symptoms. Modest use of the text messaging intervention and its mixed effects imply that dose and ingredients of the intervention should be increased for this group of patients in a future full-size RCT. Such a larger study should also include a process evaluation to investigate moderators of the effect of mindfulness practice and text message feedback on clinical outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 58808893; http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN58808893 (Archived by Webcite at http://www.webcitation.org/6pmrDRnGt)."

Mobile mental health outreach teams recruited SZ/BD homeless patients in the street, emergency shelters, hospitals, and jails from August 2011 to April 2014. Evaluations were performed during face-to-face interviews by psychiatrists and research assistants in the offices of mobile mental health outreach teams that were located in the downtown area of each city. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, chi-square and Student's t-tests, generalized estimating equation regression models, and path analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 703 patients were included in this study. The proportion of women in the SZ/BD homeless population was 123/703 (17.5%). In this population, women were more likely than men to declare that they were subjected to physical or sexual assault during the past 6 months, that they had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and that they had experienced more severe depressive symptoms. Moreover, these women presented a higher suicide risk, worse physical health status, and lower QoL than similarly situated men. Homeless women with BD were more vulnerable than women with SZ. A path analysis revealed that PTSD and violent victimization might explain the higher levels of depression and suicide risk and the lower levels of physical health status and QoL in homeless women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      SZ/BD homeless women experience more PTSD and victimization than men, which are both associated with poor clinical outcomes.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The initial introduction of the World Wide Web in 1990 brought around the biggest change in information acquisition. Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient's mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE.

Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed.

Treatment and prevention guidelines highlight the key role of information and evidence-based psychosocial interventions not only for individuals but also for their families and carers. Engaging young people in prevention and early intervention programs is a challenge, and early treatment and prevention of adolescent depression is a major public health concern. There has been growing interest in psychoeducational interventions to provide accurate information about health issues and to enhance and develop self-management skills. However, for adolescents with, or at high risk of depression, there is a lack of engaging Web-based psychoeducation programs that have been developed with user input and in line with research guidelines and targeted at both the individual and their family or carer. There are also few studies published on the process of development of Web-based psychoeducational interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to describe the process underlying the design and development of MoodHwb (HwbHwyliau in Welsh): a Web-based psychoeducation multimedia program for young people with, or at high risk of, depression and their families, carers, friends, and professionals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The initial prototype was informed by (1) a systematic review of psychoeducational interventions for adolescent depression; (2) findings from semistructured interviews and focus groups conducted with adolescents (with depressive symptoms or at high risk), parents or carers, and professionals working with young people; and (3) workshops and discussions with a multimedia company and experts (in clinical, research, and multimedia work).

Results of a pilot study using an Internet-based intervention for depression in a sample of individuals with problematic or pathological gambling behavior show that both depressive and gambling-related symptomatology can be reduced with a generic depression program compared with a wait-list control group. Based on encouraging results of the pilot study, we developed a low-threshold, anonymous and cost-free online self-help program (\"Restart\") to test whether a program tailored to the needs of gamblers yields better results compared to the effects of the intervention evaluated in the pilot study.

Together, these challenges contribute to an emerging public health crisis likely to extend well into the future. Innovative approaches are needed that reach veterans and their family members with strategies they can employ over time in their daily lives to promote improved adjustment and well-being.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of use of a Web-based, self-directed program of instruction in mind- and body-based wellness skills to be employed by Global War on Terror veterans and their significant relationship partners on mental health and wellness outcomes associated with postdeployment readjustment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 160 veteran-partner dyads in 4 regions of the United States (San Diego, CA; Dallas, TX; Fayetteville, NC; and New York, NY) through publicity by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America to its membership. Dyads were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 study arms: Mission Reconnect (MR) program alone, MR plus the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) for Strong Bonds weekend program for military couples, PREP alone, and waitlist control. We administered a battery of standardized and investigator-generated instruments assessing mental health outcomes at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Dyads in the MR arms were provided Web-based and mobile app video and audio instruction in a set of mindfulness-related stress reduction and contemplative practices, as well as partner massage for reciprocal use. All participants provided weekly reports on frequency and duration of self-care practices for the first 8 weeks, and at 16 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the first 8-week reporting period, veterans and partners assigned to MR arms used some aspect of the program a mean of 20 times per week, totaling nearly 2.5 hours per week, with only modest declines in use at 16 weeks. Significant improvements were seen at 8 and 16 weeks in measures of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep quality, perceived stress, resilience, self-compassion, and pain for participants assigned to MR arms. In addition, significant reductions in self-reported levels of pain, tension, irritability, anxiety, and depression were associated with use of partner massage.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both veterans and partners were able to learn and make sustained use of a range of wellness practices taught in the MR program. Home-based, self-directed interventions may be of particular service to veterans who are distant from, averse to, or prohibited by schedule from using professional services. Leveraging the partner relationship may enhance sustained use of self-directed interventions for this population.

The study is part of a pilot randomised controlled trial of an mHealth self-care intervention by nurses for women living with HIV in rural India. For the trial, 60 women were randomised to receive the mHealth intervention. All calls were recorded and call logs were maintained. Call logs of 59 women based on 1186 calls were scanned for psychosocial themes. Audio recordings of 400 calls rich in content were then transcribed and translated for analysis. Themes and subthemes were identified by two independent raters. Majority of the women had low literacy and more than half were widowed. Clinical depression was found in 18.6%. Of the 1186 call logs analysed, 932 calls had a record of at least one psychosocial concern and 493 calls recorded two psychosocial concerns. Some of the major themes that women discussed with nurses included worries about their own and their children's future; loneliness; stigma; inadvertent disclosure; death and dying; abandonment by partner; financial difficulties; body image; poor social support; emotions such as sadness, guilt, and anger; and need for social services. Almost all expressed appreciation for the intervention. Findings indicate the usefulness of mHealth-based self-care interventions delivered by nurses in hard to reach women in low- and middle-income countries, especially those with multiple psychosocial vulnerabilities."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic."

A random effects model was selected to combine effect sizes. The results of the meta-analysis showed that mindfulness exercise guided by a smartphone app reduced negative emotions [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.232, 95% CI: -0.398 to -0.066, p = 0.006], depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.367, 95% CI: -0.596 to -0.137, p = 0.002), and anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.490, 95% CI: -0.908 to -0.071, p = 0.022).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings indicate the potentially beneficial effect of mindfulness exercise guided by a smartphone app on symptoms of depression and anxiety among individuals in a non-clinical population with emotional symptoms. Considering the small number and overall methodological weakness of the included studies and lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the results should be interpreted with caution, and future rigorously designed RCTs are warranted to provide more reliable evidence."

            "abstract": "A large proportion of women experience depression during the postpartum period. Few studies have investigated the use of mobile technology to prevent postpartum depression in women. This study investigated the preliminary effectiveness of the CareMom program, a new app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program, on reducing the depressive symptoms of mothers during the very early postpartum period via a pilot randomized controlled study. The participants were recruited during birth hospitalization (within 3 days after giving birth) and randomized to the waiting-list control and CareMom groups. Over the four-week intervention period, the CareMom group was required to complete 28 daily challenges via CareMom. The depressive (via EPDS) and anxiety (via GAD-7) levels of participants were measured at baseline and every 7 days postbaseline for 4 weeks. A total of 112 eligible participants were randomly allocated to the two groups (CareMom: n = 57; control: n = 55). At week 4, the CareMom group achieved a significantly lower EPDS score than the control group at week 4 (p = 0.037). In addition, the EPDS (p < 0.001) scores of the CareMom group were significantly lower than the baseline values. However, the control group did not show any significant reduction in this measure. No significant reduction of GAD-7 scores was observed for CareMom and control groups at week 4. This study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of CareMom in reducing depressive symptoms in the general postpartum population during the very early postpartum period."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Task sharing holds promise for scaling up depression care in countries such as India, yet requires training large numbers of non-specialist health workers. This pilot trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a digital program for training non-specialist health workers to deliver a brief psychological treatment for depression. Methods: Participants were non-specialist health workers recruited from primary care facilities in Sehore, a rural district in Madhya Pradesh, India. A three-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, comparing digital training alone (DGT) to digital training with remote support (DGT+), and conventional face-to-face training. The primary outcome was the feasibility and acceptability of digital training programs. Preliminary effectiveness was explored as changes in competency outcomes, assessed using a self-reported measure covering the specific knowledge and skills required to deliver the brief psychological treatment for depression. Outcomes were collected at pre-training and post-training. Results: Of 42 non-specialist health workers randomized to the training programs, 36 including 10 (72%) in face-to-face, 12 (86%) in DGT, and 14 (100%) in DGT+ arms started the training. Among these participants, 27 (64%) completed the training, with 8 (57%) in face-to-face, 8 (57%) in DGT, and 11 (79%) in DGT+. The addition of remote telephone support appeared to improve completion rates for DGT+ participants. The competency outcome improved across all groups, with no significant between-group differences. However, face-to-face and DGT+ participants showed greater improvement compared to DGT alone. There were numerous technical challenges with the digital training program such as poor connectivity, smartphone app not loading, and difficulty navigating the course content-issues that were further emphasized in follow-up focus group discussions with participants. Feedback and recommendations collected from participants informed further modifications and refinements to the training programs in preparation for a forthcoming large-scale effectiveness trial. Conclusions: This study adds to mounting efforts aimed at leveraging digital technology to increase the availability of evidence-based mental health services in primary care settings in low-resource settings."

A methadone clinic was the DAART venue acceptable to the fewest subjects (36%), and a mobile syringe-exchange program was acceptable to the most subjects (83%). Adherence was higher for supervised than for unsupervised medication administration (P<.0001), a finding that supports use of daily supervision of once-daily regimens.

Our group has previously shown that family cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) leads to significantly improved perceived stress compared with specialist first-episode treatment as usual; however, there are well-known barriers to the dissemination of effective family interventions. To address this, we have developed a novel online intervention entitled 'Altitudes' that fully integrates purpose-built online social networking, expert and peer moderation, and evidence-based psychoeducation within a single application. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Altitudes in reducing stress in carers over a 6-month period.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      We describe here a single-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with permutated blocks.

Sources used for the development were a literature review, a Delphi study among experts, focus group interviews with the target group, and elements from a proven effective anti-bullying program. The result is a fully automated web-based tailored intervention for cyberbully victims (12-15 years) consisting of three web-based advice sessions delivered over three months. The first advice aims to teach participants how behavior is influenced by the thoughts they have, how to recognize and dispute irrational thoughts and how to form rational thoughts. In the second advice, participants will learn about the way bullying emerges, how their behavior influences bullying and how they can use effective coping strategies in order to stop (online) bullying. In the third advice, participants receive feedback and will learn how to use the Internet and mobile phones in a safe manner. Each advice is tailored to the participant's personal characteristics (e.g., personality, self-efficacy, coping strategies used and (ir)rational thoughts).

            "abstract": "It is often challenging to present the available evidence in a timely and comprehensible manner. We aimed to visualize the evolution of evidence about antidepressants for depression by conducting cumulative network meta-analyses (NMAs) and to examine whether it could have helped the selection of optimal drugs. We built a Shiny web application that performs and presents cumulative NMAs based on R netmeta. We used a comprehensive dataset of double-blind randomized controlled trials of 21 antidepressants in the acute treatment of major depression. The primary outcomes were efficacy (treatment response) and acceptability (all-cause discontinuation), and treatment effects were summarized via odds ratios. We evaluated the confidence in evidence using the CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) framework for a series of consecutive NMAs. Users can change several conditions for the analysis, such as the period of synthesis, among the others. We present the league tables and two-dimensional plots that combine efficacy, acceptability and level of confidence in the evidence together, for NMAs conducted in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016. They reveal that through the past four decades, newly approved drugs often showed initially exaggerated results, which tended to diminish and stabilize after approximately a decade. Over the years, the drugs with relative superiority changed dramatically; but as the evidence network grew larger and better connected, the overall confidence improved. The Shiny app visualizes how evidence evolved over years, emphasizing the need for a careful interpretation of relative effects between drugs, especially for the potentially amplified performance of newly approved drugs. HIGHLIGHTS: Network meta-analysis is considered to be a proper way of demonstrating the available evidence, since it allows comparisons between multiple interventions, and has been proved to be statistically powerful. It is challenging to present the voluminous results of NMA in an efficient and comprehendible manner. Evidence evolution based on the relatively new method NMA has not been investigated yet. The results of NMA should not only include the effects but also the confidence in the evidence, which can help interpret the findings appropriately. Effective use of rapidly developing statistical analysis and presentation tools such as Shiny package in R, may facilitate and simplify the visualization of NMA output. We should stay conservative towards new drugs, as their performance was often shown to be exaggerated initially, and it took time to become stable."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Internet-delivered mental health (eMental Health) interventions produce treatment effects similar to those observed in face-to-face treatment. However, there is a large degree of variation in treatment effects observed from program to program, and eMental Health interventions remain somewhat of a black box in terms of the mechanisms by which they exert their therapeutic benefit. Trials of eMental Health interventions typically use large sample sizes and therefore provide an ideal context within which to systematically investigate the therapeutic benefit of specific program features. Furthermore, the growth and impact of mobile phone technology within eMental Health interventions provides an opportunity to examine associations between symptom improvement and the use of program features delivered across computer and mobile phone platforms.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of program usage associated with treatment outcome in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a fully automated, mobile phone- and Web-based self-help program, \"myCompass\", for individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. The core features of the program include interactive psychotherapy modules, a symptom tracking feature, short motivational messages, symptom tracking reminders, and a diary, with many of these features accessible via both computer and mobile phone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patterns of program usage were recorded for 231 participants with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and/or stress, and who were randomly allocated to receive access to myCompass for seven weeks during the RCT. Depression, anxiety, stress, and functional impairment were examined at baseline and at eight weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Log data indicated that the most commonly used components were the short motivational messages (used by 68.4%, 158/231 of participants) and the symptom tracking feature (used by 61.5%, 142/231 of participants). Further, after controlling for baseline symptom severity, increased use of these alert features was associated with significant improvements in anxiety and functional impairment. Associations between use of symptom tracking reminders and improved treatment outcome remained significant after controlling for frequency of symptom tracking. Although correlations were not statistically significant, reminders received via SMS (ie, text message) were more strongly associated with symptom reduction than were reminders received via email.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings indicate that alerts may be an especially potent component of eMental Health interventions, both via their association with enhanced program usage, as well as independently. Although there was evidence of a stronger association between symptom improvement and use of alerts via the mobile phone platform, the degree of overlap between use of email and SMS alerts may have precluded identification of alert delivery modalities that were most strongly associated with symptom reduction.

            "abstract": "Background: A major challenge in providing mental health interventions for young people is making such interventions accessible and appealing to those most in need. Online and app-based forms of therapy for mental health are burgeoning. It is therefore crucial to identify features that are most effective and engaging for young users. Objectives: This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of digital mental health interventions and their effectiveness in addressing anxiety and depression in young people to determine factors that relate to outcomes, adherence, and engagement with such interventions. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken, including a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials that compared use of a digital intervention for depression in young people to a no-intervention control group, and 6 comparing the intervention to an active control condition. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of 41 studies was also performed. Results: The pooled effect size of digital mental health interventions on depression in comparison to a no-intervention control was small (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55), while the pooled effect size of studies comparing an intervention group to an active control showed no significant differences (Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI -.04 to 0.31). Pooled effect sizes were higher when supervision was involved (studies with no-intervention controls: Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; studies with active control: Cohen's d = 0.49, 95% CI -0.11, 1.01). Engagement and adherence rates were low. Qualitative analysis revealed that users liked interventions with a game-like feel and relatable, interactive content. Educational materials were perceived as boring, and users were put off by non-appealing interfaces and technical glitches. Conclusions: Digital interventions work better than no intervention to improve depression in young people when results of different studies are pooled together. However, these interventions may only be of clinical significance when use is highly supervised. Digital interventions do not work better than active alternatives regardless of the level of support. Future interventions need to move beyond the use of digital educational materials, considering other ways to attract and engage young people and to ensure relevance and appeal."

This study is designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of m-health-based core stability exercise (CSE) combined with self-compassion training (SCT) and compare it with m-health-based CSE alone for the management of NCLBP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a pilot, patient-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants with NCLBP were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. All the participants received m-health-based CSE, but those in the intervention group also received SCT before CSE. The intervention took place weekly on Saturday or Sunday for 4 weeks in total. Patients self-assessed their outcomes by filling out electronic questionnaires at 4 and 16 weeks after the start of the study. The primary outcome metrics for these questionnaires were back pain disability (based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ) and Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS; current pain, worst pain, average pain). The secondary outcome metrics were anxiety (GAD-7,7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), Depression Symptoms (PHQ-9,Patient Health Questionnaire-9), pain catastrophizing (PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and Self-efficiency (PSEQ, Pain Self-Efficiency Questionnaire).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 37 patients comprising 28 (75.7%) females completed the study, with 19 patients in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The mean (SD) patient age was 35.2 (11.1) years. For all primary outcomes, although there were no significant differences between groups, we found that participants in the intervention group improved function and pain earlier. The RMDQ score changed by - 1.771 points (95% CI - 3.768 to 0.227) from baseline to 4 weeks in the control group and by - 4.822 points (95% CI - 6.752 to - 2.892) in the intervention group (difference between groups, - 3.052 [95% CI - 5.836 to - 0.267]). Also, the RMDQ score changed by - 3.328 points (95% CI - 5.252 to - 1.403) from baseline to 16 weeks in the control group and by - 5.124 points (95% CI - 7.014 to - 3.233) in the intervention group (difference between groups - 1.796 [95% CI - 4.501 to 0.909]). A similar pattern was found in the NRS scores. For secondary outcomes, the intervention group was superior to the control group in for GAD-7 (intervention difference from CSE along at week 16, - 2.156 [95% CI - 4.434 to - 0.122; P value for group effect was 0.030]). At the end of treatment, the improvement in PCS in the intervention group was significant (difference in PCS score at week 4, - 6.718 [95% CI - 11.872 to - 1.564]). We also found significant changes in PCS in the control group (- 6.326 [95% CI, - 11.250 to - 1.401]) at the 16-week follow-up. As for PSEQ, there were no apparent differences between the two groups.

Smartphone apps are easy-to-use, low-cost tools that can be used to assess this information. To date, few studies have examined the usefulness of smartphone data for monitoring symptoms in bipolar disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We present results from a pilot test of a smartphone-based monitoring system, Social Information Monitoring for Patients with Bipolar Affective Disorder (SIMBA), that tracked daily mood, physical activity, and social communication in 13 patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether smartphone measurements predicted clinical symptoms levels and clinical symptom change. The hypotheses that smartphone measurements are (1) negatively related to clinical depressive symptoms and (2) positively related to clinical manic symptoms were tested.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Clinical rating scales were administered to assess clinical depressive and manic symptoms. Patients used a smartphone with the monitoring app for up to 12 months. Random-coefficient multilevel models were computed to analyze the relationship between smartphone data and externally rated manic and depressive symptoms. Overall clinical symptom levels and clinical symptom changes were predicted by separating between-patient and within-patient effects. Using established clinical thresholds from the literature, marginal effect plots displayed clinical relevance of smartphone data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall symptom levels and change in clinical symptoms were related to smartphone measures. Higher overall levels of clinical depressive symptoms were predicted by lower self-reported mood measured by the smartphone (beta=-.56, P<.001). An increase in clinical depressive symptoms was predicted by a decline in social communication (ie, outgoing text messages: beta=-.28, P<.001) and a decline in physical activity as measured by the smartphone (ie, cell tower movements: beta=-.11, P=.03). Higher overall levels of clinical manic symptoms were predicted by lower physical activity on the smartphone (ie, distance travelled: beta=-.37, P<.001), and higher social communication (beta=.48, P=.03). An increase in clinical manic symptoms was predicted by a decrease in physical activity on the smartphone (beta=-.17, P<.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical symptoms were related to some objective and subjective smartphone measurements, but not all smartphone measures predicted the occurrence of bipolar symptoms above clinical thresholds.

At record-high levels in the United States, obesity disproportionately affects minorities and is highly correlated with cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, structured weight loss programs are expensive, and compliance significantly decreases upon program completion. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is an innovative, cost-effective way to bridge this gap.

Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke survivors and their carers are recruited from the acute care service of a Houston-based comprehensive stroke center. A neurorehabilitation physician or vascular neurologist meets with participants during the index hospitalization, a baseline clinic visit, followed by visits at 1, 3, and 6 month intervals. The SOS Team focuses on feasible modifications to the Southern dietary pattern (fried foods, fatty foods, added fats, eggs, processed meats, such as bacon and ham, organ meats (e.g., liver), and sweetened drinks) and caloric restriction to facilitate a 5% reduction in total body weight.

Task-sharing models such as the Thinking Healthy Program have shown great potential in feasibility and efficacy trials as a strategy for expanding access to treatment in low-resource settings, but there are significant barriers to scale-up. We are addressing this gap by adapting Thinking Healthy for automated delivery via a mobile phone. This new intervention, Healthy Moms, uses an existing artificial intelligence system called Tess (Zuri in Kenya) to drive conversations with users.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this pilot study is to test the Healthy Moms perinatal depression intervention using a single-case experimental design with pregnant women and new mothers recruited from public hospitals outside of Nairobi, Kenya.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will invite patients to complete a brief, automated screening delivered via text messages to determine their eligibility.

The prevention of depression is regarded as one possible approach to reach this goal. People with multiple risk factors for MDD such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most from preventive measures. The Internet as intervention setting allows for scaling up preventive interventions on a public mental health level.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of parallel design aiming to investigate the (cost-) effectiveness of an Internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for the prevention of depression in chronic back pain patients (PROD-BP) with subthreshold depressive symptoms. eSano BackCare-DP is a guided, chronic back pain-specific depression prevention intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles comprising six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion of the intervention. Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) at baseline and 1-year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take place at baseline and 9 weeks as well as 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 12-month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients.

Adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with major depressive disorder; capable of reading and understanding English or Bahasa Malaysia; prescribed with at least one antidepressant and owns a smart phone were subsequently randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment reminders (intervention) or standard treatment without reminders (control), using a computergenerated randomisation programme. The intervention group received two reminder categories: Outpatient appointment reminders (a day before appointment); and medication reminders (weekly basis). Participants were followed-up over two months. We utilised Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to measure the severity of depression; and Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) to assess medication adherence. Primary outcomes were outpatient attendance rates and medication adherence assessed at two months. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression severity within each group at two months; comparison of changes in depression severity between both groups; preferences of participants towards treatment reminders, and reasons for non-attendance among participants. This trial was registered with the National Medical Research Registry, NMRR-19-3466-52001.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between February and April 2020, 183 participants were randomised to each group, of whom 179 reached study endpoint (91 [98.9%] of 92 in intervention group and 88 [96.7%] of 91 in control group).

Multiple studies in the United States and across the world have documented the association of health literacy with multiple health outcomes. In particular, the elderly and many members of minority groups have been shown to have low levels of health literacy; the same groups are disproportionately affected by chronic illnesses. These twin burdens affect the people most in need of the skills and knowledge required for coping with chronic illnesses. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that spans across specific diseases, CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance, and treatment adherence. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy could improve treatment and adherence and be cost effective, but it is not clear that this same strategy will be effective in persons with low health literacy and multiple chronic conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-delivered mobile intervention that will provide individuals with chronic conditions the necessary information to cope with their conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this project, we will complete a qualitative study on the status and needs of individuals with more than one chronic condition. Results of this study will be used to develop a mobile tailored information app that will address self-management challenges in the areas of pain, sleep, fatigue, depression, anger, stress, memory problems, and treatment adherence. The impact of the intervention on patient quality of life, patient-provider relationships, health literacy, and patient activation will be assessed. We will also explore the extent to which health literacy mediates important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and health service utilization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We are currently completing the preliminary qualitative and usability studies that will inform the content and design of the intervention. We anticipate that the intervention will be complete in 2017, and the clinical trial of its efficacy will also commence in 2017.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results will provide evidence on the usefulness of a mobile tailored information app for improving health literacy, patient activation, health-related quality of life, and self-reported health in patients with multiple chronic conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02922439; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02922439 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6pTiqDAyN)."

Methods. This was a two-phase feasibility and acceptability study, with qualitative interviews conducted in Phase 1 and qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey conducted in Phase 2. Caregiving burden, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and social support were measured before and after the intervention. Participants were asked to draw electronic paintings at any time they liked, and to share the paintings with friends or relatives if they wished. Result. The recruitment rate in Phase 2 was 87.5% (28 out of 32), with 78.6% participants (22 out 28) completing all activities in 8 weeks. The FCPWD regarded the e-painting app as an appropriate channel for expressing their emotions. They found the layout of the app to be easy to use and were satisfied with it.

Psychological factors, such as academic demands, limited opportunity to meet their peers, problematic use of technology, and domestic problems, influenced the well-being of the students, leading to poor academic performance. A mobile-based counseling application was developed to address the distress among University students. The application was meant to reach students living remotely to enable them to access psychological assistance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe a protocol aimed to evaluate the equivalence of the application when compared to the Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) in increasing the coping self-efficacy (CSE) and resilience of students as well as in decreasing their level of depression. A two-armed parallel randomized control non-inferiority trial will be conducted among approximately 430 students with selected academic problems. The participants will be randomly allocated into the TAU and the intervention groups.

Methods and design: Prospective, randomized, parallel group, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical, and experimental controlled non-invasive trial (PROBE). Adult German native speakers with acute aphasia after stroke are included. Computer-generated, blocked, and stratified randomization by aphasia severity will assign patients to one of two groups: 4 weeks of either standard logopedic speech therapy or logopedic speech therapy with the app version of Neolexon®. Both groups will be instructed in self-training: the frequency and duration of self-training will be documented. Screening for aphasia will be performed using the Language Screening Test (LAST). The severity of aphasia in general and in subitems will be assessed using the Bielefelder Aphasie Screening (BIAS) and the Aphasia Check List (ACL). Follow-up will be assessed after 3 months. Study outcomes: Based on the consensus in our study team, we considered a 10% mean difference in the change of percentile rank (PR) of BIAS to be a minimal and clinically important difference. The primary endpoint is defined as a significant difference in BIAS comparing the two groups. Differences in quality of life, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) will be evaluated as secondary outcome parameters. Discussion: This trial will determine whether speech therapy with the use of Neolexon® is superior to standard logopedic therapy. Subgroups with the greatest response to Neolexon® will be described. The trial was prospectively registered on the \"EU Clinical Trials Register\" (NCT04080817)."

Identifying influential mediators may enhance and refine effective components of mHealth interventions to improve mental health of people living with HIV.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to examine mediating factors of the effects of a mHealth intervention, Run4Love, designed to reduce depression among people living with HIV using 4 time-point measurement data.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study used data from a randomized controlled trial of a mHealth intervention among people living with HIV with elevated depressive symptoms in Guangzhou, China. A total of 300 patients were assigned to receive either the mHealth intervention (n=150) or a waitlist control group (n=150) through computer-generated block randomization. Depressive symptoms, coping, and HIV-related stigma were measured at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups. The latent growth curve model was used to examine the effects of the intervention on depressive symptoms via potential mediators. Mediating effects were estimated using bias-corrected 95% bootstrapped CIs (BCIs) with resampling of 5000.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Enhanced positive coping and reduced HIV-related stigma served as effective treatment mediators in the mHealth intervention. Specially, there was a significant indirect effect of the mHealth intervention on the slope of depressive symptoms via the slope of positive coping (beta=-2.86; 95% BCI -4.78 to -0.94). The indirect effect of the mHealth intervention on the slope of depressive symptoms via the slope of HIV-related stigma was also statistically significant (beta=-1.71; 95% BCI -3.03 to -0.40). These findings indicated that enhancement of positive coping and reduction of HIV-related stigma were important mediating factors of the mHealth intervention in reducing depression among people living with HIV.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study revealed the underlying mediators of a mHealth intervention to reduce depression among people living with HIV using latent growth curve model and 4 time-point longitudinal measurement data.

            "abstract": "Introduction: Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) and their integration into routine psychotherapy (i.e., blended therapy) can offer a means of complementing psychotherapy in a flexible and resource optimized way. Objective: The present study will evaluate the non-inferiority, cost-effectiveness, and safety of two versions of integrated blended psychotherapy for depression and anxiety compared to standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: A three-armed multicenter cluster-randomized controlled non-inferiority trial will be conducted comparing two implementations of blended psychotherapy (PSYCHOnlineTHERAPYfix/flex) compared to CBT. Seventy-five outpatient psychotherapists with a CBT-license will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each of them is asked to include 12 patients on average with depressive or anxiety disorders resulting in a total sample size of N = 900. All patients receive up to a maximum of 16 psychotherapy sessions, either as routine CBT or alternating with Online self-help sessions (fix: 8/8; flex: 0-16). Assessments will be conducted at patient study inclusion (pre-treatment) and 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks and 12 months post-inclusion. The primary outcome is depression and anxiety severity at 18 weeks post-inclusion (post-treatment) using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes are depression and anxiety remission, treatment response, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, working alliance, psychotherapy adherence, and patient safety. Additionally, several potential moderators and mediators including patient characteristics and attitudes toward the interventions will be examined, complemented by ecological day-to-day digital behavior variables via passive smartphone sensing as part of an integrated smart-sensing sub-study. Data-analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis with additional per-protocol analyses. In addition, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from a societal and a public health care perspective. Additionally, qualitative interviews on acceptance, feasibility, and optimization potential will be conducted and analyzed. Discussion: PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY will provide evidence on blended psychotherapy in one of the largest ever conducted psychotherapy trials. If shown to be non-inferior and cost-effective, PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY has the potential to innovate psychotherapy in the near future by extending the ways of conducting psychotherapy. The rigorous health care services approach will facilitate a timely implementation of blended psychotherapy into standard care. Trial Registration: The trial is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00023973; date of registration: December 28th 2020)."

When MMs and PSP transition out of these professions, they may continue to experience mental health challenges. The development and implementation of resilience-building mobile health (mHealth) apps as an emergent mental health intervention platform has allowed for targeted, cost-effective, and easily accessible treatment when in-person therapy may be limited or unavailable. However, current mHealth app development is not regulated, and often lacks both clear evidence-based research and the input of health care professionals.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to evaluate the evidence-based quality, efficacy, and effectiveness of resilience-building mobile apps targeted toward the MMs, PSP, and veteran populations via a scoping literature review of the current evidence base regarding resilience apps for these populations and an evaluation of free resilience apps designed for use among these populations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The studies were selected using a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, Academic Search Complete, Embase, and Google and were guided by PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A narrative synthesis of the resulting papers was performed. The Alberta Rating Index for Apps was used to conduct a review of each of the identified apps. The inclusion criteria consisted of apps that were free to download in either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store; updated within the last 3 years; available in English and in Canada; and intended for use by MMs, veterans, and PSP.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 22 apps met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. The resilience strategies offered by most apps included psychoeducation, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Overall, 50% (11/22) of apps had been tested in randomized controlled trials, 7 (32%) apps had been evaluated using other research methods, and 5 (23%) apps had not been studied. Using the Alberta Rating Index for Apps, the app scores ranged from 37 to 56 out of 72, with higher rated apps demonstrating increased usability and security features.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The mHealth apps reviewed are well-suited to providing resilience strategies for MMs, PSP, and veterans. They offer easy accessibility to evidence-based tools while working to encourage the use of emotional and professional support with safety in mind. Although not intended to function as a substitute for professional services, research has demonstrated that mHealth apps have the potential to foster a significant reduction in symptom severity for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. In clinical practice, apps can be used to supplement treatment and provide clients with population-specific confidential tools to increase engagement in the treatment process."

It is important to improve mental health among nurses in these countries. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of two types of newly developed smartphone-based stress management programs in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among hospital nurses in Vietnam. This study was a three-arm (including two intervention groups and one control group) randomized trial. Participants were recruited from nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two types (free-choice and fixed sequential order) of smartphone-based stress management programs were developed. Participants were randomly allocated to Program A (a free-choice, multimodule stress management), Program B (a fixed-order, internet cognitive behavioral therapy, iCBT), or a control group (treatment as usual). The depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at baseline, 3-, and 7-month follow-up surveys. 951 participants were randomly allocated to each of the three groups. Program B showed a statistically significant effect on improving depressive symptoms at 3-month (p = 0.048), but not at 7-month (p = 0.92); Cohen's d was - 0.18 (95% CI - 0.34 to - 0.02) and 0.03 (95% CI - 1.00 to 1.05), respectively. Program A failed to show a significant intervention effect on any of the outcomes at 3- or 7-month follow-up (p > 0.05).

The pre-post effect sizes (Cohen d) for mindfulness, depression, anxiety, and stress were 0.55, 0.95, 0.89, and 1.13, respectively. Participants assigned to the MIND+ (vs MIND) condition demonstrated significantly less attrition and more adherence, as indicated by a greater likelihood of completing posttreatment assessments (16/27, 59% vs 7/27, 26%; χ21=6.1; P=.01) and a higher percentage of course completion (72.6/100, 72.6% vs 50.7/100, 50.7%; t52=2.10; P=.04), respectively. No significant between-group differences in daily frequency and duration of mindfulness practice were observed. Multilevel logistic growth models showed that MIND+ participants reported significantly greater pre-post improvements in daily stress ratings (interaction estimate 0.39, SE 0.18; t317=2.29; P=.02) and depression (interaction estimate 0.38, SE 0.16; t330=2.37; P=.02) than those in the MIND condition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides new insights into effective ways of leveraging technology and task shifting to implement large-scale mental health initiatives that are financially feasible, easily transportable, and quickly scalable in low-resource settings. The findings suggest that volunteer peer counselors receiving low-cost, low-intensity training and supervision may significantly improve participants' indices of treatment engagement and mental health outcomes in an internet-based mindfulness intervention among Chinese university students."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

The results on engagement with the iBobbly app were however positive. This study showed that Indigenous youth are early and frequent users of technology in general, and they regarded the iBobbly app to be culturally safe and of therapeutic value. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that iBobbly app use was associated with self-reported improvements in psychological wellbeing, mental health literacy, and reductions in shame.

            "abstract": "Background: Internet-based cognitive therapy with monitoring via text messages (mobile CT), in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), might offer a cost-effective way to treat recurrent depression. Method: Remitted patients with at least 2 previous episodes of depression were randomized to mobile CT in addition to TAU (n = 126) or TAU only (n = 113). A linear mixed model was used to examine the effect of the treatment condition on a 3-month course of depressive symptoms after remission. Both an intention-to-treat analysis (n = 239) and a completer analysis (n = 193) were used. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR30) at baseline and 1.5 and 3 months after randomization. Results: Residual depressive symptoms showed a small but statistically significant decrease in the intention-to-treat group over 3 months in the mobile CT group relative to the TAU group (difference: -1.60 points on the IDS-SR30 per month, 95% CI = -2.64 to -0.56, p = 0.003). The effect of the treatment condition on the depressive symptomatology at the 3-month follow-up was small to moderate (Cohen's d = 0.44). All analyses among completers (≥5 modules) showed more pronounced treatment effects. Adjustment for unequally distributed variables did not markedly affect the results. Conclusions: Residual depressive symptoms after remission showed a more favorable course over 3 months in the mobile CT group compared to the TAU group. These results are a first indication that mobile CT in addition to TAU is effective in treating recurrently depressed patients in remission. However, demonstration of its long-term effectiveness and replication remains necessary. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel."

There is potential for smartphone apps to be effective in reducing sedentary behavior, although among the few studies that have investigated smartphone apps in cardiac rehabilitation, none targeted sedentary behavior.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a behavioral smartphone app (Vire) and a web-based behavior change program (ToDo-CR) to decrease sedentary behavior in cardiac rehabilitation participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using a single-center, pre-post design, participants were recruited by nursing staff on admission to cardiac rehabilitation. All eligible participants installed the Vire app, were given a Fitbit Flex, and received the 6-week ToDo-CR program while attending cardiac rehabilitation. The ToDo-CR program uses personalized analytics to interpret important behavioral aspects (physical activity, variety, and social opportunity) and real-time information for generating and suggesting context-specific actionable microbehavioral alternatives (Do's). Do's were delivered via the app, with participants receiving 14 to 19 Do's during the 6-week intervention period. Outcome measures were collected at 0, 6, and 16 weeks. The assessors were not blinded. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and follow-up rates, resource requirements, app usability (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 [UTAUT2] questionnaire), and objectively measured daily minutes of sedentary behavior (ActiGraph) for sample size estimation. Secondary outcomes included functional aerobic capacity (6-min walk test), quality of life (MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire), BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between January and May 2019, 20 participants were recruited consecutively. One-third of people who commenced cardiac rehabilitation were eligible to participate. Other than declining to take part in the study (15/40, 38%), not having a smartphone was a major reason for exclusion (11/40, 28%). Those excluded without a smartphone were significantly older than participants with a smartphone (mean difference 20 [SD 5] years; P<.001). Participants were, on average, aged 54 (SD 13) years, mostly male (17/20, 85%), and working (12/20, 67%). At 6 weeks, 95% (19/20) of participants were assessed, and 60% (12/20) of participants were assessed at 16 weeks. Participants were relatively satisfied with the usability of the app (UTAUT2 questionnaire). Overall, participants spent 11 to 12 hours per day sitting. There was a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.54) for the reduction in sedentary behavior (minutes per day) over 16 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of a behavioral smartphone app to decrease sitting time appears to be feasible in cardiac rehabilitation.

Their risks are that they are not suitable for the whole range of severity of mental illnesses and patient characteristics, show severe deficits in the data privacy policy, and a big variability in quality standards. The use of apps in depression treatment can be beneficial for patients as long as (1) the usefulness of an app-based treatment is assessed for each individual patient, (2) apps are chosen according to symptom severity as well as characteristics like the patient's level of self-reliance, their e-literacy, and their openness vis-à-vis apps, (3) manufacturers improve their privacy policies and the quality of apps."

A negative impact on the mental and physical health of women, their children, partners, or significant others has been associated with this disease. Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions can reduce the burden of the disease through prevention of new cases of depression. It is crucial to know the effectiveness of these interventions to implement them around the globe. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness of Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions to prevent depression during the perinatal period.\n    \n\n\n          Method and analysis:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies will be identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Opengrey, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University, clinicaltrial.gov, beacon.anu.edu.au, and evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org from inception until 31 March 2021. We will also search the reference lists provided in relevant studies and reviews. The selection criteria will be as follows: 1) pregnant women or women who have given birth in the last 12 months and who were non-depressive at baseline; 2) Web-based and Mobile-Based psychological interventions; 3) comparators will be usual care, attention control, waiting list or no intervention; 4) outcomes will be the incidence of new cases of perinatal depression and/or the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured by validated instruments; and 5) the design of the studies will be randomized controlled trials. No restrictions regarding the year or language of publication will be considered. Pooled standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The risk of bias of the studies will be assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 tool. Heterogeneity and publication bias will be estimated. Sensitivity and sub-group analyses will also be conducted. Random effects meta-regression will be performed.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      As a systematic review, ethical approval is not required.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent and often co-occur. Several studies indicate the potential of disorder-specific psychological interventions for the prevention of each of these disorders. To treat comorbidity, transdiagnostic treatment concepts seem to be a promising approach, however, evidence for transdiagnostic concepts of prevention remains inconclusive. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may be an effective means to deliver psychological interventions on a large scale for the prevention of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety. IMIs have been shown to be effective in treating CMDs, e.g. in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, there is a lack of studies examining the efficacy of interventions reducing the incidence of CMDs. Moreover, the comparative cost-effectiveness of guided versus unguided IMIs for the prevention of depression and anxiety has not been studied yet. Hence, this study aims at investigating the (cost-) effectiveness of guided and unguided internet- and mobile-based transdiagnostic individually tailored indicated prevention of depression and anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multi-country three-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a guided and unguided intervention to treatment as usual (TAU). Both active conditions are based on the same intervention, ICare Prevent, and differ only with regard to guidance format. Altogether, 954 individuals with subclinical symptoms of depression (CES-D ≥ 16) and anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5) who do not have a full-blown disorder will be recruited in Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, and randomized to one of three conditions (guided intervention, unguided intervention, or TAU). The TAU arm will receive access to the training after a 12-month waiting period. The primary outcome will be time to CMD onset (any depression/anxiety disorder) within a follow-up period of 12 months after baseline. Secondary outcomes will include disorder-specific symptom severity (depression/anxiety) assessed by diagnostic raters blinded to intervention condition at post-intervention, self-reports, acceptability, health related quality of life, and psychosocial variables associated with developing a CMD. Assessments will take place at baseline, mid-intervention (5 weeks into the intervention), post-intervention (8 weeks after randomization) and follow-up (6 and 12 months after randomization). Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from a public health and a societal perspective, including both direct and indirect costs.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The present study will further enhance the evidence-base for transdiagnostic preventive interventions and provide valuable information about optimal trade-off between treatment outcome and costs.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      German Clinical Trial Registration (DRKS - http://www.drks.de/drks_web/): DRKS00011099."

To date, a growing number of suicide preventive strategies based on the use of new technologies are emerging. We aimed to provide an overview of the present literature on the use of new technologies in adolescent suicide prevention. Materials and methods: An electronic search was run using the following keywords: Technology OR Technologies OR APP OR Application OR mobile application) AND (Adolescent OR youth OR puberty) AND (Suicid* OR Self-harm OR self-destruction). Inclusion criteria were: English language, published in a peer-reviewed journal, suicide prevention with the use of new technologies among adolescents. Results: Our search strategy yielded a total of 12 studies on the use of telemedicine, 7 on mobile applications, and 3 on language detection. We also found heterogeneity regarding the study design: 3 are randomized controlled trials (RCT), 13 are open-label single group trials, 2 are randomized studies, and 1 is a cross-sectional study. Telemedicine was the most adopted tool, especially web-based approaches. Mobile applications mostly focused on screening of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and for clinical monitoring through the use of text messages. Although telepsychiatry and mobile applications can provide a fast and safe tool, supporting and preceding a face-to-face clinical assessment, only a few studies demonstrated efficacy in preventing suicide among adolescents through the use of these interventions. Some studies suggested algorithms able to recognize people at risk of suicide from the exploration of the language on social media posts. Conclusions: New technologies were found to be well accepted and tolerated supports for suicide prevention in adolescents. However, to date, few data support the use of such interventions in clinical practice and preventive strategies. Further studies are needed to test their efficacy in suicide prevention among adolescents and young adults."

Participants in the therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT groups had 12-week access to a program consisting of 5 main modules, as well as a drinking calendar with automatic feedback. Guidance was given by experienced therapists trained in motivational interviewing. The primary outcome measure was weekly alcohol consumption in standard drinks (12 g of ethanol). Secondary outcomes were alcohol-related problems measured using the total alcohol use disorder identification test-score, diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder, depression, anxiety, health, readiness to change, and access to other treatments or support.

Traditional forms of mental health services (i.e. face-to-face, individualised assessments and interventions) are therefore not feasible. We propose three strategies for addressing this mental health gap: delivery of evidence-based, low-intensity interventions by non-specialists, the use of transdiagnostic treatment protocols, and strategic deployment of technology to facilitate access and uptake. We urge researchers from all over the world to conduct feasibility studies and randomised controlled studies on the effect of low-intensity interventions and technology supported (e.g. online) interventions in LMICs, preferably using an active control condition as comparison, to ensure we disseminate effective treatments in LMICs."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The stepped-care approach, where people with early symptoms of depression are stepped up from low-intensity interventions to higher-level interventions as needed, has the potential to assist many people with mild depressive symptoms. Self-monitoring techniques assist people to understand their mental health symptoms by increasing their emotional self-awareness (ESA) and can be easily distributed on mobile phones at low cost. Increasing ESA is an important first step in psychotherapy and has the potential to intervene before mild depressive symptoms progress to major depressive disorder. In this secondary analysis we examined a mobile phone self-monitoring tool used by young people experiencing mild or more depressive symptoms to investigate the relationships between self-monitoring, ESA, and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We tested two main hypotheses: (1) people who monitored their mood, stress, and coping strategies would have increased ESA from pretest to 6-week follow-up compared with an attention comparison group, and (2) an increase in ESA would predict a decrease in depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited patients aged 14 to 24 years from rural and metropolitan general practices. Eligible participants were identified as having mild or more mental health concerns by their general practitioner. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (where mood, stress, and daily activities were monitored) or the attention comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored), and both groups self-monitored for 2 to 4 weeks. Randomization was carried out electronically via random seed generation, by an in-house computer programmer; therefore, general practitioners, participants, and researchers were blinded to group allocation at randomization. Participants completed pretest, posttest, and 6-week follow-up measures of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the ESA Scale. We estimated a parallel process latent growth curve model (LGCM) using Mplus to test the indirect effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms via the mediator ESA, and calculated 95% bias-corrected bootstrapping confidence intervals (CIs).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 163 participants assessed for eligibility, 118 were randomly assigned and 114 were included in analyses (68 in the intervention group and 46 in the comparison group). A parallel process LGCM estimated the indirect effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms via ESA and was shown to be statistically significant based on the 95% bias-corrected bootstrapping CIs not containing zero (-6.366 to -0.029). The proportion of the maximum possible indirect effect estimated was κ(2 )=.54 (95% CI .426-.640).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study supported the hypothesis that self-monitoring increases ESA, which in turn decreases depressive symptoms for young people with mild or more depressive symptoms. Mobile phone self-monitoring programs are ideally suited to first-step intervention programs for depression in the stepped-care approach, particularly when ESA is targeted as a mediating factor.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00794222; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00794222 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/65lldW34k)."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Current healthcare costs for over 50 million people afflicted with AD are about $818 million and are projected to be $2 billion by 2050. Unfortunately, there are no drugs currently available that can delay and/or prevent the progression of disease in elderly individuals and in AD patients. Loss of synapses and synaptic damage are largely correlated with cognitive decline in AD patients. Women are at a higher lifetime risk of developing AD encompassing two-thirds of the total AD afflicted population. Only about 1-2% of total AD patients can be explained by genetic mutations in APP, PS1, and PS2 genes. Several risk factors have been identified, such as Apolipoprotein E4 genotype, type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, depression, and hormonal imbalance, are reported to be associated with late-onset AD. Strong evidence reveals that antioxidant enriched diets and regular exercise reduces toxic radicals, enhances mitochondrial function and synaptic activity, and improves cognitive function in elderly populations. Current available data on the use of antioxidants in mouse models of AD and antioxidant(s) supplements in diets of elderly individuals were investigated. The use of antioxidants in randomized clinical trials in AD patients was also critically assessed. Based on our survey of current literature and findings, we cautiously conclude that healthy diets, regular exercise, and improved lifestyle can delay dementia progression and reduce the risk of AD in elderly individuals and reverse subjects with mild cognitive impairment to a non-demented state."

A three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 90 participants randomized into two intervention groups and one control group was conducted. The purpose of this study is to test whether the use of a mobile phone-based app, with or without telehealth counseling, could improve HbA1c level, self-management, and health-related quality of life compared with usual care. The two intervention groups received a mobile phone with a self-management app. One intervention group additionally received telehealth counseling delivered by a diabetes specialist nurse for 6 months. All three groups continued to receive the usual care from their provider. The primary outcome is a reduction in HbA1c level. Secondary outcomes are self-management, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and lifestyle changes. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate (descriptive, t-test, MANOVA) methods. There was a significant reduction in the HbA1c levels of participants after 3 and 6 months. There was also a significant difference in HbA1c levels between the control and two intervention groups. Pre- and posteducation surveys for intervention group 2 showed an improvement in the understanding of type 2 diabetes risk factors, diabetes, and self-management. Digital telehealth demonstrated considerable potential for reducing blood sugar levels, enhancing self-management, and improving the quality of life of type 2 diabetic patients.

Mobile apps offer a promising solution to increase access to resources while students wait for services. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a publicly available mindfulness app. Students on a counseling center waitlist (n = 23) were randomized to use the app or not, with assessments completed over four weeks. Results: Recruitment over three semesters was slow, leading to an underpowered trial. Participants reported high satisfaction and moderate app usage. Very preliminary support was found for potential app efficacy relative to the control condition, particularly for depression, anxiety, and overall distress. Weaker, mixed effects were found for mindfulness and values processes. Conclusions: Overall, these results provide mixed findings suggesting the potential benefits, but also challenges in using a mindfulness app for students waiting to receive counseling services."

In terms of content, there is a huge variety in approaches ranging from a mixture of face-to-face contacts augmented with EMI components to a fully automated EMI. With regard to efficacy, only two randomized clinical trials have been conducted, supporting the efficacy of EMIs in mental health. Evidence seems to point toward greater efficacy when EMI is integrated with real-life assessment using experience sampling methodology, preferentially tailoring the intervention toward the specific needs of the individual as well as toward those moments when intervention is needed.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      The review demonstrates that mobile health may be an important asset to the mental health field but underscores that it still is in its very early ages.

Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from JBI. Quantitative data were extracted from included studies independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI.

Barriers to help-seeking include shame, feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes towards healthcare providers. The use of mobile devices and apps continues to rise amongst young people, thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids in overcoming help-seeking barriers. Apps have been shown to assist in several health-related areas, including weight loss and smoking cessation, although no apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are common among older adults and expensive to manage. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple conditions (eg, diabetes and osteoarthritis) and account for more than 90% of Medicare spending. Patients with MCCs also experience lower quality of life and worse medical and psychiatric outcomes than patients without MCCs. In primary care settings, where MCCs are generally treated, care often focuses on laboratory results and medication management, and not quality of life, due in part to time constraints. eHealth systems, which have been shown to improve multiple outcomes, may be able to fill the gap, supplementing primary care and improving these patients' lives.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to assess the effects of ElderTree (ET), an eHealth intervention for older adults with MCCs, on quality of life and related measures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this unblinded study, 346 adults aged 65 years and older with at least 3 of 5 targeted high-risk chronic conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were recruited from primary care clinics and randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to one of 2 conditions: usual care (UC) plus laptop computer, internet service, and ET or a control consisting of UC plus laptop and internet but no ET. Patients with ET have access for 12 months and will be followed up for an additional 6 months, for a total of 18 months. The primary outcomes of this study are the differences between the 2 groups with regard to measures of quality of life, psychological well-being, and loneliness. The secondary outcomes are between-group differences in laboratory scores, falls, symptom distress, medication adherence, and crisis and long-term health care use. We will also examine the mediators and moderators of the effects of ET. At baseline and months 6, 12, and 18, patients complete written surveys comprising validated scales selected for good psychometric properties with similar populations; laboratory data are collected from eHealth records; health care use and chronic conditions are collected from health records and patient surveys; and ET use data are collected continuously in system logs.

Many interventions encourage self-monitoring of steps, which can increase physical activity in the short term. However, these interventions appear insufficient to increase motivation for sustained change. There is a need for innovative strategies to increase physical activity motivation in this population.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Research studies are establishing the use of smartphone sensing to measure mental well-being. Smartphone sensor information captures behavioral patterns, and its analysis helps reveal well-being changes. Depression in diabetes goes highly underdiagnosed and underreported. The comorbidity has been associated with increased mortality and worse clinical outcomes, including poor glycemic control and self-management. Clinical-only intervention has been found to have a very modest effect on diabetes management among people with depression. Smartphone technologies could play a significant role in complementing comorbid care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to analyze the association between smartphone-sensing parameters and symptoms of depression and to explore an approach to risk-stratify people with diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional observational study (Project SHADO-Analyzing Social and Health Attributes through Daily Digital Observation) was conducted on 47 participants with diabetes. The study's smartphone-sensing app passively collected data regarding activity, mobility, sleep, and communication from each participant. Self-reported symptoms of depression using a validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were collected once every 2 weeks from all participants. A descriptive analysis was performed to understand the representation of the participants. A univariate analysis was performed on each derived sensing variable to compare behavioral changes between depression states-those with self-reported major depression (PHQ-9>9) and those with none (PHQ-9≤9). A classification predictive modeling, using supervised machine-learning methods, was explored using derived sensing variables as input to construct and compare classifiers that could risk-stratify people with diabetes based on symptoms of depression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A noticeably high prevalence of self-reported depression (30 out of 47 participants, 63%) was found among the participants. Between depression states, a significant difference was found for average activity rates (daytime) between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 16.06 [SD 14.90]) and those with none (mean 18.79 [SD 16.72]), P=.005. For average number of people called (calls made and received), a significant difference was found between participant-day instances with symptoms of major depression (mean 5.08 [SD 3.83]) and those with none (mean 8.59 [SD 7.05]), P<.001. These results suggest that participants with diabetes and symptoms of major depression exhibited lower activity through the day and maintained contact with fewer people. Using all the derived sensing variables, the extreme gradient boosting machine-learning classifier provided the best performance with an average cross-validation accuracy of 79.07% (95% CI 74%-84%) and test accuracy of 81.05% to classify symptoms of depression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Participants with diabetes and self-reported symptoms of major depression were observed to show lower levels of social contact and lower activity levels during the day. Although findings must be reproduced in a broader randomized controlled study, this study shows promise in the use of predictive modeling for early detection of symptoms of depression in people with diabetes using smartphone-sensing information."

In response there has been an explosion of digital interventions such as smartphone applications (\"apps\") to extend care. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital depression intervention (VMood), delivered via a smartphone app. VMood is adapted from an in-person intervention that was delivered by non-specialist providers and shown to be effective in the Vietnamese context in our previous trial (2016-2019). A stepped-wedge, randomized controlled trial will be conducted across eight provinces in Vietnam. Adults aged 18 years and over will be recruited through community-based primary care centres and screened for depression using the embedded Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (primary outcome measure). Participants scoring 10-19, indicating depression caseness, will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group until the target of 336 is reached. Secondary outcome measures will examine the effect of the intervention on commonly co-occuring anxiety, quality of life and work productivity, along with use of alcohol and tobacco products. Assessments will be administered through an online survey platform (REDCap) at baseline, and at every 3 months until 3 months post-intervention. Intervention-group participants will receive VMood for a 3-month period, with online support provided by social workers. Control-group participants will receive a limited version of the app until they cross into the intervention group. Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models for clustered measures will be used for all outcomes data. We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the trial to capture VMood's costs and benefits. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital mental health intervention adapted from an in-person intervention.

            "abstract": "Although impressive progress has been made toward developing empirically-supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since app-supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access to up-to-date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these interventions is needed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 randomized controlled trials of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over control conditions on panic symptoms (g=-0.05, n=3), post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=-0.08, n=5). Studies that delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based app and offered professional guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions (face-to-face, computerized treatment), although the number of studies was low (n≤13). The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for common mental health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological treatment."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and common mental disorders (CMDs) are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Lifestyle interventions via mobile apps and conversational agents present themselves as low-cost, scalable solutions to prevent these conditions. This paper describes the rationale for, and development of, \"LvL UP 1.0″, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A multidisciplinary team led the intervention design process of LvL UP 1.0, involving four phases: (i) preliminary research (stakeholder consultations, systematic market reviews), (ii) selecting intervention components and developing the conceptual model, (iii) whiteboarding and prototype design, and (iv) testing and refinement. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy and the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions were used to guide the intervention development.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Preliminary research highlighted the importance of targeting holistic wellbeing (i.e., both physical and mental health). Accordingly, the first version of LvL UP features a scalable, smartphone-based, and conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention built around three pillars: Move More (physical activity), Eat Well (nutrition and healthy eating), and Stress Less (emotional regulation and wellbeing). Intervention components include health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily \"Life Hacks\" (healthy activity suggestions), breathing exercises, and journaling. In addition to the intervention components, formative research also stressed the need to introduce engagement-specific components to maximise uptake and long-term use. LvL UP includes a motivational interviewing and storytelling approach to deliver the coaching sessions, as well as progress feedback and gamification. Offline materials are also offered to allow users access to essential intervention content without needing a mobile device.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The development process of LvL UP 1.0 led to an evidence-based and user-informed smartphone-based intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. LvL UP is designed to be a scalable, engaging, prevention-oriented, holistic intervention for adults at risk of NCDs and CMDs. A feasibility study, and subsequent optimisation and randomised-controlled trials are planned to further refine the intervention and establish effectiveness. The development process described here may prove helpful to other intervention developers."

            "abstract": "Many Syrian refugees residing in Germany have been exposed to traumatizing events, while treatment options are scarce. Therefore, the self-help app \"Sanadak\" was developed to target post-traumatic stress in Syrian refugees. We aimed to inspect the recruitment and baseline characteristics of the participants in the trial, which is conducted to evaluate the app. Analyses were based on the recruitment sample (n = 170) and the trial sample (n = 133). Data were collected during structured face-to-face interviews in the Arabic language. Targeted outcomes included post-traumatic stress (primary; Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5/PDS-5) and depressive symptoms, anxiety, resilience, among others (secondary). Recruited individuals were M = 32.8 (SD = 11.2, range = 18-65) years old; 38.8% were women. The average PDS-5 score was 23.6 (SD = 13.2) regarding trauma exposure, which was most frequently related to experiencing military- or combat-related events (32.9%). Moreover, 46.5% had major depression and 51.8% showed low resilience. Anxiety was present in 40.6% of the trial participants. Psychological distress was high in Syrian refugees residing in Germany, enrolled in a trial targeting post-traumatic stress. This underlines the need for intervention. Our results provide important figures on the mental health of a not well-studied population group in Germany."

It has substantial socioeconomic impacts and cannot be simply treated with pharmacotherapy, nonsurgical intervention, or spine surgery. Medical consensus recommends optimizing conservative self-management therapies (eg, home exercise, wellness strategies, yoga, etc) as first-line treatment options for chronic low back pain. However, access to these modalities is often limited and secondary to cost, convenience, and ease of use. Mobile health apps have emerged as a cost-effective and accessible option for chronic low back pain self-management. Established in-person pain programs can provide the structure for an optimal mobile app adaptation.

The PEG-3 total score was used, in addition to individual items-Average Pain, Pain Effect on Enjoyment, and Pain Effect on Activity. The PHQ-4 total score was also used, in addition to other individual items, including Felt Depressed, Loss of Interest, Felt Anxious, and Difficult to Control Worry.

For this purpose, 63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday), a simple information-provision mobile-application-based program (HARUCard), or a waitlist control group. Self-report questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-Related Quality of Life Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and two computer tasks including the dot-probe task and the Implicit Association Test, were administered before and after 66 days of intervention. The results showed that the Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores of the cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday) group decreased significantly after the intervention compared to the attention control (HARUCard) and waitlist control groups. However, there were no significant changes in scores of the Health-Related Quality of Life Scale and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and the two computer tasks. Such results suggest that a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program may be an effective intervention for alleviating depression and anxiety, but not the general quality of life of cancer patients. Taking into consideration that psychosocial problems may not the topmost priority for cancer patients who are facing a chronic and possibly mortal disease, a mobile-application cognitive behavioral therapy program may be a possible solution for the alleviation of depression and anxiety in cancer patients who have many restraints in terms of time and space."

            "abstract": "In a randomized double-blind study of thirty grossly obese patients undergoing gastroplasty for weight reduction, the effects of intramuscular and epidural morphine were compared as regards analgesia, ambulation, gastrointestinal motility, early and late pulmonary function, duration of hospitalization, and occurrence of deep vein thrombosis in the postoperative period. The patients were operated on under thoracic epidural block combined with light endotracheal anesthesia. A six-grade scale was devised to quantify postoperative mobilization. A radioactive isotope method using 99mTc -plasmin was employed to detect postoperative deep vein thrombosis. For 14 hr after the first analgesic injection, respiratory frequency was noted every 15 min and arterial blood gases were measured hourly. Peak expiratory flow was recorded daily until the patient was discharged from hospital. Spirometry was performed the day before and the day after surgery. Plasma concentrations of morphine were measured after both intramuscular and epidural administration. Both intramuscular and epidural morphine gave effective analgesia, but the average dose of intramuscular morphine was up to seven times greater than that required by the epidural route. A larger number of patients receiving epidural morphine postoperatively were able to sit, stand, or walk unassisted within 6, 12, and 24 hr, respectively. Being alert and more mobile as a result of superior postoperative analgesia from epidural morphine, patients in this group benefited more from vigorous physiotherapy routine, which resulted in fewer pulmonary complications. Furthermore, earlier postoperative recovery of peak expiratory flow and bowel function presumably contributed to a significantly shorter hospitalization in patients receiving epidural morphine. There was no evidence of prolonged respiratory depression in this high-risk category of patients. The 99mTc -plasmin tests revealed no significant difference between the two groups."

            "abstract": "Several reviews focused on the use of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) across different populations. This review synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital CBT on psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). An extensive search was conducted in 10 databases from inception until August 29, 2021. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed using Hedges' g. The potential sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis. A total of 18 RCTs in 2514 perinatal women were identified from over 23 countries. The sample size ranged from 25 to 910. Meta-analyses showed that digital CBT significantly reduced depression (g = -0.56, 95% CI: -0.85, -0.27, I2 = 84.81%, p < 0.001), anxiety (g = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.17, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001), and stress (g = -0.75, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.56, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001) symptoms at post-intervention and stress symptoms at follow-up (g = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.93, -0.11, I2 = 0%, p = 0.01) compared with those in the control group. Subgroup analyses highlighted that the intervention was effective when CBT was combined with other therapeutic components which delivered via a mobile application. Preferable features of intervention should be more than eight sessions and conducted for than 6 weeks among postnatal women. Multivariable meta-regression showed that age was a significant covariate on depression symptoms. The sample size in the selected RCTs was small, and the overall quality of the evidence was very low. Digital CBT is a potential intervention for alleviating psychological outcomes in perinatal women. This review suggests the essential features to optimize the intervention effect. Further well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are necessary."

The online Pilates program was conducted for 8 weeks, twice a week, and 50 min a day using a real-time video chat app. Participants visited the hospital twice for body composition and blood tests. Questionnaires on postpartum depression, sleep disorder, and stress were conducted at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after childbirth. We found a significant difference between groups in body composition. The weight, percentage of body fat, body fat mass, and BMI of the PE group decreased. Blood lipids showed significant differences between the groups in TC, TG, LDL and CRP, while insulin and HDL showed no difference. All blood lipids, insulin, and CRP in the PE group were reduced. There were significant differences between the groups in postpartum depression, sleep disorders, and perceived stress indices performed in the post-test, and the serotonin concentration in the PE group increased. Serotonin levels were significantly correlated with postpartum depression, body fat mass, and body fat rate. Pregnant women's online Pilates in this study was effective at reducing weight and depression in women after childbirth and should be used to promote women's mental health during COVID-19."

Mobile health (mHealth) can overcome barriers to care access, but poor patient engagement limits the effectiveness and implementation of these tools. Peers may facilitate patient engagement with mHealth. We designed a protocol for peers to support implementation of mobile mental health tools in primary care and tested the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of this approach. Thirty-nine patients across two Veterans Affairs sites who screened positive for depression during a primary care visit and were not currently in mental health treatment were enrolled. Participants were scheduled for four phone sessions with a peer over 8 weeks and introduced to five mobile apps for a range of transdiagnostic mental health issues (stress, low mood, sleep problems, anger, and trauma). Pre/post phone interviews using quantitative and qualitative approaches assessed participants' self-reported app use, satisfaction with the intervention, symptom change (stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia), and progress with personal health goals. On average, patients reported using 3.04 apps (SD = 1.46). Per the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, global satisfaction with the intervention was high (M = 25.71 out of 32, SD = 3.95). Pre to post participants reported significant improvements in their level of stress, based on a quantitative measure (p = .008), and 87% reported progress on at least one personal health goal. Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of peer-supported mobile mental health for veterans in primary care. A randomized controlled trial of an adaptive version of this intervention is recommended. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."

Considerable research has examined the clinical outcomes of overall engagement with mental health apps (eg, frequency and duration of app use). However, few studies have examined how specific app use behaviors can drive change in outcomes. Understanding the clinical outcomes of more nuanced app use could inform the design of mental health apps that are more clinically effective to users.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to classify user behaviors in a suite of mental health apps and examine how different types of app use are related to depression and anxiety outcomes.

Each specific behavior had varied effects on outcomes. Participants who engaged in self-tracking experienced reduced depression symptoms, and those who engaged with learning and goal setting at a moderate level (ie, not too much or not too little) also had an improvement in depression. Notably, the combination of these 3 types of behaviors, what we termed \"clinically meaningful use,\" accounted for roughly the same amount of variance as explained by the overall intensity of app use (ie, total number of app use sessions).

The participants for this study were recruited from the participants of the prior Diabetes-Depression Care-management Adoption Trial (DCAT). Depression was screened by using the 2-item and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-8, respectively). Anxiety was screened by using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), and functional disability was assessed by using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Participants chose to take up the assessment in English or Spanish. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were evaluated by using Cronbach alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Concordance was evaluated by using an ICC, a kappa statistic, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. A regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between the participant characteristics and the differences in the scores between the SMS text messaging and INTW assessment modes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 206 participants (average age 57.1 [SD 9.18] years; females: 119/206, 57.8%) were enrolled. All measurements except the SMS text messaging-assessed PHQ-2 showed Cronbach alpha values ≥.70, indicating acceptable to good internal consistency.

The concordance of the shorter PHQ-2, GAD-2, and SDS scales was poor to fair. The regression analysis revealed that a higher level of personal depression stigma was associated with reporting higher SMS text messaging-assessed PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores than the INTW-assessed scores.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Even though 1 in 5 Americans experience some form of mental illness each year, 80% have been shown to discontinue psychotherapy prematurely. The traditional psychotherapy service delivery model, consisting of isolated clinical sessions, lacks the ability to keep patients engaged outside clinical sessions. Newer digital mental health platforms can address the clinical need for a robust tool that tracks mental well-being and improves engagement in patients with depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The primary goals of this feasibility study were to (1) assess compliance among providers and their patients with a digital mental health platform protocol, and (2) examine the usability and fidelity of a mobile app through structured participant feedback.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A sample of 30 participants was recruited for a 5-week study from a community-based mental health clinic in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Inclusion criteria were: aged 18 years or older, having access to a smartphone, and having at least mild-to-moderate depression and/or anxiety as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Eligible participants were randomized into one of two study arms: (1) the intervention arm or (2) the waitlist control arm. Participants in the intervention arm were asked to download the Rose app and were prompted to complete clinical assessments (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) every other week, daily mood and anxiety Likert scales, and daily journal entries. The participants in the waitlist arm served as controls for the study and completed the clinical assessments only. Both arms engaged in weekly psychotherapy sessions, with participant in-app input informing the psychotherapy process of the intervention arm, while those in the waitlist control arm continued their standard care. Outcomes of interest included adherence to completion of in-app assessments and usability of the Rose mobile app assessed through the modified Mobile Application Rating Scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Over the study period, a sample of 30 participants used the Rose app 2834 times to complete clinical assessments. On average, 70% (21; 95% CI 61.14%-77.41%) of participants completed mood and anxiety daily check-ins and journal entries 5 days per week. Nearly all participants (29/30, 97%) completed all PHQ-9 and GAD-7 in-app scales during the study. Subjective impressions showed that 73% (22/30) of participants found the mobile app to be engaging and in line with their needs, and approximately 70% (21/30) of participants reported the app functionality and quality of information to be excellent. Additionally, more than two-thirds of the participants felt that their knowledge and awareness of depression and anxiety management improved through using the app.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Steady compliance and high app ratings showcase the utility of the Rose mobile mental health app in augmenting the psychotherapy process for patients with mood disorders and improving mental health knowledge.

The full intent-to-treat (ITT) sample consisted of 133 individuals, aged 18-65. An exploratory sub-sample of interest was those individuals who presented with moderately severe to severe depression at study entry (baseline PHQ-8 score ≥15; N = 28). Cue is a novel digital intervention platform that capitalizes on the smartphone's ability to continuously monitor depression-relevant behavior patterns and use each patient's behavioral data to provide timely, personalized \"micro-interventions,\" making this the first example of a precision digital intervention of which we are aware. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Cue plus care-as-usual or digital monitoring only plus care as usual. Within the full study and depressed-at-entry samples, we fit a mixed effects model to test for group differences in the slope of depressive symptoms over 16 weeks. To account for the non-linear trajectory with more flexibility, we also fit a mixed effects model considering week as a categorical variable and used the resulting estimates to test the group difference in PHQ change from baseline to 16 weeks. In the full sample, the group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 was negligible (Cohen's d = -0.10); however, the Cue group demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.040). In the depressed-at-entry sample, we found evidence for benefit of Cue. The group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 (Cohen's d = -0.72) indicated a meaningfully more rapid rate of improvement in the intervention group than in the control group. The Cue group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PHQ-8 from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.009). We are encouraged by the size of the intervention effect in those who were acutely ill at baseline, and by the finding that across all participants, 80% of whom were receiving pharmacotherapy, we observed significant benefit of Cue at 16 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that a social rhythm-focused digital intervention platform may represent a useful and accessible adjunct to antidepressant treatment (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03152864?term=ellen+frank&draw=2&rank=3)."

            "abstract": "Smartphone-based devices are increasingly recognized to assess disease symptoms in daily life (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, EMA). Despite this development in digital psychiatry, clinical trials are mainly based on point assessments of psychopathology. This study investigated expectable increases in statistical power by intense assessment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A simulation study, based on three scenarios and several empirical data sets, estimated power gains of two- or fivefold pre-post-assessment. For each condition, data sets of various effect sizes were generated, and AN(C)OVAs were applied to the sample of interest (N = 50-N = 200). Power increases ranged from 6% to 92%, with higher gains in more underpowered scenarios and with higher number of repeated assessments. ANCOVA profited from a more precise estimation of the baseline covariate, resulting in additional gains in statistical power. Fivefold pre-post EMA resulted in highest absolute statistical power and clearly outperformed traditional questionnaire assessments. For example, ANCOVA of automatized PHQ-9 questionnaire data resulted in absolute power of 55 (for N = 200 and d = 0.3). Fivefold EMA, however, resulted in power of 88.9. Non-parametric and multi-level analyses resulted in comparable outcomes. Besides providing psychological treatment, digital mental health can help optimizing sensitivity in RCT-based research. Intense assessment appears advisable whenever psychopathology needs to be assessed with high precision at pre- and post-assessment (e.g. small sample sizes, small treatment effects, or when applying optimization problems like machine learning). First empiric studies are promising, but more evidence is needed. Simulations for various effects and a short guide for popular power software are provided for study planning."

Individuals in green professions (agriculturists, horticulturists, foresters) show increased prevalence of chronic pain and other risk factors for mental disorders. Available healthcare services in rural areas are limited. Acceptance towards face-to-face therapy is low. Internet and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) might be a promising alternative for this population and may enable effective treatment of chronic pain. The present study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an ACT-based IMI for chronic pain in green professions in comparison with enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+).\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      A two-armed pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Two hundred eighty-six participants will be randomised and allocated to either an intervention or TAU+ group. Entrepreneurs in green professions, collaborating spouses, family members and pensioners with chronic pain are eligible for inclusion. The intervention group receives an internet-based intervention based on ACT (7 modules, over 7 weeks) guided by a trained e-coach to support adherence (eg, by positive reinforcement). Primary outcome is pain interference (Multidimensional Pain Interference scale; MPI) at 9 weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes are depression severity (Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomology; QIDS-SR16), incidence of major depressive disorder, quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life; AQoL-8D) and possible side effects associated with the treatment (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy; INEP). Psychological flexibility (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Committed Action Questionnaire, Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire) will be evaluated as a potential mediator of the treatment effect. Furthermore, mediation, moderation and health-economic analyses from a societal perspective will be performed. Outcomes will be measured using online self-report questionnaires at baseline, 9-week, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month and 36-month follow-ups.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Ulm, Germany (file no. 453/17-FSt/Sta; 22 February 2018).

On average, the combination therapy showed significant superiority over both monotherapies in terms of efficacy and acceptability, while the latter 2 treatments showed essentially similar results. Baseline depression, anxiety, prior pharmacotherapy, age, and depression subtypes moderated their relative efficacy, which indicated that for certain subgroups of patients either drug therapy or CBASP alone was a recommendable treatment option that is less costly, may have fewer adverse effects and match an individual patient's preferences.

Overall, the percentage of participants adhering to interventions ranged from 28-100% with a mean of 83%.

            "abstract": "This narrative review of the literature provides a summary and discussion of 25 years of research into the complex links between depression and diabetes. Systematic reviews have shown that depression occurs more frequently in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. Currently, it remains unclear whether depression is also more common in people with impaired glucose metabolism or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. More prospective epidemiological research into the course of depression and an exploration of mechanisms in individuals with diabetes are needed. Depression in diabetes is associated with less optimal self-care behaviours, suboptimal glycaemic control, impaired quality of life, incident micro- and macrovascular diseases, and elevated mortality rates. Randomized controlled trails concluded that depression in diabetes can be treated with antidepressant medication, cognitive-behavioural therapy (individual, group-based or web-based), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and stepped care. Although big strides forward have been made in the past 25 years, scientific evidence about depression in diabetes remains incomplete. Future studies should investigate mechanisms that link both conditions and test new diabetes-specific web- or app-based interventions for depression in diabetes. It is important to determine whether treatment or prevention of depression prevents future diabetes complications and lowers mortality rates."

Secondary outcome measures include quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey); depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales); self-motivation; self-determination; self-efficacy; and the level of satisfaction with the knee surgery and care delivery. The study will also collect quantitative usage data related to all components (app, activity tracker, and Web portal) of the TKR platform and qualitative data on the perceptions of the platform as a tool for patients, carers, and clinicians. Finally, an economic evaluation of the impact of the platform will be conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Development of the TKR platform has been completed and deployed for trial.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Medical school typically presents students with a combination of academic and personal stressors that may lead to substandard mental health wellbeing. Meditation practices such as mindfulness facilitate a greater awareness of one's thoughts and feelings, thereby decreasing emotional reactivity. The use of mindfulness-based interventions delivered online has considerable potential in fostering self-care and helping medical students to handle mental health challenges. We examined the available evidence on the use of online mindfulness interventions in order to determine whether they are feasible and effective for improving medical students' mental health.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systematic review guided by PRISMA guidelines and utilised the following databases: ProQuest, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, IEEE Explore, Cochrane, and CINAHL. The key search terms used include mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, online, web, virtual, internet cyber, app, medical students, residency students, and residents. English-language articles published in the last ten years that described online interventions for medical students or residents were included in the review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Two studies describing the impact of online mindfulness interventions on medical students' mental health were identified. Research in this domain is nascent; available qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests benefits in self-compassion, perceived stress, cognitive skill use, mindfulness, creating coping mechanisms, and greater awareness of emotions and feelings. There was no evidence of the effectiveness of online mindfulness interventions on depression, anxiety and burnout. There was, however, general low program usage and participation tended to diminish near the conclusion of the interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence found in the systematic review exhibits the potential for online mindfulness interventions to be effective in addressing some mental health challenges of medical students. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of online mindfulness interventions for burnout, depression, and anxiety. Longitudinal studies with randomised controlled trials are required to generate stronger and robust evidence."

Mobile devices offer a potentially powerful medium to deliver evidence-based interventions with greater specificity to the individual when the intervention is needed. The recent proliferation of publicly available mobile apps designed for suicide prevention underlines the need for robust evidence to promote safe practice.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This review aimed to examine the effectiveness of currently available mobile health (mHealth) technology tools in reducing suicide-specific outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The following databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and relevant sources of gray literature. All published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pseudo-RCTs, and pre-post observational studies that evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth technology in suicide prevention delivered via mobile computing and communication technology were included. Studies were included if they measured at least one suicide outcome variable (ie, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, and suicidal behavior). A total of 2 review authors independently extracted data and assessed study suitability, in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool, on July 31, 2018. Owing to the heterogeneity of outcomes found across studies, results were not amenable for pooled synthesis, and a meta-analysis was not performed. A narrative synthesis of the available research is presented here.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 7 studies met criteria for inclusion . Four published articles that reported on the effectiveness of the following mobile phone apps were included: iBobbly, Virtual Hope Box, BlueIce, and Therapeutic Evaluative Conditioning. Results demonstrated some positive impacts for individuals at elevated risk of suicide or self-harm, including reductions in depression, psychological distress, and self-harm and increases in coping self-efficacy. None of the apps evaluated demonstrated the ability to significantly decrease suicidal ideation compared with a control condition. In addition, 3 unpublished and recently completed trials also met criteria for inclusion in the review.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of stand-alone mHealth technology-based interventions in suicide prevention. The small number of studies reported in this review tentatively indicate that such tools may have a positive impact on suicide-specific outcomes. Future mHealth intervention evaluations would benefit from addressing the following 3 main methodological limitations : (1) heterogeneity of outcomes: a lack of standardized measurement of suicide outcomes across studies; (2) ecological validity: the tendency to exclude potential participants because of the elevated suicide risk may reduce generalizability within clinical settings; and (3) app regulation and definition: the lack of a standardized classification system for mHealth intervention type points to the need for better definition of the scope of such technologies to promote safe practice.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      PROSPERO CRD42017072899; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=72899.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      RR2-10.2196/resprot.8635."

Telepsychology interventions among individuals with SCI are tasked to maintain participant privacy, provide assistive technology and/or engage caregivers to minimize mobility limitations, and manage risk remotely. Challenges encountered include recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self-harm.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015).

Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy (CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality.There was a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow-up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594; GRADE: low quality).For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow-up (MD -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k = 3; N = 292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT-oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow-up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k = 1; N =18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH.Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact-based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 4; N = 3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone-based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality).None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem-solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home-based problem-solving therapy, long-term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment.We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive."

            "abstract": "Nearly 20% of women in the United States experience clinically significant depressive symptoms during pregnancy or the postpartum period. These women may benefit from easily accessible, nonpharmacologic, and inexpensive self-management approaches, such as via internet and mobile-based interventions, to prevent development of symptoms and/or intervene with current symptoms. This paper summarizes the research protocol of a nationally-funded large-scale randomized controlled study to evaluate \"Mamma Mia,\" a self-guided program with 44 modules that women use throughout pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The program contains a novel combination of components designed to enable women to enhance self-efficacy, emotional self-regulation, and perceived social support. The overall goal of this three-arm longitudinal randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of this self-management approach in diverse women in the U.S. (n = 1950). Enrolled pregnant women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) \"Mamma Mia\" alone, which is self-guided; (2) \"Mamma Mia Plus\" in which participants engage in the \"Mamma Mia\" modules plus receive brief guided support from a registered nurse; or (3) usual prenatal/postpartum care. The first specific aim is to evaluate effects by group on the primary outcome of interest, depressive symptoms, over time. The second aim is to evaluate effects by group on subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress. Using a conceptual framework based upon Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, the third aim is to evaluate possible mediators (self-efficacy, emotion self-regulation, perceived support) and possible moderators (e.g., race/ethnicity, type of healthcare clinician) of this self-management approach."

Interventions to improve MHL have used traditional media (eg, community talks, print media) and new platforms (eg, the Internet). Evaluations of interventions using conventional media show improvements in MHL improve community recognition of mental illness as well as knowledge, attitude, and intended behaviors toward people having mental illness. However, the potential of new media, such as the Internet, to enhance MHL has yet to be systematically evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Study aims were twofold: (1) To systematically appraise the efficacy of Web-based interventions in improving MHL.

Seven studies were conducted in Australia. A variety of Web-based interventions were identified ranging from linear, static websites to highly interactive interventions such as social media games. Some Web-based interventions were specifically designed for people living with mental illness whereas others were applicable to the general population. Interventions were more likely to be successful if they included \"active ingredients\" such as a structured program, were tailored to specific populations, delivered evidenced-based content, and promoted interactivity and experiential learning.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Web-based interventions targeting MHL are more likely to be successful if they include active ingredients. Improvements in MHL see concomitant improvements in health outcomes, especially for individuals with mild to moderate depression. The most promising interventions suited to this cohort appear to be MoodGYM and BluePages, 2 interventions from Australia. However, the relationship between MHL and formal and informal help seeking is less clear; self-stigma appears to be an important mediator with results showing that despite improvements in MHL and community attitudes to mental illness, individuals with mental illness still seek help at relatively low rates. Overall, the Internet is a viable method to improve MHL. Future studies could explore how new technology interfaces (eg, mobile phones vs computers) can help improve MHL, mental health outcomes, and reduce stigma."

Median failure time was 17 days into the run-in period. In univariate analyses, nonrandomized participants were younger, had lower income, were less likely to drive regularly, were less likely to have used a pedometer prior to the study, were generally less healthy, had less self-efficacy for physical activity, and reported more depressive symptoms than randomized participants. In multivariate competing risks models, not driving regularly in the past month and not having used a pedometer prior to the study were significantly associated with failure to be randomized (P=.04 and .006, respectively), controlling for age, race/ethnicity, education, shift work, and use of a study-provided mobile phone.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Regular driving and past pedometer use were associated with reduced dropout during the prerandomization run-in period.

Methods: This randomized controlled trial included women 40−65 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of 23 kg/m2 or more living in Daejeon City. The virtual reality environment was set up by attaching an IoT sensor to an indoor bicycle and linking it with a smartphone, enabling exercise in an immersive virtual reality through a head-mounted display. Results: In the virtual reality exercise group, the BMI was significantly decreased after the 8-week intervention compared with the baseline value (F = 59.491, p < 0.001). The depression scores were significantly different among the three groups, with the intervention effect being more significant in the virtual reality exercise group than in the indoor bicycle exercise and control groups (F = 3.462, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels of exercise fun (F = 12.373, p < 0.001) and exercise immersion (F = 14.629, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the virtual reality exercise group than in the indoor bicycle exercise and control groups.

Although the initial design was to have a 3-armed trial with 2 JITAI conditions (a JITAI and a narrative JITAI condition), we later opted to collapse those 2 conditions into 1 JITAI condition because of the low number of participants. All participants were recruited and participated through their smartphones, receiving 5 SMS text message reminders on each of the 35 days to self-report their rumination-related symptoms (eg, rumination episodes and duration). In the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, they also received treatment materials. The first 7 days provided a rumination baseline, and the last 7 days provided a postintervention rumination value. In total, 42% (25/59) of volunteers were eligible and provided their phone numbers, 20% (5/25) of whom never replied to the SMS text message reminding them to start the RCT. A total of 90% (18/20) of volunteers completed it (ie, finishing, as prespecified, 80% of the questionnaires and training tasks) and, therefore, were included in the analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Using independent 2-tailed t tests with bootstrapping, results showed that participants in the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, compared with those in the control condition, reported a greater reduction in counts of rumination episodes (mean -25.28, SD 14.50 vs mean 1.44, SD 4.12, P<.001) and greater reduced average time (minutes) spent in rumination (mean -21.53, SD 17.6 vs mean 1.47, SD 1.5; P=.04).

Digital mental health interventions can address the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries, but the effectiveness in these countries is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the effectiveness of a digital intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among people with diabetes and/or hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      Participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) who were being treated for hypertension and/or diabetes were enrolled in a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 sites in São Paulo, Brazil (N=880; from September 2016 to September 2017; final follow-up, April 2018), and in an individual-level RCT at 7 sites in Lima, Peru (N=432; from January 2017 to September 2017; final follow-up, March 2018).\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      An 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 215 participants in Lima).\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among 880 patients cluster randomized in Brazil (mean age, 56.0 years; 761 [86.5%] women) and 432 patients individually randomized in Peru (mean age, 59.7 years; 352 [81.5%] women), 807 (91.7%) in Brazil and 426 (98.6%) in Peru completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. The proportion of participants in São Paulo with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 40.7% (159/391 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 28.6% (114/399 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 12.1 percentage points [95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2]; P = .001). In Lima, the proportion of participants with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 52.7% (108/205 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 34.1% (70/205 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 18.6 percentage points [95% CI, 9.1 to 28.0]; adjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2]; P < .001).

            "title": "Targeting subjective engagement in experimental therapeutics for digital mental health interventions.",
            "abstract": "Engagement is a multifaceted construct and a likely mechanism by which digital interventions achieve clinical improvements. To date, clinical research on digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) has overwhelmingly defined engagement and assessed its association with clinical outcomes through the objective/behavioral metrics of use of or interactions with a DMHI, such as number of log-ins or time spent using the technology. However, engagement also entails users' subjective experience. Research is largely lacking that tests the relationship between subjective metrics of engagement and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to present a proof-of-concept exploratory evaluation of the association between subjective engagement measures of a mobile DMHI with changes in depression and anxiety. Adult primary care patients (N = 146) who screened positive for depression or anxiety were randomized to receive a DMHI, IntelliCare, immediately or following an 8-week waitlist. Subjective engagement was measured via the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) Questionnaire. Across both conditions, results showed that individuals who perceived a mobile intervention as more useful, easy to use and learn, and satisfying had greater improvements in depression and anxiety over eight weeks. Findings support our proposed experimental therapeutics framework that hypothesizes objective/behavioral and subjective engagement metrics as mechanisms that lead to changes in clinical outcomes, as well as support directing intervention design efforts for DMHIs to target the user experience."

Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608).

In tertiary care, a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet provides significant improvement. Yet, dietary treatment remains to be explored in primary care.

A structural equation modeling framework was utilized to test resilience as a mediator of insomnia and depression. Risk for insomnia and depression was also tested in the model, operationalized as a latent factor with sleep reactivity, stress, and rumination as indicators (aligned with the 3-P model).

Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro-app (\"kokoro\" means \"mind\" in Japanese), included sessions on self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters.

The prompt identification of this disorder, and the provision of treatment, may help to reduce the likelihood of post-partum depression, prevent severe forms of the disease, and reduce its intergenerational impact. Despite women's repeated encounters with health services throughout their antenatal care, depression often goes undiagnosed. This is one area where mobile health could prove useful. We will assess the feasibility of using tablets to incorporate depression screening into antenatal pathways.

We will assess the impact of survey layout on the quality of the responses given to these screening scales using a parallel, randomised controlled study design. We will calculate the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value and the false omission rate of the Whooley questions in comparison with the EPDS. We will calculate differences in data equivalence, time needed to complete the surveys, break-off rates, data completeness and requests for help between the 2 experimental groups: using all questions in one screen and navigation by vertical scrolling, or a single question per screen and navigation by multiple pages.\n    \n\n\n          Ethics and dissemination:\n        \n      \n      This study has been approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee South East Coast--Surrey.

This is a secondary data analysis, using data collected in the screening of participants to be included in the PROACTIVE cluster randomized trial. Individuals aged ≥ 60 years, registered in primary care clinics in Guarulhos, were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms according to the PHQ-9, mobile phone ownership, and use of WhatsApp. We performed multiple logistic regression models to investigate characteristics of the potential users of digital interventions. Of 3,356 older adults screened for depression, 45.7% said they use WhatsApp to receive/send messages. In the subsample that presented depressive symptomatology (n = 1,020), 41.9% stated using WhatsApp. Younger older adults and those with better socioeconomic status used more WhatsApp and were more likely to own a mobile phone. Participants with higher levels of symptoms of depression were less likely to use WhatsApp. Gender, age, schooling level, income, and depressive symptomatology are variables associated with the possession of a cell phone and with the use of WhatsApp by the older adults of the sample. These findings can help to implement digital health programs better suited to disadvantaged populations in Brazil and other low- and middle-income countries through mental telehealth interventions using WhatsApp and mobile health services to the older people."

            "abstract": "DHA is a key nutritional n-3 PUFA and needs to be supplied by the human diet. DHA is found in significant amounts in the retinal and neuronal cell membranes due to its high fluidity. Indeed, DHA is selectively concentrated in the synaptic and retinal membranes. DHA is deemed to display anti-inflammatory properties and to reduce the risk of CVD. Consumption of larger amounts of DHA appears to reduce the risk of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and mood disorders. Conversely, it has been shown that loss of DHA from the nerve cell membrane leads to dysfunction of the central nervous system in the form of anxiety, irritability, susceptibility to stress, dyslexia, impaired memory and cognitive functions, and extended reaction times. DHA plays an important role in ensuring a healthy ageing, by thwarting macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain disorders at the same time as enhancing memory and strengthening neuroprotection in general. A reduced level of DHA is associated with cognitive decline during ageing. Different mechanisms for this fundamental DHA role have been put forward. Namely, neuroprotectin D1, a DHA derivative, may support brain cell survival and repair through neurotrophic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory signalling. Many of the effects of DHA on the neurological system may be related to signalling connections, thus leading to the study of the related signalolipidomics. Therefore, the present review will focus on the influence of DHA deficiency upon ageing, with specific emphasis upon neurological disorders related to cognitive function and mental health."

A two-armed randomized controlled trial design was used, with two groups receiving the 6-week gratitude intervention app either immediately (intervention group, n = 424) or after 6 weeks (waiting list control group, n = 425). Assessments took place online at baseline (T0), six weeks later (T1) and at 12 weeks (T2), measuring outcomes (i.e., mental well-being, anxiety, depression, stress), and potential explanatory variables (i.e., gratitude, positive reframing, rumination). Linear mixed models analyses showed that when controlled for baseline measures, the intervention group scored better on all outcome measures compared to the control group at T1 (d = .24-.49). These effects were maintained at T2. The control group scored equally well on all outcome measures at T2 after following the intervention. Effects of the intervention on well-being were partially explained by gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination, and finishing a greater number of modules was weakly related to better outcomes. The intervention was generally appealing, with some room for improvement. The results suggest that a mobile gratitude intervention app is a satisfactory and effective way to improve the mental health of the general population during the difficult times of a pandemic."

However, its effectiveness remains unclear. We aimed to synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of TPIs in improving depressive symptoms of PLWHA using a meta-analytic approach. Seven databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the inception until August 14, 2018. Random-effects meta-analysis was adopted to assess effect size. Cochran's Q test and I2 were used to investigate the problem of heterogeneity. Sensitivity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed.

Random-effects meta-regression showed that publication year was a significant moderator (p = 0.013), whereby the latest trials had larger effect size in reducing the depressive symptoms than earlier trials. Our review suggested a possible future approach of utilising TPIs by means of mobile applications and internet-based interventions for PLWHA to reduce their depressive symptoms.

To facilitate the dissemination of this evidence-based treatment, we developed a technology-enhanced CBT intervention for the treatment of adolescent depression consisting of (1) online therapist training (2) in-session use of tablets for teaching clients CBT concepts and skills, and (3) text messaging for between session homework reminders and self-monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighteen licensed clinicians (social workers n = 7, psychologists n = 9) were randomized to have their patients receive either the intervention (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Each clinician treated four adolescents for 12 weeks. Clinicians in the CBT arm completed an online tutorial on CBT treatment of adolescent depression, then received an iPad with access to patient education materials for teaching CBT concepts to patients during sessions. Individualized text messages were integrated into treatment for homework reminders, support, and outcomes measurement. Outcome measures included a 49-item multiple choice test for tutorial effectiveness; the system usability scale (SUS) for user satisfaction; quick inventory of depressive symptomatology-adolescent version (QIDS-A-Pat); and clinician and patient ratings on the therapeutic alliance scale for adolescents (TASA).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A significant increase in knowledge of CBT concepts was found after completing the tutorial, t(8) = 7.02, p < 0.001. Clinician and patient ratings of user satisfaction were high for both the iPad teaching tools, and the text messaging. Ninety-five percent of teens said reviewing their text messages with their therapist was helpful, and all said they would use text messaging in treatment again. Ratings of the therapeutic alliance were higher in the CBT arm t(131) = 4.03, p = 0.001. A significant reduction in depression was found in both groups [t(34) = 8.453, p < 0.001 and t(29) = 6.67, p < 0.001 for CBT and TAU, respectively). Clinical ratings of improvement were greater on all outcome measures for the CBT arm; however, none reached statistical significance.

Only a minority of the college students concerned get professional help, a problem that might be improvable by internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). However, adherence of IMIs is a concern. While guidance might be a solution, it is resource-intensive, derailing potential implementation on population level. The first aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the IMI StudiCare Mindfulness (StudiCare-M) for college students with \"on demand\" and no guidance. The second aim is to examine potential moderators and mediators, contributing to the questions of \"how\" and \"for whom\" such interventions work.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this three-armed randomized controlled trial, both an unguided and \"guidance on demand\" (GoD) condition of StudiCare-M are compared to a waitlist control group.

One of the nonpharmacological treatments used for reducing anxiety is serious games, which are games that have a purpose other than entertainment. The effectiveness of serious games in alleviating anxiety has been investigated by several systematic reviews; however, they were limited by design and methodological weaknesses.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of serious games in alleviating anxiety by summarizing the results of previous studies and providing an up-to-date review.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The following seven databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We also conducted backward and forward reference list checking for the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently carried out the study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality of evidence appraisal. We used a narrative and statistical approach, as appropriate, to synthesize the results of the included studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 935 citations retrieved, 33 studies were included in this review. Of these, 22 RCTs were eventually included in the meta-analysis. Very low-quality evidence from 9 RCTs and 5 RCTs showed no statistically significant effect of exergames (games entailing physical exercises) on anxiety levels when compared with conventional exercises (P=.70) and no intervention (P=.27), respectively. Although 6 RCTs demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy games on anxiety levels when compared with no intervention (P=.01), the quality of the evidence reported was low. Similarly, low-quality evidence from 3 RCTs showed a statistically and clinically significant effect of biofeedback games on anxiety levels when compared with conventional video games (P=.03).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review shows that exergames can be as effective as conventional exercises in alleviating anxiety; computerized cognitive behavioral therapy games and exergames can be more effective than no intervention, and biofeedback games can be more effective than conventional video games. However, our findings remain inconclusive, mainly because there was a high risk of bias in the individual studies included, the quality of meta-analyzed evidence was low, few studies were included in some meta-analyses, patients without anxiety were recruited in most studies, and purpose-shifted serious games were used in most studies. Therefore, serious games should be considered complementary to existing interventions. Researchers should use serious games that are designed specifically to alleviate depression, deliver other therapeutic modalities, and recruit a diverse population of patients with anxiety."

Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline, post-trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks, WL participants received PRIME, resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME, participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post-trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post-trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure).

            "abstract": "Approximately 45% of young cancer survivors (18-40 years) are cigarette smokers. Continued smoking after cancer diagnosis leads to lower survival rates. A major logistical problem with smoking cessation efforts in this group is their geographic dispersion which makes them hard to reach. In addition, depression is a major predictor of smoking relapse and its rates are roughly twice as high in cancer survivors as the general population. Smartphone applications (apps) show promise in terms of efficacy, dissemination, and improving access to treatment. Mindfulness training (defined as maintaining attention on one's immediate experience and cultivating an attitude of acceptance toward this experience) is effective in improving smoking cessation outcomes by reducing psychological stress and controlling craving. Given that smartphone apps can address the issues of mobility and remote access, and mindfulness can address the high depression rate among cancer survivors, validating the feasibility and efficacy of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation intervention app in young cancer survivors is a high priority. Thus, the aims of the current study are: (1) test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the mindfulness-based smoking cessation app versus in-person mindfulness or usual care in a 3-arm pilot randomized clinical trial among young cancer survivors (n = 60; 18-40 years); and 2) conduct semi-structured exit interviews with participants in the two mindfulness groups to fine-tune the two active interventions based on feedback from participants.

Kenya ranks among countries with the highest number of neonatal deaths, at 20 per 1000 live births. Improved identification and management of neonates with potentially life-threatening illness is critical to meet the WHO's target of ≤12 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births by 2035. We developed an interactive (two-way) short messaging service (SMS) communication intervention, Mobile Solutions for Neonatal Health (Mobile women's and children's health (WACh) NEO), focused on the perinatal period. Mobile WACh NEO sends automated tailored SMS messages to mothers during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks post partum. Messages employ the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills framework to promote (1) maternal implementation of essential newborn care (ENC, including early, exclusive breast feeding, cord care and thermal care), (2) maternal identification of neonatal danger signs and care-seeking, and (3) maternal social support and self-efficacy. Participants can also send SMS to the study nurse, enabling on-demand remote support.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We describe a two-arm unblinded randomised controlled trial of the Mobile WACh NEO intervention.

Intervention: The EMPOWER intervention spans universal, secondary and tertiary prevention and consists of an eHealth platform delivered via a website and a smartphone app designed to guide employees throughout different modules according to their specific profiles. Design: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial will be implemented in four countries (Finland, Poland, Spain and UK) with employees from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and public agencies. Companies will be randomly allocated in one of three groups with different times at which the intervention is implemented. The intervention will last 7 weeks. Employees will answer several questionnaires at baseline, pre- and post-intervention and follow-up. Outcome measures: The main outcome is presenteeism. Secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress levels, wellbeing and absenteeism. Analyses will be conducted at the individual level using the intention-to-treat approach and mixed models. Additional analyses will evaluate the intervention effects according to gender, country or type of company.

The provision of digital health interventions that can support dietary change in those with depression has important benefits with respect to reach, accessibility convenience and cost. The My Food & Mood study used single arm cohort design to test the feasibility of such an intervention. Participants with current depressive symptoms were recruited and enrolled online to use the My Food & Mood m-Health (smartphone delivered) program for 8 weeks. Participants completed depression (PHQ-8) and dietary questionnaires (MEDAS) at baseline, week 4 and week 8. Metrics of use and intensity of use engagement measures were calculated from system logs and data entries. There was a significant change in both MEDAS score (t = 8.147, df = 44, p < 0.001) and PHQ-8 score (t = -7.199, df = 44, p < 0.001) throughout the study.

Currently, all participants have been recruited, and all are in the final year of the trial.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Theory-driven, evidence-based strategies for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary intake can be embedded in an intervention using social and mobile technologies to promote healthy weight-related behaviors in young adults."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the `app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct therapy for adolescents with IGD.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinical Trial Registration Center of Iran (IRCT) IRCT20181226042140N1 .

In total, 5 electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify relevant studies published until July 6, 2021. A total of 2 reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality appraisals. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. For the meta-analysis, the effect size was calculated as the standardized mean difference (SMD) by using a random effects model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 17 studies with 1280 older adults were included in the systematic review, and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Serious game interventions were classified into 3 types: physical activity (PA), cognitive function, and both PA and cognitive function. The meta-analysis demonstrated that serious games reduced depression in older adults (SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.29; P<.001). Serious games had a more significant effect size in community or home settings (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.26; P<.001) than in hospital settings (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.08; P=.02); however, the difference between groups was not significant. Among the types of games, games for PA (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.25; P<.001) and games for both (SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.17; P=.01) had a significant effect on reducing depression in older adults.

The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group).

Attrition rates from adolescent mobile health (mHealth) interventions for treating mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are an issue with a high degree of variation. Attrition in mHealth interventions targeting adolescent populations is frequently presented in a two-point fashion, from initiation of the intervention to the end of treatment, lacking more time-specific information on usage and times of attrition. Self-efficacy could provide an avenue to lower attrition rates, although a better understanding of the relationship between mental health factors and time-specific attrition rates is needed.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aims of this study were to obtain time-specific attrition rates among adolescents in an mHealth intervention, and to describe the intervention's usage and feasibility in relation to adolescent self-efficacy levels, and emotional and physical health.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A single-center randomized controlled public school pilot trial was undertaken with 41 adolescents. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks, while in-app activity and attrition rates were continually assessed throughout the intervention period. The primary outcome was attrition based on time and type of in-app health behavior usage, and feasibility of the mHealth app. Secondary outcome measures were self-efficacy levels, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as standardized BMI and sleep. Analyses of group mean variances with adjusted α levels through Bonferroni corrections were used to assess main outcome effects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The attrition from initiation of the intervention to 6-week follow up was 35%. Attrition started in the third week of the intervention and was related to daily time of app usage (Rt=0.43, P<.001). The number of average weekly in-app health exercises completed decreased significantly from the first week of the intervention (mean 55.25, SD 10.96) to the next week (mean 13.63, SD 2.94). However, usage increased by 22% between week 2 and the last week of the intervention (mean 16.69, SD 8.37). Usability measures revealed satisfactory scores (mean 78.09, SD 9.82) without gender differences (P=.85). Self-reported daily physical activity increased by 19.61% in the intervention group but dropped by 26.21% among controls. Self-efficacy levels increased by 8.23% in the invention arm compared to a 3.03% decrease in the control group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usability of an mHealth intervention among adolescent participants. Indications were toward beneficial effects on physical and mental health that warrant further research.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic pain is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes such as increased severity of pain, reduced function (e.g. missing school), and low mood (e.g. high levels of depression and anxiety). Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. However, new and innovative technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies remotely, meaning barriers to access to treatment such as distance and cost can be removed or reduced. Therapies delivered with technological devices, such as the Internet, computer-based programmes, smartphone applications, or via the telephone, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting-list, treatment-as-usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) from inception to June 2014 for randomised controlled trials of remotely delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries for potential trials. A citation and reference search for all included studies was conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All included studies were randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via the Internet, smartphone device, computer-based programme, audiotapes, or over the phone in comparison to an active, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and face-to-face interaction. We excluded interventions solely delivered face-to-face between therapist and patient from this review. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with a primary chronic pain condition were the target of the interventions. Each comparator arm, at each extraction point had to include 10 or more participants.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      For the analyses, we combined all psychological therapies. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. Pain, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events were extracted as primary outcomes. We also extracted satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between 3 and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed all included studies for risk of bias.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight studies (N = 371) that delivered treatment remotely were identified from our search; five studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and two studies included mixed samples of children with headache and mixed (i.e. recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain) chronic pain conditions. The average age of children receiving treatment was 12.57 years.For headache pain conditions, we found one beneficial effect of remotely delivered psychological therapy. Headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.50, z = 3.62,p < 0.01, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2.88). For mixed pain conditions, we found only one beneficial effect: psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.61, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.25, z = 3.38, p < 0.01). No effects were found for reducing pain at follow-up in either analysis. For headache and mixed conditions, there were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analyses could be run. Only one analysis could be conducted for depression outcomes. We found no beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing depression post-treatment for headache conditions. Only one study presented data in children with mixed pain conditions for depressive outcomes and no data were available for either condition at follow-up. Only one study presented anxiety data post-treatment and no studies reported follow-up data, therefore no analyses could be run. Further, there were no data available for adverse events, meaning that we are unsure whether psychological therapies are harmful to children who receive them. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively.'Risk of bias' assessments were low or unclear. We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk for included studies. However, judgements made on performance and attrition biases were mostly unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Psychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet, confer benefit in reducing the intensity or severity of pain after treatment across conditions. There is considerable uncertainty around these estimates of effect and only eight studies with 371 children contribute to the conclusions. Future studies are likely to change the conclusions reported here. All included trials used either behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapies for children with chronic pain, therefore we cannot generalise our findings to other therapies. However, satisfaction with these treatments was generally positive. Larger trials are needed to increase our confidence in all conclusions regarding the efficacy of remotely delivered psychological therapies. Implications for practice and research are discussed."

The primary outcome was self-reported symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). Emotional self-efficacy and sleep disruption were also assessed at baseline, 6-week postintervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention period. Feedback obtained at the end of the study focused on user experience of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were significant decreases in symptoms of depression and sleep disruption from baseline to postintervention. Sleep disruption remained significantly lower at 4-week postintervention compared with baseline. The iCanThrive app was launched a median of 20.5 times over the intervention period. The median length of use was 2.1 min. Of the individuals who initiated the intervention, 87% (20/23) completed the 6-week intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study provides support for the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the iCanThrive intervention. Future work should validate the intervention in a larger randomized controlled study. It is important to develop scalable interventions that meet the psychosocial needs of different cancer populations. The modular structure of the iCanThrive app and phone coaching could impact a large population of survivors of women's cancer."

A major problem with respect to treatment is medication non-adherence. eHealth interventions are already widely used in the treatment of patients living with affective disorders. The aim of this systematic literature review is to obtain the current scientific evidence to eHealth as a tool to improve medication adherence in patients with affective disorders. A systematic search was performed across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PsycInfo. Studies in English and German published between 2007 and 2020 were included. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines and were performed with the CADIMA online tool. A total of 17 articles were included in this review. Eleven studies were randomized controlled trials, two were controlled clinical trials, and four had a pre-/post-design. Three different types of interventions could be identified: internet-based self-management programs (n=4), multi-faceted interventions addressing different dimensions of medication adherence (n=4), and single-faceted interventions (n=9) comprising four mobile interventions and five telehealth interventions. Eleven interventions addressed patients with (comorbid) depressions and six addressed patients with bipolar disorders. Six interventions showed a statistically significant positive effect on medication adherence. None of the studies showed a statistically significant negative effect. All interventions which had a statistically significant positive effect on medication adherence involved personal contacts between therapists and patients. All included eHealth interventions are at least as effective as control conditions and seems to be effective for patients with depression as well as with bipolar disorders. Personal contacts seem to improve the effectiveness of eHealth interventions. eHealth interventions are an effective way to improve medication adherence in patients with affective disorders. In rural or underserved regions, eHealth can supplement usual care interventions on medication adherence by expanding access. More analyses are needed in order to understand determinants for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions on medication adherence enhancement."

To evaluate PASI, in late 2002 the authors enrolled 1,283 Thai students aged 15-21 years in a randomized trial. Data collection used PASI, ACASI, self-administered questionnaire, and face-to-face interview in combination with drug-use urine testing. By use of reported levels of behaviors and agreement between self-reports of smoking and urine test results, PASI and ACASI (alpha = 0.05) were compared for noninferiority, and PASI and interview were compared for superiority (alpha = 0.05). Noninferiority of PASI was demonstrated by use of self-reports of the most sensitive areas of sexual behavior (e.g., oral sex, sexual intercourse, commercial sex, history of genital ulcers, pregnancy), as well as self-reports of less sensitive behaviors (e.g., alcohol use, dietary behaviors, symptoms of depression). Data generally showed noninferiority of PASI, ACASI, and self-administered questionnaires when compared with each other and superiority of PASI, ACASI, and self-administered questionnaires when compared with interviews. PASI agreements between self-reports of tobacco smoking and presence of nicotine metabolites in urine were noninferior to ACASI and superior to interviews. The establishment of PASI noninferiority and superiority using behavioral and biologic measures suggests that PASI is a scientifically acceptable alternative for collecting sensitive behavioral data."

Self-report outcome measures were depressive symptoms and anxiety measured pre- and post-intervention, and daily negative and positive mood, vitality, flourishing, and flourishing behaviors (curiosity, creativity, motivation) assessed nightly using a smartphone survey. Vitamin C and carotenoids were measured from blood samples pre- and post-intervention, and psychological expectancies about the benefits of FV were measured post-intervention to test as mediators of psychological change. Only participants in the FVI condition showed improvements to their psychological well-being with increases in vitality, flourishing, and motivation across the 14-days relative to the other groups. No changes were found for depressive symptoms, anxiety, or mood. Intervention benefits were not mediated by vitamin C, carotenoids, or psychological expectancies. We conclude that providing young adults with high-quality FV, rather than reminding them to eat more FV (with a voucher to purchase FV), resulted in significant short-term improvements to their psychological well-being.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Depression is underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary health care. When associated with chronic physical disorders, it worsens outcomes. There is a clear gap in the treatment of depression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where specialists and funds are scarce. Interventions supported by mobile health (mHealth) technologies may help to reduce this gap. Mobile phones are widely used in LMICs, offering potentially feasible and affordable alternatives for the management of depression among individuals with chronic disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to explore the potential effectiveness of an mHealth intervention to help people with depressive symptoms and comorbid hypertension or diabetes and explore the feasibility of conducting large randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Emotional Control (CONEMO) is a low-intensity psychoeducational 6-week intervention delivered via mobile phones and assisted by a nurse for reducing depressive symptoms among individuals with diabetes or hypertension. CONEMO was tested in 3 pilot studies, 1 in São Paulo, Brazil, and 2 in Lima, Peru. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at enrollment and at 6-week follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 3 pilot studies included a total of 66 people. Most participants were females aged between 41 and 60 years. There was a reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by PHQ-9 in all pilot studies. In total, 58% (38/66) of the participants reached treatment success rate (PHQ-9 <10), with 62% (13/21) from São Paulo, 62% (13/21) from the first Lima pilot, and 50% (12/24) from the second Lima pilot study.

In a pilot study we demonstrated that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the system's effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 55) or control (n = 55) group, and 105 (95.5%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9.1 ± 15.6 mmHg (SD; P < 0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.1 ± 2.3 mmHg (SE; P < 0.005). Furthermore, 51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of <130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of control subjects (P < 0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4.1 ± 3.76; exit, 5.2 ± 4.30; P = 0.014). This study demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with automated self-care support reduced the blood pressure of diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved hypertension control. Home blood pressure monitoring alone had no effect on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative psychological effects."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Unipolar and bipolar disorder combined account for nearly half of all morbidity and mortality due to mental and substance use disorders, and burden society with the highest health care costs of all psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among these, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent re-admission among patients discharged from hospital. The present RADMIS trials aim to investigate whether using a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system, including an integrated clinical feedback loop, reduces the rate and duration of re-admissions more than standard treatment in unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel-group design. Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder are invited to participate in each trial when discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of Denmark following an affective episode and randomized to either (1) a smartphone-based monitoring system including (a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians and (b) context-aware cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules (intervention group) or (2) standard treatment (control group) for a 6-month trial period. The trial started in May 2017. The outcomes are (1) number and duration of re-admissions (primary), (2) severity of depressive and manic (only for patients with bipolar disorder) symptoms; psychosocial functioning; number of affective episodes (secondary), and (3) perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction (tertiary).

A non-equivalent comparison group pretest-posttest design was used. Participants were randomized into the experimental (n = 26) and control (n = 30) groups. The experimental group used an application developed for workers for four weeks. The results indicated that stress, emotional labor, self-efficacy, and well-being were significantly different in the experimental group, but the control group's average scores did not change significantly. On average, the Perceived Stress Scale scores decreased by 1.5 points (p = 0.035) and the Korean Occupational Stress Scale scores decreased by 0.87 points (p = 0.4). However, depression and anxiety were not significantly different. Emotional labor decreased by 0.16 points (p = 0.027), and well-being and self-efficacy mean scores increased by 0.492 (p = 0.005) and 0.162 (p = 0.025), respectively.

Although effective interventions exist for common mental disorders that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, most cases in low- and middle-income countries go untreated because of a lack of trained professionals. Task-sharing models such as the Thinking Healthy Program have shown potential in feasibility and efficacy trials as a strategy for expanding access to treatment in low-resource settings; however, there are significant barriers to scale-up. We address this gap by adapting Thinking Healthy for automated delivery via a mobile phone.

This paper describes the design and development of POD Adventures, a blended problem-solving game-based intervention for adolescents with or at risk of anxiety, depression and conduct difficulties in India. This intervention was developed as part of the PRemIum for ADolEscents (PRIDE) research programme, which aims to establish a suite of transdiagnostic psychological interventions organized around a stepped care system in Indian secondary schools. Methods and Materials: Intervention development followed a person-centered approach consisting of four iterative activities: (i) review of recent context-specific evidence on mental health needs and preferences for the target population of school-going Indian adolescents, including a multiple stakeholder analysis of school counseling priorities and pilot studies of a brief problem-solving intervention; (ii) new focus group discussions with N = 46 student participants and N = 8 service providers; (iii) co-design workshops with N = 22 student participants and N = 8 service providers; and (iv) user-testing with N = 50 student participants. Participants were aged 12-17 years and recruited from local schools in New Delhi and Goa, including a subgroup with self-identified mental health needs (N = 6). Results: Formative data from existing primary sources, new focus groups and co-design workshops supported a blended format for delivering a brief problem-solving intervention, with counselors supporting use of a game-based app on \"offline\" smartphones. User-testing with prototypes identified a need for simplification of language, use of concrete examples of concepts and practice elements to enhance engagement. There were also indications that participants most valued relatability and interactivity within real-world stories with judicious support from an in-app guide. The final prototype comprised a set of interactive and gamified vignettes and a structured set of problem-solving questions to consolidate and generalize learning while encouraging real-world application. Discussion: Findings shaped the design of POD Adventures and its delivery as an open-access blended intervention for secondary school students with a felt need for psychological support, consistent with an early intervention paradigm. A randomized controlled trial is planned to evaluate processes and impacts of POD Adventures when delivered for help-seeking students in low-resource school settings."

Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill-building exercises to reduce loneliness during the transition to college.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      First-year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully automated (1) \"social challenges,\" suggested activities designed to build social connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection building. Main intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare the conditions on self-assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline depressive symptoms and loneliness).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in loneliness at week 4 (F1, 211=0.05, P=.82; ηp2 <.001). However, there was a significant condition-by-baseline depression interaction to predict week-4 loneliness (F1,209=9.65, P=.002; ηp2 =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that baseline depression positively predicted week-4 loneliness among control participants (r=0.30, t209=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental participants (r=-0.09, t209=-0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition differences in other week-4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline vulnerability was found for week-4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus belonging).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to address loneliness among other key populations.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04164654; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04164654."

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BWL versus dim red light therapy (DRL) on depressive symptoms within individual cancer survivors using personalized (N-of-1) trials. Methods: Cancer survivors with at least mild depressive symptoms were randomized to one of two treatment sequences consisting of counterbalanced crossover comparisons of three-weeks of lightbox-delivered BWL (intervention) or DRL (sham) for 30 min each morning across 12 weeks. A smartphone application guided cancer survivors through the treatment sequence and facilitated data collection. Cancer survivors tracked end-of-day depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and fatigue using visual analog scales. Within-patient effects of BWL were assessed using an autoregressive model with adjustment for linear time trends. Results: Eight of nine cancer survivors completed the 12-week protocol. Two survivors reported significantly (i.e., p < 0.05) lower depressive symptoms (-1.3 ± 0.5 and -1.30 ± 0.9 points on a 10-point scale), five reported no difference in depressive symptoms, and one reported higher depressive symptoms (+1.7 ± 0.6 points) with BWL versus DRL. Eight of nine cancer survivors recommended personalized trials of BWL to others. Conclusions: There were heterogeneous effects of three-week BWL on self-reported depressive symptoms among cancer survivors, with some finding a benefit but others finding no benefit or even harm. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Personalized trials can help cancer survivors learn if BWL is helpful for improving their depressive symptoms."

We also searched grey literature databases, organisational websites, reference lists of included records, and academic journals, as well as seeking expert advice.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as cohort, interrupted time series, and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) on UCTs in LMICs. Primary outcomes were the use of health services and health outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently screened all potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the included studies' risk of bias. We requested missing information from the study authors.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Three studies (one cluster-RCT and two CBAs) comprising a total of 13,885 participants (9640 children and 4245 adults) as well as 1200 households in two LMICs (Nicaragua and Niger) met the inclusion criteria. They examined five UCTs between USD 145 and USD 250 (or more, depending on household characteristics) that were provided by governmental, non-governmental or research organisations during experiments or pilot programmes in response to droughts. Two studies examined the effectiveness of UCTs, and one study examined the relative effectiveness of in-hand UCTs compared with in-kind transfers and UCTs paid via mobile phone. Due to the methodologic limitations of the retrieved records, which carried a high risk of bias and very serious indirectness, we considered the body of evidence to be of very low overall quality and thus very uncertain across all outcomes.Depending on the specific health services use and health outcomes examined, the included studies either reported no evidence that UCTs had impacted the outcome, or they reported that UCTs improved the outcome. No single outcome was reported by more than one study. There was a very small increase in the proportion of children who received vitamin or iron supplements (mean difference (MD) 0.10 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.14) and on the child's home environment, as well as clinically meaningful, very large reductions in the chance of child death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66) and the incidence of severe acute malnutrition (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80). There was also a moderate reduction in the number of days children spent sick in bed (MD - 0.36 SDs, 95% CI - 0.62 to - 0.10). There was no evidence for any effect on the proportion of children receiving deworming drugs, height for age among children, adults' level of depression, or the quality of parenting behaviour. No adverse effects were identified. The included comparisons did not examine several important outcomes, including food security and equity impacts.With regard to the relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with a food transfer providing a relatively high total caloric value, there was no evidence that a UCT had any effect on the chance of child death (HR 2.27, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.44) or severe acute malnutrition (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.99). A UCT paid in-hand led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the household dietary diversity score, compared with the same UCT paid via mobile phone (difference-in-differences estimator 0.43 scores, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80), but there was no evidence for an effect on social determinants of health, health service expenditure, or local markets and infrastructure.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Additional high-quality evidence (especially RCTs of humanitarian disaster contexts other than droughts) is required to reach clear conclusions regarding the effectiveness and relative effectiveness of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in humanitarian disasters in LMICs."

A randomised controlled trial (RCT), WelTel Kenya1, demonstrated the effectiveness of the WelTel text messaging intervention to improve clinical outcomes among patients initiating ART. In preparation for WelTel Retain, an RCT that will evaluate the effect of the intervention to retain patients in care immediately following HIV diagnosis, we conducted an informative qualitative study with people living with HIV (n = 15) and healthcare providers (HCP) (n = 5) in October 2012. Study objectives included exploring the experiences of people living with HIV who have attempted to engage in HIV care, the use of cell phones in everyday life, and perceptions of communicating via text message with HCP. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted and recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo software. Analysis was guided by the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Technology Acceptance Model. Results indicate that while individuals have many motivators for engaging in care after diagnosis, structural and individual barriers including poverty, depression and fear of stigma prevent them from doing so. All participants had access to a mobile phone, and most were comfortable communicating through text messages, or were willing to learn. Both people living with HIV and HCP felt that increased communication via the text messaging intervention has the potential to enable early identification of problems, leading to timely problem solving that may improve retention and engagement in care during the first year after diagnosis."

Mobile app-delivered mindfulness meditation may be an effective part of salubrious programming to bolster long-term resilience and health among PA students.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to examine the impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on self-reported mental health symptoms among PA students. A secondary aim is to investigate changes in brain connectivity to identify neurobiological changes related to changes in mental health symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited PA students enrolled in their third semester of PA school and used a longitudinal, randomized, wait-list-controlled design. Participants randomized to the mindfulness group were provided 1-year subscriptions to the 10% Happier app, a consumer-based meditation app, and asked to practice every day for 8 weeks. Before randomization and again after completion of the 8-week program, all participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as self-report assessments of burnout, depression, anxiety, and sleep impairment. App use was acquired as a measure of mindfulness practice time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PA students randomized to the mindfulness group reported improvements in sleep impairment compared with those randomized to the wait-list control group (ηp2=0.42; P=.01). Sleep impairment decreased significantly in the mindfulness group (19% reduction; P=.006) but not in the control group (1% reduction; P=.71). There were no other significant changes in mental health for those randomized to app-delivered mindfulness. Across all students, changes in sleep impairment were associated with increased resting-state functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (a component of the default mode network) and the superior temporal gyrus, as well as between areas important for working memory. Changes in connectivity predicted categorical conversion from impaired to nonimpaired sleep in the mindfulness group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study is the first to examine app-based mindfulness for PA students' mental health and investigate the impact of mindfulness on PA students' brain function. These findings suggest that app-delivered mindfulness may be an effective tool to improve sleep dysfunction and that it may be an important part of the programming necessary to reduce the epidemic of suffering among health profession trainees."

We enrolled 626 English-speaking adults (≥18 years old) with mild to moderate depression as determined by a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥5, or if their score on item 10 was ≥2. The apps were (1) Project: EVO, a cognitive training app theorized to mitigate depressive symptoms by improving cognitive control, (2) iPST, an app based on an evidence-based psychotherapy for depression, and (3) Health Tips, a treatment control.

            "abstract": "As mobile data capture tools for patient-reported outcomes proliferate in clinical research, a key dimension of measure performance is sensitivity to change. This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper-and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25-50% lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables."

We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence.

Adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with a first 0 to IIC primary cutaneous melanoma were randomized to receive Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare (ASICA), a tablet-based intervention prompting and supporting TSSE in survivors of melanoma, or to usual care. The hypothesis was that ASICA would increase TSSE practice in users affected by melanoma and compared with controls without affecting psychological well-being. The main primary outcomes were melanoma worry (Melanoma Worry Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) as well as secondary outcomes collected using postal questionnaires 3, 6, and 12 months following randomization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 240 recruits were randomized (1:1) into the ASICA (n=121, 50.4%) or control (n=119, 49.6%) groups.

This study analyzed the mobile app data in a non-clinical sample of 39 adults participating in a larger randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) mobile app that tailors skill coaching based on in-the-moment variables (n = 17) or an app that provides randomly selected skill coaching (n = 22). Data were collected before and after each ACT skill coaching session on proximal outcome (depression, anxiety, and engagement in meaningful activity) and ACT process variables. Multilevel models indicated significant immediate improvements on average following ACT skill coaching sessions on all proximal outcome and ACT process variables, although with relatively small effects ranging between 0.17 and 0.27 SD units change. Larger immediate pre-to-post effects from ACT coaching sessions were found for anxiety, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion in the tailored app versus random app condition. Overall, results suggest that an ACT app can have immediate, in-the-moment effects on psychological functioning, which may be enhanced by tailoring skills to current context."

Randomized controlled trials of the effect of mobile health in alleviating the risk factors of CHD's occurrence and development were included. Risks of bias were assessed by two independent reviewers by using the RevMan 5.3, GRADEpro, and RoB2.0 to generate findings. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the effects of mobile health on risk factors for CHD. Subgroup analyses were conducted. Sixteen randomized controlled trials, including 3898 patients with CHD, were included.

The results of subgroup analyses indicated that the simple mobile health intervention has more remarkable advantages in reducing BMI, TC, LDL-C, and systolic blood pressure than the complex mobile health intervention. Mobile health can alleviate the risk factors for CHD and has a certain effect on the prevention and recovery of CHD. Simple mobile health has a remarkable advantage.

Risk of bias was low in one study, moderate in nine trials and five observational studies, and high in one study. Telehealth interventions were intended to replace usual care in 14 studies and supplement care in 2 studies. Delivery modes included telephone (5 studies), online modules (5 studies), and mobile applications (1 study), and was unclear or undefined in five studies. There were no differences between telehealth interventions to supplement contraceptive care and comparators for rates of contraceptive use, sexually transmitted infection, and pregnancy (low SOE); evidence was insufficient for abortion rates. There were no differences between telehealth IPV services versus comparators for outcomes measuring repeat IPV, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear of partner, coercive control, self-efficacy, and safety behaviors (low SOE). The COVID-19 pandemic increased telehealth utilization. Barriers to telehealth interventions included limited internet access and digital literacy among English-speaking IPV survivors, and technical challenges and confidentiality concerns for contraceptive care. Telehealth use was facilitated by strategies to ensure safety of individuals who receive IPV services. Evidence was insufficient to evaluate access, health equity, or harms outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Limited evidence suggests that telehealth interventions for contraceptive care and IPV services result in equivalent clinical and patient-reported outcomes as in-person care. Uncertainty remains regarding the most effective approaches for delivering these services, and how to best mobilize telehealth, particularly for women facing barriers to healthcare."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) has been shown to reduce the pain of neuropathy in multiple studies. There are several methods of stimulation both invasive and non-invasive. Recent work by this laboratory has seen that 40% of a sample of chronic neuropathic pain patients responded positively to non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the motor cortex with a reduction in pain levels by at least 20%. The effect however is short lived and multiple return visits are necessary to maintain this response. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) offers a more mobile method of motor cortex stimulation and is similarly non-invasive. The protocol described is designed to assess the analgesic effect of a home-based tDCS treatment device on chronic neuropathic pain in both responders and non-responders to previous TMS treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This article reports the protocol for a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blinded crossover study in which patients with chronic neuropathic pain (n = 24) will receive anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS over M1. All patients will have previously completed a study of rTMS of the motor cortex and have been designated as responders or non-responders to this modality. Patients receive all three tDCS stimulation types by self-administration. We assess the effect on pain scores [numerical rating scale (NRS)], self reported health status (Short Form-36 Health Survey) and anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). A linear mixed model with fixed effects will analyse changes in pain scores from pre- to post- interventions. Analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. A proportion analysis will also be carried out with patients separated into either responders or non-responders to previous TMS. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring of adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The result of this trial will assess the efficacy of self-administered tDCS of the motor cortex in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and also provide insight into whether a potential differential effect is seen in patients that have previously been shown to be either responsive or non-responsive to rTMS over the same area.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ISRCTN56839387 date 27 January 2014.

            "abstract": "Among individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs), comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is common and often noted as the rule rather than the exception. Standard care that provides integrated treatment for comorbid diagnoses simultaneously has been shown to be effective. Technology-based interventions (TBIs) have the potential to provide a cost-effective platform for, and greater accessibility to, integrated treatments. For the purposes of this review, we defined TBIs as interventions in which the primary targeted aim was delivered by automated computer, Internet, or mobile system with minimal to no live therapist involvement. A search of the literature identified nine distinct TBIs for SUDs and comorbid disorders. An examination of this limited research showed promise, particularly for TBIs that address problematic alcohol use, depression, or anxiety. Additional randomized, controlled trials of TBIs for comorbid SUDs and for anxiety and depression are needed, as is future research developing TBIs that address SUDs and comorbid eating disorders and psychotic disorders. Ways of leveraging the full capabilities of what technology can offer should also be further explored."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Anger is a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a web-based therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web-based interface allows the therapist to access data on between-session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-and 6-month follow-up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post-treatment, 3-and 6-month follow-up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition × Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8%; of those who remained in treatment, 90% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post-treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between-session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technology-enhanced, evidence-based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile app-supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties. Future research should evaluate how much therapist involvement is needed to support anger management."

Treatment for depression during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years with depression will be randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive four sessions of brief CBT in 8 weeks. Participants will be evaluated by assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Sleep disturbance symptoms are common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and have been found to hamper the treatment effect of conventional face-to-face psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. To increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment, blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) consisting of web-based and face-to-face treatment is on the rise for patients with MDD. To date, no study has examined whether sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on bCBT treatment outcomes and whether it affects bCBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU) equally.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of this study are to investigate whether baseline sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on treatment outcomes independent of treatment modality and whether sleep disturbance symptoms impact bCBT and TAU in routine care equally.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was based on data from the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment Versus Treatment-as-Usual) study, a 2-arm, multisite, parallel randomized controlled, noninferiority trial. A total of 943 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either bCBT (476/943, 50.5%) or TAU consisting of routine clinical MDD treatment (467/943, 49.5%). The primary outcome of this study was the change in depression symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the change in depression symptom severity at the 3- and 6-month follow-up and MDD diagnoses at the 12-month follow-up, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Mixed effects models were used to examine the association of sleep disturbance symptoms with treatment outcome and treatment modality over time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 943 patients recruited for the study, 558 (59.2%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the total sample, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms did not significantly affect change in depressive symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up (β=.16, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.36). However, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were negatively associated with treatment outcome for bCBT (β=.49, 95% CI 0.22-0.76) but not for TAU (β=-.23, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.05) at the 12-month follow-up, even when adjusting for baseline depression symptom severity. The same result was seen for the effect of sleep disturbance symptoms on the presence of depression measured with Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview at the 12-month follow-up. However, for both treatment formats, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were not associated with depression symptom severity at either the 3- (β=.06, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.23) or 6-month (β=.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.28) follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Baseline sleep disturbance symptoms may have a negative impact on long-term treatment outcomes in bCBT for MDD. This effect was not observed for TAU. These findings suggest that special attention to sleep disturbance symptoms might be warranted when MDD is treated with bCBT. Future studies should investigate the effect of implementing modules specifically targeting sleep disturbance symptoms in bCBT for MDD to improve long-term prognosis."

Participants are patients of the public health care services for hypertension, diabetes, or both conditions in São Paulo, Brazil (n=880) and Lima, Peru (n=432). Clinical effectiveness will be measured by reduction in depressive symptoms and gains in health-related quality of life. We will conduct cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, providing estimates of the cost per at least 50% reduction in 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores, and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. The measurement of clinical effectiveness and resource use will take place over baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up in the intervention and control groups. We will use a mixed costing methodology (ie, a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches) considering 4 cost categories: intervention (CONEMO related) costs, health care costs, patient and family costs, and productivity costs. We will collect unit costs from the RCTs and national administrative databases. The multinational economic evaluations will be fully split analyses with a multicountry costing approach. We will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and present 95% CIs from nonparametric bootstrapping (1000 replicates). We will perform deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Although positive effects of patient education have been demonstrated, limited studies explored the benefits of education via mobile applications for AS patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the WeChat-based educational intervention on depression, health-related QoL, and other clinical outcomes in AS patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial from March to December 2017. Patients were recruited and randomized into the intervention group which received a 12-week WeChat-based educational intervention (consisting of four individual online educational sessions, online educational materials) or the control group receiving standard care.

The intervention group received a complex behavioural change intervention, combining behaviour change communication provided by community health promoters and access to a habit formation mobile application, while the control group received the standard care provided by public health clinics in Malaysia. The primary outcome was a change in the woman's waist circumference. Secondary outcomes were anthropometric and metabolic measures, dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ) and mental health (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, DASS 21).

            "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines how baseline demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and intervention delivery predict engagement among adolescents with overweight and obesity seeking treatment. Methods: Data originates from a multisite randomized control trial evaluating the efficacy of an app-based weight loss intervention, compared with standard in-clinic model in adolescents with overweight and obesity. Participants were randomized to one of the three arms: (1) AppCoach, (2) AppAlone, or (3) Control. Demographic, executive functioning (EF), and depression questionnaires were completed at baseline. Percent engagement was compared within and between groups defined by demographics and depressive symptoms. Quantile regression was used to evaluate the association between age and EF on percent engagement. Results: Baseline demographics were not associated with engagement within or between groups. Neither baseline self-reported depressive symptoms (p = 0.244) nor deficits in EF (p = 0.34) were predictors of engagement. Univariate analysis found that the control arm had the highest engagement (83%) compared with AppCoach (63.5%) and AppAlone (22.5%, p = 0.02). Hispanic ethnicity was predictive of higher engagement in the control arm (p = 0.02). On multivariate quartile regression no other baseline characteristics were significant predictors of engagement. Conclusion: Baseline demographics and individual psychosocial characteristics were not related to engagement in this cohort. The intervention arm that required parental involvement resulted in the greatest engagement suggesting that family involvement may overshadow individual behavioral phenotype and thus promote better engagement. Further investigation is needed to understand how program delivery can be leveraged to optimize treatment engagement and outcomes in adolescence. Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT03500835."

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified the in-person recruitment and onboarding procedures to internet-based, remote processes with human support. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of how the composition of the recruited cohort might have changed from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 enrollment period. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially those needed to support patients who were not very familiar with downloading apps onto their mobile phones on their own. Finally, we used the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during the COVID-19 social distancing period.

Significant changes were made to the onboarding procedures, including facilitating app download via Zoom video call and/or a standard phone call and implementing brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers reduced from 34.4% (11/32) in the pre-COVID-19 cohort to 27.3% (3/11) in the COVID-19 cohort.

Participants (N = 52) were recruited from primary care practices between January and December 2017 and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive (a) Moodivate, (b) an active control cognitive-behavioral therapy-based mobile app (\"MoodKit\"), or (c) treatment as usual (TAU; no app). Participants completed assessments of depressive symptoms weekly for 8 weeks. App analytics data were captured to examine Moodivate feasibility (analytics unavailable for control app). Moodivate participants on average had 46.76 (SD = 30.10) app sessions throughout the trial duration, spent 3.50 (2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent 120.76 (101.02) minutes using the app in total throughout the trial. Nearly 70% of Moodivate participants continued to use the app 1 month after trial enrollment and 50% at the end of the 8-week follow-up period. A generalized estimating equation model examining change in depressive symptoms over time by treatment condition indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment condition (χ2 = 42.21, df = 14, p < .001).

On the app, participants initially responded to 5 single-item measures of key protective factors in youth mental health (formal help-seeking, informal help-seeking, sleep, exercise, and sense of belonging). They were then encouraged to use the app daily to input data relating to mood states (happiness, sadness, anger, stress, and worry), daily problems, and coping self-efficacy. The app automatically collected data pertaining to user engagement over the course of the 28-day intervention period. Students also completed pen and paper questionnaires containing standardized measures of emotional distress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; DASS-21), well-being (World Health Organization Well-Being Index; WHO-5), and coping (Coping Strategies Inventory; CSI).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      On average the participants completed 18% (5/28) of daily ratings, and engagement levels did not differ across gender, age, school, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or nationality. On a scale of 1 to 10, happiness was consistently the highest rated mood state (overall mean 6.56), and anger was consistently the lowest (overall mean 2.11). Pearson correlations revealed that average daily ratings of emotional states were associated with standardized measures of emotional distress (rhappiness=-.45, rsadness=.51, ranger=.32, rstress=.41, rworry=.48) and well-being (rhappiness=.39, rsadness =-.43, ranger=-.27, rstress=-.35, rworry=-.33). Inferential statistics indicated that single-item indicators of key protective factors were related to emotional distress, well-being, and average daily mood states, as measured by EMA ratings. Hierarchical regressions revealed that greater daily problems were associated with more negative daily mood ratings (all at the P<.001 level); however, when coping efficacy was taken into account, the relationship between problems and happiness, sadness, and anger became negligible.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While engagement with the app was low, overall the EMA data collected in this exploratory study appeared valid and provided useful insights into the relationships between daily problems, coping efficacy, and mood states.

            "abstract": "Stress and anxiety during pregnancy are associated with a range of adverse health outcomes, but there is an unmet need for low-barrier treatments that target stress and anxiety. One such treatment approach, attention bias modification training (ABMT), targets the anxiety-related threat bias, a disruption in attention to and neural processing of threat-related information. It remains unclear, however, whether reducing treatment barriers via mobile delivery of ABMT is effective and whether ABMT efficacy varies depending on individual differences in neural processing of threat. The present study tested whether mobile, gamified ABMT reduced prenatal threat bias, anxiety and stress, and whether ABMT efficacy varied with individual differences in neural responses to threat. Participants were 29 women in their 19th-29th week of pregnancy, randomized to four weeks of an ABMT or placebo training (PT) version of the mobile app using a double-blind design. Self-report of anxiety, depression, and stress were obtained; salivary cortisol was collected at home and in lab in response to stressors to index biological stress reactivity. Threat bias was measured using a computerized attention assay during which EEG was recorded to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to threat cues. Results showed lower levels of lab cortisol following ABMT versus PT. Although the main effect of ABMT on subjective anxiety was not significant, the magnitude of cortisol reduction was correlated with lower levels of subjective anxiety and threat bias. Those receiving ABMT also reported less anxiety when showing smaller ERPs to threat (P1, P2) prior to training, but, conversely reported more anxiety when showing larger ERPs to threat. Use of gamified, mobile ABMT reduced biobehavioral indices of prenatal stress and anxiety, but effects on anxiety varied with individual differences in cortisol response and neurocognitive indices of early attention to threat."

Medical interventions for this client group tend to focus on the treatment of seizures, whereas mental health disorders often remain undiagnosed and untreated. Early identification and treatment of mental health difficulties in people with epilepsy are vital to ensure better outcomes and improvements in quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this exploratory randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention delivered through a mobile app-ThinkNinja for Epilepsy-is a clinically effective tool to improve quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being in a large sample of people with epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study aims to recruit 184 individuals, 18 to 65 years of age, with a self-reported diagnosis of epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app condition (arm A) or the waiting-list control group (arm B). Participants in arm A will receive access to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app first. After 8 weeks, participants in arm B will receive the same full access to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app as the participants in arm A. This design will allow an initial between-subjects analysis between the two conditions as well as a within-subject analysis including all participants. The primary outcome is participants' quality of life, measured by the 10-item patient-weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include measures of anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment; depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; medication adherence, using the Medication Adherence Questionnaire; and impression of change, using the Patient Global Impression of Change questionnaire.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Recruitment for this study began in March 2022 and was completed in October 2022. We expect data collection to be finalized by May 2023 and study results to be available within 12 months of the final data collection date. Results of the study will be written up as soon as possible thereafter, with the intention of publishing the outcomes in high-quality peer-reviewed journals.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy intervention at improving the quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being of people with epilepsy.

            "abstract": "Positive psychological interventions (PPIs), programs that specifically target positive emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, have been shown to reduce depression and improve other aspects of psychological well-being. However, potential pathways linking PPIs to better outcomes have been under-explored. In this paper, we report the results of a randomized trial of a self-guided online delivered PPI called MARIGOLD (Mobile Affect Regulation Intervention with the Goal of Lowering Depression). Participants with elevated depression were randomized to receive MARIGOLD (n = 539) or an emotion reporting control condition (n = 63). In addition to testing direct effects of the intervention on depressive symptoms, we explored whether positive or negative emotion-operationalized as past day, past week, reactivity, or flexibility-mediated the intervention impact on depression. Results demonstrated that participants in the MARIGOLD condition had reduced depressive symptoms compared to controls and, although the effect did not reach statistical significance, reductions in past day negative emotion appeared to mediate this effect. Contrary to hypotheses, the intervention did not increase positive emotion compared to the control condition. Discussion focuses on the need for future studies to continue investigating the mechanisms of action for PPIs with emphasis on theoretically-based measurement and operationalization of emotion and other potential mediators to maximize the ultimate impact of PPIs on psychological well-being.

Culturally appropriate interventions can combat this disparity, especially those that increase social support. However, these interventions face significant cost and time barriers, which mHealth (mobile health) may overcome. This trial examines the benefit of adding social support to an existing text-message based, patient-focused mHealth intervention for emergency department patients with poorly controlled diabetes. Family members and friends of patients were randomized to mHealth augmented social support training (daily text-messages that synchronize with the patient messages) or a pamphlet based training (the same content mailed to their house.) We hypothesize that patients who received mHealth augmented social support will have a larger improvement in diabetes management (glycosylated hemoglobin or A1C) than those receiving standard support at six-months, and that improvement will be sustained at twelve-months. Secondary patient outcomes are clinical (weight, blood pressure), behavioral (medication adherence, self-care activities) and psychosocial (general and diabetes-specific social support, self-efficacy, diabetes-related distress, depression, fatalism and quality of life). We screened 2004 patients and enrolled 166 patient/supporter dyads. 70% of patients are Spanish-speaking, 51% female, with a mean A1C of 10.8. We employed innovative measures to remotely enroll family members and support a bilingual population, which will assist other investigators in design of similar trials.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has been on the forefront of implementing telehealth solutions as a way to extend care to key populations of interest or to overcome barriers to receiving timely and high-quality care. Women Veterans are one such key population who could benefit from the flexibility and access afforded by telehealth because they are geographically dispersed within the Veterans Health Administration and have gender-specific care needs. Thus, the goal of this report was to conduct an evidence map that characterizes the quantity, distribution, and characteristics of evidence which assesses the effectiveness of telehealth services designed specifically for women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE® (via PubMed®) and Embase® to identify relevant articles and systematic reviews (SRs) published between inception and December 29, 2016, for peer-reviewed, English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled studies, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time-series or repeated-measures studies, and relevant SRs or patient-level meta-analyses of telehealth interventions designed for women. We conducted article inclusion screening and abstraction based on predetermined criteria such as type of study design used, population recruited, and intervention tested. Two reviewers independently evaluated titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible primary studies and SRs for full-text review. Because of the large volume of primary studies, at the full-text screening stage a trained independent reviewer made eligibility decisions, of which at least a random sample of 20% was dual-reviewed. The SRs were examined separately by 2 team members. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the 2 investigators or by a third investigator. Articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The literature search identified 5305 unique citations, of which 590 primary studies and 21 SRs were promoted to full-text review. Of these, 209 studies and 2 SRs were retained for data abstraction. From these, 81 primary studies and 1 SR related to maternal care, 56 to prevention, 43 to disease management, 11 to family planning, 7 to identifying and managing women at high risk for breast cancer, 6 to mental health, and 5 studies and 1 SR to intimate partner violence (IPV). When looking across these 7 focused areas of research, the majority of studies identified were relatively small (n <250). For studies that provided race and ethnic study composition, the overwhelming majority of studies included populations that were predominantly white. Age distributions in this literature tracked with population distributions of women potentially affected by the identified health issues. However, we found relatively few studies that focused on health issues of women 60 years of age and older across the reports on prevention, disease management, mental health, and intimate partner violence.\n    \n\n      \n      When mapping the setting of telehealth interventions designed for women, the overwhelming majority of studies was conducted in countries categorized as high income by the World Bank. The only exception to this was in the area of family planning, where half the studies were conducted in middle- and low-income countries. When looking across the literature, most studies recruited from outpatient clinics (including specialty outpatient clinics), followed by the community. Across all areas of research, telephone was the dominant telehealth modality to deliver intervention content. Nearly all studies used telehealth technologies to facilitate communication between patients and health care team members. We identified only 1 study that focused on provider-to-provider communication. Very few telehealth interventionists were physicians or advanced practice providers (eg, nurse practitioners, physician assistants). Instead, the interventions were mostly supported by diverse credentialed and noncredentialed positions (eg, registered nurses, behavioral health specialists, health educators, peer or lay health workers). The majority of studies were limited in their duration and did not extend beyond 12 weeks. The only exception was among studies focused on prevention; the majority of these were 25 weeks or more. We also mapped the outcomes addressed in each study. Of the studies that reported primary outcomes, most focused on patient-level outcomes. No studies focused on provider-level outcomes, and only 11 studies reported primary outcomes focused on the system level.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Telehealth offers a potentially ideal approach to deliver targeted support to women Veterans in a manner that is convenient to the patient and does not require traveling long distances. From a provider and system level, telehealth provides additional tools to aid the facilitation of continuity of care and transitions of care (eg, post-acute care) and can be a powerful tool for population health management. The goal of this report was to provide an overview of current evidence for the use of telehealth services designed specifically for women. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to map this literature base.\n    \n\n      \n      A key use of these evidence maps is to inform decisions about where more primary research is needed. The maps in this report serve as a broad visualization of the field of telehealth interventions for women. Beyond maternal health care, we identified a relatively small number of telehealth studies that addressed other gender-specific needs of women Veterans that warrant further exploration, such as family planning, IPV, homelessness, pain management, and high-risk breast cancer assessment. Also, outside of postpartum depression, few studies used telehealth interventions to address the mental health needs of women. Further, mobile health technologies were underrepresented, emphasizing the need to study how best to use evolving technology to address the needs of women. Finally, there is a need for research on the extent to which telehealth improves provider- and system-level outcomes related to provider satisfaction and retention and patient access to care. Only after conducting studies that address these key research gaps can the promise of telehealth for optimizing the well-being of women Veterans be fully assessed. Because the VA is a large, integrated health care system that has demonstrated a commitment to the development and use of telehealth modalities and has been a setting for the successful conduct of multisite studies, the VA health care system is well-positioned to address the gaps in the women’s telehealth literature."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies have shown an improvement in the access to treatment for patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), specifically young patients, through mobile app-based interventions. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intervention to improve community functioning in adolescents with FEP. Mobile app-based interventions could increase quality of life and disease awareness, which improve adherence to treatment and reduce the frequency of relapses and rehospitalizations in adolescents with FEP. Methods: This article describes a mobile app treatment and the pilot trial protocol for patients with FEP. We will perform a single-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) including patients with FEP aged 14-19 years recruited from Gregorio Marañón Hospital, Madrid, Spain. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group, which will receive treatment as usual plus five modules of a psychological intervention through the mobile app (psychoeducation, recognition of symptoms and prevention of relapses, problem solving, mindfulness, and contact wall), or to a control group (standard care). The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by means of an extensive battery of clinical tests at baseline and at 3 months of follow-up. The primary outcome is reduction in psychotic and depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes comprise adherence, awareness, use of drugs, and quality of life. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Mixed model repeated-measures analysis will be used to explore the following effect: group × time interaction between the control group and the intervention group for clinical and functional variables during the follow-up period. Discussion: This is an innovative study for the assessment of a psychological intervention through a mobile app for patients with FEP during the critical period. This pilot RCT is intended to be a precursor to larger studies, which in turn could facilitate dissemination of mobile app therapy for patients with FEP. Ethics and Dissemination: The local ethics committee approved the study protocol. All participants must sign the informed consent, to participate. After finalizing the study, the results will be published. Trial registration: NCT03161249. NCT clinicaltrials.gov. Date of registration in primary registry 02 May 2017. clinicaltrials.gov."

Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRVB) is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, breathing-based cardiorespiratory training technique that can reduce trauma symptoms and improve HRV parameters. Prior studies have demonstrated HRVB is well-tolerated by veterans with PTSD symptoms (Tan et al., in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 36(1):27-35, 10.1007/s10484-010-9141-y, 2011; Schuman and Killian, in Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 44(1):9-20, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10484-018-9415-3 , 2019). This randomized wait-list controlled pilot study tested a short mobile app-adapted HRVB intervention in combination with treatment as usual for veterans with military-related PTSD to determine if further investigation was warranted. We assessed veterans' military-related PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and HRV time and frequency domain measures at baseline, after three clinical sessions, and one month later. This study combined clinical training and home biofeedback with a smartphone app and sensor to reinforce training and validate adherence. In the intervention group, depression and SDNN significantly improved, and we observed marginally significant improvements for PTSD Cluster B (intrusion) symptoms, whereas no significant improvements were observed in the control group. In addition, the brief protocol was acceptable to veterans with PTSD with over 83% of participants completing the study. However, adherence to home practice was low. Findings suggest brief HRVB interventions can decrease comorbid depression and improve overall autonomic function in veterans with PTSD; however, additional research on home biofeedback is necessary to determine the best strategies to increase adherence and which veterans would benefit from brief HRVB interventions."

            "abstract": "Individuals who suffer from depressive symptoms experience a substantial impact on psychosocial functioning, physical health, mortality, and quality of life. In the search for therapeutic strategies, exercise has been found to play a relevant part in its treatment. However, the promotion of exercise entails adherence difficulties that arose out of the tendency towards sedentarism led by symptomatology. Personalised exercise plans on top of usual care have the potential to enhance behavioural changes and mental health. The present study aims at evaluating the changes in functioning deriving from a blended intervention merging a psychological intervention with a personalised exercise programme based on medical assessment. We will conduct a three-arm randomised controlled trial in which 172 participants suffering from mild-moderate depressive symptoms will be allocated to Intervention A (personalised exercise group programme + app with motivational messages), B (personalised exercise group programme + app with no motivational messages) or control group (app with no motivational messages). Data regarding global functioning, well-being, symptoms, physical activity, and exercise capacity will be collected at baseline, 4, 12, and 36 weeks. The results of this trial will provide information about whether this physical activity support programme may be efficient for improving mental and physical health outcomes.

The best outcomes are for individuals to plan for and eventually cease driving, however with insufficient support programs in place, many avoid the issue until it is reaches a crisis point. This program of research investigates a comprehensive support- and education-based intervention targeted at people living with dementia and their care partners who are managing driving cessation. The primary aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of the program through a cluster randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The intervention (CarFreeMe) is an intensive program delivered by a trained health professional that addresses practical and emotional needs relevant to driving cessation.

A cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Evaluation will take place pre-intervention, immediately following, and three months post-intervention. Clusters are randomized to either intervention or usual treatment. Participants within clusters will be recruited via primary and secondary care clinics, community agencies, service providers, local media, social media, support groups, and word of mouth.

MHapps and other technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features that are not optimized.

Despite their high prevalence worldwide, there is still insufficient recognition and accessible treatments. Many mobile apps are available to the general population that aim to support mental health needs; however, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness. Mobile apps for mental health are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence and there is a need for an overview of the state of the literature on these apps. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the current research landscape and knowledge gaps regarding the use of artificial intelligence in mobile health apps for mental health. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study types (PICOS) frameworks were used to structure the review and the search. PubMed was systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and cohort studies published in English since 2014 that evaluate artificial intelligence- or machine learning-enabled mobile apps for mental health support. Two reviewers collaboratively screened references (MMI and EM), selected studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria and extracted the data (MMI and CL), which were synthesised in a descriptive analysis. 1,022 studies were identified in the initial search and 4 were included in the final review. The mobile apps investigated incorporated different artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for a variety of purposes (risk prediction, classification, and personalisation) and aimed to address a wide range of mental health needs (depression, stress, and suicide risk). The studies' characteristics also varied in terms of methods, sample size, and study duration. Overall, the studies demonstrated the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to support mental health apps, but the early stages of the research and weaknesses in the study designs highlight the need for more research into artificial intelligence- and machine learning-enabled mental health apps and stronger evidence of their effectiveness. This research is essential and urgent, considering the easy availability of these apps to a large population."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Low attendance and engagement in behavioural weight management trials are common. Mental health may play an important role, however previous research exploring this association is limited with inconsistent findings. We aimed to investigate whether mental health was associated with attendance and engagement in a trial of behavioural weight management programmes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a secondary data analysis of the Weight loss referrals for adults in primary care (WRAP) trial, which randomised 1267 adults with overweight or obesity to brief intervention, WW (formerly Weight Watchers) for 12-weeks, or WW for 52-weeks. We used regression analyses to assess the association of baseline mental health (depression and anxiety (by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (by EQ5D), satisfaction with life (by Satisfaction with Life Questionnaire)) with programme attendance and engagement in WW groups, and trial attendance in all randomised groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Every one unit of baseline depression score was associated with a 1% relative reduction in rate of WW session attendance in the first 12 weeks (Incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.98, 0.999). Higher baseline anxiety was associated with 4% lower odds to report high engagement with WW digital tools (Odds ratio [OR] 0.96; 95% CI 0.94, 0.99). Every one unit of global quality of life was associated with 69% lower odds of reporting high engagement with the WW mobile app (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15, 0.64). Greater symptoms of depression and anxiety and lower satisfaction with life at baseline were consistently associated with lower odds of attending study visits at 3-, 12-, 24-, and 60-months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Participants were less likely to attend programme sessions, engage with resources, and attend study assessments when reporting poorer baseline mental health. Differences in attendance and engagement were small, however changes may still have a meaningful effect on programme effectiveness and trial completion.

They have the potential to enable individuals to learn more about, and to exercise active involvement in, their care, and thus we see a growing interest in this area for both research and practice. However, for e-resources to become important adjuncts to clinical care, it is necessary to understand if and how they impact on patients and care outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this study was to review systematically the research evidence for theory-driven and evidence-based mental health self-management e-resources; and make recommendations about strengthening the future evidence base.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted.

Two reviewers independently rated quality for all included studies using predefined criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Data Synthesis:\n        \n      \n      One randomized, controlled trial (RCT) enrolling veterans (2,305 participants) found that screening for hearing loss was not associated with improvements in hearing-related function at 1 year, although screening was associated with increased hearing aid use. Thirty-four studies (reported in 35 articles) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests, a single question, a questionnaire, a handheld audiometric device, or a mobile-based audiometric application for identifying hearing loss in older adults. For detecting mild hearing loss (>20 to 25 dB), single-question screening had a pooled sensitivity of 66 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 58% to 73%) and a pooled specificity of 76 percent (95% CI, 68% to 83%) (10 studies, 12,637 participants); for detecting moderate hearing loss (>35 to 40 dB), the pooled sensitivity was 80 percent (95% CI, 68% to 88%) and the pooled specificity was 74 percent (95% CI, 59% to 85%) (6 studies, 8,774 participants). Too few studies reported sufficient data to pool accuracy of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening (HHIE-S) for detecting mild hearing loss (>25); across four studies (7,194 participants), sensitivity of HHIE-S ranged from 34 to 58 percent, and specificity ranged from 76 to 95 percent. For detecting moderate hearing loss (>40 dB), the pooled sensitivity of HHIE-S was 68 percent (95% CI, 52% to 81%), and the pooled specificity was 79 percent (95% CI, 69% to 86%) (5 studies; 2,820 participants). In four studies (411 participants) assessing the AudioScope for detecting moderate hearing loss (>40 dB), sensitivities were high (range: 94% to 100%) and specificity varied widely (range: 24% to 80%). Other screening questionnaires, clinical tests (e.g., watch tick, whispered voice), and technology were assessed by few studies each, and results were often inconsistent and imprecise.\n    \n\n      \n      Six trials (853 participants) evaluated benefits of amplification compared with no amplification among populations with screen-detected or recently detected, untreated age-related hearing loss over 6 weeks to 4 months. Five trials reported on the HHIE (838 participants), a self-report tool designed to measure perceived effects of hearing loss in older adults; four (758 participants) found statistically significant benefit in favor of hearing aids. Three of the four trials that found statistically significant benefit enrolled veterans and reported differences in HHIE scores that were greater than the minimal important difference of 18.7. One RCT (154 participants) enrolling community volunteers found statistically significant benefit on the HHIE in favor of two different hearing aids vs. a placebo device; however, differences between groups did not meet the level considered to be clinically meaningful. Four studies reported on general quality of life or function; few studies reported on the same measure. One RCT (194 participants) enrolling veterans with screen-detected hearing loss found significant benefit in favor of the intervention on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (difference between groups in change from baseline: −0.28 points [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.48]; p=0.008) and Geriatric Depression Scale (difference between groups in change from baseline: −0.80 points [95% CI, 0.09 to 1.51]; p=0.03) in addition to the HHIE. No studies of interventions reported on harms.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The one trial of screening was not designed to measure hearing-related function. There has been little reproducibility in testing specific screening tests in primary care populations; most studies of screening test accuracy enroll populations from audiology or other high-prevalence settings. Trials showing clinically meaningful benefit in hearing-related function among groups receiving hearing aids vs. controls all enrolled veterans with a relatively high prevalence of hearing loss.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Several screening tests can adequately detect hearing loss in adults age 50 years or older. One trial of screening that enrolled veterans with a relatively high prevalence of self-perceived hearing loss did not find a benefit for hearing-related function. No controlled studies reported on the harms of screening or treatment among adults with screen-detected or newly detected hearing loss. Evidence showing benefit for hearing-related function associated with hearing aids among adults with screen-detected or newly detected hearing loss is limited to studies enrolling veterans with a high prevalence of hearing loss."

Methods: The eligible participants (M age = 57.06, SD = 11.26 years) were enrolled in the MHP, a therapist-supported mobile intervention. Using a non-randomized pre-post design, change in mental health QoL [WHO QoL Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) psychological health] and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) from baseline to post-treatment were examined. Time of enrollment [pre- vs. post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was included as a between-subjects factor in the repeated measures analyses. Results: Forty-two participants enrolled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; eight enrolled after the pandemic began. Among the pre-COVID-19 enrollees, increase in mental health QoL, F(1, 38) = 12.61, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.25 and decreases in loneliness emerged, F(1, 38) = 5.42, p = 0.025, η2 = 0.13. The changes in mental health QoL, but not loneliness, held for the combined sample, such as post-COVID-19 enrollees, F(1, 44) = 6.02, p = 0.018, η2 = 0.12. The regression analyses showed that increases in mindfulness were associated with the increased mental health QoL and decreased loneliness. Conclusion: Therapist-supported digital mental health interventions, such as the MHP, have the potential to improve mental health QoL and decrease loneliness among the middle-aged and older adults. The findings for loneliness may not hold during the periods of mandated isolation. Instead, therapists supporting digital interventions may need to tailor their approach to target loneliness."

Although settings were heterogeneous, music listening programs played a predominant role with the aim to reduce symptoms like depression and pain, or to improve quality of life and the relationship between patients and caregivers as primary endpoints.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We were able to show that HBMT is an innovative service for future healthcare delivery. It fits with the changing healthcare system and its conditions but also meets the therapeutic needs of the increasing number of elderly and severely impaired people. Apart from music therapists, patients and their families HBMT is also interesting as a blueprint for home based care for other groups of caregivers."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Information and communication technologies are promising tools to increase the quality of life of people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and that of their caregivers. However, there are barriers to their use associated with sociodemographic factors and negative attitudes, as well as inadequate knowledge about technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to analyze technophilia (attitudes toward new technologies) and the use of smartphones and tablets along with associated factors in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and their caregivers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the first visit of the Support Monitoring and Reminder for Mild Dementia (SMART4MD) randomized multicenter clinical trial were used for this analysis. Data were obtained from two European countries, Spain and Sweden, and from three centers: Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain), Servicio Andaluz de Salud (Andalusia, Spain), and the Blekinge Institute of Technology (Sweden). Participants with a score between 20 and 28 in the Mini Mental State Examination, with memory problems (for more than 6 months), and who were over the age of 55 years were included in the study, along with their caregivers. The bivariate Chi square and Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1086 dyads were included (N=2172). Overall, 299 (27.53%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment had a diagnosis of dementia. In addition, 588 (54.14%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment reported using a smartphone almost every day, and 106 (9.76%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. Among the caregivers, 839 (77.26%) used smartphones and tablets almost every day, and 181 (16.67%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. The people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment showed a lower level of technophilia in comparison to that of their caregivers after adjusting for confounders (B=0.074, P=.02) with differences in technology enthusiasm (B=0.360, P<.001), but not in technology anxiety (B=-0.042, P=.37). Technophilia was associated with lower age (B=-0.009, P=.004), male gender (B=-0.160, P<.001), higher education level (P=.01), living arrangement (living with children vs single; B=-2.538, P=.01), country of residence (Sweden vs Spain; B=0.256, P<.001), lower depression (B=-0.046, P<.001), and better health status (B=0.004, P<.001) in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment. Among caregivers, technophilia was associated with comparable sociodemographic factors (except for living arrangement), along with a lower caregiver burden (B=-0.005, P=.04) and better quality of life (B=0.348, P<.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Technophilia was associated with a better quality of life and sociodemographic variables in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and caregivers, suggesting potential barriers for technological interventions. People with dementia/mild cognitive impairment frequently use smartphones and tablets, but the use of specific apps or software to support memory is limited. Interventions using these technologies are needed to overcome barriers in this population related to sociodemographic characteristics and the lack of enthusiasm for new technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03325699; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03325699."

We hypothesized that both approaches would result in significant HbA1c reductions, although health coaching with mobile phone monitoring would result in significantly larger effects. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months (difference between and within groups). Other outcomes included weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), satisfaction with life, depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), and quality of life (Short Form Health Survey-12 [SF-12]).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 138 patients were randomized and 7 were excluded for a substudy; of the remaining 131, 67 were allocated to the intervention group and 64 to the control group.

            "abstract": "Web-based stress management interventions are effective for college students, particularly those with interpersonal trauma histories. However, these interventions have not been assessed among those reporting childhood emotional abuse, a group with the most distress. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver near-real-time psychosocial interventions in daily life, offer the possibility of increasing intervention efficacy. This randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and efficacy of an EMI for reducing psychological distress among students with and without an emotional abuse history. Undergraduate students (N = 382) were randomly assigned to receive (a) an EMI that taught stress management skills, or (b) an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with self-monitoring of stressors and mood. Both the EMI and EMA lasted for 14 days. Participants completed outcome measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress symptoms) at pretest, posttest, and 3-week follow-up. Overall, the EMI appeared feasible, acceptable, and usable, with 80% to 91% completion rates. Linear mixed models indicated that there were no significant Condition × Time interaction effects in the total sample, with decreases in perceived stress and increases in positive affect over time regardless of condition (EMI vs. EMA). Moderation analyses indicated that the EMI was generally more effective for those with a history of emotional abuse and that the EMA was more effective for those without such a history. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that participants wrote less in the EMI than in a web-based version of the intervention. Future interventions could target at-risk groups based on trauma history or baseline distress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

C-LEARN is designed to determine how to build a service program and individual client capacity to improve mental health-related quality of life among individuals at risk for depression, with exposure to social risk factors or concerns about environmental hazards in areas of Southern Louisiana at risk for events such as hurricanes and storms. The study uses a Community Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR) framework to incorporate community priorities into study design and implementation. The first phase of C-LEARN is assessment of community priorities, assets, and opportunities for building resilience through key informant interviews and community agency outreach. Findings from this phase will inform the implementation of a two-level (program-level and individual client level) randomized study in up to four South Louisiana communities. Within communities, health and social-community service programs will be randomized to Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) for multi-sector coalition support or Technical Assistance (TA) for individual program support to implement evidence-based and community-prioritized intervention toolkits, including an expanded version of depression collaborative care and resources (referrals, manuals) to address social risk factors such as financial or housing instability and for a community resilience approach to disaster preparedness and response. Within each arm, the study will randomize individual adult clients to one of two mobile applications that provide informational resources on services for depression, social risk factors, and disaster response or also provide psychoeducation on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to enhance coping with stress and mood. Planned data collection includes baseline, six-month and brief monthly surveys for clients, and baseline and 12-month surveys for administrators and staff."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The use of mobile health (mHealth) has become common in recent years and is regarded as one of the most effective interventions for developing disease-specific management skills and establishing confidence in making preventive health behavior changes and accomplishing health-related goals among community-dwelling older adults. Most mHealth designs adopt a reactive care approach whereby health care professionals do not respond until they receive abnormal assessment results from the database or a message or signal from the client. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a proactive mobile health application program with the support of a community health-social care team for older adults dwelling in the community on improving their self-care health management.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a three-armed, randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted in 7 community centers with an estimated sample size of 282 participants. The participants will be randomly assigned to mHealth with interactivity, mHealth, and control groups when they are (1) aged 60 or above, (2) complaining chiefly of pain, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, (3) living within the service areas, and (4) smartphone users. Subjects in the mHealth with interactivity group will receive 2 main elements, the mHealth application and nurse case management supported by a social service team. The mHealth group will receive the mHealth application only. The primary outcome measure will be self-efficacy, and secondary outcomes will include self-management outcomes (pain score, blood pressure, capillary blood glucose), client outcomes (quality of life, depression), and health service utilization outcomes (institutionalization and health service utilization [general practitioner, outpatient clinic, emergency room, hospital admission]). Data will be collected before intervention, after intervention, and 3 months after intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The incremental benefits of adding interactivity in the mHealth program have not been confirmed. This present study will add valuable information to the knowledge gap of whether mHealth with nurse interaction supported by a health-social partnership can improve self-care management among community-dwelling older adults."

This study evaluated the feasibility of a technology-assisted collaborative care (TCC) program for depression in people with diabetes and/or high blood pressure (DM/HBP) attending a primary health care (PHC) facility in Santiago, Chile. Twenty people diagnosed with DM/HBP having a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 15 points were recruited. The TCC program consisted of a face-to-face, computer-assisted psychosocial intervention (CPI, five biweekly sessions), telephone monitoring (TM), and a mobile phone application for behavioral activation (CONEMO). Assessments of depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes were made. Thirteen patients completed the CAPI, 12 received TM, and none tried CONEMO. The TCC program was potentially efficacious in treating depression, with two-thirds of participants achieving response to depression treatment 12 weeks after baseline. Decreases were observed in depressive symptoms and healthcare visits and increases in mental health-related quality of life and adherence to treatment. Patients perceived the CPI as acceptable. The TCC program was partially feasible and potentially efficacious for managing depression in people with DM/HBP. These data are valuable inputs for a future randomized clinical trial."

However, given the high rates of nonresponse and relapse, there is a need for optimization. Studies suggest that outcomes can be improved by increasing the treatment dose via, for example, the continuous web-based application of therapy strategies between sessions. The strong emphasis in CBASP on the therapeutic relationship, combined with limited therapeutic availabilities, encourages the addition of web-based interventions to face-to-face therapy in terms of blended therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to test an app-based intervention called CBASPath, which was designed to be used as a blended therapy tool.

Overall, they reported good usability and quality ratings along with high user satisfaction. All participants showed favorable engagement with CBASPath; however, the frequency of use differed widely among the participants and assessment points. Situational analysis was used by all participants, and the number of completed modules ranged from 1 to 7.

Therapeutic guidance might contribute to high adherence and increase patient self-management. A few adjustments, such as saving entries directly in the app, could facilitate higher user engagement. A randomized controlled trial is now needed to investigate the efficacy and added value of this blended approach. In the long term, CBASPath could help optimize persistent depressive disorder treatment and reduce relapse by intensifying therapy and providing long-term patient support through the app."

A single-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized, dynamic, and stratified intervention strategy based on an app. Four health centers will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to an intervention group (two centers) and a control group (two centers). Participants (n = 426) will be enrolled from the four selected health centers, with 213 in each group. The intervention group will receive the interventions personalized by the feature-matching algorithm of the user profile and be reassigned to the low-risk group (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] < 9) or moderate/high-risk group (9 ≤ EPDS < 13 and EPDS ≥ 13, but not meeting the criteria for PND) for intervention based on each EPDS score until 6 months after delivery. The control group will receive the same intervention components of the app but without the dynamic, personalized, and stratified function. Depression status, negative emotion symptoms, parental competence, and sample dropout rate will be measured at different weeks of pregnancy (12-16 [baseline], 24, 37) and at 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months after delivery. Follow-up evaluation (t6: 12 months after delivery) will also be conducted. If the intervention is effective, it will provide a personalized, time-friendly, and dynamic intervention for preventing PND. This phenomenon can effectively reduce the sample dropout rate and provide an empirical basis for promoting maternal mental health."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite the growing prevalence of people with complex conditions and evidence of the positive impact of telemonitoring for single conditions, little research exists on telemonitoring for this population.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial and embedded qualitative study aims to evaluate the impact on and experiences of patients and health care providers (HCPs) using a telemonitoring system with decision support to manage patients with complex conditions, including those with multiple chronic conditions, compared with the standard of care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A pragmatic, unblinded, 6-month randomized controlled trial sought to recruit 146 patients with ≥1 diagnosis of heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension (HT), and insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (DM) from outpatient specialty settings in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants were randomized into the control and telemonitoring groups, with the latter being instructed to take readings relevant to their conditions. The telemonitoring system contained an algorithm that generated decision support in the form of actionable self-care directives to patients and alerts to HCPs. The primary outcome was health status (36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included anxiety and depression, self-efficacy in chronic disease management, and self-reported health service use. HF-related quality of life and self-care measures were also collected from patients followed for HF. Within- and between-group change scores were analyzed for statistical significance (P<.05). A convenience sample of HCPs and patients in the intervention group was interviewed about their experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 96 patients were recruited and randomized. Recruitment was terminated early because of implementation challenges and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant within- and between-group differences were found for the main primary and secondary outcomes. However, a within-group analysis of patients with HF found improvements in self-care maintenance (P=.04) and physical quality of life (P=.046). Opinions expressed by the 5 HCPs and 13 patients who were interviewed differed based on the monitored conditions. Although patients with HF reported benefitting from actionable self-care guidance and meaningful interactions with their HCPs, patient and HCP users of the DM and HT modules did not think telemonitoring improved the clinical management of those conditions to the same degree. These differing experiences were largely attributed to the siloed nature of specialty care and the design of the decision support, whereby fluctuations in the status of HT and DM typically required less urgent interventions compared with patients with HF.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We recommend that future research conceive telemonitoring as a program and that self-management and clinical decision support are necessary but not sufficient components of such programs for patients with complex conditions and lower acuity. We conclude that telemonitoring for patients with complex conditions or within multidisciplinary care settings may be best operationalized through nurse-led models of care.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03127852; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03127852.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      RR2-10.2196/resprot.8367."

            "abstract": "Background: According to the expansion of suicide prevention applications in recent years, the aim of this study was to review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pretest-posttest studies that evaluated the effectiveness of suicide prevention applications. Methods: In this systematic review, we searched online databases including Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Chocrane Database, and Google Scholar to find randomized controlled trials and pretest-posttest studies published up to Jul 18, 2019. Randomized controlled trials and pretest-posttest of efficacy self-guided telephone applications that reported any primary and secondary outcome of suicidal thoughts and behaviors were included in the review. We evaluated the articles using the CONSORT 2010 checklist. Results: After screening articles, 7 studies were included in this review. Four studies focused on the effectiveness of applications on suicide thoughts and attempt, 2 on effectiveness of applications on self-injury, 4 on depression and anxiety, 1 on impulsivity, and 2 on adaptive strategies. Overall, mobile phone applications were associated with reductions in suicidal ideation scores at post intervention, and enhancement of adaptive skills; however, no evidence of reduction was reported in impulsivity after use of applications. Conclusion: Despite the differences in studies, this review showed that the use of mobile applications had an overall positive effect on reducing the risk of suicide and improving performance and health of patients."

However, available results from randomised controlled trials are conflicting. Moreover, it is yet not clear whether guided or unguided self-help iSMI provide better value for money. Internet-based mental health interventions without guidance are often much less effective than interventions including at least some guidance from a professional. However, direct comparisons in randomised controlled trials are scarce and, to the best of our knowledge, the comparative (cost)-effectiveness of guided vs. unguided iSMI has not yet been studied. Hence, this study investigates the acceptability and (cost-) effectiveness of minimal guided and unguided iSMI in employees with heightened levels of perceived stress.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A three-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to compare a minimal guided and unguided iSMI with a waiting list control condition (WLC). Both active conditions are based on the same iSMI, i.e. GET.ON Stress, and differ only with regard to the guidance format. Employees with heightened levels of perceived stress (PSS ≥ 22) will be randomised to one of three conditions. Primary outcome will be comparative changes in perceived stress (PSS). Secondary outcomes include changes in self-reported depression, work-engagement, presenteeism and absenteeism. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective, including both direct medical costs and costs related to productivity losses. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted from the employer's perspective. Incremental net-benefit regression analyses will address the question if there are any baseline factors (i.e. subgroups of employees) associated with particularly favorable cost-effectiveness when the experimental intervention is offered. Assessments take place at baseline, 7 weeks post-treatment and 6 months after randomisation.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Online-based (guided) self-help interventions could be an acceptable, effective and economically sustainable approach to offer evidence-based intervention alternatives to reduce the negative consequences associated with work-related stress. This study evaluates the (cost-) effectiveness of two versions of an iSMI, minimal guided and unguided iSMI.

Innovative programs are needed to support both maternal mental health and parenting, and to buffer the long-term impacts of stress on young children. Using a patient-oriented approach, our research team aimed to co-develop and pilot test an App-based psychoeducation and social-connection platform: Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The co-development process involved a parent advisory board from conceptualization and design, through to direct participation in the program delivery. The BEAM program includes weekly videos and activities based on Unified Protocol therapy modules and emotion-focused parenting strategies, a weekly telehealth group review session, and access to a private online forum for support from other mothers and clinical coaches. A parallel randomized control trial was conducted across two provinces in Canada. Mothers of preschool children (aged 18-36 months old), with moderate-to-severe depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9 ≥ 10), were recruited online and randomized to either the 10-week BEAM intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) control group. Online surveys (ensuring researcher blinding) included questions about feasibility and acceptability of the program and pre/post self-report measures of mental health, parenting, positive coping and child behavior outcomes. The primary outcome measures were symptoms of depression and parenting stress. Data were analyzed using mixed models and an intention-to-treat approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      65 participants were randomized, by an online allocation tool, to the BEAM (n = 33) and TAU (n = 32) groups. Engagement was relatively high at the beginning of the program, with 78.8% starting the BEAM App and 70.6% attending ≥1 telehealth session. Most respondents felt socially supported, satisfied with the App, and found it easy to use. Pre-post results indicated interaction effects with greater reductions in overall mental health problems, and specifically anxiety and sleep symptoms, among BEAM vs. control participants. There were also time effects with reductions in depression symptoms across both groups. No significant treatment effects emerged for the other mental health symptoms, parenting problems, positive coping, or child behavior outcomes.

Information technology offers an opportunity to more closely engage patients with chronic HIV infection in their long-term management and support a focus on HRQL. However, the implementation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, such as HRQL in routine care, is challenged by the need to synthesize data generated by questionnaires, the complexity of collecting data between patient visits, and the integration of results into clinical decision-making processes.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our aim is to design and pilot-test a multimedia software platform to overcome these challenges and provide a vehicle to increase focus on HRQL issues in HIV management.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multidisciplinary team in France and Australia conducted the study with 120 patients and 16 doctors contributing to the design and development of the software. We used agile development principles, user-centered design, and qualitative research methods to develop and pilot the software platform. We developed a prototype application to determine the acceptability of the software and piloted the final version with 41 Australian and 19 French residents using 2 validated electronic questionnaires, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items, and the Patient Reported Outcomes Quality of Life-HIV.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Testing of the prototype demonstrated that patients wanted an application that was intuitive and without excessive instruction, so it felt effortless to use, as well as secure and discreet. Clinicians wanted the PRO data synthesized, presented clearly and succinctly, and clinically actionable. Safety concerns for patients and clinicians included confidentiality, and the potential for breakdown in communication if insufficient user training was not provided. The final product, piloted with patients from both countries, showed that most respondents found the application easy to use and comprehend. The usability testing survey administered found that older Australians had reduced scores for understanding the visual interface (P=.004) and finding the buttons organized (P=.02). Three-fourths of the respondents were concerned with confidentiality (P=.007), and this result was more prevalent in participants with higher anxiety and stress scores (P=.01), as measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items. These statistical associations were not observed in 15 French patients who completed the same questionnaire.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Digital applications in health care should be safe and fit for purpose. Our software was acceptable to patients and shows potential to overcome some barriers to the implementation of PROs in routine care. The design of the clinicians' interface presents a solution to the problem of voluminous data, both synthesizing and providing a snapshot of longitudinal data. The next stage is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether patients experience increased satisfaction with care and whether doctors perceive that they deliver better clinical care without compromising efficiency."

This study was conducted in 6 clinical trial research sites in the United States from December 2018 to September 2019. The primary outcome, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week 12 or the last available visit, was analyzed using the mixed-effects regression model for repeated measures, applied to an intent-to-treat sample.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total PANSS scores slightly decreased from baseline over the study period in both groups; the treatment difference at day 85 between PEAR-004 and sham was 2.7 points, in favor of the sham (2-sided P=.09). The secondary scales found no benefit, except for transient improvement in depressive symptoms with PEAR-004. Application engagement was good, and patient and clinical investigator satisfaction was high. No safety concerns were observed. There was some evidence of study site heterogeneity for the onboarding processes and directions on PEAR-004 product use at baseline and throughout the study.

Patients with depression often do not receive adequate treatment. App-based psychotherapy is considered to have great potential to treat depression owing to its reach and easy accessibility.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aim to analyze the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 23, 2020. We selected randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized studies and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies) were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, we pooled data using random effects meta-analyses to obtain estimates of the effect size of the intervention. We conducted post hoc meta-regression analyses to explore the factors associated with intervention success.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After screening 3468 unique references retrieved from bibliographic searches and assessing the eligibility of 79 full texts, we identified 12 trials (2859 participants) evaluating 14 different interventions. Of 14 trials, 7 (58%) were conducted in the United States; 3 (25%) trials, in Asia (Japan, South Korea, and China); 1 (8%) trial, in Australia; and 1 (8%) trial, in Germany. Of the 12 trials, 5 (42%) trials presented a low risk of bias. The mean duration of the interventions was 6.6 (SD 2.8) weeks. Two-thirds of the interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy alone or included it in combination with cognitive control therapy, positive psychology, brief behavioral activation, or mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapy. With no evidence of publication bias, a pooled analysis of 83% (10/12) of the trials and 86% (12/14) of the interventions showed that app-based interventions, compared with a control group receiving usual care or minimal intervention, produced a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.33; 2018/2859, 70.58% of the participants; I2=70%). Our meta-regression analyses indicated that there was a greater reduction in symptoms of depression (P=.04) in trials that included participants with moderate to severe depression (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.55), compared with trials with participants exhibiting mild to moderate depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.12).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      App-based interventions targeted at people with depression produce moderate reductions in the symptoms of depression.

Internet- and mobile-based interventions for physical activity have shown promising results in helping users increase or maintain their level of physical activity in general and specifically in secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cardiac rehabilitation. One component related to the efficacy of these interventions is tailoring of the content to the individual.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our trial assessed the effect of a longitudinally tailored Internet- and mobile-based intervention for physical activity as an extension of a face-to-face cardiac rehabilitation stay.

The participants were randomized in monthly clusters to a tailored or nontailored (control) intervention group. All participants had access to a website with information regarding cardiac rehabilitation, an online discussion forum, and an online activity calendar. Those using the tailored intervention received tailored content based on models of health behavior via the website and mobile fully automated text messages. The main outcome was self-reported level of physical activity, which was obtained using an online international physical activity questionnaire at baseline, at discharge, and at 1 month and 3 months after discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Included in the study were 69 participants.

Following our preregistered analysis plan and consistent with hypotheses, assignment to the HMP predicted significantly larger reductions in psychological distress, our primary outcome, at post-intervention (Cohen's d=-0.52, 95% confidence interval [-0.68, -0.37], p<.001) and at the three-month follow-up (d=-0.33 [-0.48, -0.18], p<.001). Also consistent with hypotheses, we observed similar indications of immediate and sustained benefit following the HMP on all six preregistered secondary outcomes selected to tap skills targeted in the app (e.g., perseverative thinking, social connection, well-being; absolute ds=0.19-0.42, all ps<.031 corrected except mindful action at follow-up). We found no evidence for elevated adverse events and the HMP was equally effective among participants with elevated baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms. These data suggest that the HMP may be an effective and scalable approach to supporting the mental health and well-being of teachers and other school system employees, with implications for employee retention and performance, and student outcomes."

            "title": "Molehill Mountain feasibility study: Protocol for a non-randomised pilot trial of a novel app-based anxiety intervention for autistic people.",
            "abstract": "Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available (e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged ≥16-years with an existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms (trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a self-guided app-based intervention-'Molehill Mountain'. Primary (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary outcome measures and survey/ interview)-with both objectives further informed by a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes."

Telehealth can be a feasible method to improve adherence and interventional support for breast cancer patients, of which most do not meet sufficient physical activity levels after diagnosis. The Adaptations to Breast Cancer and Exercise Using Telehealth (ABRACE: Telehealth) study aims to investigate the effects of a 12-week telehealth multicomponent training program plus a health education program (MTHE), compared to a health education program alone (HE), on physical and psychological outcomes in breast cancer patients undergoing treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Women undergoing primary treatment (during or after chemotherapy) for breast cancer (stages I-III) will be randomly assigned to MTHE (twice a week) or HE (once a week). MTHE components are mobility, aerobic, balance, resistance, and flexibility home-based exercises, supervised by video call. The primary study outcome is cancer-related fatigue. The secondary outcomes are quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety, physical activity level, cancer-related cognitive impairment, and functional capacity. Other outcomes are adherence to interventions and a follow-up questionnaire evaluating the individual perception in motivation, lifestyle changes, and main barriers to participation.

            "abstract": "This study leverages data from a pilot randomized controlled trial to investigate whether the effectiveness of a text-delivered mHealth intervention targeting adolescent depression and anxiety differs according to residential- and activity space-based measures of exposure to community-level socioeconomic disadvantage. For depression, we find that intervention efficacy is significantly stronger for youth residing in more disadvantaged neighborhoods, even after controlling for individual level socioeconomic status, as well as marginal moderating effects of activity space-based neighborhood disadvantage on treatment efficacy. We do not find evidence of treatment efficacy moderation by neighborhood disadvantage regarding anxiety. While the generalizability of our findings is restricted to this sample and for this intervention, this research serves as a motivating example and initial evidence for how mHealth intervention efficacy can vary by characteristics of the environment, in particular community-level disadvantage. Future clinical research should investigate whether the effectiveness of mHealth interventions may be enhanced by personalization based on an individual's contextual environmental exposures."

Adults with SCD and significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score ≥ 10) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7] score ≥ 10) were eligible to participate and be randomized to either receive eight sessions of cCBT with care coach support or treatment as usual. Participants reported daily pain and mood symptoms using a mobile diary app. Depression, anxiety, and pain symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Thirty patients were enrolled: 18 to cCBT, and 12 to control. The cCBT intervention was feasible to implement in clinical settings and acceptable to participants. Patients in the cCBT arm reported a marginally greater decrease in depression at 6 months (-3.82, SE = 1.30) than those in the control group (-0.50, SE = 1.60; p = .06). There were no significant effects of treatment on anxiety; however, cCBT was associated with improved daily pain reported via a mobile diary app (p = .014). cCBT, delivered via mobile device, is a feasible strategy to provide mental health care to adults living with SCD. cCBT was acceptable to the target population; was able to be implemented in real-world, nonideal conditions; and has the potential to improve patient-reported outcomes."

Results Eighty-one participants with a baseline HbA1c of 8.98% ± 1.82 were randomised to the intervention ( n = 45) and standard care ( n = 36). The Group by Time effect revealed MTH did not significantly influence HbA1c ( p = 0.228), but p values were borderline significant for blood pressure ( p = 0.054) and mental-health related quality of life ( p = 0.057). Examination of effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for mean group differences at nine months supported the existence of a protective effect of MTH on mental health-related quality of life as well as depression. None of the other measured outcomes were found to be affected by the MTH intervention. Conclusions Findings from this study must be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, but they do not support the widespread adoption of MTH to achieve clinically significant changes in HbA1c.

Access to ongoing psychosocial interventions through technological platforms may potentially minimise diabetes complications and improve health-related outcomes. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such interventions on diabetes distress and health-related outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To synthesise the best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of technology-based psychosocial interventions on diabetes distress, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and HbA1c level in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A search of eleven databases was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials that examined the effects of technology-based psychosocial interventions on the outcomes. Randomised controlled trials reported in English from 2010 to 2020 were included. Selection of studies, quality appraisal, and data extraction were conducted by two reviewers independently. Meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were performed using Review Manager. Intervention effects was measured using standardise mean difference.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty randomised controlled trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 18 randomised controlled trials were included in meta-analysis. technology-based psychosocial interventions improved diabetes distress, self-efficacy and HbA1c levels with significant and small effect sizes. Subgroup analyses revealed greater improvement in health-related quality of life for participants with comorbid depression and lower HbA1c levels for studies with lesser than 100 participants.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this review increase knowledge on the effectiveness of technology-based psychosocial interventions on diabetes distress and self-efficacy. However, evidence to support the effects of technology-based psychosocial interventions on HbA1c and health-related quality of life was not strong. More research is needed to examine the effectiveness of the psychosocial interventions delivered through mobile applications or virtual reality."

ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting.\n    \n\n\n          Enrollment status:\n        \n      \n      A total of 36 (90%) of 40 ICU physicians have been randomized and 83 (52%) of 160 patient-family dyads have been enrolled to date.

This painful injury can be devastating-with a high associated mortality rate-and survivors likely to be more dependent and less mobile. Pain relief at the scene of injury is known to be inadequate. Intravenous morphine is usually given by paramedics, but opioids are less effective for dynamic pain and can cause serious side effects, including nausea, constipation, delirium and respiratory depression. These may delay surgery, require further treatment and worsen patient outcomes. We completed a feasibility study of paramedic-provided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB), testing the intervention, trial methods and data collection.

Kokoro-App consists of three cognitive behavioral skills of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, with corresponding worksheets to fill in. All activities of the participants learning each session of the program and completing each worksheet were uploaded onto Kokoro-Web, which each patient could use for self-check. We examined what use characteristics differentiated the more successful users of the CBT app from the less successful ones, split at the median of change in depression severity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 81 patients with major depression were allocated to the smartphone CBT.

However, the former completed more behavioral activation tasks, engaged in different types of activities, and also filled in more cognitive restructuring worksheets than the latter. Activities such as \"test-drive a new car,\" \"go to a coffee shop after lunch,\" or \"call up an old friend\" were found to be particularly rewarding.

However, more mHealth+CP patients reported taking medications as prescribed at 6 months (8.8% more, 95% CI 1.2-16.5, P=.02) and 12 months (13.8% more, CI 3.7-23.8, P<.01), and 10.2% more mHealth+CP patients reported talking with their CarePartner at least twice per week at the 6-month follow-up (P=.048). mHealth+CP patients were less likely to report negative emotions during those interactions at both endpoints (both P<.05), were consistently more likely to report taking medications as prescribed during weekly IVR assessments, and also were less likely to report breathing problems or weight gains (all P<.05). Among patients with more depressive symptoms at enrollment, those randomized to mHealth+CP were more likely than standard mHealth patients to report excellent or very good general health during weekly IVR calls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compared to a relatively intensive model of IVR monitoring, self-management assistance, and clinician alerts, a model including automated feedback to an informal caregiver outside the household improved HF patients' medication adherence and caregiver communication. mHealth+CP may also decrease patients' risk of HF exacerbations related to shortness of breath and sudden weight gains. mHealth+CP may improve quality of life among patients with greater depressive symptoms.

            "abstract": "Many women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) report high depression rates. The relationship between PCOS and these high depression rates is unclear. Two-component lifestyle interventions have revealed short-term effects on depression scores in this group of women. In general, 3-component interventions including diet, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are more effective in the long-term to improve emotional well-being. This has not yet been studied in women with PCOS. This study examined the effect of 20 CBT lifestyle (LS) sessions combined with a healthy diet and physical therapy with or without 9 months additional feedback through Short Message Service (SMS) via mobile phone, compared to care as usual (CAU, involving advice to lose weight). In this secondary analysis, 155 women with PCOS and a BMI above 25 kg/m2 were eligible. Depression scores decreased significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.045). In both the LS programme without SMS (P = 0.036) and the LS programme with SMS (P = 0.011) depression scores decreased while no change was observed in CAU (P = 0.875). Self-esteem scores improved significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.027). No differences in body image scores were observed in LS participants compared to CAU (P = 0.087), although body image improved significantly in both the LS without SMS (P = 0.001) and with SMS (P = 0.008) study arms. We found no significant mediating role by androgens in the relationship between LS participants and emotional well-being. Only weight-loss mediated the relationship between LS and self-esteem. To conclude, a three-component lifestyle intervention programme with or without additional SMS resulted in significant improvements in depression and self-esteem compared to CAU, in women with PCOS, obesity, and a wish to achieve a pregnancy. Testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, insulin, HOMA-IR, and cortisol did not mediate this effect. Weight loss mediated the effects on self-esteem but not on depression and body-image. This suggests that lifestyle treatment independent of weight loss can reduce depression and body-image, but both lifestyle treatment and weight loss can improve self-esteem. Thus, a three-component lifestyle intervention based on CBT could prove successful in improving mood in women with PCOS who are overweight or obese and attempting to become pregnant."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Diabetes is a complex, demanding disease that requires the constant attention of patients. The burden of self-management, including different medication regimens, routine self-care activities, and provider visits, has an impact on patients' emotional well-being. Diabetes distress and depression are two important components of emotional well-being that may negatively affect diabetes outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim was to determine the impact of the 1-year Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study cluster randomized clinical trial on emotional well-being measured by diabetes distress and depression among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 163 adults with not-well-managed T2D were enrolled from community primary care practices. Primary care practices were cluster randomized into either a usual care control group or intervention group. Intervention participants were given a mobile phone with coaching software including a Web portal to communicate with providers. A priori established secondary outcomes included distress measured by the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), with subscales measuring emotional burden, interpersonal distress, physician-related distress, and regimen-related distress, as well as depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Linear mixed models were used to calculate the effect of the intervention on diabetes distress levels over time, both overall and separately by sex, and to determine if the intervention affected distress or depression. The impact of total DDS on changes in HbA1c was also studied.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no significant treatment group effects for DDS total (baseline: P=.07; differences over time: P=.38) or for depression (P=.06 over time). Significant declines in total DDS were observed over the 12-month intervention period (P=.01). Regimen-related distress significantly decreased for all study participants (P<.001), but no significant change over time was observed for emotional burden (P=.83), interpersonal distress (P=.64), or physician-related distress (P=.73). Women in both the usual care and intervention groups were more likely to have higher overall DDS, emotional burden, physician-related distress, and regimen-related distress, but not interpersonal distress. Women also reported higher baseline depression compared to men (P=.006). Overall, depression decreased over the treatment period (P=.007), but remained unaffected by group assignment (P=.06) or by sex (P=.97). Diabetes distress had no effect on the change in HbA1c (P=.91) over the treatment period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although we found no definitive overall or sex-specific effect of the intervention on diabetes distress or depression, this study makes an important contribution to the understanding of mobile health interventions and the impact on emotional health. Our study verified previous work that although diabetes distress and depression are highly correlated, these measures are not evaluating the same construct. Design of future mobile technology provides an opportunity to personalize, contextualize, and intervene in the emotional well-being of persons with diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01107015; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01107015 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6vVgRCLAF)."

As long as the COVID-19 pandemic is ever on the rise, the psychological pandemic of the disease is on the rise, too. The high prevalence of COVID-19 has further increased physicians' work pressure. Patients' needs are not met adequately by physicians. It seems essential to use aids to monitor patients' needs and serve them properly. Thus, in the present research, suggestions are made on how to evaluate patients' physical and psychological conditions during the treatment via a mobile application. Methods and Analysis: The present research is a randomized, two parallel-group, controlled trial. One-hundred-twelve inpatients diagnosed with the coronavirus will be assigned randomly to the control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, a mobile application will be provided to educate patients, establish two-way interactions between patients and care providers and record patients' symptoms. Those in the control group will receive the usual care. The primary outcome is the change to the depression anxiety stress scales-21 (DASS-21) score from the baseline to 2 weeks after discharge from hospital. It will be measured at the baseline, at the time of discharge, and two weeks later. Ethics and Dissemination: The Ethics committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences' approval date was 2020-04-19 with IR.MUMS.REC.1399.118 reference code.

Acceptability was measured by examining self-reports and user engagement with the program. The primary outcome was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) change score between pre- and postintervention at 2 months, as collected in usual care by clinicians blinded to the study questions. Using a propensity score matching to control for potential confounders, we compared women receiving 7Cups to women receiving treatment as usual (TAU).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants (n=19) proactively logged into 7Cups for a median of 12 times and 175 minutes. Program use was mostly through the mobile app (median of mobile use 94%) and between 18:00 and 08:00 when clinicians are unavailable (68% of total program use time). Participants chatted with volunteers for a total of 3064 minutes and have indicated in their responses 0 instances in which they felt unsafe. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that 7Cups recipients experienced significant decreases in EPDS scores (P<.001, Cohen d=1.17). No significant difference in EPDS decrease over time was found between 7Cups and TAU, yet the effect size was medium favoring 7Cups (P=.05, Cohen d=0.58).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study supports using a computerized method to train lay people, without any in-person guidance or screening, and engage them with patients diagnosed with mental illness as part of usual care. The medium effect size (d=0.58) favoring the 7Cups group relative to TAU suggests that 7Cups might enhance treatment outcomes. A fully powered trial has to be conducted to examine this effect."

Elevated stress reactivity is one of the most widely studied mechanisms underlying psychotic and affective mental health problems. Thus, targeting stress reactivity in youth is a promising indicated and translational preventive strategy for adverse mental health outcomes that could develop later in life and for improving resilience. Compassion-focused interventions offer a wide range of innovative therapeutic techniques that are particularly amenable to being implemented as ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), a specific type of mobile health intervention, to enable youth to access interventions in a given moment and context in daily life.

            "abstract": "The predictD is an intervention implemented by general practitioners (GPs) to prevent depression, which reduced the incidence of depression-anxiety and was cost-effective. The e-predictD study aims to design, develop, and evaluate an evolved predictD intervention to prevent the onset of major depression in primary care based on Information and Communication Technologies, predictive risk algorithms, decision support systems (DSSs), and personalized prevention plans (PPPs). A multicenter cluster randomized trial with GPs randomly assigned to the e-predictD intervention + care-as-usual (CAU) group or the active-control + CAU group and 1-year follow-up is being conducted. The required sample size is 720 non-depressed patients (aged 18-55 years), with moderate-to-high depression risk, under the care of 72 GPs in six Spanish cities. The GPs assigned to the e-predictD-intervention group receive brief training, and those assigned to the control group do not. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the e-predictD group download the e-predictD app, which incorporates validated risk algorithms to predict depression, monitoring systems, and DSSs. Integrating all inputs, the DSS automatically proposes to the patients a PPP for depression based on eight intervention modules: physical exercise, social relationships, improving sleep, problem-solving, communication skills, decision-making, assertiveness, and working with thoughts. This PPP is discussed in a 15-min semi-structured GP-patient interview. Patients then choose one or more of the intervention modules proposed by the DSS to be self-implemented over the next 3 months. This process will be reformulated at 3, 6, and 9 months but without the GP-patient interview. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the control-group+CAU download another version of the e-predictD app, but the only intervention that they receive via the app is weekly brief psychoeducational messages (active-control group). The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of major depression measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at 6 and 12 months. Other outcomes include depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depression risk (predictD risk algorithm), mental and physical quality of life (SF-12), and acceptability and satisfaction ('e-Health Impact' questionnaire) with the intervention. Patients are evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US $210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization, all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02335554; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02335554 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6dGXKWjWE)."

However, scalable interventions have not been established yet.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study was designed to test the efficacy of two adolescent health promotion interventions: a well-care visit (WCV) with a risk assessment interview and counseling and self-monitoring with a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app. Our hypothesis was that participants who had received both WCV and the CBT app would have better outcomes than those who had received only WCV or those who had not received any intervention. We conducted a prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were 217 adolescents aged 13-18 years.

A smartphone-based CBT program was developed based on the CBT approach. The CBT app comprised a 1-week psychoeducation component and a 1-week self-monitoring component. During the CBT program, participants created several self-monitoring sheets based on the CBT model with five window panels: event, thoughts, feelings, body response, and actions. The primary outcome was the change in scores for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores for self-esteem, quality of life, self-monitoring, and an adolescent health promotion scale.

The objective of this study was to assess whether a therapeutic smartphone application (\"LifeBuoy\") was superior to an attention-matched control application at reducing the severity of suicidal ideation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      In this 2-arm parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 455 young adults from Australia experiencing recent suicidal ideation and aged 18 to 25 years were randomly assigned in a 2:2 ratio to use a smartphone application for 6 weeks in May 2020, with the final follow-up in October 2020. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation symptom severity scores from baseline (T0) to postintervention (T1) and 3-month postintervention follow-up (T2), measured using the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). Secondary outcomes were symptom changes in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), distress (Distress Questionnaire-5, DQ5), and well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, SWEMWBS). This trial was conducted online, using a targeted social media recruitment strategy. The intervention groups were provided with a self-guided smartphone application based on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; \"LifeBuoy\") to improve emotion regulation and distress tolerance. The control group were provided a smartphone application that looked like LifeBuoy (\"LifeBuoy-C\"), but delivered general (nontherapeutic) information on a range of health and lifestyle topics. Among 228 participants randomized to LifeBuoy, 110 did not complete the final survey; among 227 participants randomized to the control condition, 91 did not complete the final survey.

A total of 60% of the participants with PHQ-9 scores above the cutoff for major depression at baseline (PHQ≥10) reported clinically significant improvement at the 12-month follow-up (at least 50% reduction in PHQ-9 score and postprogram score <10). Participants also reported reductions in symptoms of anxiety that were maintained for at least 6 months after the program (4.26-point reduction in GAD-7 score, 95% CI 3.14-5.38; P<.001; Hedges g=0.91, 95% CI 0.54-1.28).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is limited evidence on whether outcomes associated with smartphone-based interventions for common mental health problems are maintained posttreatment. Participants who enrolled in Ascend experienced clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety that were maintained for up to 1 year and 6 months after the intervention, respectively. Future randomized trials are warranted to test Ascend as a scalable solution to the treatment of depression and anxiety."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow obstruction due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, for example, cigarette smoke. The pattern of care for people with moderate to very severe COPD often involves regular lengthy hospital admissions, which result in high healthcare costs and an undesirable effect on quality of life. Research over the past decade has focused on innovative methods for developing enabling and assistive technologies that facilitate patient self-management.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions delivered by computer and by mobile technology versus face-to-face or hard copy/digital documentary-delivered interventions, or both, in facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-management among people with COPD.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      In November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and we handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials that measured effects of remote and Web 2.0-based interventions defined as technologies including personal computers (PCs) and applications (apps) for mobile technology, such as iPad, Android tablets, smart phones, and Skype, on behavioural change towards self-management of COPD. Comparator interventions included face-to-face and/or hard copy/digital documentary educational/self-management support.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors (CMcC and MMcC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text study reports for inclusion. Two review authors (CMcC and AMB) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for studies using different outcome measurement scales.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included in our review three studies (Moy 2015; Tabak 2013; Voncken-Brewster 2015) with a total of 1580 randomised participants. From Voncken-Brewster 2015, we included the subgroup of individuals with a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result, the total population available for analysis included 557 participants; 319 received smart technology to support self-management and 238 received face-to-face verbal/written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these studies included outcomes such as self-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression.All three studies included our primary outcome - health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our other primary outcomes - hospital admissions and acute exacerbations. Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001). For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month six, the effect of smart technology on self-management and subsequent HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better than when participants received face-to-face/digital and/or written support for self-management of COPD (SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at 12 months described no significant between-group differences (MD 1.1, 95% CI -2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33) did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart technology was used than when face-to-face/digital and/or written support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95% CI 369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups (mean -108, 95% CI -720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect (OR 1.06, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta-analyses showed no significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi² = 0.39, P = 0.82; I² = 0% and Chi² = 0.01, P = 0.91; I² = 0%, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-managment in people with COPD and delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through face-to-face/digital and/or written support, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration. The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile technology for self-management for people with COPD is not harmful and may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example, those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit.The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals, service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaining self-management. Further research that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed. Researchers should provide clear information on how self-management is assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on behavioural change."

Digital interventions have demonstrated efficacy in the prevention and treatment of depression; however, high dropout rates are a major challenge, particularly in clinical settings.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to identify the predictors of dropout in a digital intervention for the treatment and prevention of depression in patients with comorbid CBP. We assessed which participant characteristics may be associated with dropout and whether intervention usage data could help improve the identification of individuals at risk of dropout early on in treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected from 2 large-scale randomized controlled trials in which 253 patients with a diagnosis of CBP and major depressive disorder or subclinical depressive symptoms received a digital intervention for depression. In the first analysis, participants' baseline characteristics were examined as potential predictors of dropout. In the second analysis, we assessed the extent to which dropout could be predicted from a combination of participants' baseline characteristics and intervention usage variables following the completion of the first module. Dropout was defined as completing <6 modules. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From participants' baseline characteristics, lower level of education (odds ratio [OR] 3.33, 95% CI 1.51-7.32) and both lower and higher age (a quadratic effect; age: OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.82, and age2: OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18-2.04) were significantly associated with a higher risk of dropout. In the analysis that aimed to predict dropout following completion of the first module, lower and higher age (age: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.85; age2: OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.13-2.23), medium versus high social support (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.25-7.33), and a higher number of days to module completion (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) predicted a higher risk of dropout, whereas a self-reported negative event in the previous week was associated with a lower risk of dropout (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.69). A model that combined baseline characteristics and intervention usage data generated the most accurate predictions (area under the receiver operating curve [AUC]=0.72) and was significantly more accurate than models based on baseline characteristics only (AUC=0.70) or intervention usage data only (AUC=0.61). We found no significant influence of pain, disability, or depression severity on dropout.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Dropout can be predicted by participant baseline variables, and the inclusion of intervention usage variables may improve the prediction of dropout early on in treatment. Being able to identify individuals at high risk of dropout from digital health interventions could provide intervention developers and supporting clinicians with the ability to intervene early and prevent dropout from occurring."

At baseline, postintervention (1 month), and 2-month follow-up, participants completed self-reports of primary outcomes (anxiety and depression), secondary outcomes (mindfulness and social support), and emotional suppression as a culturally relevant mechanism of change. Feasibility and acceptability were also evaluated. Using intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, linear mixed effects models showed that compared to social support mHealth, mindfulness mHealth had a superior effect on anxiety (p = .024, between-group d = 0.72). Both conditions improved on depression (baseline-to-FU ds > 1.10, between-group difference not significant, d = 0.36 favoring mindfulness). There was an interaction of Emotional suppression reduction × Condition in the improvement of anxiety and depression. Further, mindfulness mHealth was demonstrated to be more feasible and acceptable in program engagement, evaluation, skills improvement, and perceived benefit. Retention was high in both conditions (>80%). The difference in self-reported adverse effect was nonsignificant (3.9% in mindfulness and 8.7% in social support). Results of this pilot trial suggest that both mindfulness and social support, delivered via mHealth, show promise in reducing distress among young adults in quarantine, with mindfulness being particularly effective in addressing anxiety. Successful implementation and dissemination of this mHealth intervention approach have the potential for addressing the psychological consequences of the pandemic.

The intervention group reported significantly greater medication adherence score (mean difference: 0.58, 95% CI 0.19-0.97; P=.004). The majority of intervention participants reported reading all their text messages (52/61, 85%). The number of visits to the website per person ranged from zero to 100 (median 3) over the 6-month intervention period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A mHealth CR intervention plus usual care showed a positive effect on adherence to multiple lifestyle behavior changes at 3 months in New Zealand adults with CHD compared to usual care alone. The effect was not sustained to the end of the 6-month intervention.

Mobile health technologies may improve noncommunicable disease outcomes, but LMICs lack resources to provide these services. We evaluated the efficacy of a cloud computing model using automated self-management calls plus home blood pressure (BP) monitoring as a strategy for improving systolic BPs (SBPs) and other outcomes of hypertensive patients in two LMICs.\n    \n\n\n          Subjects and methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a randomized trial with a 6-week follow-up. Participants with high SBPs (≥140 mm Hg if nondiabetic and ≥130 mm Hg if diabetic) were enrolled from clinics in Honduras and Mexico. Intervention patients received weekly automated monitoring and behavior change telephone calls sent from a server in the United States, plus a home BP monitor. At baseline, control patients received BP results, hypertension information, and usual healthcare. The primary outcome, SBP, was examined for all patients in addition to a preplanned subgroup with low literacy or high hypertension information needs. Secondary outcomes included perceived health status and medication-related problems.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 200 patients recruited, 181 (90%) completed follow-up, and 117 of 181 had low literacy or high hypertension information needs. The median annual income was $2,900 USD, and average educational attainment was 6.5 years. At follow-up intervention patients' SBPs decreased 4.2 mm Hg relative to controls (95% confidence interval -9.1, 0.7; p=0.09). In the subgroup with high information needs, intervention patients' average SBPs decreased 8.8 mm Hg (-14.2, -3.4, p=0.002). Compared with controls, intervention patients at follow-up reported fewer depressive symptoms (p=0.004), fewer medication problems (p<0.0001), better general health (p<0.0001), and greater satisfaction with care (p≤0.004).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Automated telephone care management plus home BP monitors can improve outcomes for hypertensive patients in LMICs.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Most people with mental health disorders fail to receive timely access to adequate care. US Hispanic/Latino individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who either self-identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three different self-guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence-based therapeutic principles from problem-solving therapy, PST), Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information app that served as an information control).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet-based advertisements, and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self-guided treatment was conducted on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non-Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score≥5 or related functional impairment. Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ-9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale), collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active surveys.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding a sample of 348 active users. Long-term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=-2.66, P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Fully remote mobile-based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants engaged in this type of \"low-touch\" research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user-centered design to determine the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested in using, and strategies for long-term engagement.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01808976; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01808976 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/70xI3ILkz)."

            "abstract": "Late-life depression is heterogenous and patients vary in disease course over time. Most psychotherapy studies measure activity levels and symptoms solely using self-report scales, administered periodically. These scales may not capture granular changes during treatment. We introduce the potential utility of passive sensing data collected with smartphone to assess fluctuations in daily functioning in real time during psychotherapy for late life depression in elder abuse victims. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of passive sensing among depressed elder abuse victims. We present data from three victims who received a 9-week intervention as part of a pilot randomized controlled trial and showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (50% reduction). Using a smartphone, we tracked participants' daily number of smartphone unlocks, time spent at home, time spent in conversation, and step count over treatment. Independent assessment of depressive symptoms and behavioral activation were collected at intake, Weeks 6 and 9. Data revealed patient-level fluctuations in activity level over treatment, corresponding with self-reported behavioral activation. We demonstrate how passive sensing data could expand our understanding of heterogenous presentations of late-life depression among elder abuse. We illustrate how trajectories of change in activity levels as measured with passive sensing and subjective measures can be tracked concurrently over time. We outline challenges and potential solutions for application of passive sensing data collection in future studies with larger samples using novel advanced statistical modeling, such as artificial intelligence algorithms."

The health outcomes were number of depression-free days according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, (DSM-IV) criteria assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders by blinded interviewers after 3, 12, and 24 months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were self-assessed with the three level version of the EuroQol Five Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Costs were assessed with the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated and cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were displayed to assess the probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean total costs over 24 months were €8298 (US $9415) for M-CT and €7296 (US $8278) for TAU. No statistically significant differences were found between M-CT and TAU regarding depression-free days and QALYs (P=.37 and P=.92, respectively). The incremental costs were €179 (US $203) per depression-free day and €230,816 (US $261,875) per QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves suggested that for depression-free days, high investments have to be made to reach an acceptable probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU. Regarding QALYs, considerable investments have to be made but the probability that M-CT is cost effective compared to TAU does not rise above 40%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results suggest that adding M-CT to TAU is not effective and cost effective compared to TAU alone. Adherence rates were similar to other studies and therefore do not explain this finding. The participants scarcely booked additional therapist support, resulting in 17.3 minutes of mean total therapist support. More studies are needed to examine the cost effectiveness of internet-based interventions with respect to long-term outcomes and the role and optimal dosage of therapist support. Overall, more research is needed on scalable and cost-effective interventions that can reduce the burden of recurrent MDD.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Netherlands Trial Register NTR2503; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2503 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/73aBn41r3)."

            "abstract": "Disasters have far-reaching and potentially long-lasting effects on youth and families. Research has consistently shown a clear increase in the prevalence of several mental health disorders after disasters, including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Widely accessible evidence-based interventions are needed to address this unmet need for youth and families, who are underrepresented in disaster research. Rapid growth in Internet and Smartphone access, as well as several Web based evaluation studies with various adult populations has shown that Web-based interventions are likely to be feasible in this context and can improve clinical outcomes. Such interventions also are generally cost-effective, can be targeted or personalized, and can easily be integrated in a stepped care approach to screening and intervention delivery. This is a protocol paper that describes an innovative study design in which we evaluate a self-help Web-based resource, Bounce Back Now, with a population-based sample of disaster affected adolescents and families. The paper includes description and justification for sampling selection and procedures, selection of assessment measures and methods, design of the intervention, and statistical evaluation of critical outcomes. Unique features of this study design include the use of address-based sampling to recruit a population-based sample of disaster-affected adolescents and parents, telephone and Web-based assessments, and development and evaluation of a highly individualized Web intervention for adolescents. Challenges related to large-scale evaluation of technology-delivered interventions with high-risk samples in time-sensitive research are discussed, as well as implications for future research and practice."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Precision medicine, optimized interventions, and access to care are catchphrases for the future of behavioral treatments. Progress has been slow due to the dearth of clinical trials that optimize interventions' benefits, individually tailor interventions to meet individual needs and preferences, and lead to rapid implementation after effectiveness is demonstrated. Two innovations have emerged to meet these challenges: fully remote trials and precision clinical trials.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper provides a detailed description of Mindful MyWay, a study designed to test online mindfulness training in older adults with depression. Consistent with the concept of fully remote trials using a smartphone app, the study requires no in-person contact and can be conducted with participants anywhere in the United States. Based upon the precision medicine framework, the study assesses participants using high-frequency assessments of symptoms, cognitive performance, and patient preferences to both understand the individualized nature of treatment response and help individually tailor the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Mindful MyWay is an open-label early-phase clinical trial for individuals 65 years and older with current depression. A smartphone app was developed to help coordinate the study, deliver the intervention, and evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, as well as predictors and outcomes of it. The curriculum for the fully remote intervention parallels the mindfulness-based stress reduction curriculum, a protocolized group-based mindfulness training that is typically provided in person. After consent and screening, participants download The Healthy Mind Lab mobile health smartphone app from the Apple App Store, allowing them to complete brief smartphone-based assessments of depressive symptoms and cognitive performance 4 times each day for 4 weeks prior to and after completing the intervention. The intervention consists of an introduction video and 10 weekly mindfulness training sessions, with the expectation to practice mindfulness at home daily. The app collects participant preference data throughout the 10-week intervention period; these high-frequency assessments identify participants' individually dynamic preferences toward the goal of optimizing the intervention in future iterations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participant recruitment and data collection began in March 2019.

RAINBOW is a type 1 hybrid design randomized controlled trial. The objective is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and implementation potential of an integrated, technology-enhanced, collaborative care model for treating comorbid obesity and depression in primary care. Obese and depressed adults (n = 404) will be randomized to usual care enhanced with the provision of a pedometer and information about the health system's services for mood or weight management (control) or with the Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight (I-CARE) program (intervention). The 12-month I-CARE program synergistically integrates two proven behavioral interventions: problem-solving therapy with as-needed intensification of pharmacotherapy for depression (PEARLS) and standardized behavioral treatment for obesity (Group Lifestyle Balance(™)). It utilizes traditional (e.g., office visits and phone consults) and emerging care delivery modalities (e.g., patient web portal and mobile applications). Follow-up assessments will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We hypothesize that compared with controls, I-CARE participants will have greater improvements in weight and depression severity measured by the 20-item Depression Symptom Checklist at 12 months, which will be sustained at 24 months. We will also assess I-CARE's cost-effectiveness and use mixed methods to examine its potential for reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This study offers the potential to change how obese and depressed adults are treated-through a new model of accessible and integrative lifestyle medicine and mental health expertise-in primary care."

Offering transdiagnostic, web-based prevention programs such as ICare Prevent to those with subclinical complaints has the potential to reduce some barriers to receiving help (eg, availability of services, privacy considerations, and students' desire for autonomy). However, uptake of these interventions is often low, and accounts of recruitment challenges are needed to complement available effectiveness research in student populations.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aims of this study were to describe recruitment challenges together with effective recruitment strategies for ICare Prevent and provide basic information on the intervention's effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in a student sample with subclinical symptoms of depression and anxiety on the effectiveness of an individually guided (human support and feedback on exercises provided after each session, tailored to each participant) and automatically guided (computer-generated messages provided after each session, geared toward motivation) version of ICare Prevent, a web-based intervention with transdiagnostic components for the indicated prevention of depression and anxiety. The intervention was compared with care as usual.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This is the first update of a review published in 2015, Issue 1. Chronic pain is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes, such as increased severity of pain, reduced function, and low mood. Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. To address barriers to treatment access, such as distance and cost of treatment, technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies remotely. Therapies delivered remotely, such as via the Internet, computer-based programmes, and smartphone applications, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting list, treatment as usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) from inception to May 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remotely-delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries, reference sections, and citations of included studies for potential trials.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included RCTs that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via technology in comparison to an active, treatment as usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and up to 30% face-to-face interaction. Interventions had to be delivered primarily via technology to be included, and we excluded interventions delivered via telephone. We included studies that delivered interventions to children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with a chronic pain condition or where chronic pain was a primary symptom of their condition (e.g. juvenile arthritis). We included studies that reported 10 or more participants in each comparator arm, at each extraction point.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We combined all psychological therapies in the analyses. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. We extracted pain severity/intensity, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events as primary outcomes, and satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between three and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed risk of bias and all outcomes for quality using the GRADE assessment.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We found 10 studies with 697 participants (an additional 4 studies with 326 participants since the previous review) that delivered treatment remotely; four studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one included children with sickle cell disease, one included children with irritable bowel syndrome, and three studies included children with different chronic pain conditions (i.e. headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain). The average age of children receiving treatment was 13.17 years.We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk. However, we judged performance and attrition biases to be mostly unclear. Out of the 16 planned analyses, we were able to conduct 13 meta-analyses. We downgraded outcomes for imprecision, indirectness of evidence, inconsistency of results, or because the analysis only included one study.Headache conditionsFor headache pain conditions, we found headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 3.01); P < 0.001, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 5.36, 7 studies, 379 participants; very low-quality evidence). No effect was found at follow-up (very low-quality evidence). There were no effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.13; P = 0.28, 5 studies, 440 participants) or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence). Similarly, no effect was found for the outcomes of depression (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.23, P = 0.69, 4 studies, 422 participants) or anxiety (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.12; P = 0.45, 3 studies, 380 participants) at post-treatment, or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence).Mixed chronic pain conditionsWe did not find any beneficial effects of psychological therapies for reducing pain intensity post-treatment for mixed chronic pain conditions (SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.95 to 0.16; P = 0.10, 5 studies, 501 participants) or at follow-up. There were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.18; P = 0.24, 3 studies, 363 participants) and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analysis could be run. We found no beneficial effects for the outcomes of depression (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.26; P = 0.73, 2 studies, 317 participants) and anxiety (SMD 0.53, 95% CI -0.63 to 1.68; P = 0.37, 2 studies, 370 participants) post-treatment, however, we are cautious of our findings as we could only include two studies in the analyses. We could not conduct analyses at follow-up. We judged the evidence for all outcomes to be very low quality.All conditionsAcross all chronic pain conditions, six studies reported minor adverse events which were not attributed to the psychological therapies. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively and was overall positive. However, we judged both these outcomes as very low quality.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There are currently a small number of trials investigating psychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet. We are cautious in our interpretations of analyses. We found one beneficial effect of therapies to reduce headache severity post-treatment. For the remaining outcomes there was either no beneficial effect at post-treatment or follow-up, or lack of evidence to determine an effect. Overall, participant satisfaction with treatment was positive. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the estimate. Further studies are needed to increase our confidence in this potentially promising field."

            "abstract": "Mobile phone technology (mHealth) is a promising tool that has been used to improve HIV care in high-risk populations worldwide. Understanding patient perspectives of newly diagnosed men who have sex with men (MSM) in Lima, Peru during linkage and engagement in the HIV care continuum can help close the gaps in care following initial HIV diagnosis and ensure retention in continuous care. From June 2015 to March 2016, as part of a randomized controlled trial, 40 MSM participants were linked to care with an mHealth intervention within 3 months of HIV diagnosis at Via Libre clinic. For 12 weeks, participants agreed to receive weekly predetermined, standardized short message service (SMS), WhatsApp©, and/or Facebook© messages from an assigned HIV counselor. Text messaging was bi-directional, meaning participants could also send messages to their counselor at any time. In this qualitative study, we coded and thematically analyzed 947 SMS, 918 WhatsApp, and 2,694 Facebook bi-directional messages. Mean age of participants was 29.8 years (20-50); with 70 percent reporting some post-high school education and 73 percent self-identifying as homosexual. We identified six recurring themes that emerged from the data: (a) mental health symptoms; (b) coping behaviors; (c) interpersonal support; (d) physical symptoms; (e) HIV knowledge; and (f) care coordination. Participants sent text messages describing depressive symptoms and seeking mental health services during this initial stage of HIV care. For newly diagnosed MSM entering the HIV care continuum, a bi-directional mHealth intervention provided support to facilitate care while eliciting deeply personal mental and emotional states. Future interventions could benefit from using mHealth interventions as ancillary support for clinicians."

Participants were adults with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or otherwise at high risk of cognitive decline.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to describe the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight RCTs with a total of 660 participants met review inclusion criteria. Duration of the included trials varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. Only one trial used an inactive control. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. Overall, our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by very low-quality evidence. Almost all results were very imprecise; there were also problems related to risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and indirectness of the evidence.No trial provided data on incident dementia. For comparisons of CCT with both active and inactive controls, the quality of evidence on our other primary outcome of global cognitive function immediately after the intervention period was very low. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about this outcome.Due to very low quality of evidence, we were also unable to determine whether there was any effect of CCT compared to active control on our secondary outcomes of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, depression, functional performance, and mortality. We found low-quality evidence suggesting that there is probably no effect on speed of processing (SMD 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies; 119 participants), verbal fluency (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.44; 3 studies; 150 participants), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -1.85 to 2.65; 1 study; 19 participants).When CCT was compared with inactive control, we obtained data on five secondary outcomes, including episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, depression, and functional performance. We found very low-quality evidence; therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about these outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently available evidence does not allow us to determine whether or not computerised cognitive training will prevent clinical dementia or improve or maintain cognitive function in those who already have evidence of cognitive impairment. Small numbers of trials, small samples, risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and highly imprecise results mean that it is not possible to derive any implications for clinical practice, despite some observed large effect sizes from individual studies. Direct adverse events are unlikely to occur, although the time and sometimes the money involved in computerised cognitive training programmes may represent significant burdens. Further research is necessary and should concentrate on improving methodological rigour, selecting suitable outcomes measures, and assessing generalisability and persistence of any effects. Trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the potential of this intervention to reduce the risk of dementia."

Depression is the most prevalent cause of disability while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best validated behavioral depression treatment. CBT, when combined with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has strong evidence for increased efficacy. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M efficacy, comparisons with in-office delivery are lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this research is to assess whether online group CBT-M (with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at post-intervention and 6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder. The study will also assess whether digitally recorded data (ie, online workbooks completed, Fitbit step count, and online text messages) predict depression symptom reduction in online participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a research-based psychiatry institution where participants will be identified from service wait lists and through contacts with other Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged 18-60 years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) of mild severity (score ≥14) with no upper severity limit; (3) Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric major depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) receipt of weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) criteria for severe alcohol or substance use disorder (in past 3 months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or other primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent or attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant depression. All participants receive standard psychiatric care, experimental participants receive online group CBT-M, and controls receive standard care in-office group CBT-M. The online group program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) combines smartphone and computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, secure text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), quality of life (European Quality of Life Five Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80% power to reject an inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample of 78 per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect sizes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and noninferiority in relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04825535; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04825535.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      DERR1-10.2196/29726."

Participants (54 percent males, 87 percent SMs) in both groups reported reductions in PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the 6-week intervention, which were sustained at 3 months, but exhibited partial rebound at 6-12 months. Our preliminary results suggest that app use, with or without specific direction, feasibly and effectively reduces symptom severity.

            "abstract": "Depression is highly prevalent among university students. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES-D ≥ 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08-0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30-0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18-0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03-0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (χ 2=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow-up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms.

The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both women and men with CHD.

Clinicians have limited face-to-face consultation time with Parkinson's disease patients, making it difficult to comprehensively address non-adherence. Here we share the results from a multi-centre (seven centres) randomised controlled trial conducted in England and Scotland to assess the impact of using a smartphone-based Parkinson's tracker app to promote patient self-management, enhance treatment adherence and quality of clinical consultation. Eligible Parkinson's disease patients were randomised using a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated random sequence, stratified by centre and using blocks of variable size, to intervention Parkinson's Tracker App or control (Treatment as Usual). Primary outcome was the self-reported score of adherence to treatment (Morisky medication adherence scale -8) at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were Quality of Life (Parkinson's disease questionnaire -39), quality of consultation for Parkinson's disease patients (Patient-centred questionnaire for Parkinson's disease), impact on non-motor symptoms (Non-motor symptoms questionnaire), depression and anxiety (Hospital anxiety and depression scale) and beliefs about medication (Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire) at 16 weeks. Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed using a generalised linear model with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline measurement as the covariate. 158 patients completed the study (Parkinson's tracker app = 68 and TAU = 90). At 16 weeks Parkinson's tracker app significantly improved adherence, compared to treatment as usual (mean difference: 0.39, 95%CI 0.04-0.74; p = 0.0304) with no confounding effects of gender, number of comorbidities and age. Among secondary outcomes, Parkinson's tracker app significantly improved patients' perception of quality of consultation (0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.27; p = 0.0110). The change in non-motor symptoms was -0.82 (95% CI -1.75 to 0.10; p = 0.0822). 72% of participants in the Parkinson's tracker app group continued to use and engage with the application throughout the 16-week trial period. The Parkinson's tracker app can be an effective and novel way of enhancing self-reported medication adherence and quality of clinical consultation by supporting self-management in Parkinson's disease in patients owning smartphones. Further work is recommended to determine whether the benefits of the intervention are maintained beyond the 16 week study period."

We will test the impact of this mobile mental health platform for service delivery in a large-scale trial across 20+ colleges. Students who screen positive or at high-risk for clinical anxiety, depression, or an eating disorder and who are not currently engaged in mental health services (N = 7884) will be randomly assigned to: 1) intervention via the mobile mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual care (i.e., campus health or counseling center). We will test whether the mobile mental health platform, compared to referral, is associated with improved uptake, reduced clinical cases, disorder-specific symptoms, and improved quality of life and functioning. We will also test mediators, predictors, and moderators of improved mental health outcomes, as well as stakeholder-relevant outcomes, including cost-effectiveness and academic performance.

We will also perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptom assessments as preliminary indicators of myelin addition following rTMS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants (N = 30, aged 18-65 years) will have a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS. ≤2 weeks before the intervention, eligible, consenting participants will complete a physical exam, baseline brain MRI scan and participant-reported MS symptom assessments [questionnaires: Fatigue Severity Scale, Quality of Life (AQoL-8D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and smartphone-based measures of cognition (electronic symbol digit modalities test), manual dexterity (pinching test, draw a shape test) and gait (U-Turn test)]. Participants will be pseudo-randomly allocated to rTMS (n=20) or sham (placebo; n=10), stratified by sex. rTMS or sham will be delivered 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (20 sessions, 6 min per day). rTMS will be applied using a 90-mm circular coil at low-intensity (25% maximum stimulator output) in an iTBS pattern. For sham, the coil will be oriented 90° to the scalp, preventing the magnetic field from stimulating the brain. Adverse events will be recorded daily. We will evaluate participant blinding after the first, 10th and final session. After the final session, participants will repeat symptom assessments and brain MRI, for comparison with baseline. Participant-reported assessments will be repeated at 4-month post-allocation follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study will determine whether this rTMS protocol is safe and tolerable for people with MS. MRI and participant-reported symptom assessments will serve as preliminary indications of rTMS efficacy for myelin addition to inform further studies.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12619001196134 .

Characterizing effective delivery methods of eHealth interventions is required to enable improved design and implementation of evidence-based health behavior change interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to systematically review the literature and synthesize evidence on the success of eHealth behavior change interventions in patients with cancer and survivors delivered by synchronous, asynchronous, or combined methods compared with a control group. Engagement with the intervention, behavior change, and health outcomes, including quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, were examined.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A search of Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed was conducted for studies published between March 2007 and March 2019. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions delivered to adult cancer survivors via eHealth methods with a measure of health behavior change. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to examine whether the method of eHealth delivery impacted the level of engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 24 RCTs were included predominantly examining dietary and physical activity behavior change interventions. There were 11 studies that used a synchronous approach and 11 studies that used an asynchronous approach, whereas 2 studies used a combined delivery method. Use of eHealth interventions improved exercise behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48), diet behavior (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.70), fatigue (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.50; SMD change 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.35), anxiety (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36-2.07; SMD change 0.15, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.40), depression (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00-0.30), and quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.34; SMD change 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.24).

Anxiety and depression are predictors of short- and long-term adverse outcomes, increased risk for higher rates of in-hospital complications, re-infarction, malignant arrhythmias, and mortality in CD patients. Despite researchers finding that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, the fact that such results are maintained only in the short term and the lack of maintenance of the long-term affects the absence of changes in lifestyles, preventing the possibility of a wide generalization of results.

            "abstract": "Although psychological interventions might have a tremendous potential for the prevention of mental health disorders (MHD), their current impact on the reduction of disease burden is questionable. Possible reasons include that it is not practical to deliver those interventions to the community en masse due to limited health care resources and the limited availability of evidence-based interventions and clinicians in routine practice, especially in rural areas. Therefore, new approaches are needed to maximize the impact of psychological preventive interventions. Limitations of traditional prevention programs could potentially be overcome by providing Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This relatively new medium for promoting mental health and preventing MHD introduces a fresh array of possibilities, including the provision of evidence-based psychological interventions that are free from the restraints of travel and time and allow reaching participants for whom traditional opportunities are not an option. This article provides an introduction to the subject and narratively reviews the available evidence for the effectiveness of IMIs with regard to the prevention of MHD onsets. The number of randomized controlled trials that have been conducted to date is very limited and so far it is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the potential of IMIs for the prevention of MHD for specific disorders. Only for the indicated prevention of depression there is consistent evidence across four different randomized trial trials. The only trial on the prevention of general anxiety did not result in positive findings in terms of eating disorders (EDs), effects were only found in post hoc subgroup analyses, indicating that it might be possible to prevent ED onset for subpopulations of people at risk of developing EDs. Future studies need to identify those subpopulations likely to profit from preventive. Disorders not examined so far include substance use disorders, bipolar disorders, stress-related disorders, phobic disorders and panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, impulse-control disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and insomnia. In summary, there is a need for more rigorously conducted large scale randomized controlled trials using standard clinical diagnostic instruments for the selection of participants without MHD at baseline and the assessment of MHD onset. Subsequently, we discuss future directions for the field in order to fully exploit the potential of IMI for the prevention of MHD."

Participants used 2 different interventions: The experimental group used an mHealth app for PA motivation, and the control group used a paper diary. The purpose was to motivate employees to engage in healthier behavior regarding the promotion of PA in the workplace. A user-centered design process was followed to design, develop, and evaluate the mHealth app, incorporating self-determination theory (SDT) and using game elements.

Although Web-based interventions to reduce negative emotion in individuals with depression are available, these interventions frequently suffer from poor retention and adherence and do not capitalize on the potential benefits of increasing positive emotion.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to develop and test a Web-based positive emotion skills intervention tailored for individuals living with elevated depressive symptoms, as well as to develop and test enhancement strategies for increasing retention and adherence to that intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study protocol describes the development and testing for Mobile Affect Regulation Intervention with the Goal of Lowering Depression (MARIGOLD), a Web-based positive emotion skills intervention, adapted for individuals with elevated depressive symptomatology. The intervention development is taking place in three phases. In phase 1, we are tailoring an existing positive emotion skills intervention for individuals with elevated symptoms of depression and are pilot testing the tailored version of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial with two control conditions (N=60). In phase 2, we are developing and testing three enhancements aimed at boosting retention and adherence to the Web-based intervention (N=75): facilitator contact, an online discussion board, and virtual badges. In phase 3, we are conducting a multifactorial, nine-arm pilot trial (N=600) to systematically test these enhancement strategies, individually and in combination. The primary outcome is depressive symptom severity. Secondary outcomes include positive and negative emotion, psychological well-being, and coping resources.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The project was funded in August 2014, and data collection was completed in May 2018.

It is necessary to study whether limited access to basic services and decreased family and social support could have deleterious effects on cognition, quality of life, and mental health in vulnerable older people.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia as the main outcome and the quality of life, perceived health status, and depression as secondary outcomes and to analyze the association of living alone and a change in living arrangements with those outcomes and other variables related with the use of technology and health services. Likewise, this study aims to analyze the association of high and low technophilia with those variables, to explore the access and use of health care and social support services, and, finally, to explore the informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This cohort study was conducted in Málaga (Spain). In total, 151 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART4MD (n=75, 49.7%) and TV-AssistDem (n=76, 50.3%) randomized clinical trials, were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 26, 2020. All participants had undergone 1-3 assessments (in 6-month intervals) on cognition, quality of life, and mood prior to the COVID-19 breakout.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, and mood of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Perceived stress was reported as moderate during the outbreak. After correction for multiple comparisons, living alone, a change in living arrangements, and technophilia were not associated with negative mental health outcomes. However, being alone was nominally associated with self-perceived fear and depression, and higher technophilia with better quality of life, less boredom, perceived stress and depression, and also less calmness. Overall, health care and social support service access and utilization were high. The most used ICTs during the COVID-19 outbreak were the television for informative, cognitive, and entertainment-related uses and the smartphone for socialization.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings show that the first months of the outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, perceived health status, and depression of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Living alone and low technophilia require further research to establish whether they are risk factors of mental health problems during lockdowns in vulnerable populations.

It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an \"evidence-based\" practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research. It has been viewed or downloaded over 36,000 times, indicating widespread interest in this treatment modality. Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be \"moderate\" to \"large.\" Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow."

Despite the importance of mentally detaching from work during leisure time, workers seem to struggle to disengage and, instead, experience the constant mental representation of work-related stressors, regardless of their absence. Those who struggle with work-related rumination could benefit from an easy-access intervention that fosters mental detachment by promoting recreational activities. Especially during vacations, workers appear to naturally engage in sufficient recovery activities; however, this beneficial behaviour is not sustained. The smartphone app-based intervention \"Holidaily\" promotes recovery behaviour and, thus, mental detachment from work with the intension of extending the beneficial effects of workers' vacations into their daily working life.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This randomised-controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the efficacy of \"Holidaily\". The Holidaily app is a German stand-alone program for mobile devices with either Android/iOS operating systems. The sample includes workers, who are awaiting to go on vacation and are randomly assigned to either the intervention (IG) or a waitlist-control group (CG). The IG receives two weeks pre-vacation access to Holidaily, while the CG receives access two weeks post-vacation. On a daily basis participants in the IG are provided with three options promoting recreational activities and beneficial recovery experiences. Online questionnaires are distributed to all participants at several timepoints. The primary outcome measure assesses participants' work-related rumination (Irritation Scale). A significant difference two weeks post-vacation is expected, favouring the IG. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression, insomnia severity, emotional exhaustion, thinking about work, recovery experiences, vacation specifics, work and personal characteristics. To help explain the intervention's effect, explorative analyses will investigate the mediation properties of the frequency of engaging in recreational activities and the moderation properties of Holidaily users' experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If successful, workers will maintain their recovery behaviour beyond their vacation into daily working life. Findings could, therefore, provide evidence for low-intensity interventions that could be very valuable from a public-health perspective. App-based interventions have greater reach; hence, more workers might access preventative tools to protect themselves from developing adverse health effects linked to work-related rumination. Further studies will still be needed to investigate whether the vacation phenomenon of \"lots of fun quickly gone\" can be defied and long-term benefits attained.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      German Clinical Trials Registration DRKS00013650 .

Linear regression mixed modeling estimated the population trends and individual differences in change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled 319 participants; 287 participants completed the study (155 control and 132 intervention). The participants in the intervention group had significant improvements in diabetes self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale, 0.34; 95% CI -0.15,0.53; P<.01) and a decrease in depressive symptoms compared with usual care at 3 months (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; 0.89; 95% CI 0.01-1.77; P=.05), with no differences in the other outcomes. The differences in self-efficacy and depression scores between the 2 arms at 9 months were not sustained. The participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in physical activity (from 23,770 steps per week to 39,167 steps per week at 3 months and 32,601 per week at 9 months).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of this intervention; however, by 9 months, although physical activity remained above the baseline, the improvements in self-efficacy were not sustained.

While labor productivity and absenteeism varied, presenteeism showed almost no change across groups. The quality-adjusted life year in the intervention group was 6.84 (0.07 higher than that in the non-intervention group). By analyzing medical expenses and making assumptions regarding productivity, we estimated that the aggregate of medical expenses, productivity loss, and application fee for the intervention group could be lower than that of the non-intervention group by over JPY 130,000 (USD 1,170, as of December 2017) per individual.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The subjects included were willing or relatively willing to use the application.

However, few have been the subject of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the change processes that are hypothesized to mediate claimed effects have not been previously studied. This RCT compared the efficacy of three publicly available MHapps to a waitlist control condition in a community sample, in which no MHapp was provided. The three MHapps included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) toolkit app MoodKit, mood tracking app MoodPrism, and CBT strategy app MoodMission. Participants were randomly allocated to each condition, completed a baseline assessment, downloaded their allocated MHapp, and completed a second assessment 30 days later, with n = 226 included in final analyses (81% female; M age = 34 years). Compared to the control condition, all MHapp groups experienced increases in mental wellbeing, MoodKit and MoodMission groups experienced decreases in depression, and no groups experienced effects on anxiety. Mediated regressions revealed that increasing coping self-efficacy, rather than emotional self-awareness or mental health literacy, was the underlying process contributing to effects on mental health for all three MHapps. MHapps appear to be an effective solution for improving public mental health, notably by improving users' confidence in their ability to cope."

The present study evaluated the effect of consumption of heat-killed SBC8803 on sleep architecture in humans. A non-randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, and crossover pilot study was conducted using volunteers who scored at a slightly high level (i.e. ≥6) on the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Male subjects (n=17; age 41-69 y) consumed placebo or SBC8803 capsules (25 mg/day of heat-killed SBC8803) for 10 days. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded using a mobile, one-channel system, providing objective data on sleep. Subjects' sleep journals and administration of the AIS provided subjective data on sleep. Three subjects were excluded from the statistical analysis. Analysis of the remaining 14 volunteers revealed no significant differences between placebo and SBC8803 consumption in either the AIS or the sleep EEG. The sleep journals revealed an improvement in 'waking' for the SBC8803 consumption periods (P=0.047), and there was a marginally significant effect on 'drowsiness during the following day' (P=0.067). Effects on the EEG delta power value (μV(2)/min) were revealed by a stratified analysis based on age, AIS, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Specifically, effects were found among subjects in their 40s who consumed the SBC8803 capsules (P=0.049) and among subjects with a BDI score less than the all-subjects average (13.3) (P=0.045). A marginally significant effect was found among subjects with an AIS score less than the all-subjects average (11.6) (P=0.065). The delta power value of 5 subjects with both BDI and AIS scores less than the average increased significantly (P=0.017). While the number of subjects was limited, a beneficial effect on sleep due to consumption of heat-killed L. brevis SBC8803 was found in subjects with slightly challenged sleep."

            "abstract": "The sudden arrival of culturally diverse asylum seekers and refugees into Germany has created a strong demand for recognizing and appropriately treating those suffering from mental health issues. Due to many systemic, organizational, cultural and socio-linguistic barriers, psychiatric treatment of refugees is posing a major challenge to Germany's mental health care system. Thus, there is a need for alternative models that allow for increased access to adequate, effective and efficient culturally sensitive mental health care services. Here, we describe the Mental Health in Refugees and Asylum Seekers (MEHIRA) project, a multicentre randomized controlled trial investigating a stepped collaborative care model (SCCM) for providing mental health treatment in this vulnerable population. The proposed SCCM aims to decrease the aforementioned barriers. Adult and adolescent participants will be screened for depressive symptoms and matched to appropriate psychological interventions, including group-level interventions (START intervention, Empowerment/Gender-sensitive/Peer to peer), and other innovative, digital treatment approaches (Smartphone application). The therapeutic effect of the SCCM will be compared to TAU (treatment-as-usual). All interventions have been designed to be culturally sensitive, and offered in two different languages: Arabic and Farsi. The outcome of this study may contribute significantly to future clinical and legal guidelines in developing parallel and efficient new structures of treatment. Collected data will inform primary and secondary mental health care providers with recommendations concerning the design and implementation of effective treatment models and programmes. Guidelines and recommendations may also potentially be adopted by other host countries, developing countries and also in humanitarian aid programmes."

However, close to half of Canadians older than 80 years report feeling socially isolated. Research has shown that social isolation leads to increased mortality and morbidity, and various interventions have been studied to alleviate loneliness among older adults. This proposal presents an evaluation of an intervention that provides one-on-one coaching, is intergenerational, provides both educational and socialization experiences, and increases technology literacy of older adults to overcome loneliness.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper describes the protocol of a randomized, mixed-methods study that will take place in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an intergenerational technology literacy program can reduce social isolation and depression in older adults via quantitative and qualitative outcome measures.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a randomized, mixed-methods, feasibility trial with 2 conditions.

            "abstract": "Context: Internet Use Disorder (IUD), characterized as the inability to control one's internet use, is emerging as an increasing societal concern as it is associated with reduced quality of life and mental health comorbidities. Evidence-based treatment options are, however, scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based interventions may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address individuals affected in their online setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed, guided internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD. Methods: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N = 130), individuals showing problematic internet use patterns (Internet Addiction Test ≥ 49) will be randomly allocated to the internet- and mobile-based intervention or a waiting control group. Assessments will take place at baseline, 7 weeks, 6- and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is internet addiction symptom severity (IAT) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other psychosocial variables associated with IUD. Intervention: The intervention consists of seven sessions: Goal setting and motivational interviewing, impulse control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, self-worth, relapse prevention, and a booster session. Participants are supported by an eCoach who provides individual feedback after completion of each session. Participants can choose between several elective sessions based on individual need. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate an internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD, which could be a promising first step to reduce individuals' disease burden. Trial Registration: DRKS00015314. The study is currently ongoing. First participants were enrolled in the study on September 14th 2018. Recruitment will continue approximately through March 2020."

The largest modifiable risk factor after receiving a stent is medication adherence to Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy, a combination of P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to determine the acceptability of a protocol and an intervention using the My Interventional Drug-Eluting Stent Educational App (MyIDEA) and to evaluate medication adherence using the proportion of days covered (PDC) and platelet activation tests in a multisite randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Potential participants who received a post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure with a drug-eluting stent were approached. All patients older than 50 years and who spoke English were recruited. Participants were recruited, baseline demographics were collected, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form, Burden-Benefit questionnaire, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and PCI knowledge questionnaire were administered. Block randomization was used to randomize participants to either usual care or MyIDEA supplementation. MyIDEA is a personalized educational intervention based on the Kolb experiential learning theory using patient narratives for education. During the visits, participants' blood was collected to measure platelet suppression from medication. During the second and third encounters, the Morisky medication adherence score and cardiology outcomes were measured. The study was conducted at the University of Illinois Hospital and John H Stroger Jr Cook County Hospital with appropriate ethical approvals. Platelet suppression was measured through aspirin reactive units and P2Y12 reactive units. Medication adherence was measured using the PDC. The analysis team was blinded to the participants' group membership.

Synergy: Physically inactive adults (18-65 years) who reported poor sleep quality were recruited for a two-arm Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) (Physical Activity and Sleep Health (PAS; n = 80), or Wait-list Control (CON; n = 80) groups). Refresh: Physically inactive adults (40-65 years) who reported poor sleep quality were recruited for a three-arm RCT (PAS (n = 110), Sleep Health-Only (SO; n = 110) or CON (n = 55) groups). The SO group was omitted from this study. The PAS groups received a pedometer, and accessed a smartphone/tablet \"app\" using behaviour change strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning), with additional email/SMS support. The ASI score comprised self-reported moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, resistance training, sitting time, sleep duration, efficiency, quality and timing. Outcomes were assessed using DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, stress), SF-12 (QOL-physical, QOL-mental) and SF-36 (Energy & Fatigue).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Common mental health disorders (CMDs) are leading causes of disability globally. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the burden of CMDs. COVID-19 containment measures, including lockdowns, have disrupted access to in-person mental health care. It is therefore imperative to explore the utility of digital mental health interventions to bridge the treatment gap. Mobile health technologies are effective tools for increasing access to treatment at a lower cost. This study explores the utility of Inuka, a chat-based app hinged on the Friendship Bench problem-solving therapy intervention. The Inuka app offers double anonymity, and clients can book or cancel a session at their convenience. Inuka services can be accessed either through a mobile app or the web.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to explore the feasibility of conducting a future clinical trial. Additionally, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, scalability, and preliminary effectiveness of Inuka.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected using concurrent mixed methods. We used a pragmatic quasiexperimental design to compare the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical effectiveness of Inuka (experimental group) and WhatsApp chat-based counseling (control). Participants received 6 problem-solving therapy sessions delivered by lay counselors. A reduction in CMDs was the primary clinical outcome. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability and functioning, and social support. Quantitative outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Finally, we used administrative data and semistructured interviews to gather data on acceptability and feasibility; this was analyzed using thematic analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Altogether, 258 participants were screened over 6 months, with 202 assessed for eligibility, and 176 participants were included in the study (recruitment ratio of 29 participants/month). The participants' mean age was 24.4 (SD 5.3) years, and most participants were female and had tertiary education. The mean daily smartphone usage was 8 (SD 3.5) hours. Eighty-three users signed up and completed at least one session. The average completion rate was 3 out of 4 sessions. Inuka was deemed feasible and acceptable in the local context, with connectivity challenges, app instability, expensive mobile data, and power outages cited as potential barriers to scale up. Generally, there was a decline in CMDs (F2,73=2.63; P=.08), depression (F2,73=7.67; P<.001), and anxiety (F2,73=2.95; P=.06) and a corresponding increase in HRQoL (F2,73=7.287; P<.001) in both groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Study outcomes showed that it is feasible to run a future large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) and lend support to the feasibility and acceptability of Inuka, including evidence of preliminary effectiveness. The app's double anonymity and structured support were the most salient features. There is a great need for iterative app updates before scaling up. Finally, a large-scale hybrid RCT with a longer follow-up to evaluate the clinical implementation and cost-effectiveness of the app is needed."

A systematic literature search was conducted using Chinese and English databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies on mHealth apps and depression in China were included. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria with three randomized trials, two quasi-randomized trials, one clinical trial with an uncertain grouping method, and one study with a single-group design. All studies used the WeChat platform and included activities such as psychoeducation, self-management, supervised group chats, and/or remote contact with a healthcare team, in comparison to usual care. All studies reported significant and large benefits for outcomes, but the risk of bias was high. There are few rigorous evaluations of mHealth apps for depression in China, with all included studies involving WeChat programs and most using WeChat to extend nursing discharge care for inpatients with depression. While these studies showed significant improvement in health outcomes as compared to usual care, the results remain inconclusive because of the high risk of bias. mHealth holds promise for increasing access to mental health care in China, but issues such as efficacy, scalability, patient and clinician acceptability, and data privacy must be addressed."

Direct comparisons with face-to-face treatments do not indicate that there are relevant differences between Internet-based and face-to-face treatment formats. The challenge for the near future is to examine how these treatments can be integrated in mental health care. Major opportunities are in preventive services, primary care, specialized mental health care, and in patients with comorbid general medical disorders.

A virtual randomized controlled trial was used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 5-week, self-guided, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile application, Spark, compared to a psychoeducational mobile application (Active Control) as an adjunct treatment for adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A community sample aged 13-21, with self-reported symptoms of depression, was recruited nationwide. Participants were randomly assigned to use either Spark or Active Control (NSpark = 35; NActive Control = 25). Questionnaires, including the PHQ-8 measuring depression symptoms, completed before, during, and immediately following completion of the intervention, evaluated depressive symptoms, usability, engagement, and participant safety.

Median daily use was 29%, and 23% completed all levels. There was a significant negative relationship between behavioral activations completed and change in PHQ-8. Efficacy analyses revealed a significant main effect of time, F = 40.60, p < .001, associated with decreased PHQ-8 scores over time. There was no significant Group × Time interaction (F = 0.13, p = .72) though the numeric decrease in PHQ-8 was greater for Spark (4.69 vs. 3.56).

Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p < .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p = .03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p = .02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps > .05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks. This pilot also demonstrates the feasibility of future research regarding the delivery of behavioral and cognitive intervention strategies via apps.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score > 70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Internet-delivered interventions play a major role in increasing access to mental health care.

This cross-sectional analysis utilized enrollment data from a randomized trial (Mobile WAChX, NCT02400671) in six Kenyan public maternal and child health clinics. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), stigma with the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness, and intimate partner violence (IPV) with the Abuse Assessment Screen. Correlates of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (\"depression\", PHQ-9 score ≥10) were assessed using generalized estimating equation models clustered by facility. Among 824 pregnant WLWH, 9% had depression; these women had more recent HIV diagnosis than those without depression (median 0.4 vs. 2.0 years since diagnosis, p = .008). Depression was associated with HIV-related stigma (adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR]:2.36, p = .025), IPV (aPR:2.93, p = .002), and lower social support score (aPR:0.99, p = .023). Using population-attributable risk percent to estimate contributors to maternal depression, 81% were attributable to stigma (27%), recent diagnosis (24%), and IPV (20%). Integrating depression screening and treatment in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission programs may be beneficial, particularly in women recently diagnosed or reporting stigma and IPV."

            "title": "Development and Implementation of a Mobile Tool for High-Risk Pregnant Women to Deliver Effective Caregiving for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The United States continues to experience an alarming rise in opioid use that includes women who become pregnant and related neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in newborns. Most newborns experiencing NAS require nonpharmacological care, which entails, most importantly, maternal involvement with the newborn. To facilitate positive maternal-newborn interactions, mothers need to learn effective caregiving NAS strategies when they are pregnant; however, an enormous gap exists in the early education of mothers on the symptoms and progression of NAS, partly because no education, training, or other interventions exist to prepare future mothers for the challenges of caring for their newborns at risk for NAS.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this paper, we describe a mixed methods, multistage study to adapt an existing mobile NAS tool for high-risk pregnant women and assess its usability, acceptability, and feasibility in a small randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Stage 1 will include 20 semistructured interviews with a panel of neonatology experts, NAS care providers, and mothers with experience caring for NAS-affected newborns to gather their recommendations on the management of NAS and explore their perspectives on the care of these newborns. The findings will guide the adaptation of existing mobile NAS tools for high-risk pregnant women. In stage 2, we will test the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the adapted mobile tool via surveys with 10 pregnant women receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT). Finally, in stage 3, we will randomize 30 high-risk pregnant women receiving OAT to either receive the adapted mobile NAS caregiving tool or usual care. We will compare these women on primary outcomes-maternal drug relapse and OAT continuation-and secondary outcomes-maternal-newborn bonding; length of newborn hospital stays; readmission rates; breastfeeding initiation and duration; and postpartum depression and anxiety at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postpartum.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded in July 2020 and approved by the institutional review board in April 2020. Data collection for stage 1 began in December 2020, and as of January 2021, we completed 18 semistructured interviews (10 with NAS providers and 8 with perinatal women receiving OAT). Common themes from all interviews will be analyzed in spring 2021 to inform the adaptation of the NAS caregiving tool. The results from stage 1 are expected to be published in summer 2021. Stage 2 data collection will commence in fall 2021.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this study have the potential to improve NAS care and maternal-newborn outcomes and lead to commercialized product development. If effective, our new tool will be well suited to tailoring for other high-risk perinatal women with substance use disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04783558; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04783558.\n    \n\n\n          International registered report identifier (irrid):\n        \n      \n      DERR1-10.2196/27382."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and defecation-related anxiety, which can result in reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F1,79=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F1,79=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F1,79=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F1,79=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F1,79=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F1,79=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F1,79=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F1,79=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04170686; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04170686."

The intervention group (IG) received a guided depression IMI tailored to CBP next to treatment-as-usual (TAU; including medication), while the control group (CG) received TAU. The primary outcome was observer-masked clinician-rated Hamilton depression severity (9-week follow-up). The secondary outcomes were: further depression outcomes, pain-related outcomes, health-related quality of life, and work capacity. Biostatistician blinded analyses using regression models were conducted by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between October 2015 and July 2017, we randomly assigned 210 participants (IG, n = 105; CG, n = 105), mostly with only a mild pain intensity but substantial pain disability. No statistically significant difference in depression severity between IG and CG was observed at the 9-week follow-up (β = -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.05). Explorative secondary depression (4/9) and pain-related (4/6) outcomes were in part significant (p < 0.05). Health-related quality of life was significantly higher in the IG. No differences were found in work capacity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results indicate that an IMI for patients with CBP and depression in a routine care setting has limited impact on depression. Benefits in pain and health-related outcomes suggest that an IMI might still be a useful measure to improve routine care."

The intervention will focus on symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, self-destructive thoughts, job- and study-related stress and burnout, and chronic pain. It will be based on different approaches, primarily psychoeducation, Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT), and third-wave CBT. At the end of the treatment, user satisfaction and usability will be assessed. In addition, two further aims will be evaluating the treatment efficacy through a randomized controlled trial and tuning a predictive model through Machine Learning techniques. The intervention consists of a 7-week treatment on two problematic areas according to each students' personal needs, identified through an initial assessment. Besides the treatment assigned following the initial screening, participants will also be assigned to a different module to improve their relational skills. The treatment, which can be accessed through a mobile app, consists of psychoeducational videos followed by related exercises.

The main goal of the present investigation was to examine the effect and feasibility (usability and satisfaction) of an iCBT (GROw program) for adults with PGD. A secondary objective was to detect adherence to the app (Emotional Monitor) used to measure daily grief symptoms. The study had a single-case multiple-baseline AB design with six participants. The GROw program is organized sequentially in eight modules, and it is based on the dual-process model of coping with bereavement. Evaluations included a pre-to-post treatment assessment of depression, grief symptoms, and typical grief beliefs, along with daily measures of symptom frequency and intensity on the Emotional Monitor App. Treatment opinions and adherence to the App were also collected. Efficacy data were calculated using a Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) analysis and Reliable Change Index (RCI). The mean age of the sample was 29.5 years (SD = 8.19). Two participants dropped out of the study. Adherence to the App varied across patients (4.8 % -77.8 %). Most participants (75 %) showed a clinically significant change (recovered) in depression, and 50 % obtained a clinically significant improvement (recovered) in symptoms of loss and typical beliefs in complicated grief. The participants reported high usability and satisfaction with the treatment content and format. In sum, the GROw program was very well accepted and generally feasible, and it has strong potential for treating PGD. The results support scaling up the treatment by using more complex designs with larger samples (i.e., randomized controlled trials comparing GROw with active conditions)."

This study evaluated whether automated text messages to women undergoing medical abortion can reduce anxiety and emotional discomfort, and whether the messages can better prepare women for symptoms they experience.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted in which women undergoing early medical abortion were allocated to receive standard of care (SOC) only (n=235) or SOC+a messaging intervention (n=234). Consenting women were interviewed at the clinic after taking mifepristone and again at their follow-up clinic visit 2-3 weeks later; the intervention group received text messages over the duration of this period. Emotional outcomes were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Adler's 12-item emotional scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Preparedness for the abortion symptoms and overall satisfaction with the procedure were assessed using 4-point Likert-type scales.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between baseline and follow-up, anxiety decreased more (p=0.013), and less emotional stress was experienced (adjusted for baseline anxiety, p=0.015), in the intervention compared to the SOC group. Participants in the intervention group were also more likely to report that they felt very well prepared for the bleeding (p<0.001), pain (p=0.042) and side effects (p=0.027) they experienced. Acceptability and other negative emotions relating to the abortion did not differ between study groups. Ninety-nine percent of the intervention group stated that they would recommend the messages to a friend having the same procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Text messages to women following mifepristone administration for early medical abortion may assist them in managing symptoms and appear highly acceptable to recipients.\n    \n\n\n          Implication statement:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the effectiveness of text messages following mifepristone administration in strengthening medical abortion care. The messages were associated with significant reductions in women's anxiety and stress during the abortion process; they improved preparedness for the abortion symptoms experienced and appeared highly acceptable."

Educating youths on depression and suicidal behavior, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are understudied. Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other nonpsychiatrist physician settings. Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change."

There is growing evidence that body psychotherapy (BPT) is efficacious for the treatment of various mental disorders. However, with regard to cancer patients, evidence is scarce. The aims of this project are to evaluate whether bodily disturbances in post-treatment cancer patients can be improved by group BPT, and to estimate the efficacy of intermittent smartphone-triggered bodily interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The project is a bi-center study with two participating centers in Switzerland, applying a pre-post convergent parallel design of a weekly group BPT using a waiting-period comparator, including a nested RCT during the group BPT phase.

Patients who had received curatively intended treatment for any malignant neoplasm (treatment being completed ≥3 months) and are suffering from bodily disturbances are screened to assess eligibility. Sample size estimation is based on an a priori power analysis. We plan to include a total of N = 88 subjects, aiming at at least 52 completers. Patients are surveyed three times (baseline assessment (T0), pre- (T1) and post-intervention assessment (T2)), and on a daily basis along BPT during five consecutive weeks. The primary outcome, bodily disturbances, is assessed using the 'Body Image Scale'(BIS). For the secondary outcomes standardized questionnaires are used to assess changes in experience of presence and vitality, mood, body mindfulness, somatic symptoms and somatic symptom disorder, quality of life, anxiety, and depression including suicidal tendency, vitality and mental health, as well as group cohesion.

            "title": "Participants' and Nurses' Experiences With a Digital Intervention for Patients With Depressive Symptoms and Comorbid Hypertension or Diabetes in Peru: Qualitative Post-Randomized Controlled Trial Study.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and a leading cause of disability, disproportionately affecting specific groups, such as patients with noncommunicable diseases. Over the past decade, digital interventions have been developed to provide treatment for these patients. CONEMO (Emotional Control in Spanish) is an 18-session psychoeducational digital intervention delivered through a smartphone app and minimally supported by a nurse. CONEMO demonstrated effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among patients with diabetes, hypertension, or both, in Lima, Peru. However, in addition to clinical outcomes, it is important to explore users' experiences, satisfaction, and perceptions of usability and acceptability, which can affect their engagement with the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to explore the RCT participants' experiences with CONEMO in Peru, complemented with information provided by the nurses who monitored them.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In 2018, semistructured interviews were conducted with a sample of 29 (13.4%) patients from the 217 patients who participated in the CONEMO intervention in Peru and the 3 hired nurses who supported its delivery. Interviewees were selected at random based on their adherence to the digital intervention (0-5, 10-14, and 15-18 sessions completed), to include different points of view. Content analysis was conducted to analyze the interviews.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants' mean age was 64.4 (SD 8.5) years, and 79% (23/29) of them were women. Most of the interviewed participants (21/29, 72%) stated that CONEMO fulfilled their expectations and identified positive changes in their physical and mental health after using it. Some of these improvements were related to their thoughts and feelings (eg, think differently, be more optimistic, and feel calmer), whereas others were related to their routines (eg, go out more and improve health-related habits). Most participants (19/29, 66%) reported not having previous experience with using smartphones, and despite experiencing some initial difficulties, they managed to use CONEMO. The most valued features of the app were the videos and activities proposed for the participant to perform. Most participants (27/29, 93%) had a good opinion about the study nurses and reported feeling supported by them. A few participants provided suggestions to improve the intervention, which included adding more videos, making the sessions' text simple, extending the length of the intervention, and improving the training session with long explanations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this qualitative study provide further support and contextualize the positive results found in the CONEMO RCT, including insights into the key features that made the intervention effective and engaging. The participants' experience with the smartphone and CONEMO app reveal that it is feasible to be used by people with little knowledge of technology. In addition, the study identified suggestions to improve the CONEMO intervention for its future scale-up.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03026426; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03026426."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Depression frequently first emerges during adolescence, and one in five young people will experience an episode of depression by the age of 18 years. Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes. The Future Proofing Study is a large-scale school-based trial investigating whether cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) delivered by smartphone application can prevent depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A randomised controlled trial targeting up to 10,000 Year 8 Australian secondary school students will be conducted. In Stage I, schools will be randomised at the cluster level either to receive the CBT intervention app (SPARX) or to a non-active control group comparator. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes include psychological distress, anxiety and insomnia. At the 12-month follow-up, participants in the intervention arm with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in an individual-level randomised controlled trial (Stage II) and be randomised to receive a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a control condition. Assessments will occur post intervention (both trial stages) and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post baseline. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in symptoms from baseline to follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first trial testing the effectiveness of smartphone apps delivered to school students to prevent depression at scale.

The aim of this study was to explore system use, usefulness, ease of use, and preliminary effects of Stress Proffen, an app-based cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention for patients with cancer. A feasibility pilot project tested the intervention with cancer survivors (N = 25). The intervention contained (a) one face-to-face introduction session, (b) 10 app-based modules with stress management educational material and exercises, and (c) one follow-up phone call. Post-intervention interviews were conducted and user log-data were extracted. Outcome measures-Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Anxiety and Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL; SF-36), and Self-Regulatory Fatigue (SRF-18)-were completed at baseline and post-intervention. Participants were primarily women (84%), age 34-71 (mean 48) and represented a variety of cancer diagnoses (majority breast cancer: 40%). Twenty-two participants completed all (pre-post) questionnaires. Sixteen participants (67%) completed at least 7 of 10 modules within the 8-week study period. Post-intervention interviews described StressProffen as providing a new, appreciated, and easily accessible stress management tool for the cancer survivors. Dependent/paired t-tests showed significant pre-post intervention effects with significant decrease in stress (p = .008), anxiety (p = .019), and self-regulatory fatigue (p = .025), and improved HRQoL (Role Physical, General Health, Vitality, and Role Emotional, all p's <.01). App-based stress management interventions such as StressProffen can provide appreciated support for cancer survivors, should be easy to use, can provide significant stress reduction, and improve emotional well-being. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is warranted and is in progress. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0293961."

Of the total, 72.7% (115/158) of the papers focused on six mental disorders: depression, anxiety, trauma and stressor-related, substance-related and addiction, schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic disorders, or a combination of disorders. More than half of known mental disorders were not or very scarcely (<3%) represented. An increasing number of studies were dedicated to assessing clinical effects, but RCTs were still a minority (25/158, 15.8%).

However, little is known about how stroke survivors engage with the internet, social media, and other digital technologies on a day-to-day basis.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study had three main objectives: to describe the type, frequency, and purpose of technology use among a cohort of low-morbidity stroke survivors; to investigate associations between social media use and participant factors, including sociodemographics, physical function, and independence in activities of daily living; and to investigate associations between stroke-related health risk factors and the use of the internet to search for health and medical information.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained during a national randomized controlled trial-Prevent 2nd Stroke. The participants were stroke survivors recruited from 2 Australian stroke registries who completed 2 telephone-administered surveys to collect data on demographics and stroke characteristics; health risk factors (diet quality, physical activity, blood pressure medication, alcohol intake, anxiety and depression, and smoking status); physical functioning; independence in activities of daily living; and questions about what technology they had access to, how often they used it, and for what purposes. Participants were eligible if they had no more than a moderate level of disability (modified Rankin score ≤3) and had access to the internet. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between social media use and sociodemographics, physical function, and independence in activities of daily living as well as associations between stroke-related health risk factors and the use of the internet to search for health and medical information.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 354 participants were included in the analysis. Approximately 79.1% (280/354) of participants used the internet at least daily, 40.8% (118/289) accessed social media on their phone or tablet daily, and 46.4% (134/289) looked up health and medical information at least monthly. Women were 2.7 times more likely to use social media (adjusted odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.51-4.72), and people aged >75 years were significantly less likely to use social media compared with those aged <55 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.07-0.44).

This is important given that they are at high risk of recurrent stroke regardless of their level of disability. Exploring the technology use behaviors and the possibility of eHealth among survivors who experience higher levels of morbidity or disability because of their stroke is an area of research that warrants further study."

As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p < 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p < 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research."

Yet, their limited access to and uptake of traditional mental health care is inequitable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile interventions emerged as a potential solution to this discontinued healthcare access, but more knowledge is needed about their effectiveness and impact on health equity. This equity-focused systematic review examined the effectiveness and equity impact of mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and 3 other databases, from date of database inception and until January 2021, for experimental studies on mobile interventions targeting pregnant and postpartum women. We used pooled and narrative synthesis methods to analyze effectiveness and equity data, critically appraised the methodological rigour of included studies using Cochrane tools, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search identified 6148 records, of which 18 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included. Mobile interventions had a clinically important impact on reducing the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.64]; absolute risk reduction RD: 7.14% [95% CI 4.92 to 9.36]; p<0.001) and preventing its severity perinatally (MD = -3.07; 95% CI -4.68 to -1.46; p<0.001). Mobile cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in managing postpartum depression (MD = -6.87; 95% CI -7.92 to -5.82; p<0.001), whereas other support-based interventions had no added benefit. Results on anxiety outcomes and utilization of care were limited. Our equity-focused analyses showed that ethnicity, age, education, and being primiparous were characteristics of influence to the effectiveness of mobile interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for virtual mental health care, mobile interventions show promise in preventing and managing common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women.

            "abstract": "Infants of low-income and depressed mothers are at high risk for poor developmental outcomes. Early parenting mediates infant experiences from birth, and early intervention can support sensitive and responsive parent practices that optimize infant outcomes via promoting developmental competencies. However, low-income and depressed mothers experience substantial challenges to participating in early intervention. They also have extremely limited access to interventions targeting depression. Interventions targeting maternal depression and parent practices can improve maternal and infant outcomes. Mobile internet-based interventions overcome numerous barriers that low-resource mothers face in accessing home-based interventions. Pandemic-related stressors likely reduce family resources and exacerbate distress of already heavily-burdened mother-infant dyads. During crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based remote coaching interventions are paramount. This article reports on a mobile intervention for improving maternal mood and increasing parent practices that promote infant development. An ongoing randomized controlled trial study provided a unique opportunity to monitor progression from referral to intervention initiation between two groups of depressed mothers: those prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic. The study also examines mother and infant characteristics at baseline. The sample consisted primarily of Black mothers experiencing extreme poverty who self-referred to the study in a large southern city, which is one of the most income disparate in the United States. Prior to the pandemic, 97% of study participants successfully progressed from consent to intervention, as compared to significantly fewer-86%-during the pandemic. Mother-infant dyads during COVID-19, as compared to those prior to COVID-19, displayed similar pre-intervention demographic characteristics and intrapersonal characteristics."

Scientific evidence points to the urgency of designing preventive interventions and concludes that the gestational period is the most appropriate time to implement these interventions. However, many pregnant women do not seek professional help due to a lack of knowledge about the importance of mental health, its impact, and the available intervention options, as well as a lack of time and financial resources. E-health interventions can be an efficient, cost-effective, and accessible resource for preventing postpartum depression that can circumvent the barriers that pregnant women face. This randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy of Healthy Moms and Babies, an app aimed at preventing postpartum depressive symptomatology. The second objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of the tool in preventing anxious symptomatology. The primary outcome measure is the difference in the mean score between the intervention and control groups on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at the end of the intervention and at 3 and 6 months postpartum. The secondary outcome will be determined by using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7) at the same time points. The research findings can be used to determine pregnant women's use of the e-health application for the prevention of postpartum depression, whether the Healthy Moms and Babies intervention app is an effective and useful resource, and what modifications will need to be made to the tool in future updates."

The system features machine learning methods for patient monitoring: continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation, physical activity monitoring, and psychological profile recognition. These methods feed a decision support system that provides recommendations on physical health and psychological support. The system was designed using a human-centered methodology involving the patients throughout development.

The mean absolute error of BP estimation was 9.0 mm Hg for systolic BP and 7.0 mm Hg for diastolic BP. The accuracy of psychological profile detection was 88.6%. The F-measure for physical activity recognition was 71%.

            "abstract": "Background: Mental disorders are highly prevalent among university students. Distance-learning students are particularly burdened and have limited access to conventional university health services. Interventions for stress are sought after in distance learners and may help increase treatment coverage. Internet-based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating depression, but it remains unclear if interventions directed at academic stress also have this potential. Aim: The trial presented here investigates the effectiveness of an Internet- and App-based stress intervention in distance-learning students with elevated levels of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D) ≥ 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted. Discussion: Results will provide the basis to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of Internet-delivered stress interventions in distance-learning students with symptoms of depression. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been reviewed and approved by the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg ethics committee (Erlangen, Germany; 33_17 Bc). Results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trial Registration (DRKS), identifier DRKS00011800."

However, knowledge is scant regarding the influence of human support on attrition and adherence and participant preferences for support in nonclinical settings.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to compare the influence of 3 modes of human support on attrition and adherence to a digital mental health intervention for a nonclinical cohort. It evaluated user preferences for support and assessed whether adherence and outcomes were enhanced when participants received their preferred support mode.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Subjects participated in a 10-week digital mental health promotion intervention and were randomized into 3 comparative groups: standard group with automated emails (S), standard plus personalized SMS (S+pSMS), and standard plus weekly videoconferencing support (S+VCS). Adherence was measured by the number of video lessons viewed, points achieved for weekly experiential challenge activities, and the total number of weeks that participants recorded a score for challenges. In the postquestionnaire, participants ranked their preferred human support mode from 1 to 4 (S, S+pSMS, S+VCS, S+pSMS & VCS combined). Stratified analysis was conducted for those who received their first preference. Preintervention and postintervention questionnaires assessed well-being measures (ie, mental health, vitality, depression, anxiety, stress, life satisfaction, and flourishing).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Interested individuals (N=605) enrolled on a website and were randomized into 3 groups (S, n=201; S+pSMS, n=202; S+VCS, n=201). Prior to completing the prequestionnaire, a total of 24.3% (147/605) dropped out. Dropout attrition between groups was significantly different (P=.009): 21.9% (44/201) withdrew from the S group, 19.3% (39/202) from the S+pSMS group, and 31.6% (64/202) from the S+VCS group. The remaining 75.7% (458/605) registered and completed the prequestionnaire (S, n=157; S+pSMS, n=163; S+VCS, n=138). Of the registered participants, 30.1% (138/458) failed to complete the postquestionnaire (S, n=54; S+pSMS, n=49; S+VCS, n=35), but there were no between-group differences (P=.24). For the 69.9% (320/458; S, n=103; S+pSMS, n=114; S+VCS, n=103) who completed the postquestionnaire, no between-group differences in adherence were observed for mean number of videos watched (P=.42); mean challenge scores recorded (P=.71); or the number of weeks that challenge scores were logged (P=.66). A total of 56 participants (17.5%, 56/320) received their first preference in human support (S, n=22; S+pSMS, n=26; S+VCS, n=8). No differences were observed between those who received their first preference and those who did not with regard to video adherence (P=.91); challenge score adherence (P=.27); or any of the well-being measures including, mental health (P=.86), vitality (P=.98), depression (P=.09), anxiety (P=.64), stress (P=.55), life satisfaction (P=.50), and flourishing (P=.47).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Early dropout attrition may have been influenced by dissatisfaction with the allocated support mode. Human support mode did not impact adherence to the intervention, and receiving the preferred support style did not result in greater adherence or better outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): 12619001009101; http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12619001009101.aspx."

            "abstract": "The current manuscript is a commentary on \"Mobile phone-based interventions for mental health: A systematic meta-review of 14 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials\". Although embedded within a nuanced discussion, one of the primary conclusions readers have taken from the meta-analysis was \"we failed to find convincing evidence in support of any mobile phone-based intervention on any outcome\", which seems to contradict the entirety of the evidence presented when taken out of context of the methods applied. In evaluating whether the area produced \"convincing evidence of efficacy,\" the authors used a standard that appeared destined to fail. Specifically, the authors required \"no evidence of publication bias\", which is a standard that would be unlikely to be found in any area of psychology or medicine. Second, the authors required low to moderate heterogeneity in effect sizes when comparing interventions with fundamentally different and entirely dissimilar target mechanisms. However absent these 2 untenable criteria, the authors actually found highly suggestive evidence of efficacy (N > 1,000, p < .000001) in (1) anxiety; (2) depression; (3) smoking cessation; (4) stress; and (5) quality of life. Perhaps the appropriate conclusions would be that existing syntheses of data testing smartphone intervention suggests that these interventions are promising, but additional work is needed to separate what types of interventions and mechanisms are more promising. Evidence syntheses will be useful as the field matures, but such syntheses should focus on smartphone treatments that are created equal (i.e., similar intent, features, goals, and linkages in a continuum of care model) or use standards for evidence that promote rigorous evaluation while allowing identification of resources that can help those in need."

Stigma, lack of adequate mental health professionals and mental health services account for this treatment gap, which is worse in rural areas. Our project evaluated task shifting and mobile-technology based electronic decision support systems to enhance the ability of primary care health workers to provide evidence-based mental health care for stress, depression, and suicidal risk in 30 remote villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Systematic Medical Appraisal Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health project between May 2014 and April 2016 trained lay village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists - ASHAs) and primary care doctors to screen, diagnose and manage individuals with common mental disorders using an electronic decision support system. An anti-stigma campaign using multi-media approaches was conducted across the villages at the outset of the project.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The use of mental health mobile apps to treat anxiety and depression is widespread and growing. Several reviews have found that most of these apps do not have published evidence for their effectiveness, and existing research has primarily been undertaken by individuals and institutions that have an association with the app being tested. Another reason for the lack of research is that the execution of the traditional randomized controlled trial is time prohibitive in this profit-driven industry. Consequently, there have been calls for different methodologies to be considered. One such methodology is the single-case design, of which, to the best of our knowledge, no peer-reviewed published example with mental health apps for anxiety and/or depression could be located.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of 5 apps (Destressify, MoodMission, Smiling Mind, MindShift, and SuperBetter) in reducing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. These apps were selected because they are publicly available, free to download, and have published evidence of efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multiple baseline across-individuals design will be employed. A total of 50 participants will be recruited (10 for each app) who will provide baseline data for 20 days. The sequential introduction of an intervention phase will commence once baseline readings have indicated stability in the measures of participants' mental health and will proceed for 10 weeks. Postintervention measurements will continue for a further 20 days. Participants will be required to provide daily subjective units of distress (SUDS) ratings via SMS text messages and will complete other measures at 5 different time points, including at 6-month follow-up. SUDS data will be examined via a time series analysis across the experimental phases. Individual analyses of outcome measures will be conducted to detect clinically significant changes in symptoms using the statistical approach proposed by Jacobson and Truax.

We compared the operating characteristics of four short and ultrashort versions of the EPDS with the criterion standard of probable depression, defined as an EPDS-10 ≥ 13. The prevalence of probable depression (475/1144 [42 %] and 165/361 [46 %]) was consistent across both samples. The 2-item subscale demonstrated poor internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranged from 0.55 to 0.58). All four subscales demonstrated excellent discrimination, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.91 to 0.99. Maximal discrimination was observed for the 7-item depressive symptoms subscale: at the conventional screening threshold of ≥10, it had 0.97 sensitivity and 0.76 specificity for detecting probable antenatal depression. The comparability of the findings across the two studies suggests that it is feasible to use community health workers to conduct case finding for antenatal depression."

There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees; however, they are often costly, time-consuming, and characterized by a high access threshold. Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The detection of early warning signs is essential in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders. However, in bipolar patients' daily life and outpatient treatment the assessment of upcoming state changes faces several difficulties. In this trial, we examine the effectiveness of a smartphone based automated feedback about ambulatory assessed early warning signs in prolonging states of euthymia and therefore preventing hospitalization. This study aims to assess, whether patients experience longer episodes of euthymia, when their treating psychiatrists receive automated feedback about changes in communication and activity. With this additional information an intervention at an earlier stage in the development of mania or depression could be facilitated. We expect that the amount of time will be longer between affective episodes in the intervention group.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The current study is designed as a randomized, multi-center, observer-blind, active-control, parallel group trial within a nationwide research project on the topic of innovative methods for diagnostics, prevention and interventions of bipolar disorders. One hundred and twenty patients with bipolar disorder will be randomly assigned to (1) the experimental group with included automated feedback or (2) the control group without feedback. During the intervention phase, the psychopathologic state of all participants is assessed every four weeks over 18 months. Kaplan-Meier estimators will be used for estimating the survival functions, a Log-Rank test will be used to formally compare time to a new episode across treatment groups. An intention-to-treat analysis will include data from all randomized patients.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This article describes the design of a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of a smartphone-based feedback loop. This feedback loop is meant to elicit early interventions at the detection of warning signs for the prevention of affective episodes in bipolar patients. This approach will hopefully improve the chances of a timely intervention helping patients to keep a balanced mood for longer periods of time. In detail, if our hypothesis can be confirmed, clinical practice treating psychiatrists will be enabled to react quickly when changes are automatically detected. Therefore, outpatients would receive an even more individually tailored treatment concerning time and frequency of doctor's appointments.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02782910 : Title: \"Smartphone-based Ambulatory Assessment of Early Warning Signs (BipoLife_A3)\".

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      At least 100,000 patients with schizophrenia receive care from community mental health teams (CMHTs) in England. These patients have regular meetings with clinicians, who assess them, engage them in treatment and co-ordinate care. As these routine meetings are not commonly guided by research evidence, a new intervention, DIALOG, was previously designed to structure consultations. Using a hand-held computer, clinicians asked patients to rate their satisfaction with eight life domains and three treatment aspects, and to indicate whether or not additional help was needed in each area, with responses being graphically displayed and compared with previous ratings. In a European multicentre trial, the intervention improved patients’ quality of life over a 1-year period. The current programme builds on this research by further developing DIALOG in the UK.\n    \n\n\n          Research questions:\n        \n      \n      (1) How can the practical procedure of the intervention be improved, including the software used and the design of the user interface? (2) How can elements of resource-oriented interventions be incorporated into a clinician manual and training programme for a new, more extensive ‘DIALOG+’ intervention? (3) How effective and cost-effective is the new DIALOG+ intervention in improving treatment outcomes for patients with schizophrenia or a related disorder? (4) What are the views of patients and clinicians regarding the new DIALOG+ intervention?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We produced new software on a tablet computer for CMHTs in the NHS, informed by analysis of videos of DIALOG sessions from the original trial and six focus groups with 18 patients with psychosis. We developed the new ‘DIALOG+’ intervention in consultation with experts, incorporating principles of solution-focused therapy when responding to patients’ ratings and specifying the procedure in a manual and training programme for clinicians. We conducted an exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial with 49 clinicians and 179 patients with psychosis in East London NHS Foundation Trust, comparing DIALOG+ with an active control. Clinicians working as care co-ordinators in CMHTs (along with their patients) were cluster randomised 1 : 1 to either DIALOG+ or treatment as usual plus an active control, to prevent contamination. Intervention and control were to be administered monthly for 6 months, with data collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months following randomisation. The primary outcome was subjective quality of life as measured on the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life; secondary outcomes were also measured. We also established the cost-effectiveness of the DIALOG intervention using data from the Client Service Receipt Inventory, which records patients’ retrospective reports of using health- and social-care services, including hospital services, outpatient services and medication, in the 3 months prior to each time point. Data were supplemented by the clinical notes in patients’ medical records to improve accuracy. We conducted an exploratory thematic analysis of 16 video-recorded DIALOG+ sessions and measured adherence in these videos using a specially developed adherence scale. We conducted focus groups with patients (n = 19) and clinicians (n = 19) about their experiences of the intervention, and conducted thematic analyses. We disseminated the findings and made the application (app), manual and training freely available, as well as producing a protocol for a definitive trial.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients receiving the new intervention showed more favourable quality of life in the DIALOG+ group after 3 months (effect size: Cohen’s d = 0.34), after 6 months (Cohen’s d = 0.29) and after 12 months (Cohen’s d = 0.34). An analysis of video-recorded DIALOG+ sessions showed inconsistent implementation, with adherence to the intervention being a little over half of the possible score. Patients and clinicians from the DIALOG+ arm of the trial reported many positive experiences with the intervention, including better self-expression and improved efficiency of meetings. Difficulties reported with the intervention were addressed by further refining the DIALOG+ manual and training. Cost-effectiveness analyses found a 72% likelihood that the intervention both improved outcomes and saved costs.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The research was conducted solely in urban east London, meaning that the results may not be broadly generalisable to other settings.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      (1) Although services might consider adopting DIALOG+ based on the existing evidence, a definitive trial appears warranted; (2) applying DIALOG+ to patient groups with other mental disorders may be considered, and to groups with physical health problems; (3) a more flexible use with variable intervals might help to make the intervention even more acceptable and effective; (4) more process evaluation is required to identify what mechanisms precisely are involved in the improvements seen in the intervention group in the trial; and (5) what appears to make DIALOG+ effective is that it is not a separate treatment and not a technology that is administered by a specialist; rather, it changes and utilises the existing therapeutic relationship between patients and clinicians in CMHTs to initiate positive change, helping the patients to improve their quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Future research:\n        \n      \n      Future studies should include a definitive trial on DIALOG+ and test the effectiveness of the intervention with other populations, such as people with depression.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN34757603.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme."

A randomized controlled proof-of-concept trial (1:2 ratio of control:intervention) was set up with ambulatory CHF patients in stable condition in Belgium and Italy. Data were collected by means of a 6-min walking test and a number of standardized questionnaire instruments. A total of 56 (34 intervention and 22 control group) participants completed the study (77% male; mean age 63 years, sd 10.5). All depression and anxiety dimensions decreased in the intervention group (p < 0.001), while the need for sexual counselling decreased in the control group (p < 0.05). Although the group differences were not significant, self-care increased (p < 0.05), and sexual problems decreased (p < 0.05) in the intervention group only. No significant intervention effects were observed for HRQoL, self-care confidence, illness perception and exercise capacity. Overall, results of this proof-of-concept trial suggest that the HeartMan personal health system significantly improved mental and sexual health and self-care behaviour in CHF patients. These observations were in contrast to the lack of intervention effects on HRQoL, illness perception and exercise capacity."

Delivering clinical prediction tools in a way that will enhance their uptake in routine clinical practice remains challenging; however, mobile apps show promise in this respect.

By comparison, MMB was statistically superior to both TAU and FTF-CBT in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress from baseline to the 21-week follow-up (large and moderate effect sizes). Thus, after 21 weeks, the average symptom scores for depression and anxiety of women receiving MMB were approximately half those of women in both the TAU and FTF-CBT groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this RCT, MMB was at least as effective as FTF-CBT in achieving remission from a diagnosed PND episode. MMB was superior to TAU and FTF-CBT in encouraging and maintaining reduction of symptom severity over the 21-week follow-up for depressed postnatal women. These findings replicate results of prior studies on MMB that showed clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and they provide direct empirical support that internet-delivered treatment for depressed postnatal women is a viable alternative to FTF treatment. The generalizability of the results needs to be examined in future research, as RCTs of internet-based versus FTF treatments necessarily involve a subset of people who are willing to undertake either modality of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12613000881730; https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=364683&isReview=true."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This is one of the three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Although HIV infection can be prevented, still a large number of new infections occur. More effective HIV prevention interventions are needed to reduce the number of people newly infected with HIV. Phone calls can be used to potentially more effectively deliver HIV prevention interventions. They have the potential to save time, reduce costs and facilitate easier access.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effectiveness of voice landline and mobile telephone delivered HIV prevention interventions in HIV-negative persons.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, the World Health Organization's Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We searched the following grey literature sources: Dissertation Abstracts International and the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International Direct Global Health database, the System for Information on Grey Literature Europe, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections database, International AIDS Society conference database, AIDS Education Global Information System and reference lists of articles.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing the effectiveness of delivering HIV prevention by phone calls to usual care in HIV-negative people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently searched databases, screened citations, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Primary outcomes were knowledge about the causes and consequences of HIV/AIDS, change in behaviour, healthcare uptake and clinical outcomes. Secondary outcomes were users' and providers' views on the intervention, economic outcomes and adverse outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Out of 14,717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria. The included RCT recruited women and girl children who received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after rape from sexual assault services in South Africa between August 2007 and May 2008.Participants (n (number) =274) were randomised into a telephone support (n=136) and control (n=138) group. Control group participants received usual care (an interactive information session) from the sexual assault service during the 28 days in which they had to take PEP, with no further contact from the study staff. Telephone support group participants received standard care and phone calls from a counsellor throughout the 28 days when they had to take PEP.Overall, adherence to PEP was not significantly (P=0.13) different between the intervention (38.2%) and control (31.9 %) groups. Also, the proportion of participants who read a pamphlet, did not return to collect medication or with a depression were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups (P=0.006, P=0.42, P=0.72 respectively). The proportion of participants who used a diary was significantly (P=0.001) higher in the intervention group (78.8%) versus the control group (69.9%). The study authors reported that there were no recorded adverse events. The RCT did not provide information about participants' and providers' evaluation outcomes, or economic outcomes. The study had a moderate risk of bias.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found only one RCT, with a moderate risk of bias, which showed that providing PEP support by phone calls did not result in higher adherence to PEP. However, the RCT was conducted in an upper-middle-income country with high HIV prevalence, on a high-risk population and the applicability of its results on other settings and contexts is unclear. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of using phone calls for providing PEP support and for other HIV prevention interventions."

Several reports indicated that people in distress were turning to digital technology, but there was little evidence about the impact of these tools on mitigating distress.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study seeks to determine the acceptability, feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of mobile mental health apps for decreasing mental health symptoms in essential workers and unemployed individuals with suicide risk.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited participants who indicated that they were unemployed because of COVID-19 or were COVID-19-designated essential workers. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 free commercial mobile apps for managing distress that were (1) highly rated by PsyberGuide and (2) met the criteria for intervention features these participants indicated were desirable in a previous survey. Participants used the apps for 4 weeks and completed baseline and 4-week self-assessments of depression, anxiety emotional regulation, and suicide risk.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found no differences between the apps in any outcome but did find significant changes in depression and anxiety over time (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9: estimate=-1.5, SE 0.2, 95% CI -1.1 to -1.8, P<.001; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD]-7: estimate=-1.3, SE 0.2, 95% CI -1.0 to -1.6, P<.001). We found no significant changes in suicidal behavior (Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised [SBQ-R]) or emotional regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale - Short Form [DERS-SF]) for the 4 weeks. We did find a significant dose-response pattern for changes in depression and anxiety. Using the app at least once a week resulted in greater improvements in treatment conditions over time on depression (estimate=-0.6, SE 0.2, 95% CI 1.0-0.2, P=.003) and anxiety (estimate=0.1, SE 0.2, 95% CI 0.4-0.6, P=.78). There was no association between app frequency and changes in suicidal behavior (SBQ-R) or emotional regulation (DERS-SF). We further found a significant difference between the conditions with regard to app usability, with the control app being the most usable (meanBeautiful Mood 72.9, SD 16.7; meanCOVID Coach 71.2, SD 15.4; meanCalm 66.8, SD 17.3; mean7 Cups 65.2, SD 17.7).

A total of 1047 women of the INTER-ACT RCT were randomized into the intervention (n = 542) or control arm (n = 505). The lifestyle intervention consisted of 4 face-to-face coaching sessions, supported by an e-health app. Anthropometric and mental health data were collected at baseline, end of intervention and 6-months follow-up. We applied mixed models to assess whether the evolution over time of depressive symptoms, anxiety, sense of coherence and quality of life differed between the intervention and control arm, taking into account the women's pre-pregnancy BMI. There was no statistical evidence for a difference in evolution in anxiety or quality of life between intervention and control arm. But an improvement in symptoms of depression and sense of coherence was observed in women who received the intervention, depending on the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI.

Both intervention groups received the mobile phone-based self-management system Few Touch Application (FTA). The FTA consisted of a blood glucose-measuring system with automatic wireless data transfer, diet manual, physical activity registration, and management of personal goals, all recorded and operated using a diabetes diary app on the mobile phone.

Sleep-related disorders are common in primary care practice and incorporating sleep tracker data may help in improving patient care. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a sleep program using the Fitbit Charge 2™ device and SleepLife® application. The main aim of the study was to examine whether a program using a commercially available wearable sleep tracker device providing objective sleep data would improve communication in primary care settings between patients and their providers. Secondary aims included whether patient satisfaction with care would improve as result of the program.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective, randomized, parallel group, observational pilot study was conducted in 20 primary care clinics in Indianapolis, IN from June 2018 to February 2019. Inclusion criteria included patients over the age of 18, have a diagnosis of insomnia identified by electronic medical record and/or a validated questionnaire, and were on a prescription sleep aid. The study was not specific to any sleep aid prescription, branded or generic, and was not designed to evaluate a drug or drug class. Each primary care clinic was randomized to either the SleepLife® intervention or the control arm. All patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge 2™ device. Only patients in the intervention arm were educated on how to use the SleepLife® application. Physicians in the intervention arm were set up with the SleepLife® portal on their computers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-nine physicians and 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 12.8) years and 61% were female. Mean age of physicians was 47 (SD 10.6) years. Patients showed high rates of involvement in the program with 83% completing all survey questions. Physician survey completion rate was 55%. Only one physician logged into the SleepLife portal to check their patients' sleep status. At the end of the 6-week intervention, patients' composite general satisfaction scores with sleep health management decreased significantly in the intervention arm when compared to controls (p = 0.03). Patients' satisfaction with communication also decreased significantly in the intervention group (p = 0.01). The sleep outcomes, which were calculated on the basis of study questionnaire answers, improved significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Physician communication satisfaction scores remained unchanged (p = 0.12).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      SleepLife® and its related physician portal can facilitate physician-patient communication, and it captures patient sleep outcomes including behaviors and habits. Patients were highly engaged with the program, while physicians did not demonstrate engagement. The study design and questionnaires do not specifically address the reasons behind the decreased patient satisfaction with care and communication, but it was perceived to be a result of physician non-responsiveness. Sleep quality scores on the other hand showed an improvement among SleepLife® users, suggesting that patients may have implemented good sleep practices on their own. Given that it was a feasibility study, and the sample size was small, we were not able to make major inferences regarding the difference between sleep disorder types. Additionally, we excluded patients with a history of alcohol use, substance abuse, or depression because of concerns that they may affect sleep independently. To promote the growth of technology in primary care, further research incorporating results from this study and physician engagement techniques should be included."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Serious mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, affects approximately 4% of the US population and profoundly affects individuals, their families, and communities. Mobile Health (mHealth) approaches that use mobile phones in support of health care can help overcome some of the barriers associated with clinic-based care. Whether mHealth interventions can serve as standalone treatments, effectively engage individuals with SMI in remote care, and produce clinical outcomes that are comparable to clinic-based interventions is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      mHealth approaches that use mobile phones to deliver interventions can play an important role in improving access to care for people with serious mental illness. The goal of this study was to evaluate how an mHealth intervention (FOCUS) performs against a traditional group-based treatment (Wellness Recovery Action Planning [WRAP]). The specific aims of the study were to (1) evaluate and compare the willingness and ability of individuals with SMI to enroll in the 2 illness self-management interventions, (2) examine and compare participant engagement and satisfaction with both treatments, and (3) examine and compare patient outcomes following participation in the interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted an assessor-blind, 2-arm, randomized controlled intervention superiority trial between June 2015 and September 2017 in partnership with Thresholds, a large community mental health agency that provides services to people with serious mental illness living in the Midwestern United Sates. The participants were 163 predominantly minority clients with long-term, serious mental illnesses (49% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 28% with bipolar disorder, and 23% with major depressive disorder). The outcomes were engagement throughout the intervention period, satisfaction posttreatment, and improvement in clinical outcomes (assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up). Our primary clinical outcome was general psychopathology, which is most appropriate for the range of clinical groups represented in the sample of people with serious mental illness. Secondary clinical outcomes included depression, psychosis, recovery, and quality of life. Individuals were randomized (1:1 ratio) into FOCUS (n = 82) or WRAP (n = 81). Interventions were deployed for a period of 12 weeks, using cycles of 8 cohorts of participants assigned to individual FOCUS or group-based WRAP over parallel periods. Participants were not monetarily incentivized to engage in interventions but were compensated for completing assessments. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02421965).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants assigned to FOCUS were more likely to commence treatment (90% vs 58%) and remain fully engaged in 8 weeks of care (56% vs 40%) than those assigned to WRAP. Patient satisfaction ratings were comparably high for both interventions. Participants in both groups improved significantly and did not differ on clinical outcomes, including general psychopathology and depression. We saw statistically significant improvements in recovery within the WRAP group posttreatment, and we saw significant improvements in recovery and quality of life within the FOCUS group at 6-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in retention of gains over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both the FOCUS and WRAP interventions produced significant gains in predominantly minority clients with severe and persistent mental illnesses. The mHealth intervention (FOCUS) showed superior treatment commencement and patient engagement and produced patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes that were not statistically different from those produced by a widely used clinic-based group intervention for illness management (WRAP). If clinicians or patients are given the option to select from these 2 treatment options, the findings of our research can directly inform their decision-making. Broadly, this study supports the notion that mHealth can play an important role in 21st century mental health care. Contemporary mobile phone “smart” functionalities enable these devices to serve as much more than staid information repositories. Audio and video media players, graphics displays, interactive capabilities, bidirectional calling and texting, and internet connectivity create new opportunities to engage patients with both automated resources and human supports. Policymakers contemplating whether mHealth should be recognized as a viable (and potentially billable/reimbursable) service will be encouraged to see our findings, which suggest that some mHealth interventions warrant consideration, as they produce outcomes that are comparable to more time-/labor-/resource-intensive clinic-based care.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      We did not include a usual-treatment comparator arm. We are unable to conclude that the clinical outcomes reported in the study are a direct result of the interventions deployed, rather than the passage of time, artifacts related to involvement in research, or treatment from outside the research.\n    \n\n      \n      We developed measures of engagement and satisfaction for this study that have not been evaluated and validated in previous research. Because the study was powered to detect differences in the full sample between treatment groups, exploratory analyses have reduced power and thus should be interpreted with caution."

Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns' daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week's mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week's mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found that the previous week's mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week's mood with an estimated moderation of -0.052 (P=.001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week's step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week's step count, with an estimated moderation of -0.039 (P=.01) and that the previous week's sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week's sleep with an estimated moderation of -0.075 (P<.001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that an individual's current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health.

            "title": "Behavioural interventions delivered through interactive social media for health behaviour change, health outcomes, and health equity in the adult population.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Social networking platforms offer a wide reach for public health interventions allowing communication with broad audiences using tools that are generally free and straightforward to use and may be combined with other components, such as public health policies. We define interactive social media as activities, practices, or behaviours among communities of people who have gathered online to interactively share information, knowledge, and opinions.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to assess the effectiveness of interactive social media interventions, in which adults are able to communicate directly with each other, on changing health behaviours, body functions, psychological health, well-being, and adverse effects. Our secondary objective was to assess the effects of these interventions on the health of populations who experience health inequity as defined by PROGRESS-Plus. We assessed whether there is evidence about PROGRESS-Plus populations being included in studies and whether results are analysed across any of these characteristics.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE (including trial registries) and PsycINFO. We used Google, Web of Science, and relevant web sites to identify additional studies and searched reference lists of included studies. We searched for published and unpublished studies from 2001 until June 1, 2020. We did not limit results by language.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs). We included studies in which the intervention website, app, or social media platform described a goal of changing a health behaviour, or included a behaviour change technique. The social media intervention had to be delivered to adults via a commonly-used social media platform or one that mimicked a commonly-used platform. We included studies comparing an interactive social media intervention alone or as a component of a multi-component intervention with either a non-interactive social media control or an active but less-interactive social media comparator (e.g. a moderated versus an unmoderated discussion group). Our main outcomes were health behaviours (e.g. physical activity), body function outcomes (e.g. blood glucose), psychological health outcomes (e.g. depression), well-being, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were process outcomes important for behaviour change and included knowledge, attitudes, intention and motivation, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and social support.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used a pre-tested data extraction form and collected data independently, in duplicate. Because we aimed to assess broad outcomes, we extracted only one outcome per main and secondary outcome categories prioritised by those that were the primary outcome as reported by the study authors, used in a sample size calculation, and patient-important.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 88 studies (871,378 participants), of which 84 were RCTs, three were CBAs and one was an ITS. The majority of the studies were conducted in the USA (54%). In total, 86% were conducted in high-income countries and the remaining 14% in upper middle-income countries. The most commonly used social media platform was Facebook (39%) with few studies utilising other platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google Hangouts. Many studies (48%) used web-based communities or apps that mimic functions of these well-known social media platforms. We compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with non-interactive social media interventions, which included paper-based or in-person interventions or no intervention. We only reported the RCT results in our 'Summary of findings' table. We found a range of effects on health behaviours, such as breastfeeding, condom use, diet quality, medication adherence, medical screening and testing, physical activity, tobacco use, and vaccination. For example, these interventions may increase physical activity and medical screening tests but there was little to no effect for other health behaviours, such as improved diet or reduced tobacco use (20,139 participants in 54 RCTs). For body function outcomes, interactive social media interventions may result in small but important positive effects, such as a small but important positive effect on weight loss and a small but important reduction in resting heart rate (4521 participants in 30 RCTs). Interactive social media may improve overall well-being (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.79, moderate effect, low-certainty evidence) demonstrated by an increase of 3.77 points on a general well-being scale (from 1.15 to 6.48 points higher) where scores range from 14 to 70 (3792 participants in 16 studies). We found no difference in effect on psychological outcomes (depression and distress) representing a difference of 0.1 points on a standard scale in which scores range from 0 to 63 points (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.12, low-certainty evidence, 2070 participants in 12 RCTs). We also compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with those with an active but less interactive social media control (11 studies). Four RCTs (1523 participants) that reported on physical activity found an improvement demonstrated by an increase of 28 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (from 10 to 47 minutes more, SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, small effect, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies found little to no difference in well-being for those in the intervention and control groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13, small effect, low-certainty evidence), demonstrated by a mean change of 0.4 points on a scale with a range of 0 to 100. Adverse events related to the social media component of the interventions, such as privacy issues, were not reported in any of our included studies. We were unable to conduct planned subgroup analyses related to health equity as only four studies reported relevant data.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review combined data for a variety of outcomes and found that social media interventions that aim to increase physical activity may be effective and social media interventions may improve well-being. While we assessed many other outcomes, there were too few studies to compare or, where there were studies, the evidence was uncertain. None of our included studies reported adverse effects related to the social media component of the intervention. Future studies should assess adverse events related to the interactive social media component and should report on population characteristics to increase our understanding of the potential effect of these interventions on reducing health inequities."

            "title": "Digital Treatment of Back Pain versus Standard of Care: The Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial, Rise-uP.",
            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Non-specific low back pain (NLBP) causes an enormous burden to patients and tremendous costs for health care systems worldwide. Frequently, treatments are not oriented to existing guidelines. In the future, digital elements may be promising tools to support guideline-oriented treatment in a broader range of patients. The cluster-randomized controlled \"Rise-uP\" trial aims to support a General Practitioner (GP)-centered back pain treatment (Registration No: DRKS00015048) and includes the following digital elements: 1) electronic case report form (eCRF), 2) a treatment algorithm for guideline-based clinical decision making of GPs, 3) teleconsultation between GPs and pain specialists for patients at risk for development of chronic back pain, and 4) a multidisciplinary mobile back pain app for all patients (Kaia App).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In the Rise-uP trial, 111 GPs throughout Bavaria (southern Germany) were randomized either to the Rise-uP intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Rise-uP patients were treated according to the guideline-oriented Rise-uP treatment algorithm. Standard of care was applied to the CG patients with consideration given to the \"National guideline for the treatment of non-specific back pain\". Pain rating on the numeric rating scale was the primary outcome measure. Psychological measures (anxiety, depression, stress), functional ability, as well as physical and mental wellbeing, served as secondary outcomes. All values were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and at 3-month follow-ups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 1245 patients (IG: 933; CG: 312) with NLBP were included in the study. The Rise-uP group showed a significantly stronger pain reduction compared to the control group after 3 months (IG: M=-33.3% vs CG: M=-14.3%). The Rise-uP group was also superior in secondary outcomes. Furthermore, high-risk patients who received a teleconsultation showed a larger decrease in pain intensity (-43.5%) than CG patients (-14.3%). ANCOVA analysis showed that the impact of teleconsultation was mediated by an increased training activity in the Kaia App.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our results show the superiority of the innovative digital treatment algorithm realized in Rise-uP, even though the CG also received relevant active treatment by their GPs. This provides clear evidence that digital treatment may be a promising tool to improve the quality of treatment of non-specific back pain. In 2021, analyses of routine data from statutory health insurances will enable us to investigate the cost-effectiveness of digital treatment."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To prevent the exacerbation of mental health burdens, a growing body of research has recommended a balanced approach that emphasizes both the delivery of mental health treatments to individuals with common mental disorders (CMDs) and the strengthening of protective factors for CMDs among nonclinical populations. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy of a smartphone-delivered multicomponent lifestyle medicine (LM) intervention, Lifestyle Hub, for improving mental health among a nonclinical population of Chinese adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 106 participants with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score < 10 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale <8 were randomly assigned to either the Lifestyle Hub intervention group (LH, n = 53) or the waitlist control group (WL, n = 53). Lifestyle Hub is an 8-week smartphone-delivered multicomponent LM intervention developed based on the transtheoretical model. The intervention components included lifestyle psychoeducation, physical activity, diet and nutrition, stress management, sleep management, and motivation and goal-setting techniques. Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up (LH only).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The linear mixed effect model based on the intention-to-treat principle indicated that Lifestyle Hub significantly improved overall mental health, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, stress, insomnia severity, overall health-promoting behaviors, dietary quality, and stress management compared to the WL group at immediate post-intervention (d = 0.13-0.56). No significant between-group differences were observed in terms of functional impairment, health-related quality of life, health responsibility, physical activity level, spiritual growth, and interpersonal relations. The intervention gains in the LH group were maintained at 1-month follow-up. The LH participants indicated that Lifestyle Hub was an acceptable intervention for improving mental health, although a significantly higher level of study attrition was observed in the LH group (20.8%) relative to the WL group (5.7%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Lifestyle Hub may serve as an efficacious and acceptable intervention for improving mental health in nonclinical adult populations. To extend the benefits of LM interventions at the population level, future studies are warranted to examine a stepped-care approach to delivering LM interventions.Trial registration: This randomized controlled trial was pre-registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04295369)."

Adult participants experiencing high levels of loneliness will be recruited from the general population. Individuals currently experiencing at least moderately severe depressive symptoms, an ongoing severe substance use disorder, previous or current bipolar or psychotic disorder, or acute suicidality will be excluded from the trial. Assessments will take place at baseline, 5 weeks (midassessment), and 10 weeks (postassessment). The primary outcome is loneliness assessed using the 9-item University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale at the posttreatment time point. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, symptoms of social anxiety, satisfaction with life, social network size, and variables assessing cognitive bias and social behavior. The maintenance of potentially achieved gains will be assessed and compared at 6 and 12 months after randomization in the 2 active conditions.

Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study's primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score ≥55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately after the participant's encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activation-based features specifically developed for users with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference -4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Delivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants' engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified.

In total, 49 adults with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder n=20, social phobia n=19, agoraphobia without panic n=12, panic with agoraphobia n=6, panic without agoraphobia n=4, subclinical depression n=41) received access to the 7-session intervention. We examined motivation and expectations, intervention use, user experience, impact, and modification requests. Qualitative data were assessed using semistructured interviews and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Quantitative outcomes included symptom severity of anxiety and depression (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], Quick Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology clinician rating [QIDS-C]), diagnostic status in clinical interviews (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), and web-based self-reports (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale [PAS], Social Phobia Scale [SPS], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at baseline and postassessment.

The main positive effects were the general improvement of disease burden and attentiveness to feelings and risk situations while the main negative effects experienced were lack of change in disease burden and symptom deterioration. The most prevalent reasons for participation were the advantages of online treatment, symptom burden, and openness toward online treatment. Helpful factors included support, psychoeducation and practicing strategies in daily life; the main hindering factors were too little individualization and being overwhelmed by the content and pace.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The intervention was found to be feasible and results show preliminary data indicating potential efficacy for improving anxiety and depression.

ICBT's effectiveness has been investigated in treating and managing conditions like depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, and phobias. ICBT's role in the treatment of medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus with comorbid psychiatric illnesses was also explored. Furthermore, this study elaborates on its cost-effectiveness and its impact in rural areas. We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar with no restrictions on the date. ICBT's role in treating and controlling psychiatric illnesses has been established in the literature. From the data compiled, we conclude that ICBT is useful in treating mental health and medical illnesses with psychiatric comorbidities. It has also been found to be cost-effective for patients and society. ICBT is a potential tool emerging with modern day technological advancements and is useful in rural and urban settings, across various languages and cultures, and on a global scale. Larger randomized control trials on its use in clinical practice and in reaching rural populations are bound to shed more light on the effectiveness of this tool along with spreading awareness among physician and patient communities."

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective for treating these symptoms; however, cancer survivors are often unable to participate in face-to-face interventions because of difficulties such as work and family commitments, treatment-related side-effects, scheduling conflicts, and geography. Smartphone app-based MBIs are an innovative way to deliver psychosocial cancer care and can overcome several such difficulties, since patients can participate at their own convenience.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The SEAMLESS (Smartphone App-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Cancer Survivors) study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a tailored app-based mindfulness intervention for cancer survivors (the Am Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship-MBCS-Journey) for treating (1) symptoms of stress (primary outcome), as well as (2) fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and overall physical functioning (secondary outcomes).

Therefore, there is an increasing need to find new efficient strategies to deliver and extend PE programs to a wider population of BD patients. Mobile apps are a cost-effective way to deliver PE. In the Italian healthcare context, no evidence about the use of apps is available. The current paper presents the protocol about the development of a smartphone app to deliver PE for BD and the protocol for a trial assessing its effectiveness. In euthymic BD patients, the study will compare the adherence rates to antipsychotics between PE delivered through Bipolar mobile Application (Bip.App), group PE and a combination of both, will investigate demographic, socio-cultural and clinical predictors of lower adherence in the arms, and will investigate whether PE combined with Bip.App is associated with lower risk of recurrence of (hypo)manic and depressive episodes than group PE alone, and assess the feasibility and satisfaction for Bip.App. Participants will be recruited from mental health centres and included if they are 18-65 year-old, have primary BD in the euthymic phase, they have been prescribed a second-generation oral antipsychotic as a maintenance/prophylactic therapy for at least 1 year, they have not undergone a structured protocol of PE for BD, they have access to a smartphone and sufficient competence in using it.

However, iCBT programmes include training in a wide array of cognitive and behavioural skills via different delivery methods, and it remains unclear which of these components are more efficacious and for whom.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a systematic review and individual participant data component network meta-analysis (cNMA) of iCBT trials for depression. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to Jan 1, 2019, that compared any form of iCBT against another or a control condition in the acute treatment of adults (aged ≥18 years) with depression. Studies with inpatients or patients with bipolar depression were excluded. We sought individual participant data from the original authors. When these data were unavailable, we used aggregate data. Two independent researchers identified the included components. The primary outcome was depression severity, expressed as incremental mean difference (iMD) in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores when a component is added to a treatment. We developed a web app that estimates relative efficacies between any two combinations of components, given baseline patient characteristics. This study is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018104683.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We identified 76 RCTs, including 48 trials contributing individual participant data (11 704 participants) and 28 trials with aggregate data (6474 participants). The participants' weighted mean age was 42·0 years and 12 406 (71%) of 17 521 reported were women. There was suggestive evidence that behavioural activation might be beneficial (iMD -1·83 [95% credible interval (CrI) -2·90 to -0·80]) and that relaxation might be harmful (1·20 [95% CrI 0·17 to 2·27]). Baseline severity emerged as the strongest prognostic factor for endpoint depression. Combining human and automated encouragement reduced dropouts from treatment (incremental odds ratio, 0·32 [95% CrI 0·13 to 0·93]). The risk of bias was low for the randomisation process, missing outcome data, or selection of reported results in most of the included studies, uncertain for deviation from intended interventions, and high for measurement of outcomes. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the studies and their components.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      The individual patient data cNMA revealed potentially helpful, less helpful, or harmful components and delivery formats for iCBT packages. iCBT packages aiming to be effective and efficient might choose to include beneficial components and exclude ones that are potentially detrimental. Our web app can facilitate shared decision making by therapist and patient in choosing their preferred iCBT package.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Postnatal depression adversely affects many mothers and infants with good evidence that caregiving difficulties associated with depressive symptoms play a key role in later adverse childhood outcomes. In many countries, there is only limited support available for women who experience symptoms of depression during the postnatal period, particularly those experiencing subthreshold symptom levels. Furthermore, mental health services and community family health services in many countries tend to focus primarily on providing help for depressive symptoms or maternal caregiving, respectively, despite these problems commonly being comorbid. Group-based nurse-led interventions delivered over the Web through mobile phone \"apps\" have the potential to be a cost-effective method of providing a large number of mothers with easy access to integrated support for both maternal depressive symptoms and caregiving difficulties.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper describes the protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a 4-month group-based nurse-led intervention delivered over the Web when infants were 2-6 months. The primary aims of the trial are to determine whether the intervention (1) reduces levels of maternal depressive symptoms and (2) improves the quality of maternal caregiving when infants are 8-12 months of age.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The trial aimed to recruit and randomize 160 mothers of infants aged 2-8 weeks to either the intervention (eMums plus) or standard care. Assessments were completed when infants were aged 1-2 (preintervention), 8, and 12 months. The primary outcomes were the level of maternal depressive symptoms and the quality of maternal caregiving assessed when infants were aged 12 months. The intervention provided specific support for problems with mood and problems with caregiving.

It is important to measure patient-reported outcomes and monitor progress or challenges over time when managing T2D to understand patients' perception of health and quantify the impact of disease processes or intervention effects. The evaluation of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) is especially important among patients with multiple chronic conditions in which clinical measures do not provide a complete picture of health.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study examined the feasibility of collecting Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, and preliminarily evaluated changes in PROMIS scores and compared the scores with standard scores of the general US population. The parent study is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial testing three different modes (mobile health [mHealth], paper diary, and control) of self-monitoring in a behavioral lifestyle intervention among overweight or obese patients with T2D.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with comorbid overweight or obesity and a diagnosis of T2D for at least 6 months were recruited from a diabetes education program.

A systematic search was conducted for trial-based economic evaluations published before 10th May 2021. Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PSYNDEX, and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) were searched for randomized controlled trials examining IMIs targeting mental disorders and symptoms and conducting a full health economic evaluation. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was assumed at or below £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Of the 4044 studies, 36 economic evaluations were reviewed. Guided IMIs were likely to be cost-effective in depression and anxiety. The quality of most evaluations was good, albeit with some risks of bias. Heterogeneity across studies was high because of factors such as different costing methods, design, comparison groups, and outcomes used. IMIs for anxiety and depression have potential to be cost-effective.

However, real-world usage of apps is typically not sustained over time, and no studies systematically examine which features increase sustained engagement with apps or the relationship between engagement features and clinical efficacy. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify empirical studies that (1) investigate standalone apps for depression and/or anxiety in symptomatic participants and (2) report at least one measure of engagement. Features intended to increase engagement were categorized using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and principles of behavioral economics. Twenty-five studies with 4159 participants were included in the analysis. PSD features were commonly used, whereas behavioral economics techniques were not. Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888, SE = 0.0999, z(15) = 2.89, p = 0.0119, Q(df = 14) = 41.93, p < 0.0001, I2 = 66.6%), and apps that employed a greater number of engagement features as compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450, SE = 0.0164, t(15) = 2.7344, p = 0.0161). We observed an unexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = -0.0293, SE = 0.0121, t(17) = 02.4142, p = 0.0281). Overall, PSD features show promise for augmenting app efficacy, though engagement, as reflected in study completion, may not be the primary factor driving this association. The results suggest that expanding the use of PSD features in mental health apps may increase clinical benefits and that other techniques, such as those informed by behavioral economics, are employed infrequently."

The effectiveness of the HOM-HEMP will next be tested in a full scale randomised control trial."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Researchers have largely turned to commercial app stores, randomized trials, and systematic reviews to make sense of the mHealth landscape. Few studies have approached understanding by collecting information from target end users. The end user perspective is critical as end user interest in and use of mHealth technologies will ultimately drive the efficacy of these tools.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to obtain information from end users of mHealth technologies to better understand the physical and mental health apps people use and for what purposes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      People with depressive or anxious symptoms (N=176) seeking entry into a trial of mental health and well-being apps for Android devices completed online questionnaires assessing depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), past and current mental health treatment-seeking behavior, overall mobile device use, and use of mobile health apps. Participants reported the physical health and mental health apps on their devices and their reasons for using them. Data were extracted from the participant self-reports and apps and app purposes were coded in order to categorize them.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants were largely white, middle-aged females from the Midwest region of the United States recruited via a health care organization and Web-based advertising (135 female, 41 male, mean age 38.64 years, age range 19-75 years.) Over three-quarters (137/176, 77.8%) of participants indicated having a health app on their device. The top 3 kinds of apps were exercise, fitness, and pedometers or heart rate monitoring apps (93/176, 52.8%); diet, food, or calorie counting apps (65/177, 36.9%); and mental health/wellness apps (46/177, 26.1%). The mean number of mobile physical and mental health apps on a participant's phone was 2.15 (SD 3.195). Of 176 participants, 107 (60.8%) specifically reported the top 5 health apps that they used and their purposes. Across the 107 participants, a total of 285 apps were reported, with 139 being unique apps. The majority of these apps were free (129/139, 92.8%). Almost two-thirds of participants (67/107, 62.6%) reported using health apps at least on a daily basis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Among those seeking support for their well-being via physical and mental health apps, people are using a variety of health apps. These people use health apps on a daily basis, especially free apps. The most common reason for using a health app is to track some health-related data; for mental health apps specifically, training or habit building was the most popular reason. Understanding the end user perspective is important because it allows us to build on the foundation of previously established mHealth research and may help guide future work in mHealth.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02176226; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02176226 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6rGc1MGyM)."
