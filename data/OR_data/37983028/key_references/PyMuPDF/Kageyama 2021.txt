Background: A smartphone application (i.e., SPSRS) was developed to help people with subthreshold depression 
(StD) improve depressive symptoms by presenting positive word stimuli in videos. However, to date, no ran­
domized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to investigate SPSRS application interventions for depressive 
symptoms in people with StD. Therefore, a pilot RCT was conducted to assess the preliminary efficacy of the 
SPSRS application intervention for people with StD. 
Methods: In a pilot RCT, 32 participants (female = 34.4%, mean age = 20.06, SD = 1.24) with StD were ran­
domized to SPSRS application intervention for approximately 10 min/a day for 5 weeks (experimental group; n 
= 16) or no intervention (wait list control group; n = 16). The primary outcome is the change from baseline in 
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score after the 5-week intervention. The sec­
ondary outcomes are the change from baseline in the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K-6) 
score and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) after the 5-week intervention. 
Results: No participants dropped out of the study. The experimental group displayed medium, small, and small 
improvements in CES-D, K-6, and GAD-7 scores (adjusted Hedge’s g = −0.64, −0.29, and −0.40), respectively, 
compared with control. 
Limitations: The observed effects must be considered preliminary due to the small sample size. 
Conclusions: The results suggest the potential of intervention using the SPSRS application to reduce depressive 
symptoms in people with StD. Future studies should replicate these findings in a full-scale RCT.   
1. Introduction 
Subthreshold depression (StD), which is also called subsyndromal or 
minor depression, fails to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder 
(MDD) (Rodríguez, Nuevo, Chatterji, & Ayuso-Mateos, 2012). However, 
it is characterized by the presence of clinically significant depressive 
symptoms (Rodríguez et al., 2012). Previous studies reported the prev­
alence of StD at 4.0–53.2% (Meeks, Vahia, Lavretsky, Kulkarni, & Jeste, 
2011; Takahashi, Takada, Inoue, et al., 2019; Vaccaro et al., 2017; 
Xiang, Leggett, Himle, & Kales, 2018), which leads to poor health 
(Ayuso-Mateos, Nuevo, Verdes, Naidoo, & Chatterji, 2010), poor quality 
of life (Cuijpers, Smit, & van Straten, 2007; Goldney, Fisher, Dal Grande, 
& Taylor, 2004; Rodríguez et al., 2012), increased mortality (Ho, Jin, 
Nyunt, Feng, & Ng, 2016), and increased economic costs (Cuijpers, Smit, 
Oostenbrink, et al., 2007). Notably, StD is a precursor to MDD and an 
important risk factor for the onset of MDD (Cuijpers, Smit, & van 
Straten, 2007; Lee et al., 2019; Naber & Bullinger, 2018; Wesselhoeft, 
Sørensen, Heiervang, & Bilenberg, 2013). Therefore, StD is a group that 
has an extremely high risk of onset of MDD. In other words, if StD is a 
precursor to MDD (Cuijpers, Smit, & van Straten, 2007), which is a 
major public health problem, then StD is a clear target for preventive 
intervention and requires appropriate intervention for its early

recognition and treatment. Psychological treatments, such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy and mindfulness, are effective interventions for StD 
and may prevent the onset of MDD (Cuijpers et al., 2014; Walsh, 
Eisenlohr-Moul, & Baer, 2016). A meta-analysis finds that psychother­
apy reduces the risk of depressive symptoms and future MDD in adults 
with StD (Cuijpers et al., 2014; Cuijpers, Smit, & van Straten, 2007). 
However, although evidence suggests that such programs are effective, 
several obstacles to their widespread implementation have been 
observed. Psychotherapy requires a qualified and specialized staff and 
increases costs, thus limiting the scale of treatment (Zhou, Li, Pei, Gao, & 
Kong, 2016). Another barrier is the limited access to psychotherapy 
especially for rural people and outpatients with restricted mobility 
(Titzler, Saruhanjan, Berking, Riper, & Ebert, 2018). Moreover, patients 
may hesitate to receive treatment because of stigma and embarrassment 
(Cuijpers, van Straten, & Andersson, 2008; Pedersen & Paves, 2014). 
Given the limitations of psychotherapy, developing accessible in­
terventions for improving depressive symptoms in people with StD is 
required. Interventions using smartphone applications may address the 
abovementioned issues. The previous years have seen an explosive in­
crease in interest and development in smartphone applications, thus 
paving the way for new treatments for mental health (Firth et al., 2017; 
Miralles et al., 2020). An advantage of smartphone applications is that 
many cheap or free applications that improve access to treatments are 
available and may be easier and less burdensome to patients (Grist, 
Porter, & Stallard, 2017; Miralles et al., 2020). These factors enable 
patients to receive interventions tailored to their personal lifestyle in 
their communities and even homes. This convenience could ultimately 
provide significant benefits to the society in general and the insurance 
system in particular. Several smartphone applications have been 
developed for MDD or StD (Firth et al., 2017; Miralles et al., 2020). 
However, to date, smartphone applications using video viewing for 
MDD or StD have not been developed (Firth et al., 2017; Miralles et al., 
2020). Video viewing is a rapidly growing trend around the world 
(Madathil, Rivera-Rodriguez, Greenstein, & Gramopadhye, 2015). 
Given that many people now rely on smartphones for their video 
viewing methods, video-based interventions can reach a large number of 
individuals who are eligible for treatment via smartphones. If the 
intervention using video viewing proves effective, then it may become a 
new intervention strategy in the treatment of StD and shed new light on 
this condition. Therefore, the study developed a smartphone application 
(i.e., SPSRS) that uses video viewing for the treatment of StD (Takaha­
shi, Takada, & Hirao, 2019). The central therapeutic goal of the SPSRS 
application is to improve depressive symptoms in people with StD by 
presenting positive word stimulation through videos (Takahashi, 
Takada, & Hirao, 2019). In this manner, progression to MDD is pre­
vented and users are enabled to manage their health. 
The first study on interventions using SPSRS applications that tar­
geted people with StD investigated the feasibility of such interventions 
(Takahashi, Takada, & Hirao, 2019). As a result, no adverse events were 
noted during the intervention through SPSRS applications. Moreover, 
the present study found that the SPSRS application is safe and 
easy-to-use. In addition, a previous study suggested that intervention 
through the SPSRS application could improve depressive symptoms in 
people with StD (Takahashi, Takada, & Hirao, 2019). However, the 
study conducted was a single-arm trial without a control group. 
Therefore, a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) is required to 
assess the efficacy of SPSRS application interventions for people with 
StD. However, formal sample size calculations were difficult due to the 
lack of published RCT data on the potential impact of SPSRS application 
interventions on depressive symptoms in people with StD. Validating the 
preliminary efficacy through pilot trials can provide information for 
subsequent full-scale RCT sample size calculations, which is especially 
advisable in the absence of previous study data (Thabane et al., 2010). 
Therefore, as a preliminary step toward a full-scale RCT implementa­
tion, the present conducted a pilot RCT aimed at verifying the pre­
liminary efficacy of the SPSRS application for people with StD. We 
hypothesized that people with StD who received the SPSRS application 
intervention experienced a greater amelioration of depressive symptoms 
before and after treatment than those who had StD but did not receive 
the SPSRS application intervention. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Trial design 
The study was designed as a single-center, assessor-blind, two-arm, 
randomized, parallel-group, pilot controlled trial. The Ethics Review 
Board of Kibi International University approved the study protocol 
(approval numbers: 19–33) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT04136041). The details of study design are published in a protocol 
paper (Kato et al., 2020). The study was conducted according to the 
CONSORT 2010 extension to randomized pilot and feasibility trials 
(Eldridge et al., 2016). 
2.2. Randomization 
All eligible participants were randomly assigned to the experimental 
or wait list control group at a 1: 1 ratio after baseline evaluation. An 
Excel spreadsheet by a third party independent of the study was used to 
generate a randomized list based on the permuted block method (block 
size 4). The created randomized list was sent to the Central Registration 
Center, which is set up at Kurashiki Heisei Hospital in Japan and where 
random allocation was made. In this manner, the allocation process was 
concealed. 
2.3. Settings and recruitment 
Details on the recruitment of participants are published in the pro­
tocol paper (Kato et al., 2020). The participants were recruited through 
Kibi International University in Okayama Prefecture, Japan. Okayama 
Prefecture has a population of approximately 1,890,000, of which 
approximately 45,000 (2.4%) are university students. Kibi International 
University has approximately 1,800 students. Kibi International Uni­
versity not only has a healthcare center but also works closely with the 
local community and surrounding organizations. This permits access to 
professional counseling and other services when participants show signs 
of poor mental or physical health. Research leaflets, emails, and social 
networking services were used to invite potential participants. All ma­
terials included a dedicated email address for contacting the research 
team. The researchers briefed the participants regarding the details of 
the study using informational materials. The participants were then sent 
the URL of an online questionnaire to assess eligibility. Informed consent 
was provided through the questionnaire, which was administered prior 
to the baseline assessment. Consent was confirmed by pressing the 
consent button. After assessing eligibility using the online questionnaire 
and completing the baseline assessment, the participants were randomly 
assigned to an experimental or a wait list control group. 
2.4. Participants 
Participants in this study were recruited from Kibi International 
University using the convenience sampling method. 
The eligibility criteria for participants were as follows. 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1) 18 years and older  
2) Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score ≥
16 (Shima, Shikano, Kitamura, & Asai, 1985)  
3) Owns a smartphone with an iOS® operating system  
4) Written informed consent prior to participation 
Exclusion Criteria: 
K. Kageyama et al.

1) Lifetime history of psychiatric disorders  
2) Currently receiving treatment for a mental health problem from a 
mental health professional  
3) Vision or hearing deficits that negatively impact everyday life  
4) Experience of a major depressive episode 2 weeks prior to the study 
as determined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Inter­
view (MINI) (Otsubo et al., 2005) 
We strongly encouraged participants to seek additional assistance if 
major depressive episodes were observed using MINI and provided in­
formation on relevant health services (such as the university healthcare 
center and professional counseling). 
2.5. Sample size 
One of the objectives of the study is to calculate the sample size 
suitable for a full-scale trial implementation. Thus far, no RCT has used 
the SPSRS application for people with StD. Therefore, sample size cal­
culations for future full-scale trials can be derived from the results of the 
CES-D score, which is the primary outcome of this pilot trial. Although 
no formal sample size calculations are required for pilot RCTs (Thabane 
et al., 2010), a total of 15–20 participants per group are required to 
ensure the scientific validity of the results (Hertzog, 2008). Therefore, 
the study aimed to attract a total of 32 participants at 16 members per 
group. 
2.6. Assessment measures 
An assessor blinded to the objectives of the study collected the pri­
mary and secondary outcomes online. As part of the baseline assessment, 
this study collected demographic data such as age and sex, as well as 
lifestyle characteristics such as sleep time, smoking habits, exercise 
habits, and drinking habits. Sleep time was defined as the average sleep 
time per week (Hall et al., 2008). Drinking habits were defined as 
drinking at least one bottle (approximately 500 mL) of beer per day, ≥3 
days a week (Takimoto, Yokoyama, Yoshiike, & Fukuoka, 2005). 
Smoking habits were defined as “daily smoker” or “have occasional 
smoking days (Akhtar, Haw, Currie, Zachary, & Currie, 2009).” Exercise 
habits were defined as exercise periods“once 30 min or more” performed 
at least twice a week and continued for at least 1 year (N. Nishi, Yosh­
izawa, & Okuda, 2017). 
2.6.1. Primary outcome measure 
2.6.1.1. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The 
primary outcome denotes the change from baseline in the CES-D score 
after the intervention. CES-D is a 20-item self-reported questionnaire, 
where each item is scored from 0 to 3 points (Radloff, 1977; Shima et al., 
1985). The total scores on the CES-D ranged from 0 to 60, with high 
scores indicating high levels of depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977; 
Shima et al., 1985). The reliability and validity of CES-D have been re­
ported elsewhere (Ohno et al., 2017; Radloff, 1977; Sakurai, Nishi, 
Kondo, Yanagida, & Kawakami, 2011; Shima, Kitagawa, Kitamura, 
Fujinawa, & Watanabe, 1994; Shima et al., 1985; Thombs, Hudson, 
Schieir, Taillefer, & Baron, 2008). The CES-D score had a high internal 
consistency (Cronbach α = 0.81–0.88) (Ohno et al., 2017; Sakurai et al., 
2011; Thombs et al., 2008). 
2.6.2. Secondary outcome measures 
2.6.2.1. Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K-6). K-6 is a 
6-item self-reported questionnaire used to measure psychological 
distress (Furukawa et al., 2008; Kessler et al., 2002). Each item is scored 
from 0 to 4 points. The total score ranges from 0 to 24 points, and the 
higher the score, the stronger the psychological distress. The reliability 
and validity of K-6 have been verified elsewhere (Furukawa et al., 2008; 
Hajebi et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2002; A. Nishi, Noguchi, Hashimoto, & 
Tamiya, 2012; Sakurai et al., 2011). The K-6 score had a high internal 
consistency (Cronbach α = 0.85–0.90) (Nishi et al., 2012; Sakurai et al., 
2011). 
2.6.2.2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 is a 7-item self- 
reported questionnaire used to measure generalized anxiety disorder, 
with each item scoring 0–3 points (Muramatsu, 2010; Spitzer, Kroenke, 
Williams, & Lowe, 2006). The total score ranges from 0 to 21 points, 
which indicate that the higher the score, the stronger the anxiety 
symptoms. The reliability and validity of GAD-7 have been verified 
elsewhere (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, Monahan, & Lowe, 2007; Lowe 
et al., 2008; Muramatsu, 2010; Sawaya, Atoui, Hamadeh, Zeinoun, & 
Nahas, 2016; Sousa et al., 2015; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 
2006). The GAD-7 score had a high degree of internal consistency 
(Cronbach α = 0.90–0.92) (Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 2016; Spitzer, 
Kroenke, Williams, & L¨owe, 2006). 
2.7. Blinding 
Independent evaluators who were unaware of group assignments, 
research objectives, and the trial design performed the primary and 
secondary outcome assessments. For evaluation, online questionnaire 
was adopted to reduce the burden of visits by participants. The partic­
ipants and therapists could not be blinded to the study protocol due to 
the nature of the intervention. However, the study reduced bias that may 
occur between the interveners and participants by providing conceal­
ment of the research hypotheses, standardized intervention guidance, 
and standardized text message feedback. 
2.8. Interventions 
The experimental group received intervention with the SPSRS 
application. The wait list control group was non-interventional and did 
not receive the SPSRS application intervention during the intervention 
period (up to 5 weeks from the start of the intervention). 
2.8.1. Experimental group 
The Subliminal Priming with Supraliminal Reward Stimulation 
(SPSRS) is an iPhone (iOS 9.1 or greater) application designed on the 
basis of verbal stimulation from research-based evidence and positive 
language as reported by previous qualitative studies on people with StD 
(Aarts, Custers, & Marien, 2008; Aoyama et al., 2017; Takahashi, 
Takada, Inoue, et al., 2019; Takarada & Nozaki, 2014). The SPSRS 
application is designed to improve depressive symptoms in people with 
StD by presenting positive word stimuli through videos. Furthermore, 
the SPSRS application is programmed to display videos that feature 
general confidence-boosting words, such as “able,” “let us try,” “good 
luck,” “can,” and “do not worry” (Takahashi, Takada, Inoue, et al., 
2019). Each word is randomly displayed in the four corners of the screen 
for 17 ms (Aoyama et al., 2017). Afterward, positive words, such as 
“great,” “fantastic,” “nice,” “satisfactory,” and “enjoyable,” are dis­
played in the center of the screen (150 ms each) (Takarada & Nozaki, 
2014). Positive words to increase confidence are automatically dis­
played on top of the video when the participant selects the video they 
like. The SPSRS application is free. Its main feature is the use of the 
YouTube Application Programming Interface, which enables the 
viewing of videos uploaded to YouTube. Given the wide variety of 
videos uploaded to YouTube from various sources (Madathil et al., 
2015), the SPSRS application, which automatically presents positive 
word stimulation through YouTube videos, allows users to select videos. 
Therefore, working toward reducing depressive symptoms according to 
user preferences becomes possible. The SPSRS application consists of 
approximately 10 min of video viewing per day (at least 70 min per 
K. Kageyama et al.

week) for 5 weeks (at least 350 minutes). The participants freely selected 
the videos to be viewed. However, because the SPSRS application is 
filtered, participants are unable to watch inappropriate videos (sad 
videos, violent videos, etc.) published on YouTube. The research team 
developed and provided a manual that demonstrates the installation and 
use of the SPSRS application as an educational resource. Three occu­
pational therapy students on the research team disseminated the manual 
among the participants prior to the start of the intervention. Currently, 
SPSRS applications do not include push notifications. 
Instead, once a day, a text message was sent to encourage the use of 
the SPSRS application to maintain better adherence to video viewing 
with the SPSRS application. The history function in the SPSRS applica­
tion was used to monitor the usage status of each participant’s SPSRS 
application. SPSRS application usage history is stored locally in the 
device. The recorded history comprises the viewing date and time, and 
personal data such as participant-identifiable information (name, 
address, etc.) and the name of the video viewed are not recorded. Each 
participant was instructed to send a usage record of the SPSRS appli­
cation to the research team once a week. Furthermore, the data 
exchanged via the Internet is encrypted by a Secure Sockets Layer to 
ensure security. The collected data are stored on a USB memory stick 
with a password and can only be accessed by the research team. The 
appropriate text message from the message pool was sent to the par­
ticipants dependent on the viewing time of each participant. In other 
words, if the participants achieved the required amount of video viewing 
time per week (i.e., 70 min or more), they were sent a text message 
encouraging them to continue watching the video. However, if the 
required video viewing time was not reached, a sent a text message is 
sent stating that the required video viewing time for the week was not 
achieved. In addition, a text message was sent urging the supplemen­
tation of the shortage of viewing time in the following week. Occupa­
tional therapy students on the research team sent the templated text 
messages to participants through social network services. 
2.8.2. Wait list control group 
The wait list control group was non-interventional and did not 
receive the SPSRS application intervention during the intervention 
period up to 5 weeks from the start of the intervention. However, the 
researchers explained prior to the intervention that receiving the 
intervention through the SPSRS application after the 5-week outcome 
measurement. 
2.9. Statistical analysis 
The linear mixed model (LMM) with a restricted maximum likeli­
hood estimation method was used to estimate the mean values of the 
pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes and compare the change 
from baseline to 5 weeks post-treatment across the two groups (Gueor­
guieva & Krystal, 2004). LMM is suitable for intention to treat-based 
analysis because it can address defects that occur in clinical trials and 
can use data from all assigned participants (Gueorguieva & Krystal, 
2004). Group assignment, assessment time points, and interaction be­
tween group assignment and assessment time points were considered 
fixed-effects factors, whereas the participants were considered 
random-effect factors. The model used a fixed-effect type-III test. In the 
LMM, the main group effect denotes average score differences between 
groups at the pre-treatment assessment. The time effect denotes the 
average score change from pre-treatment to post-treatment across both 
groups. The group × time effect denotes the difference scores between 
groups from pre-treatment to post-treatment(Gueorguieva & Krystal, 
2004). Two-sided significance tests were performed in the analyses. P 
value < 0.05 was considered significant for the primary and secondary 
outcomes. SPSS v.26.0 (IBM Japan., Tokyo, Japan) was used for ana­
lyses. Effect size (ES) used Hedge’s g (Hedges, 1981; Hedges & Olkin, 
1985). The study calculated pre- and post-ES between the two groups. In 
addition, the adjusted ES was calculated by subtracting the pre-ES from 
the post-ES (Durlak, 2009). Values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 between groups 
were considered small, medium, and large differences, respectively 
(Cohen, 1988). 
3. Results 
3.1. Enrollment and baseline characteristics 
Fig. 1 depicts the flow of the trial. Between October 2019 and 
January 2020, a total of 180 participants were evaluated for eligibility. 
Out of them, 32 (18 to 24 years old) met the study eligibility criteria and 
were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 16) or wait list control 
(n = 16) group after baseline evaluation. The participants completed the 
assigned intervention and were evaluated after 5 weeks. As a result, 
none of the participants discontinued the study due to adverse events 
after the start of the intervention. Table 1 shows the demographic 
characteristics of the participants at baseline. The mean age (SD) was 
20.00 (0.82) for the experimental group and 20.13 (1.59) for the wait 
list control group. Females comprised 31.25% of the experimental group 
and 37.5% of the wait list control group. 
3.2. Effect of SPSRS application intervention on the outcomes 
Table 2 shows the estimated effect of the SPSRS application on the 
cited outcomes based on LMM analysis of the experimental and wait list 
control groups. Furthermore, Table 3 displays the mean and SD of the 
baseline and 5-week outcome measures, as well as the ES (Hedge’s g) 
values between the two groups. The effect of time on the primary 
outcome (CES-D score) was significant (P < 0.001), whereas the group 
(P = 0.92) and group  ×
time interactions (P = 0.16) were non- 
significant. The adjusted ES between the two groups was −0.64. The 
effect of time on the secondary outcome (K-6 score) was significant (P =
0.01), whereas the group (P = 0.82) and group  × time interactions (P =
0.37) were non-significant. The adjusted ES between the two groups was 
−0.29. The time (P = 0.12), group (P = 0.28), and group  × time in­
teractions (P = 0.25) for the GAD-7 scores were non-significant. The 
adjusted effect size between the two groups was −0.40. 
3.3. Adherence 
The mean and SD of video viewing time during the 5-week inter­
vention was 356.59 ± 351.55 min. Adherence rate was calculated by 
dividing the number of participants who achieved the required viewing 
time for the duration of the intervention by the number of participants in 
the experimental group. Of the 16 participants, five complied with the 
SPSRS application intervention. Thus, an adherence rate of 31% was 
achieved. 
3.4. Post-hoc power analyses 
Data from the trial were used to calculate the sample size required to 
achieve two-sided α = 0.05, 80% power. The difference in mean change 
of the CES-D scores between the experimental and wait list control 
groups was 2.87 points. The average SD value of the two groups was 
5.43 points. Therefore, a sample size of 58 individuals per group (a total 
of 116) was estimated. 
4. Discussion 
The pilot RCT aims to verify the preliminary effectiveness of the 
SPSRS application intervention in improving the depressive symptoms 
of people with StD. The findings suggest that the SPSRS application 
intervention was effective. At the end of the 5-week intervention, the 
CES-D score of the experimental group improved by 5.56 points, 
whereas the CES-D score in the wait list control group improved by only 
2.69 points. The difference in the mean change of the CES-D scores

between the experimental and wait list control groups was non- 
significant, whereas medium ES (−0.64) was observed. This result ex­
ceeds the ES value (0.28–0.35) reported in various meta-analyses on 
psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal 
counseling) for people with StD (Cuijpers et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016). 
Furthermore, the finding suggests that the SPSRS application interven­
tion may be more effective than other interventions. Given that the 
SPSRS application is easy to use and free, it may be an alternative 
strategy for improving depressive symptoms among people with StD. 
Several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of smartphone ap­
plications against depressive disorders (Miralles et al., 2020). However, 
despite the suggestion that StD-specific interventions are required to 
alleviate the depressive symptoms of StD (Takagaki et al., 2014), no 
RCTs have investigated the effectiveness of smartphone applications 
exclusively for people with StD (Miralles et al., 2020). The SPSRS 
application is the first smartphone app that has proven to be effective in 
RCTs by targeting only those suffering from StD. As such, the SPSRS 
application may be a promising approach for improving depressive 
symptoms in people with StD compared with the existing applications 
for depressive disorders. 
The difference in mean changes in K-6 and GAD-7 scores between the 
experimental group and the wait list control group was not significant. 
However, a small ES was observed between the two groups with a K-6 
score (−0.29) and GAD-7 score (−0.40). This result is comparable with 
the ES values for anxiety symptoms and psychological distress reported 
in RCTs of CBT conducted with people with StD (Imamura et al., 2014; 
Mullin et al., 2015; Proudfoot et al., 2013). Therefore, SPSRS applica­
tions may be able to alleviate anxiety symptoms and psychological

distress in people with StD to the same extent as CBT. In addition, the 
data support the need for intervention of various mental states (i.e., 
anxiety and psychological distress) present in StD prior to the onset of 
MDD. The likelihood that the SPSRS application is associated with the 
reduction of anxiety and psychological distress in people with StD may 
provide hope for the prevention potential of the SPSRS application 
intervention. Specifically, the categorical predictors of MDD onset in StD 
are anxiety symptoms in addition to depressive symptoms, as indicated 
by findings from previous study (Bot, Pouwer, Ormel, Slaets, & de 
Jonge, 2010). These findings highlight the clinical importance of anxiety 
symptoms and psychological distress in StD, and emphasize the poten­
tial of early intervention in modifying the course of the disease and 
preventing the development of MDD. Addressing anxiety symptoms and 
psychological distress may be another promising method for improving 
StD or preventing MDD. However, the results should be interpreted with 
caution due to the inherent inaccuracy of small data samples. 
In the future, large-scale clinical efficacy trials based on the calcu­
lated sample size (58 people per group or 116 people in total) are 
required to determine the effect of the SPSRS application intervention 
on depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in people with StD. 
Therefore, further consideration of the measures for recruiting a large 
number of calculated participants will be an important step for the 
success of a full-scale RCT. By selecting collaborative research designs 
with other institutions, using opt-out technology, and providing in­
centives, the recruitment rate could be improved(Briel, Speich, von Elm, 
& Gloy, 2019; Brueton et al., 2013; Junghans, Feder, Hemingway, 
Timmis, & Jones, 2005). In addition, making the SPSRS application 
available on other smartphones (such as Android) in addition to the 
iPhone (iOS 9.1 or greater) may improve the recruitment rate. 
The majority of the participants assigned to the experimental group 
did not achieve the 5-week video viewing time set, and adherence rate 
was low. Low treatment adherence can affect the effectiveness of SPSRS 
applications. Therefore, future research should improve the low adher­
ence rate of the SPSRS application intervention. Based on the experience 
of a previous feasibility study that demonstrated a low adherence rate 
(50%) for the SPSRS application (Takahashi, Takada, & Hirao, 2019), 
this subsequent study sent a text message once a day to the experimental 
group with the objective of increasing the adherence rate of the SPSRS 
application. However, the adherence rate was 31%. Thus, the effort to 
increase the adherence rate of the SPSRS application was ineffective. 
This result contradicts the findings of studies that reported the benefits 
of text messages on treatment adherence (Finitsis, Pellowski, & Johnson, 
2014; Lester et al., 2010; Pop-Eleches et al., 2011; Wald, Bestwick, 
Raiman, Brendell, & Wald, 2014). This discrepancy may be explained by 
the frequency of text messages sent between studies. For example, one 
study found that interventions that messaged participants more than 
once a day, due to reasons, such as habituation and response fatigue, 
resulted in lower adherence rates than interventions that messaged 
participants several times a week (Finitsis et al., 2014). Therefore, future 
research should consider the optimal frequency of text messages, which 
is an important aspect that should be evaluated before conducting a 
full-scale study. In addition, considering the use of reminders (push 
notifications and phone calls to use the app) other than text messages 
may further optimize adherence. In previous systematic reviews, almost 
all apps used some kind of reminder feature to drive adherence rates 
(Ahmed et al., 2018). Of these, push notifications were used most often 
(Ahmed et al., 2018). Push notifications notify you even if the app is not 
running on your smartphone (Van Dantzig, Geleijnse, & Van Halteren, 
2013). As such, push notifications may encourage user treatment 
adherence more efficiently than text messages. It has also been sug­
gested that once or twice weekly telephone reminders may also improve 
adherence rates and reduce participant dropout(Kim & Oh, 2003). 
Therefore, encouraging the use of SPSRS applications over the phone 
may also increase adherence rates. In addition, several techniques for 
behavioral change applied to increase adherence rates in mobile health 
applications include individual goal setting, self-monitoring of behav­
iors, and rewards for adherence, which are used in combination (Mor­
rissey, Corbett, Walsh, & Molloy, 2016). Therefore, future research 
should consider using these techniques for behavioral change and 
consider additional support to encourage high rates of adherence to the 
SPSRS application. 
5. Limitations 
Several limitations should be considered based on the study results. 
First, the study was small-scale, and the sample size was small. The 
observed intervention effects should be considered preliminary because 
data from small samples contain inherent inaccuracies. Future trials 
should replicate the effectiveness of the SPSRS application intervention 
for people with StD based on the calculated sample size. Second, the 
participants were 18 to 24 years old and age-skewed. The generaliz­
ability of the current findings is limited across age groups because the 
current sample is not representative of a diverse population. Third, 
therapist–participant bias may exist due to the nature of the intervention 
because therapists and participants could not be blinded. However, the 
study’s hypotheses were masked to reduce potential bias due to the lack 
of blinding. Furthermore, efforts were made to maintain data quality by 
providing standardized intervention guidance and uniform text feed­
back. Fourth, follow-up evaluation is lacking. Therefore, whether the 
effects of the treatment will persist after the 5-week intervention re­
mains unclear. However, the improvement in depressive symptoms 
observed in people with StD warrants further testing, including a follow- 
up evaluation, to investigate the sustained effects of the intervention. 
Finally, participants had to own an iPhone to use the SPSRS application.

As a result, potential participants with other smartphones (such as the 
Android) were not invited to the pilot study. This limits the number of 
participants and could bias the demographic profile of participants. 
Future research will require the SPSRS application to be compatible with 
other smartphones (such as Android). 
6. Conclusions 
The results of the pilot RCT suggested that the SPSRS application has 
a medium ES against improvement in depressive symptoms in people 
with StD. Therefore, conducting further trials using the SPSRS applica­
tion for people with StD is worthwhile. However, strategies for 
improving the methods of recruiting more participants and increasing 
the adherence rate of the SPSRS application need to be considered 
before conducting a full-scale trial in the future. By addressing these 
issues, recruiting according to the calculated sample size of the study, 
and conducting full-scale trials with follow-up evaluations, determining 
whether the SPSRS application improves depressive symptoms and 
prevents the future development of MDD in people with StD is possible.
