Background: Patients with unipolar depressive disorder are frequently hospitalized, and the period following 
discharge is a high-risk-period. Smartphone-based treatments are receiving increasing attention among re­
searchers, clinicians, and patients. We aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-based monitoring and 
treatment system reduces the rate and duration of readmissions, more than standard treatment, in patients with 
unipolar depressive disorder following hospitalization. 
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The intervention group 
received a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system in addition to standard treatment. The system 
allowed patients to self-monitor symptoms and access psycho-educative information and cognitive modules. The 
patients were allocated a study-nurse who, based on the monitoring data, guided and supported them. The 
control group received standard treatment. The trial lasted six months, with outcome assessments at 0, 3, and 6 
months. 
Results: We included 120 patients with unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). Intention-to-treat analyses showed 
no statistically significant differences in time to readmission (Log-Rank p=0.9) or duration of readmissions (B=- 
16.41,95%CI:-47.32;25.5,p=0.3) (Primary outcomes). There were no differences in clinically rated depressive 
symptoms (p=0.6) or functioning (p=0.1) (secondary outcomes). The intervention group had higher levels of 
recovery (B=7,29, 95%CI:0.82;13,75,p=0.028) and a tendency towards higher quality of life (p=0.07), well­
being (p=0,09) satisfaction with treatment (p=0.05) and behavioral activation (p=0.08) compared with the 
control group (tertiary outcomes). 
Limitations: Patients and study-nurses were unblinded to allocation. 
Conclusions: We found no effect of the intervention on primary or secondary outcomes. In tertiary outcomes, 
patients in the intervention group reported higher levels of recovery compared to the control group.

1. Introduction 
Unipolar depressive disorder is a common mental illness with a 
lifetime prevalence of 15-20% (Kessler et al., 2003). Unipolar depressive 
disorder is the leading cause for all Years Lived With Disabilities (YLDs) 
among mental illnesses (Rehm and Shield, 2019) and burden society 
with high health care costs (Olesen et al., 2012). Patients with unipolar 
depressive disorder are often hospitalized, with high costs to patients 
and society (Ekman et al., 2013; Health, 2018). The period following 
discharge is a high-risk period with an increased risk of suicide and 
readmission (Hansen et al., 2012; Kessing et al., 2004; Mortensen et al., 
2000). In the case of relapse of symptoms following discharge, real-time 
reporting of symptoms might not be available to the clinicians in stan­
dard clinical settings. Approaches allocating the right treatment to the 
right patient at the right time are warranted to prevent relapse and 
readmissions and allocate the limited treatment resources appropriately. 
New technologies and treatment modalities seek to address this treat­
ment gap (WHO, 2011). 
Today, a median of 76% of adults in 18 advanced economies report 
having a smartphone (Taylor, 2019), and many people use a smartphone 
on a daily basis (Ericsson, 2018). Smartphones comprise a unique 
platform for real-time monitoring and treatment. Smartphone-based 
treatment tools in psychiatry are receiving increasing attention among 
researchers, clinicians, and patients (Miralles et al., 2020). The ambi­
tions of delivering high-quality, effective, and timely interventions to 
more patients at a lower cost are driving forces. Nonetheless, despite the 
hype, current clinical evidence is sparse (Hidalgo-Mazzei et al., 2020; 
Tønning et al., 2019), and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 
smartphone-based treatments in psychiatry are essential to provide this 
evidence. However, existing RCTs lack methodological rigor and robust 
objective outcome measures (Tønning et al., 2019). 
Our group has previously conducted the MONARCA I and II trials, 
showing that smartphone-based monitoring and treatment was useful, 
feasible, and valid for monitoring symptoms in patients with bipolar 
disorder. The MONARCA I and II trials found no effect of smartphone- 
based monitoring and treatment on depressive and manic symptoms, 
but a higher quality of life and reduced perceived stress in patients 
receiving smartphone-based monitoring and treatment (Faurholt-Jep­
sen et al., 2019; Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2015). 
Previous reviews have identified several RCTs on the effects of 
smartphone-based treatments on depressive symptoms (Firth et al., 
2017; Linardon et al., 2019). However, many of the included trials 
measured depressive symptoms in other diagnoses, conditions, and 
non-clinical samples (e.g., self-reported depression, anxiety, sleep dis­
orders, and the general population). A recent review by the authors 
(Tønning et al., 2019) identified only seven RCTs investigating the effect 
of smartphone-based treatment in patients with a validated diagnosis of 
a depressive disorder (Hur et al., 2018; Ly et al., 2015; Ly et al., 2014; 
Mantani et al., 2017; Roepke et al., 2015; Stiles-Shields et al., 2019; 
Watts et al., 2013). Moreover, only one of these RCTs (Mantani et al., 
2017) was conducted in a clinical setting, and the remaining RCTs 
recruited patients online and validated the diagnosis using question­
naires as well as telephone interviews (Hur et al., 2018; Ly et al., 2015; 
Ly et al., 2014; Roepke et al., 2015; Stiles-Shields et al., 2019; Watts 
et al., 2013). Previous non-RCT studies have shown that self-monitoring 
is feasible in patients with unipolar depressive disorder following 
discharge from the hospital (Lauritsen et al., 2017). 
Thus, limited RCT-research concerning the use of smartphone-based 
monitoring and treatment in patients diagnosed with unipolar depres­
sive disorder has been published in general, even less in clinical settings 
and none concerning patients following discharged from psychiatric 
hospitalization. 
Therefore, we conducted the Reducing the rate and duration of 
readmission among patients with unipolar depressive disorder trial (the 
RADMIS trial) and hypothesized that add-on of a smartphone-based 
monitoring and treatment system to standard care would reduce the 
rate and duration of readmissions compared to the standard treatment in 
patients diagnosed with unipolar depressive disorder following 
discharge from psychiatric hospitalization for a depressive episode. 
We expected that by using the smartphone-based system, it would be 
possible to catch relapses in an earlier stage, intervene adequately, and 
hereby, prevent readmissions. Furthermore, we expected that if read­
mission were necessary, a more timely readmission would lead to a 
shorter duration of readmissions. 
2. Methods 
The present trial is reported according to the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (Moher et al., 2012), with 
additions from the consort E-health guidelines (Eysenbach, 2011). 
Further details concerning design and methods have previously been 
published (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2017). 
2.1. Design, settings, and patients 
The RADMIS trial was a pragmatic, parallel-group, rater-blinded 
randomized controlled trial with a balanced randomization ratio (1:1) of 
adult patients with unipolar depressive disorder with a 6-months follow- 
up period. Patients with a diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder were 
recruited from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region in Denmark, 
corresponding to 1.6 million people during the period from May 2017 to 
August 2019. 
Inclusion criteria: Age over 18 years; unipolar depressive disorder 
diagnosis according to the International Classification of Diseases, 
version 10 (ICD-10) using Schedules for Clinical Assessments in 
Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) (Wing et al., 1990); discharge from a psychi­
atric hospital following hospitalization for a depressive episode. 
Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy; insufficient Danish language skills; 
any kind of compulsory hospitalization or treatment at the time of 
inclusion. 
We had no upper age limit or exclusion of patients with comorbid­
ities, including alcohol/drug abuse, as long as they had a primary 
diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder. Patients were included in the 
trial as close to the day of discharge as possible, with a 14 days margin in 
both ends. 
2.2. Randomization and allocation 
The included patients were randomized with a balanced ratio of 1:1 
to either 1) the intervention group with active use of the smartphone- 
based monitoring and treatment system + standard treatment or 2) 
the control group (standard treatment alone). Numbered, sealed, and 
opaque envelopes were provided by the Pharma Consulting Group 
(http://www.pharmaconsultinggroup.com), who generated random 
allocation numbers with random block sizes (6-10). Randomization was 
stratified according to the psychiatric center from which the patients 
were discharged (five centers) and the number of previous psychiatric 
admissions (0-3 or >3). The envelopes were stored in a locked cabinet of 
an unknown location to the blinded researchers. 
2.3. Blinding 
The RADMIS trial was a single-blinded trial. Due to the nature of the 
intervention, it was not possible to blind patients nor the study nurses. 
Researchers responsible for outcome assessments, data entry, data an­
alyses, interpretation of analyses, and writing of papers (MLT and MFJ) 
were kept blinded to allocation. In the case of unblinding, the patients 
were seen by another researcher.

2.4. Intervention 
2.4.1. Intervention group 
Following discharge, patients allocated to the intervention group 
received multimodal monitoring and treatment based on a smartphone- 
based system (the Monsenso system). The smartphone-based system 
builds upon the MONARCA system previously developed and used by 
our research group (Bardram et al., 2013; Bardram et al., 2012; Faur­
holt-Jepsen et al., 2019; Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2015). Based on a 
user-centered design process, the system was improved and adapted to 
fit patients with unipolar depressive disorder. The Monsenso system 
consists of several modules with various functions: 
2.4.2. Symptom monitoring and clinical feedback loop 
The smartphone-based system collected data through daily patient- 
reported entries (subjective data: e.g., mood, sleep, and activity) and 
automatically collected smartphone sensor data (objective data: e.g., 
phone usage, mobility measures, and voice features). Information was 
presented to the patient for self-monitoring on their smartphone screen 
and the study nurse on a desktop-computer (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 
2014). 
The study nurses checked the data three times a week and reacted 
according to the data presented, providing a double feedback loop be­
tween the study nurse and the patient (Fig. 1). Daily notifications 
reminded patients to fill out self-rating questions. In the case of several 
missing days, patients were contacted by the study nurse. 
2.4.3. Smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
The smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) modules 
included psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and rumination- 
focused CBT. The psychoeducation was delivered as both text and 
small cartoons and include strategies for detecting and intervening with 
early signs of relapse. 
Patients were encouraged, as a minimum, to fill in the daily self- 
rating, which would take 2-5 minutes. Based on the patients’ needs, 
skills, and clinical status, the remaining functions in the app would be 
used based on an individual assessment by the patient and the study 
nurse on how to best help the patient. Further details concerning the 
smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system and technical as­
pects are described in the study protocol (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2017). 
2.4.4. Changes in the intervention during the trial 
During the trial period, there were no long-lasting breakdowns. 
However, several times one or more functions were unavailable for a 
period of maximum 1-2 days. The psychoeducation module and the 
cognitive restructuring and rumination-focused CBT were shortly 
delayed and added to the app at the beginning of the trial period. 
2.4.5. Control group and standard treatment 
The patients who were randomized to the control group received 
standard treatment. The control group had the smartphone app installed 
on their smartphone to collect objective data, but with no access to the 
content of the smartphone-based system. 
All patients received standard treatment, decided by their treating 
physician with no restrictions, regardless of their allocation. Outpatient 
treatment in Denmark is given either by the patients’ family doctor 
(general practitioner), by a private psychiatrist, in an outpatient clinic 
with monthly consultations, or in an intensive, multidisciplinary 
outpatient clinic with psychiatrists, psychologists, and nurses. The 
treatment options consist of psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, 
various nurse-guided support, psychoeducation, and physical activity. 
Treatment is public and in large free of charge. Patients can be read­
mitted through psychiatric emergency rooms, or by referral/recom­
mendation of treatment-system and various 24/7 phone helplines. 
2.5. Outcomes and assessments 
Outcome measures were defined a priori (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 
2017). Outcome assessments and baseline interviews were conducted by 
research-trained, non-specialist, medical doctors (MLT, MFJ, SAM, DTP) 
who were blinded to allocation status. Outcome assessments were done 
at 0, 3, and 6 months. Assessors and researchers had access to patients’ 
electronic medical records. If a patient was admitted at the time for a 
follow-up assessment, the researchers visited the ward. If follow-up was 
not possible face to face in any way, it was done via telephone. Sec­
ondary and tertiary outcome measures were regarded as valid within 
+/- 14 days for the scheduled date for outcome assessment. 
Primary outcomes: The rate and accumulated duration of psychiatric 
readmissions. Readmissions were assessed at follow-up visits and by 
checking the electronic medical records. Secondary outcomes: Severity 
of depressive symptoms measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating 
Scale 17-items (HDRS-17) (Hamilton, 1960); Psychosocial functioning 
according to the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST) (Rosa et al., 
2007); Number of depressive episodes defined as HDRS-17> 13. Ter­
tiary outcomes: Paper-based questionnaires on Perceived stress ac­
cording to Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen et al., 1983); 
Quality of life according to the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHO­
QOL-BREF) (1998); Self-rated depressive symptoms according to Beck’s 
Depressive Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961); Self-rated depressive 
symptoms according to the Hamilton Depression Self-rating Scale 6-item 
(HAM-D6) (Bech et al., 1981; Bech et al., 1975); Recovery according to 
the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) (Corrigan et al., 2004) Empow­
erment according to Roger’s Empowerment Scale (Rogers et al., 1997); 
Adherence to medication according to the Medicine Adherence Rating 
Scale (MARS) (Fialko et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2000); Wellbeing 
according to the WHO (five) (WHO5) Wellbeing Index (Bech et al., 
2003); Rumination according to the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS)

(Treynor et al., 2003); Worrying according to the Penn State Worry 
Questionnaire (PSWQ) (Meyer et al., 1990); Satisfaction with care ac­
cording to the Verona Satisfaction Scale-Affective Disorder (VSS-A) 
(Kessing et al., 2006); Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale 
(BADS) (Kanter et al., 2006). 
2.6. Statistical analyses 
The statistical analyses were defined ´a priori (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 
2017) and conducted using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. The 
sample size calculations on primary and secondary outcomes are 
described in detail elsewhere (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2017). The ITT 
analysis includes all randomized participants regardless of the adher­
ence to treatment. Differences in the primary outcome (readmission) 
were investigated using survival analysis with reasons for censoring 
being death, leaving the country, or end-of-study, and event being the 
first day of the first readmission. Time was calculated from the day of the 
discharge. Proportional hazards were assessed by goodness of fit models 
and graphical presentation. 
Differences in the duration of readmissions were investigated, for 
patients who were readmitted, in a general linear model regression 
analysis using parametric statistics. First, in an unadjusted model with 
allocation status (intervention or control) as the independent variable 
and the total number of days admitted during the trial as the dependent 
variable. Further, in a model adjusted for the stratification variables, 
age, and sex. 
Differences in secondary and tertiary outcomes were calculated 
using two-level linear mixed effect models, including a fixed effect of 
visit number and a patient-specific random effect (Table 2). Level 1 
represented intra-individual variation in repeated outcome measures of 
symptoms (e.g., HDRS-17), and level 2 represented repeated inter- 
individual variation. Differences in outcomes between the intervention 
group and the control group were analyzed in: Model 1, adjusting for 
differences in baseline values of the outcome variable and the two 
stratification variables (1) psychiatric center and (2) the number of prior 
hospitalizations (0-3 or >3); in Model 2, adjusting further for age and 
sex, and in Model 3 further adjusting for scores on the HDRS-17 (except 
for measures of depression). Potential interactions between randomi­
zation group and visit number on any specific outcome variable were 
investigated and reported if significant. Linear mixed model analysis 
implicitly imputes missing data from dropouts under the assumption 
that these are missing at random. As such, handling missing data is 
embedded in the procedure. 
For subanalyses, we calculated the six core depression items (HDRS- 
6) of the HDRS-17. Further, we used cox regression analysis to calculate 
the hazard ratio of developing a depressive episode (HDRS-17 > 13) 
during the trial for patients in remission (HDRS-17 <13) at baseline, 
using follow-up visits as time. 
Model assumptions with analyses of residuals and covariance were 
calculated and assessed for all outcomes. Missing items in the ques­
tionnaires were not included in the summed scores, and no imputations 
or assumptions on missing items were made. Single questionnaires with 
more than 20 % missing items were discarded. 
The statistical threshold for significance was p≤0.05 (two-tailed). 
Analyses were done using IBM SPSS statistics version 25. 
3. Ethical considerations 
Ethical permission was obtained from the ethics committee in The 
Capital Region of Denmark (H-16046093) and The Data Agency (RHP- 
2017-005, I-Suite: 05365). The law on handling personal data, as well as 
the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was respec­
ted. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03033420. All 
researcher collected data was stored in Research Electronic Data Cap­
ture (REDCap) electronic data capture tools (Harris et al., 2019; Harris 
et al., 2009). Electronic data from the Monsenso app was stored by 
Monsenso with a data-storage-agreement between Monsenso and The 
Capital Region of Copenhagen. All patients were given written and oral 
information and gave informed consent, according to the Helsinki 
declaration. Any desire to leave the trial was accepted. Patients were 
encouraged to continue their participation, however, not compromising 
their safety or wellbeing. In case of significant concerns regarding the 
patients’ condition (i.e., high suicidality), relevant precautions were 
taken to secure the safety of the patients. Study-nurse and researchers 
consulted professor LVK for supervision when needed. 
Patients could use their own smartphones. Alternatively, they were 
offered to loan an Android-based smartphone free of charge during the 
trial period and instructed to use it as their primary phone. Any travel 
expenses concerning the trial were refunded. The patients received no 
additional payment or gifts. 
4. Results 
4.1. Background characteristics 
Fig. 2 presents the flow of patients in the RADMIS trial. During the 
trial period, a total of 609 patients with unipolar depressive disorder 
from psychiatric hospitalization were assessed for eligibility. Of these, a 
total of 158 were excluded for various reasons (e.g., change in diagnosis 
(n=48), not deemed capable of participating in research by ward staff or 
study nurse (n=55)). A total of 81 patients were discharged before it was 
possible to invite for participation, and 188 patients did not wish to 
participate (not wanting to or able to use a smartphone, did not want to 
monitor, or did not want further contacts). Finally, a total of 62 patients 
were interested in participation and followed until discharge; however, 
upon inclusion, they could not oversee participation/did not show up or 
did not return calls and were not included, randomized, or assed further. 
Thus, a total of 120 patients were included and randomized to either the 
intervention group or the control group. The last patient’s last visit for 
outcome assessment was in March 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics at baseline are presented in Table 1. All patients had 
been diagnosed with moderate-severe depression during the hospitali­
zation leading to the inclusion, with a high amount of comorbidity (22% 
of patients in the active arm and 29% in control arm) and thus composed 
a group of severely ill patients. 
4.2. Assessments adherence and intervention 
The number of patients completing intervention and assessments can 
be seen in Fig. 2. Two patients were included without sufficient consent 
to assess medical records. They did not show up for follow-up visits and 
provided no further data than baseline. In three cases, patients were 
rated by an unblinded assessor. Seven patients in the intervention group 
withdraw from the trial, with the intervention as the explicit reason: 
(found monitoring stressful (n=3) could not oversee it (n=3) or did not 
find it helpful (n=1)). They all dropped out between 27-89 days after 
inclusion and had an average of 25 days of self-monitoring (range: 7-50; 
SD=4.6). Additional five patients discontinued the intervention before 
the end of the trial (lost contact or change of diagnosis). They had an 
average of 41.6 days of self-monitoring (range: 20-90; SD=30,1). The 
remaining patients (n=47) had regular contact with study nurses and 
registrations throughout the trial period but with variation in use 
depending on the patients’ needs and abilities. The average number of 
days with self-monitoring for these patients was 151 (range 49-198; 
SD=34). 
During the trial period, the study nurse registered 143 text corre­
spondences, 303 telephone conversations, and 73 face to face conver­
sations with patients from the intervention group. 
Both groups received equally high levels of standard treatment: A 
total of 82.5 % of all patients were treated in hospital-based outpatient 
clinics, with 87% of these receiving frequent multidisciplinary treatment 
often on a weekly basis. The 17.5% not treated in a hospital setting were

either treated by a general practitioner (5 %), private psychiatrist

were found on this primary outcome (log Rank test p=0.9). The survival 
probability of not being readmitted within the six months following 
discharge was 0.77 (95%CI:0.67;0.89) in the intervention group and 
0.77 (95%CI: 0.67; 0.88) in the control group. Hazard Ratio for read­
mission in the intervention group compared to the control group was 
0.95 (95%CI:0.45;2.02, p=0.9). One patient left the country after 130 
days and was censored at the corresponding date. 
4.3.2. Differences between the intervention group and the control group in 
the accumulated duration of readmissions 
In the intervention group, 13 patients were readmitted for a total of 
458 days. Eight patients were readmitted once, four patients were 
readmitted twice, and a single patient was readmitted three times. In the 
control group, 14 patients were readmitted for a total of 723 days. Nine 
patients were readmitted once, and five patients were readmitted twice. 
The average length of readmittances among those who were readmitted 
was 35.2 days (SD=32.6) in the intervention group and 51.6 days 
(SD=44.0) in the control group. However, a few patients in each group 
constituted the majority of the total days in the hospital during the trial. 
The two groups were compared in an unadjusted linear regression model 
(B= -16.41, 95%CI: -47.32; 25.5, p=0.3), and a model adjusting for the 
two stratification variables (psychiatric center and the number of pre­
vious hospitalizations), age and sex (B= –12.76, 95% CI: -44.42; 18.9, 
p=0.4). There were no statistically significant differences between the 
two groups in this primary outcome of the accumulated duration of 
readmissions. 
4.3.3. Exploratory analyses on the primary outcome 
We conducted several exploratory subanalyses in relation to the 
primary outcome, stratifying on stratification variables, age, sex, and 
comorbidity as well as analysis on admittances longer than three days 
and possible early or late effect. There were no significant results on any 
of the models, and estimates are therefore not reported. Further, we 
incorporated data on adherence to the survival analysis: We used the 
percentage of days with completed self-monitoring as an operational 
proxy for adherence to the intervention as a whole. The median value of 
80% completed days of self-monitoring was used to divide the inter­
vention group into two groups. We compared the groups using Kaplan 
Meier curves, with corresponding log Rank test. We found no statisti­
cally significant differences between the two groups (log Rank test 
p=0.93). We applied similar analyses for various levels of adherence 
with no relevant nor statistically significant findings. 
Additionally, to reduce confounding, we calculated adherence in the 
first 28 days. The intervention group was divided as above based on 
initial adherence levels. We conducted survival analysis for the subse­
quent trial period to calculate differences in risk of readmission 
following the first 28 days based on initial adherence. There were no 
relevant or statistically significant differences between various levels of 
initial adherence.

4.4. Secondary outcomes 
Differences between the intervention group and the control group on 
secondary outcomes (HDRS-17 and FAST) and tertiary outcomes 
(questionnaires) are presented in Table 2. As can be seen, in models 
adjusting for baseline values of the outcome variable and the two 
stratification variables (Model 1), further adjusting for age and sex 
(Model 2), and further adjusting for HDRS-17 scores (except for outcome 
measures of depression) (Model 3), there were no statistically significant 
differences between the intervention group and the control group in the 
secondary outcomes (HDRS-17: Model 2; B= 0.62, 95% CI: -1.81; 3.05, 
p= 0.6. FAST: Model 3; B= -2.78, 95% CI: -6.19; 0.63, p=0.1) (Table 2). 
Explorative analyses on the HDRS-17 were conducted on subgroups 
of patients based on their baseline scores on the HDRS-17. We used cut- 
offs at 7 "symptom-free"and 14 "depressive."All analyses were statisti­
cally non-significant. 
Survival analyses using Cox regression on the risk of developing a 
depressive episode (HDRS >13) during the trial period for patients 
presenting with HDRS score< 14 at baseline are also presented in 
Table 2. There was no statistically significant difference in the hazard 
rate between the two groups (Model 2: HR= 0.88, 95%CI: 0.31; 2.48, 
p=0.8). 
4.5. Tertiary outcomes 
Tertiary outcomes were calculated like secondary outcomes and are 
presented in Table 2. All tertiary outcomes were insignificant in model 1 
and model 2. In model 3, further adjusting for HDRS-17 scores, there 
were statistically significantly higher levels of recovery measured using 
the RAS in the intervention group compared with the control group 
(Model 3; B= 7.29, 95% CI: 0.82; 13.75, p=0.028). Further, in model 3 
there was borderline statistically significantly higher levels of quality of 
life measured by WHOQOL, higher levels of wellbeing measured by 
WHO5, higher satisfaction with care measured using the VSSA and 
higher levels of behavioral activation measured using the BADS in the 
intervention group compared with the control group: (WHOQOL: Model 
3; B= 4.09, 95% CI: -0.30; 8.47, p= 0.067) (WHO5: Model 3; B= 1.59, 
95% CI: -0.027; 3.44, p=0.092) (VSSA: Model 3; B= 7.80, 95% CI: 
-0.025; 15.63, p=0.051) (BADS: Model 3; B= 8.00, 95% CI: -0.88; 16.88, 
p=0.076). The remaining tertiary outcomes were insignificant. 
4.6. Post hoc statistical power analysis based on the obtained sample size 
The trial included 120 patients, which was less than the calculated 
sample size of 200 patients (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2017). Despite

intense recruiting, expansion of the recruitment area, and a double in 
recruitment time, it was not possible to obtain the desired number. 
Nevertheless, it is clear from the Kaplan-Meir curves in Fig. 3 and the 
p-value of 0.9 from the log-rank test that the sample size of 120 patients 
was sufficient to exclude a type II error in relation to time to readmission 
as one of the primary outcome measures. Similarly, the trial resulted in a 
statistical power of 97% to detect a statistically significant difference at 
a p-level of 5% between the obtained difference in cumulated days of 
readmission (35 days (SD=33) versus 52 days (SD=44.0). 
5. Discussion 
We investigated the effect of a smartphone-based monitoring and 
treatment system in patients with unipolar depressive disorder following 
discharge from hospitalization for a depressive episode. In the present 
single-blinded trial, patients with unipolar depressive disorder were 
randomized to either a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment 
system, including a clinical feedback loop as an add-on to standard 
treatment or to standard treatment alone. The intervention lasted six 
months following discharge from hospitalization for a depressive 
episode. Overall, we found no effect on time to readmission or the 
duration of readmissions. Furthermore, there was no effect on clinically 
rated depressive symptoms and clinically rated functioning. However, 
patients in the intervention group reported statistically significantly 
higher recovery compared with the control group. Furthermore, there 
was a tendency towards patients reported a higher quality of life, higher 
wellbeing, more satisfaction with treatment, and higher behavioral 
activation in the intervention group compared with the control group. 
Although not statistically significant at a 0.05 level, analyses pointed in 
the same direction of a possible improvement on these outcome mea­
sures in patients in the intervention group compared with the control 
group. 
The lack of effect on primary and secondary outcomes is in contrast 
to our hypothesis. We do not think this is a false negative finding due to 
low power (type II error) as there are only minor differences between the 
two groups. Possible explanations on the lack of effect could be 1) a large 
number of all patients (71.7%) received intensive, coordinated hospital- 
based outpatient treatment with frequent multidisciplinary contacts. 
This is a part of an intense focus in recent years in the region on reducing 
readmissions by providing quick and intense outpatient treatment; 2) 
the intervention was not integrated into the standard treatment but as an 
external research project and 3) we expected 30% readmissions in the 
control group; however, only 22% were readmitted in both groups. 
Thus, baseline risk was lower than expected, possibly due to the general 
focus on reducing readmissions. 
The pragmatic design and the setting where the trial was conducted 
may have ended up opaquing the effects of the intervention to some 
extent. The multidisciplinary mental health care of patients after an 
affective episode in Denmark is well-known to be one of the most 
comprehensive and effective in the world, according to many studies 
(Hansen et al., 2012). Hence, it might be difficult to enhance a system 
that is already enhanced and providing close, continuous, and 
high-quality care to discharged patients. The same intervention in many 
other contexts or in a non-pragmatic RCT might have yielded different 
results 
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) (McKenna, 2011) are 
central patient-experienced outcomes, and the results from the present 
trial are in line with previous findings from our group (the MONARCA II 
trial) (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2019), where we found improved quality 
of life in patients with bipolar disorder using a smartphone-based 
monitoring system like the one used in the present trial. Interestingly, 
during recent years there has been increasing international attention 
regarding the use of PROMs as a quality indicator of patient care and 
safety (Roe et al., 2019). This reflects the ongoing health service 
commitment of involving patients and the public within the broader 
context of the development and evaluation of health care service 
delivery and quality improvement. The higher improvement in recovery 
and possible higher improvement on other PROMs in the intervention 
group compared to the control group could indicate relevant improve­
ments in the patient’s life, which is not measured by readmission or 
clinical rated scores. However, they also represent unblinded, 
self-reported, tertiary outcomes and must be interpreted with caution. 
Seven patients explicitly discontinued the intervention. The inten­
sive monitoring and extra contact were deemed stressful by some pa­
tients and indicated that such treatment systems might not be to 
everyone, and such dropouts should be expected and accepted. To 
minimize side effects and dropouts in this vulnerable patient group, we 
recommend: 1) Thorough face to face information on implications of 
participating in the study with the study nurse as well as a researcher 
before inclusion 2) Scalable intervention to suit the patients’ clinical 
status 3) Experienced psychiatric nurses to guide and support the 
patient. 
The rapid evolution of smartphone technology has resulted in the 
increasing development of tools for remote self-monitoring (Lal and 
Adair, 2014; Roberts et al., 2018; WHO, 2011) with the opportunity to 
collect fine-grained data unobtrusively and outside the clinical setting 
(Ebner-Priemer and Trull, 2009) This comprise a unique platform for 
real-time monitoring and treatment. However, existing RCTs lack 
methodological rigor and robust objective outcome measures (Tønning 
et al., 2019). Thus, the present trial adds to the evidence within this area. 
Given the limited access to appropriate treatment facilities across the 
globe, smartphone-based monitoring and treatment may represent a 
flexible real-time system which could be of great support for both pa­
tients and health care providers. In this way, outpatient treatment could 
potentially be optimized and more flexible according to the patients’ 
needs. The treatment-system tested in our current trial could possibly 
work in other settings or patients-subgroups, and it cannot be excluded 
that there would have been effects on other outcome measures, which 
we did not include or prioritize in the present trial. We chose to include 
readmission and duration of readmission as our robust primary out­
comes, since patients with unipolar depressive disorder are often hos­
pitalized, and costs due to psychiatric hospitalizations are a major 
burden for patients and society (Ekman et al., 2013; Health, 2018). 
Although we only found an effect of recovery, there was a tendency 
towards a possible effect of the intervention in several PROMs. Trials, 
including PROMs as primary outcome measures, are common within 
smartphone-based treatments in psychiatry (Tønning et al., 2019). The 
effect on these outcome measures must be investigated further, and 
future trials could include a sham app in standard treatment, potentially 
longer follow-up times, or integration of smartphone-based in­
terventions in the existing standardized treatment program. 
6. Limitations 
We did not obtain the intended number of patients, despite pro­
longing the recruitment period. Patients could not oversee participating 
in further research or further treatments and contacts besides, often 
intense, standard treatment. Nevertheless, according to the post hoc 
statistical power analyses, the trial obtained sufficient power to exclude 
a type II error at a p-value of 0.05 with a sample size of 120 patients. 
There may be different effects of the different components of the 
intervention. The present RADMIS trial investigated the effect of a 
combined system, and thus it was not possible to address the potential 
effect of individual components. Due to the type of intervention is was 
not possible to blind the patients and the study nurse to allocation status. 
Although the researchers collecting outcome data were kept blinded to 
allocation status during the entire trial, the tertiary outcomes were self- 
reported by non-blinded patients. The possible improvements in the 
tertiary outcomes could be the digital placebo effect (Torous and Firth, 
2016) due to the awareness of being in the intervention group, wanting 
to please the researcher, or overestimate the positive effect of receiving a 
new intervention.

The intervention comprised of multiple elements and was not 
completely static due to minor changes in the smartphone-based system 
during the trial period, change of study nurse, and learning effect from 
the study nurses being more familiar with the system during the trial 
period. However, these minor adjustments resemble real-life settings. 
Technical issues (either in the system or at a patient-level) possibly 
affected the intervention, as is common in mHealth trials and real-life 
settings. 
6.1. Generalizability 
An RCT represents a trial design with high interval validity, with a 
possible cost of lower external validity and lower generalizability of the 
results. The present trial used a single-blinded design, with data on 
outcome measures collected by a researcher not aware of the randomi­
zation group, and therefore data was not affected by bias. Further, the 
trial had a pragmatic design with few exclusion criteria resembling 
clinical practice. All patients were thoroughly assessed with clinical 
evaluation and access to health records. We succeeded in including 120 
patients from a very severe population in a critical period of their life 
and had high follow-up rates. 
The results from the present trial reflect the use of smartphone-based 
monitoring during clinical settings with severely ill patients. Overall, the 
findings of the present trial are found to be generalizable to patients with 
a more severe unipolar depressive disorder. 
7. Conclusion 
Smartphone-based monitoring and treatment in real-time in patients 
with unipolar depressive disorder did not reduce readmissions and 
accumulated duration of readmissions or reduce clinical reported 
outcome measures in the present trial. In tertiary outcomes concerning 
patient-reported outcomes, patients in the intervention group had a 
higher level of recovery. However, findings on tertiary outcomes were 
not based on power calculation made for the present trial, and thus 
findings should be interpreted with caution. Despite the widespread 
excitement of smartphone-based monitoring, few clinical studies have 
investigated possible effects, and further studies are needed with PROMs 
or smartphone gathered data as possible outcome measures.
