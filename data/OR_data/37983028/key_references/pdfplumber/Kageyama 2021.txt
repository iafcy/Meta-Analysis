Keywords: Background: A smartphone application (i.e., SPSRS) was developed to help people with subthreshold depression

Methods: In a pilot RCT, 32 participants (female =34.4%, mean age =20.06, SD =1.24) with StD were ran-
domized to SPSRS application intervention for approximately 10 min/a day for 5 weeks (experimental group; n
=16) or no intervention (wait list control group; n =16). The primary outcome is the change from baseline in
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score after the 5-week intervention. The sec-
ondary outcomes are the change from baseline in the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K-6)
score and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) after the 5-week intervention.
Results: No participants dropped out of the study. The experimental group displayed medium, small, and small
improvements in CES-D, K-6, and GAD-7 scores (adjusted Hedge’s g =(cid:0) 0.64, (cid:0) 0.29, and (cid:0) 0.40), respectively,
compared with control.
Limitations: The observed effects must be considered preliminary due to the small sample size.
Conclusions: The results suggest the potential of intervention using the SPSRS application to reduce depressive
symptoms in people with StD. Future studies should replicate these findings in a full-scale RCT.
