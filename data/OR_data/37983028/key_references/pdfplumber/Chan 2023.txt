Despite its efficacy (Santoft et al., 2019), the accessibility of cognitive behavioral therapy for
depression (CBT-D) is often limited by high cost and cultural barriers (Corrigan, Druss, &
Perlick, 2014; Shi, Shen, Wang, & Hall, 2020). The preference for self-reliance and stigma
in some communities may hamper help-seeking behavior from mental health professionals
(e.g. Corrigan et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2020).
In addition to being a common symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD)
(McClintock et al., 2011; Tsuno, Besset, & Ritchie, 2005), sleep disturbance, in particular
insomnia, also predicts its onset, maintenance, and reoccurrence (Fang, Tu, Sheng, & Shao,
2019; Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), as well as suicidal ideations and
attempts (Harris, Huang, Linthicum, Bryen, & Ribeiro, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Because of
the high comorbidity and the bidirectionality of sleep disturbances and depression, sleep-
focused interventions are recommended to be included in the treatment of MDD (Harvey,
Murray, Chandler, & Soehner, 2011).
Sleep treatments, in particular CBT for insomnia (CBT-I), are efficacious in alleviating
non-sleep symptoms in MDD (Ballesio et al., 2018; Feng, Han, Li, Geng, & Miao, 2020;
