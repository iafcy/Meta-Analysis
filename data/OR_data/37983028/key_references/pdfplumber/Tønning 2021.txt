Intervention
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The intervention group
received a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system in addition to standard treatment. The system
allowed patients to self-monitor symptoms and access psycho-educative information and cognitive modules. The
patients were allocated a study-nurse who, based on the monitoring data, guided and supported them. The
control group received standard treatment. The trial lasted six months, with outcome assessments at 0, 3, and 6
months.
Results: We included 120 patients with unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). Intention-to-treat analyses showed
no statistically significant differences in time to readmission (Log-Rank p=0.9) or duration of readmissions (B=-
16.41,95%CI:-47.32;25.5,p=0.3) (Primary outcomes). There were no differences in clinically rated depressive
symptoms (p=0.6) or functioning (p=0.1) (secondary outcomes). The intervention group had higher levels of
recovery (B=7,29, 95%CI:0.82;13,75,p=0.028) and a tendency towards higher quality of life (p=0.07), well-
being (p=0,09) satisfaction with treatment (p=0.05) and behavioral activation (p=0.08) compared with the
control group (tertiary outcomes).
Limitations: Patients and study-nurses were unblinded to allocation.
Conclusions: We found no effect of the intervention on primary or secondary outcomes. In tertiary outcomes,
patients in the intervention group reported higher levels of recovery compared to the control group.
