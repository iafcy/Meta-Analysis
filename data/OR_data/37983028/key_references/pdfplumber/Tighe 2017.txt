ideation (n=45), but there were no differences found in
this subanalysis. Our scales were brief, motivated by the
need to make responses non-burdensome, but this may
have reduced sensitivity. Since impulsivity measures tem-
perament as opposed to symptoms of distress, our
expectation of seeing change may have been too high
for this outcome measure. This was supported by the
observation of little change in both groups over the time
period for this measure, especially in comparison to
observed changes in distress and depression.
Nevertheless, the study had strengths. One of the key
criticisms of eHealth interventions is that they target
those with mild disorders and do not capture those at
most risk. In this case, we demonstrated the feasibility
and effectiveness of an app for self-help of severe psy-
chological distress. We also demonstrated engagement
