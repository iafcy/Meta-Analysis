Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and credibility of a smartphone-delivered multicomponent lifestyle
medicine (LM) intervention, Lifestyle Hub, as a primary modality for managing depressive symptoms in an
adult Chinese population. Method: Participants with at least a moderate level of depressive symptoms (n =
79), as indicated by a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of ≥10, were randomly assigned to an LM
intervention group (LMG; n = 39; eight weekly sessions) or a waitlist control group (WLG; n = 40). Results:
The intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (d = 0.66),
generalized anxiety symptoms (d = 0.93), insomnia symptoms (d = 0.20), functional impairment (d =
0.22), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL; d = 0.11) from Week 0 (baseline) to Week 9 (immediate postintervention assessment) in the LMG relative to the WLG. Moreover, significantly more health-promoting
behaviors (overall health behaviors, health responsibility, physical activity level, nutrition, spiritual growth,
and stress management) (d = 0.40–0.89) and higher levels of total activity (d = 0.55) and walking activity (d =
0.55) were found at Week 9 in the LMG relative to the WLG. However, no significant differences were
observed in interpersonal relationships, vigorous and moderate exercise levels, sedentary behavior levels, or
food frequency questionnaire measures at Week 9 between the LMG and the WLG. From Week 9 to Week 13
(1-month follow-up assessment), a significant within-group reduction in HRQoL (d = 0.50) and an increase in
alcohol intake (d = 0.41) were observed in the LMG. Conclusions: The smartphone-delivered multicomponent LM intervention Lifestyle Hub may serve as a primary modality for managing depressive symptoms.

LIFESTYLE MEDICINE FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS 971


estimates in 2017 (Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021). In view of these
emerging mental health issues, the provision of timely and easily
accessible mental health interventions is vital from both clinical and
societal perspectives (Cuijpers et al., 2014). However, the dominant
model of delivering nonpharmacological treatments for depressive
symptoms (i.e., in-person consultations delivered by mental health
professionals) appears to be suboptimal to meet the pressing mental
health needs (Kazdin, 2018; Kazdin & Rabbitt, 2013; Purtle et al.,
2020). The inadequacy of this dominant model has become even
more evident amid the COVID-19 pandemic because of workforce
shortages and mental health service disruptions in 93% of countries worldwide (Turale & Nantsupawat, 2021; World Health
Organization, 2020).
To bridge the demand-supply gap, a growing number of studies
have highlighted the potential utility of smartphone-based interventions in ameliorating depressive symptoms (Luxton et al., 2011;
Torous et al., 2020), given the current global smartphone penetration
rate has been estimated to be 78% (O’Dea, 2021). Smartphones
could offer an unprecedented opportunity to disseminate nonpharmacological treatments for depressive symptoms in a scalable and
timely manner (Firth et al., 2017), overcome geographic and time
constraints, and potentially enhance intervention outcomes via their
built-in functions in smartphones (e.g., automated notifications and
text messaging; Bakker et al., 2016). Emerging evidence has
indicated that smartphone-based interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms (g = 0.26–0.41) (Kerst et al., 2020;
Linardon et al., 2019; Weisel et al., 2019). However, high dropout
rates remain a major challenge in their implementation (Himle et al.,
2021; Torous et al., 2020; Webelhorst et al., 2020). For example, a
recent meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
found that the pooled dropout rate in smartphone-based interventions that specifically targeted depressive symptoms was 26.2%
(Torous et al., 2020), and this figure increased to 48% after adjusting
for publication bias. Another meta-analysis examining the dropout
rate in smartphone-based interventions for depressive symptoms
demonstrated similar results: the dropout rates at short-term (≤8
weeks from baseline) and long-term (>8 weeks from baseline)
follow-ups were 35.5% and 32.1%, respectively (Linardon &
Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020).
As highlighted by previous reviews and treatment guidelines for
depression, accommodating service users’ preferences could be a
promising way to increase intervention adherence in addition to inperson clinician feedback (Delevry & Le, 2019; Firth et al., 2017;
Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020; Torous et al., 2020; Windle
et al., 2020). Qualitative content analyses have shown that, to manage
depressive symptoms, service users preferred smartphone-based interventions that focused on self-empowerment and self-management
skills (Firth et al., 2017; Patoz et al., 2021; Pung et al., 2018; Tan et al.,
2020). For example, integrating a range of lifestyle self-management
modifications into daily routines was shown to be of particular interest
to service users (Morgan & Jorm, 2009; Parker & Crawford, 2007;
Pung et al., 2018; Sarris et al., 2014).
One innovative approach that could address the perceived needs
of service users with depressive symptoms is lifestyle medicine
(LM). Although there are various definitions of LM in the literature, the LM approach is broadly defined as an evidence-based
approach that uses multicomponent LM interventions (diet, physical activity, sleep management, and/or stress management) as a
primary modality to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related health


problems (Egger et al., 2017; Katz & Karlsen, 2019). It should
be noted that the LM approach was not intended to be a substitute for
current clinical practice for depressive symptoms. Rather, the LM
approach recognizes the clinical value of current practice, and it has
been suggested that the two could be used in tandem to maximize
treatment outcomes (Egger et al., 2009; Ripoll, 2012). While
conventional treatments primarily focus on individual risk factors
(e.g., biological and psychological markers), the LM approach
works on a range of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., poor diet
quality, physical inactivity, poor quality of sleep, and stress) that are
involved in several important biological pathways and/or processes
(e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress, gastrointestinal microbiota,
the stress response system, and neuroprogression) of depression
(Firth et al., 2020; Lopresti et al., 2013; Sarris et al., 2014).
Furthermore, the LM approach emphasizes that active participation
in lifestyle modifications is the key to intervention success (Egger
et al., 2017). It aims to empower service users to take a proactive role
in managing their own health and intervention progress (Coventry
et al., 2014), thus emphasizing that the responsibility for managing
long-term health is not solely on healthcare professionals but also on
service users (Egger et al., 2009).
Indeed, researchers in the fields of lifestyle psychiatry and clinical
psychology are showing an increasing interest in implementing
lifestyle interventions for depressive symptoms (Firth et al., 2020;
Sarris et al., 2014). This is likely because of an emerging body of
evidence that has revealed the correlations between poor diet quality
(Kosulwat, 2002; Law, 2019), physical inactivity and sedentary
behaviors (Christofoletti et al., 2020; Vandelanotte et al., 2016),
poor sleep quality (Ekirch, 2015; Hoyos et al., 2015), and stress
(Hammen, 2015; Sarris et al., 2014) with the onset and development
of depressive symptoms (Firth et al., 2020; Sarris et al., 2014).
However, to date, the majority of pure lifestyle interventions for
depressive symptoms have focused on a single lifestyle factor (e.g.,
exercise, diet, mindfulness, or yoga) and have demonstrated small to
moderate effect sizes (d = 0.16–0.53) compared with nonpharmacological treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy; Bello´n et al., 2021; Brinsley et al.,
2020; Firth et al., 2017, 2019, 2020). Considering that the risk
factors for depressive symptoms are multifactorial and intercorrelated (Ripoll, 2012), the LM approach that aims to modify multiple
risk factors related to depressive symptoms simultaneously may
provide synergistic therapeutic benefits (Walsh, 2011). This proposition has been supported by recent RCTs that have investigated the
effects of multicomponent LM interventions on depressive symptoms. For example, Chang et al. (2018) implemented a multicomponent LM intervention (physical activity, dietary recommendation,
and stress management) as a primary modality for geriatric depressive symptoms. Their findings demonstrated a medium effect size
(d = 0.70) on depressive symptoms relative to a care-as-usual
control group. A more recent RCT evaluating a Web-based selfhelp multicomponent LM intervention (physical activity, dietary
recommendation, social activity, and sleep management) as a
primary modality for depressive symptoms in individuals with a
history of major depression also demonstrated encouraging results
(Abbott et al., 2020). The results suggested that individuals receiving the LM intervention for 44 days had significantly fewer depressive symptoms (d = 1.08) compared with a waitlist control group at
immediate post-intervention assessment. Moreover, a recent metaanalysis of RCTs examining the effects of multicomponent LM

interventions (that targeted at least two of the following lifestyle
factors: nutrition, physical activity, sleep management, and/or stress
management) on depressive symptoms demonstrated favorable
results but with smaller effect sizes (d = 0.20–0.22) (Wong et al.,
2021). The authors explained that the smaller clinical effect was likely
because most of the included participants had a minimal level of
depressive symptoms or had depressive symptoms secondary to a
physical disease at baseline with limited room for improvement.
A growing yet limited body of research has investigated the
effects of multicomponent LM interventions as a primary modality
for depressive symptoms, but the efficacy and credibility of a
smartphone-based multicomponent LM intervention for depressive
symptoms remain unclear. Considering the limited accessibility of
nonpharmacological treatments for depressive symptoms and the
various needs and preferences of service users, a smartphone-based
multicomponent LM intervention could potentially benefit individuals with depressive symptoms in a clinically effective and costeffective way. We conducted the first RCT to evaluate the efficacy
and credibility of a smartphone-delivered multicomponent LM
intervention, Lifestyle Hub, as a primary modality for individuals
with depressive symptoms in an adult Chinese population.

##### Method


In this RCT, 79 participants were randomized to either the
lifestyle medicine group (LMG) or the waitlist control group
(WLG). Ethical approval was sought from the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee (SBREC), the Chinese University
of Hong Kong (Reference No. SBRE-19-303). The trial was preregistered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration no. NCT04152850)
and followed the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) guidelines for reporting.

##### Study Population and Procedure


Potential participants were then asked to complete a set of online
screening questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform. Eligible participants were invited to participate in this study by a research
assistant (RA) via phone contact (approximately 10 min). During
the call, the RA explained the consent form to eligible participants
and instructed them to download an in-house smartphone app
(Longitudinax) for online informed consent and data collection.
Participants who completed the baseline assessment were then
randomly assigned to either the LMG or the WLG at a 1:1 ratio.
Randomization was performed by an independent assessor using a
computer-generated list of numbers. Thereafter, the LMG participants received the download instructions and unique login details
for Lifestyle Hub from the RA via text message. In addition, a brief
reminder regarding the self-help nature and intervention structure of
the Lifestyle Hub (i.e., the eight 60-min sessions delivered on a
weekly basis) was sent along with the login details. Throughout the
study period, participants were allowed to contact the RA via text
messaging for any technical errors or adverse events (i.e., any
unintended physical injury resulting from the intervention). Nine
participants from the LMG contacted the RA for technical support.
Their reasons for contact included requesting login details (n = 6),
encountering bugs when using Lifestyle Hub (n = 2), and insufficient
phone storage (n = 1). No adverse event was reported throughout the
study. The WLG participants were asked to maintain their typical
activities during the 8-week waiting period, and they were given
access to the Lifestyle Hub following the completion of the immediate post-intervention assessment at Week 9. Compensation of HK
$100 (equivalent to US$13) was offered to those who completed all
of the study and assessment procedures to acknowledge the contribution of their time and effort.

##### Intervention


The recruitment period lasted for 4 weeks starting from April 1,
2020. Potential participants were recruited from the local community through the mass mailing system of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, advertisements in local print media, and social media
(e.g., Facebook and Instagram). Participants were included if they
(a) were Hong Kong residents; (b) aged ≥18 years; (c) had a Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score ≥10 (Moriarty et al., 2015;
Spitzer et al., 1999); (d) were able to read Chinese and type in
Chinese or English; (e) had an Internet-enabled mobile device (iOS
or Android operating system); and (f) were willing to provide
informed consent and comply with the trial protocol. Given the
self-help nature of this study, the following exclusion criteria were
assessed based on a self-report checklist: (a) current involvement in
psychotherapy or recent changes in medication for depression; (b)
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Item 9 score of at least 2,
indicating a current moderate suicidal risk that requires active crisis
management (referral information to professional services was
provided to those with a serious suicidal risk) (Beck et al., 1961;
Green et al., 2015; Shiner et al., 2016); (c) self-disclosure of having
unsafe health conditions for which physical activity or a change in
diet was contraindicated by physicians; and (d) self-disclosure of a
diagnosis of any major psychiatric, medical or neurocognitive
disorders that make participation unsuitable or that may interfere
with the adherence to the lifestyle modifications.


Lifestyle Hub is an integrative multicomponent LM smartphone
application developed by the study authors based on recent research
findings, clinical guidelines, and local dietary guidelines. Its development was guided by the theoretical constructs of the transtheoretical model (TTM), including consciousness-raising, dramatic relief,
counterconditioning, self-re-evaluation, environmental re-evaluation,
self-liberation, contingency management, and stimulus control, to
increase self-efficacy for lifestyle modifications and improve adherence (Gholami et al., 2019; Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983; Romain
et al., 2018). A team of healthcare professionals (a clinical psychologist, a psychiatrist, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, a
dietitian, and a physical instructor) was responsible for validating the
included content. Moreover, the intervention content was tested in a
pilot RCT of a group-based lifestyle intervention for depressive
symptoms in a Chinese population (Ip et al., 2021).
The Lifestyle Hub intervention comprised eight 60-min weekly
sessions with six components: (a) lifestyle psychoeducation, (b)
physical activity, (c) dietary recommendations, (d) stress management, (e) sleep management, and (f) motivation and goal-setting
techniques. A screenshot of the Home page of the Lifestyle Hub
application is presented in Figure 1A. To facilitate understanding,
each weekly session was divided into five to six submodules (i.e., 45
submodules in a total of eight sessions) supported by animated
videos lasting from 8 to 15 min. Video scripts were provided
beneath each animated video (Figure 1B). Detailed descriptions
of the intervention content are presented in Table 1. All the

participants from the LMG received the same intervention sessions
for at least 60 min per week and completed the same homework
activities that lasted for 10–20 min per day starting from Week 1 to
Week 9. Participants could review their intervention progress and
homework activities in the Record page of Lifestyle Hub (Figure
1C). To facilitate the incorporation of lifestyle recommendations
into their daily life, the participants could use the built-in goalsetting function in Lifestyle Hub to set their personal goals. A total of
60 sample lifestyle goals with brief descriptions and potential
benefits were included for reference (Figure 1D). The intervention
content was delivered using animated videos, audio, texts, pictures,
and gamified quizzes to maximize engagement by arousing the
participants’ interest.
Throughout the intervention, a series of reflective and openended questions based on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI) (i.e., expressing empathy, avoiding argumentation,
rolling with resistance, developing discrepancy, and supporting
self-efficacy) were embedded within the eight intervention sessions to encourage long-term maintenance and enjoyment of the
many self-management skills that the participants have learned
from Lifestyle Hub (Miller & Rollnick, 2012). MI was also used

Table 1
Intervention Overview


to promote SMART goal setting, planning, review, implementation, and maintenance. One of the prominent features of
Lifestyle Hub is the Explore page (Figure 1E), which provided
continuous weekly updates of locally tailored recipes (some
containing video demonstrations) (Figure 1F), exercise instructions, and/or yoga, mindfulness, and diaphragmatic breathing
demonstrations to increase intervention adherence. Moreover, a
daily lifestyle challenge (e.g., walk 8,000 steps today) was sent
to the participants every morning throughout the trial period to
keep them motivated for continuous lifestyle modifications. In
addition, a daily motivational quote (e.g., “if you want it, work
for it”) was sent out every day throughout the trial period to help
increase self-efficacy and affinity. If the notification function
was enabled, the participants would receive new updates on the
Explore page, daily challenges, and reminders on self-created
personal goals.
To ensure participation, a backend platform for account management and adherence data recording was created. The monitoring
function of this platform could capture embedded routine data,
including participants’ login time, login duration, and usage of
sessions and submodules.

LIFESTYLE MEDICINE FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS 975


##### Data Collection

Self-report assessments of depressive and generalized anxiety
symptoms, insomnia severity, HRQoL, health-promoting behaviors
(HPBs), functional disability, food frequency, physical activity
level, and intervention expectancy and credibility were collected
at the baseline (Week 0), immediate post-intervention (Week 9), and
1-month follow-up (Week 13). Note that the WLG was not assessed
for intervention expectancy and credibility at Week 9 or for any
measure at Week 13 to avoid unnecessary intervention delay.
Participants in both groups were given a maximum of 3 days to
complete the baseline assessments via Longitudinax. Daily notifications (i.e., a total of three messages) were sent via Longitudinax to
remind the participants to complete the assessments. In addition, the
RA reminded the participants in both groups to complete the
outcome measures via daily text message (maximum 3 days).


##### Screening and Outcome Measures

 Screening


BDI-II item 9 was used to assess participants’ suicidal thoughts or
intention 2 weeks before the baseline assessment (Beck et al., 1961;
Green et al., 2015; Shiner et al., 2016). This item includes explicit
language about suicidal ideation on a 4-point scale, including (0) “I
don’t have any thoughts of killing myself,” (1) “I have thoughts of
killing myself, but would not carry them out,” (2) “I would like to
kill myself,” and (3) “I would kill myself if I had the chance.”

##### Outcomes


The primary outcome of the present study was depressive symptoms measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9;
Kroenke et al., 2001), a 9-item questionnaire used for screening,
diagnosing, and measuring the severity of depression. The participants responded to each item on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total PHQ-9 score is
the sum of the scores on the nine items and ranges from 0 to 27. A
higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms. The
Cronbach’s α for the PHQ-9 in the present study was 0.92.
The secondary outcomes included generalized anxiety symptoms,
insomnia severity, HRQoL, HPBs, functional disability, intervention expectancy and credibility, food frequency, and physical
activity level. Generalized anxiety symptoms were measured using
the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment (Tong
et al., 2016), a 7-item questionnaire used for assessing the severity of
generalized anxiety over the past 2 weeks. The participants responded to each item on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total GAD-7 score is the sum
of the scores on the seven items and ranges from 0 to 21. A higher
score indicates more severe generalized anxiety symptoms. The
Cronbach’s α for the GAD-7 in the present study was 0.89.
Insomnia severity was evaluated using the Insomnia Severity
Index (ISI; Bastien et al., 2001), a 7-item questionnaire that uses a
5-point Likert-type scale to measure the severity of insomnia. The
total ISI score is the sum of the scores on the seven items and ranges
from 0 to 28. A higher score indicates more severe insomnia
symptoms. The Cronbach’s α for the ISI in the present study was 0.89.
HRQoL was evaluated using the Short Form (Six-Dimension)
Health Survey (SF-6D; Lam et al., 2008). The participants selected


the levels (up to four or six levels) that best described their physical
functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental
health, and vitality. A preference-based single index measure was
calculated by adding the scores of the six dimensions using a scoring
algorithm. The total SF-6D score ranges from 0.315 (the worse
HRQoL) to 1 (full health). The Cronbach’s α for the SF-6D in the
present study was 0.80.
HPBs were measured using the Health Promotion Lifestyle
Profile II (HPLP-II; Walker et al., 1987), a 52-item questionnaire
scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4
(routinely). The HPLP-II measures the overall health-promoting
lifestyle and six subdomains of HPBs, which include health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, interpersonal
relations, and stress management. The overall health-promoting
lifestyle score is the sum of the scores on the 52 items and ranges
from 52 to 208, whereas the score of each subdomain is the sum of
the scores on the specific items (eight or nine items) within that
subdomain and ranges from 8 to 32 or 9 to 36. A higher score
indicates more HPBs. In the present study, the Cronbach’s α was
0.95 for the overall scale and varied between 0.64 and 0.89 for the
HPLP-II subdomains.
Functional impairment was measured using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan, 1983), a brief 3-item self-report tool that
assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and
family life. The global functional impairment score, ranging from
0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired), is the sum of the scores of
the three items. The Cronbach’s α for the SDS in the present study
was 0.81.
Intervention acceptability was evaluated using the CredibilityExpectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly & Borkovec, 2000), a
6-item questionnaire that assesses the credibility of the intervention
and the expectations of intervention success. The average score of the
first four items in the CEQ was used to measure the overall intervention credibility, whereas the mean score of the remaining two items
was used to assess the overall intervention success expectancy. A
higher score indicates higher intervention credibility and success
expectancy. The Cronbach’s α for the credibility and expectancy
domains in the present study were 0.80 and 0.74, respectively.
Food frequency was measured by the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs; Zhang & Ho, 2009), an 18-item scale measuring
the frequency of food intake over the past 3 months. The participants responded to each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 0 (never) to 6 (more than four portions per day). The 18 items
were summarized into 11 categories, including carbohydrates;
vegetables; fish and other seafoods; red meat; white meat; beans,
nuts, and seeds; dairy products; products containing caffeine;
sugary products; alcohol; and tobacco. The average score for
each category ranges from 0 (never) to 6 (more than four portions
per day). The Cronbach’s α for the FFQ categories in the present
study varied from 0.50 to 0.68.
The physical activity level was evaluated using the International
Physical Activities Questionnaire—Chinese version (IPAQ-C; Lee
et al., 2011; Macfarlane et al., 2007), a 5-item questionnaire that
measures the amount of sitting time, walking time, and moderate
and vigorous exercise during the last 7 days. All of the responses
were converted to minutes from hour(s) and reported as a continuous
variable (metabolic equivalent task [MET] minutes a week) except
for the responses for sitting time, which were reported as hour(s) per
week. MET is defined as energy expenditure at rest. In the IPAQ-C,


-----

##### 976 WONG ET AL.


walking is assigned a value of 3.3 METs; moderate exercise, 4
METs; and vigorous exercise, 8 METs. The total activity level is the
sum of walking time and moderate and vigorous exercise. A higher
score indicates a higher activity level. The Cronbach’s α for the
IPAQ-C in the present study was 0.68.

##### Statistical Analyses


as the completion of the eight 60-min weekly sessions; this did not
include the participant’s time spent doing homework activities,
setting their personal goal(s), browsing the Explore page, or changing the app setting in the Setting page.

##### Results


The effect size estimation was based on an RCT that evaluated the
efficacy of a Web-based self-help multicomponent LM intervention
(physical activity, dietary recommendation, social activity, stress
management, and sleep management) as a primary modality for
depressive symptoms (Abbott et al., 2020). Using G[*]Power 3 (Faul
et al., 2007), considering a 5% α error probability, 80% power in a
two-tailed test, an estimated effect size of 0.8, and an estimated
dropout rate of 30% (Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020; Torous
et al., 2020), the estimated sample size to detect a significant
between-group difference in depressive symptoms was 76 (38
participants in each group).
All statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences Version 25.0 based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Two-tailed tests with a p value of less
than .05 were used to determine statistical significance. Cohen’s d
was used to calculate the between-group and within-group effect
sizes, with magnitudes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 considered as small,
moderate, and large, respectively (Cohen, 2013). The baseline
characteristics of the LMG and WLG were compared using the
chi-square test of independence or independent samples t-test, as
appropriate. The efficacy of Lifestyle Hub was evaluated using a
linear mixed-effects model (LMM) from baseline to Week 9, with
intervention conditions as the between-subject group factor and time
as the within-subject factor. The LMM uses maximum likelihood
estimation and handles data that are assumed to be missing at
random (Dziura et al., 2013; Little et al., 2012). Paired sample ttests were used to assess the within-group differences from Week 9
to Week 13 in all of the outcome measures in the LMG. A
conservative approach was adopted to establish clinical significance.
Participants who had at least a 5-point reduction in the PHQ-9 score
from baseline to immediate postintervention were considered to
have reached clinical significance (Kroenke et al., 2016, 2020; Löwe
et al., 2004). The chi-square test of independence was used to assess
whether there was any significant difference in the number of
participants who reached clinical significance and in the proportion
of participants who had achieved a PHQ-9 score of <10 at Week 9
assessment between the two groups.
The within-group differences in intervention credibility and
expectancy in the LMG were assessed using paired sample t-tests.
The study dropout rate was defined as the withdrawal rate throughout the entire study, comprising withdrawals during the intervention
and at the Week 9 and Week 13 assessments. The chi-square test of
independence was used to identify any significant difference in the
dropout rate between the two groups. In addition to the ITT analysis,
a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of
nonadherence on intervention outcomes. Participants in the LMG
who completed fewer than 70% of the submodules (i.e., <32
submodules) were considered to be nonadherent to the intervention
(Fleming et al., 2018). In addition, the participants were considered
to have successfully completed a session if their intervention usage
was ≥60 min per week as designed. Intervention usage was defined


##### Participant Characteristics

A total of 79 participants were included in this RCT, 39 and 40
of whom were randomly assigned to the LMG and the WLG,
respectively (Figure 2). The participants were predominantly
females (84.8%), and their mean age was 32.9 (SD = 12.5) years.
All of the lifestyle, psychosocial, and demographic characteristics were comparable between the LMG and WLG at baseline
( p > .05), except for age, which was significantly different
between the two groups ( [p = .02) (Tables 2 and 3 and Supple-](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000695.supp)
[mental Table 1).](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000695.supp)


##### Intervention Dropout and Usage

The dropout rates in the LMG and WLG were 12.8% and 12.5%,
respectively, which were not significantly different (χ[2] = 0.00, p =
.97). Reasons for dropout are listed in Figure 2. As for the intervention
usage, the LMG participants had completed an average of 24 of the 45
submodules by the Week 9 assessment. Specifically, 10 participants
had completed 1–10 submodules, 6 had completed 11–20 submodules, 4 had completed 21–30 submodules, 7 had completed 31–40
submodules, and 7 had completed 41–45 submodules.


##### Between-Group Comparisons

The LMM analyses revealed that depressive symptoms ( p < .01);
generalized anxiety symptoms ( p < .01); insomnia symptoms ( p <
.05); functional impairment ( p < .05); HRQoL ( p < .05); the HPLPII total ( p < .01), health responsibility domain ( p < .01), physical
activity domain ( p < .01), nutrition domain ( p < .05), spiritual
growth domain ( p < .05), and stress management domain ( p < .05)
scores; the IPAQ total activity domain score ( p < .05); and the IPAQ
walking activity domain score ( p < .05) were significantly improved
from baseline to Week 9 in the LMG relative to the WLG (Table 3
[and Supplemental Table 1). However, no between-group difference](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000695.supp)
was observed in the HPLP-II interpersonal relationship domain
score, IPAQ vigorous exercise domain score, IPAQ moderate
exercise domain score, IPAQ sedentary behavior domain score,
and FFQ measures.


##### Within-Group Comparisons

Paired sample t-tests revealed a significant reduction in HRQoL, as
measured by the SF-6D ( p < .01), and an increase in alcohol intake, as
measured by the FFQ (p < .05), from Week 9 to Week 13 in the LMG
[(Table 3 and Supplemental Table 1). No significant change was](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000695.supp)
observed in any other outcome from Week 9 to Week 13 (p > .05).


##### Sensitivity Analysis

A statistical summary of the sensitivity analysis is presented in
[Table 4 and Supplemental Table 2. The LMM analysis was repeated](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000695.supp)
to examine the intervention effects on participants who had

##### Clinical Significance

Thirteen of the 34 participants in the LMG and 4 of the 35
participants in the WLG showed at least a 5-point reduction in the
PHQ-9 score from baseline to Week 9. The χ[2] test revealed that
compared with the WLG, a significantly higher proportion of
participants in the LMG achieved a clinically significant reduction
in depressive symptoms from the baseline to Week 9 (χ[2] = 11.82,
p < .01). Moreover, 21 of the 34 participants in the LMG and 16 of
the 35 participants in the WLG achieved a PHQ-9 score of <10 at
Week 9 assessment. The χ[2] test indicated no statistically significant
difference in this score between the two groups at Week 9 assessment (χ[2] = 1.79, p = .23).

##### Intervention Evaluation

expectancy, t(38) = –0.90, p = .37, from baseline to Week 9 in
the LMG.

##### Discussion


Our RCT demonstrated that Lifestyle Hub, a smartphonedelivered multicomponent LM intervention, improved not only
depressive symptoms but also generalized anxiety symptoms,
insomnia symptoms, functional impairment, HRQoL, HPBs, and
total activity levels relative to the WLG at the immediate postintervention assessment (Week 9). However, Lifestyle Hub did not
demonstrate significant effects on interpersonal relationships, vigorous exercise or moderate exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, or
dietary quality. From the immediate post-intervention (Week 9) to


the 1-month follow-up (Week 13), a significant within-group reduction in HRQoL and an increase in alcohol intake were observed in
the LMG. Moreover, the credibility of Lifestyle Hub was supported
by a modest score on the CEQ and a low dropout rate when
compared with the existing multicomponent LM interventions
(Wong et al., 2021) and smartphone-based interventions for
depressive symptoms (Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020;
Torous et al., 2020). Taken together, our findings demonstrated that
Lifestyle Hub is an efficacious and credible multicomponent LM
intervention for depressive symptoms.
The effect of Lifestyle Hub on depressive symptoms at immediate
post-intervention in our study (d = 0.66) was superior to the effects
of other smartphone-based interventions for depressive symptoms
reported in recent meta-analyses (d = 0.26–0.41) (Firth et al., 2017;
Linardon et al., 2019; Weisel et al., 2019) as well as multicomponent
LM interventions for depressive symptoms reported in another
meta-analysis (d = 0.22) (Wong et al., 2021). The difference in

the magnitude of treatment effects between our study and the metaanalysis of Wong et al. (2021) was perhaps due to different study
samples. Most of the participants included in their meta-analysis
(Wong et al., 2021) had mild depressive symptoms secondary to a
physical illness at baseline, whereas the participants recruited in our
study had at least a moderate level of depressive symptoms.
Nevertheless, in line with our findings, Wong et al. (2021) demonstrated that the clinical effects tended to be stronger in participants
with a higher level of depressive symptoms (d = 0.45). In comparison with other individual RCTs that implemented multicomponent
LM interventions as a primary modality for depressive symptoms
(d = 0.70–1.08) (Abbott et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2018), our results
demonstrated consistent findings but a smaller effect size. Although
speculative, the smaller effect size in our study may be explained by
two reasons. First, this study was commenced during the second
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, during which
stringent social distancing measures and lockdown were enforced.
The reduced social connection might have increased the level of
perceived loneliness (Luchetti et al., 2020), which is a significant
risk factor for depressive symptoms (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010).
Second, Lifestyle Hub did not include social relationships as an
intervention component. Studies have found that poorer social
relationships had durable predictive power on the development
and progression of depressive symptoms (Teo et al., 2013). In
view of this, the addition of social relationships as a component
in multicomponent LM interventions would be beneficial to the
clinical management of depressive symptoms, particularly amid the
current pandemic crisis.


Given the limited data in the literature on the efficacy of multicomponent LM interventions for generalized anxiety symptoms, the
large effect size (d = 0.93) of Lifestyle Hub on generalized anxiety
symptoms was beyond our expectation. Our findings demonstrated
that Lifestyle Hub is comparable to the current first-line treatments
(e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, and
their combination) (Carpenter et al., 2018) and superior to the
various smartphone-based psychological interventions for generalized anxiety symptoms (e.g., cognitive bias modification, acceptance and commitment therapy, and gamified diaphragmatic
breathing) (Firth et al., 2017). In comparison with previous
RCTs examining multicomponent LM interventions for generalized
anxiety symptoms (Forsyth et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2019), the larger
effect size observed in our study may be attributed to the differences
in methodological and intervention design variability. First, the
addition of stress and sleep management as components in Lifestyle
Hub may have had synergistic effects in improving generalized
anxiety symptoms, considering that more lifestyle risk factors that
are involved in the development and progression of generalized
anxiety symptoms were being addressed. Second, the results of
previous RCTs that examined multicomponent LM interventions for
generalized anxiety symptoms may subject to the floor effect,
leaving little room for improvement throughout the course of
treatment. Third, the comparison group (i.e., the WLG) used in
the present study was different from those used in the studies by
Forsyth et al. (2015) and Nie et al. (2019), which were an attention
control group and a usual care control group, respectively. Thus, the
effect size resulted in our study might have been inflated due to the

use of a WL control group (Cuijpers et al., 2016; Furukawa
et al., 2014).
In the follow-up analyses, a significant within-group reduction in
HRQoL and an increase in alcohol intake were observed from Week
9 to Week 13 in the LMG. Caution is advised when interpreting
these findings, as the validity of our results might have been
threatened by the absence of a comparison group and the potential
impact of the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong.[1]

Notwithstanding the above limitations, our results on HRQoL were
consistent with those of the recent studies that examined the effect of
COVID-19 on individuals with depressive symptoms (Holmes et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). The further
tightening of social distancing measures (e.g., sudden neighborhood
lockdown and evening dine-in ban) together with high uncertainties
(e.g., employment, health, and economy) during the COVID-19
pandemic were found to be associated with poorer HRQoL. Hence,
the deterioration of HRQoL at Week 13 could partly be explained by
the impact of COVID-19 surge in Hong Kong. Similarly, the
significantly increased alcohol intake at Week 13 may be a maladaptive coping strategy to deal with COVID-19-related stressful
experiences. As posited by the negative reinforcement models of
substance use, the emergence of negative emotions due to disasters
(e.g., earthquake, tsunami, and pandemic) could increase the likelihood of using alcohol and/or other substances as a coping response
(Rogers et al., 2020; Wardell et al., 2020).
The nonsignificant between-group difference in vigorous and
moderate exercises at immediate postintervention was expected.
We adopted the stage-of-change model to guide our intervention
design; accordingly, high-intensity exercises were deliberately introduced in the last two sessions. Thus, a longer time was required to
see significant improvements in vigorous and moderate exercises. In
addition, our findings revealed no significant improvement in any
food frequency measures at the Week 9 assessment. According to
the stage-of-change model, commitment was the best predictor of


healthy dietary changes from the action stage to the maintenance
stage (Kelly, 2011). We postulate that significant changes in the FFQ
measures could be observed in a long-term follow-up among those
with acceptable adherence to the intervention. Future RCTs with
long-term follow-ups (e.g., 3-month follow-up) are warranted to
verify this hypothesis. Another possible explanation for the insignificant results in the FFQ measures could be the relatively long
recall period (i.e., the past 3 months) over the 8-week LM intervention, which may have diluted the observed food frequency changes.
The LM approach places a strong emphasis on active participation (Egger et al., 2009); therefore, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted to examine the intervention effects on participants
who had completed at least 70% of the submodules by the Week
9 assessment relative to the WLG. The findings demonstrated that
Lifestyle Hub had a moderate effect on depressive symptoms (d =
0.70) and a large effect on generalized anxiety symptoms (d = 0.82)
but a small effect on functional impairment (d = 0.31), insomnia
symptoms (d = 0.08), and HRQoL (d = 0.01). These findings
suggest that enhancing the intervention usage and adherence could
maximize the efficacy of multicomponent LM interventions for
depressive symptoms. Future studies are recommended to include a
range of self-management skills and motivational techniques (e.g.,
self-monitoring, MI, feedback, and goal-setting) along with core
lifestyle components to enhance treatment adherence. Likewise,
brief booster sessions could potentially consolidate the intervention
benefits and promote long-term maintenance of a healthy lifestyle in
depressed individuals.
In the present study, a dropout rate of 12.8% was observed in the
Lifestyle Hub intervention, which is lower than the rate reported in
other smartphone-based interventions for depressive symptoms
(range: 32.1%–48%) and multicomponent LM interventions for

depressive symptoms (20.6%) (Wong et al., 2021). Surprisingly, our
dropout rate was comparable to those in the smartphone-based
interventions for depressive symptoms that offered real-person
feedback (11.7%) (Torous et al., 2020). Indeed, the high dropout
rates in smartphone-based interventions for depressive symptoms
have long been regarded as a major challenge for translating
empirical data into real-world use. The low dropout rate observed
in this study suggests that the LM approach, which accommodated
the perceived needs of service users, could be a viable approach to
expedite the management of depressive symptoms.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the
findings in this study might have been inflated because of the
use of a WL control group. Future studies are recommended to
replicate this study by using an active control group to provide
more robust results regarding the intervention effects. Second,
considering the self-help nature of Lifestyle Hub and practicality
in real-world settings, all of the outcome measures were based on
self-report questionnaires that are prone to subjectivity bias. Future
studies may use clinical diagnostic tools (e.g., structured clinical
interviews) to enhance the precision and credibility of the findings.
Moreover, a range of wearable devices (e.g., pedometer, accelerometer, and actigraphy) could be used to objectively and continuously monitor physical and physiological changes, as well as
ecological momentary assessment to repeatedly sample individuals’ states of mood and behaviors in real time within natural
environments (Shiffman et al., 2008). Third, blinding of the
participants was not possible; thus, our findings may be subject
to performance bias. Fourth, we did not examine the mechanisms of
change because this study was a pioneering attempt to elucidate the
effects of a smartphone-delivered multicomponent LM intervention as a primary modality for depressive symptoms. Future studies
are warranted to obtain a stronger evidence base for this intervention. Fifth, the validity of our findings might have been threatened
by a range of covarying factors (drug use, levels of perceived
loneliness, attitudes toward COVID-19 and social distancing, and
personality traits) that could explain the intervention effects. Sixth,
as reflected by the completion rate, future studies can consider
collecting qualitative data regarding the design of the intervention
(e.g., duration and frequency of the intervention). The final important limitation of this RCT is that the current findings might have
limited generalizability, given that our participants were primarily
unmarried, childless, and highly educated.
In conclusion, this study was the first to demonstrate the potential
of a smartphone-delivered multicomponent LM intervention, Lifestyle Hub, as a primary modality for depressive symptoms. Our
results suggested that Lifestyle Hub is an efficacious and credible
multicomponent LM intervention for depressive symptoms. Such
smartphone-based multicomponent LM interventions that accommodate the perceived needs and preferences of service users could
be a viable option for alleviating the growing burden of depressive
symptoms. Future RCTs with high methodological quality are
needed to provide more robust evidence for such interventions.
