Abstract

Background. Despite its efficacy in treating comorbid insomnia and depression, cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited in its accessibility and, in many countries,
cultural compatibility. Smartphone-based treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative
modality. This study evaluated a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major
depression and insomnia.
Methods. A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted with 320
adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized to receive either
a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or waitlist condition. The primary
outcomes included depression severity, insomnia severity, and sleep quality. The secondary
outcomes included anxiety severity, subjective health, and acceptability of treatment.
Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week
12 follow-up. The waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up.
Results. Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In all but one
model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 6 follow-up was
significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment group had lower levels of depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen’s d = 0.86, 95% CI
(−10.11 to −5.37)], insomnia [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen’s d = 1.00, 95% CI (−5.93
to −3.53)], and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale – Anxiety subscale (HADSA): Cohen’s d = 0.83, 95% CI (−3.75 to −1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality [Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen’s d = 0.91, 95% CI (−3.34 to −1.83)]. No differences across
any measures were found at week 12, after the waitlist control group received the treatment.
Conclusion. proACT-S is an efficacious sleep-focused self-help treatment for major depression
and insomnia.

Despite its efficacy (Santoft et al., 2019), the accessibility of cognitive behavioral therapy for
depression (CBT-D) is often limited by high cost and cultural barriers (Corrigan, Druss, &
Perlick, 2014; Shi, Shen, Wang, & Hall, 2020). The preference for self-reliance and stigma
in some communities may hamper help-seeking behavior from mental health professionals
(e.g. Corrigan et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2020).
In addition to being a common symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD)
(McClintock et al., 2011; Tsuno, Besset, & Ritchie, 2005), sleep disturbance, in particular
insomnia, also predicts its onset, maintenance, and reoccurrence (Fang, Tu, Sheng, & Shao,
2019; Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), as well as suicidal ideations and
attempts (Harris, Huang, Linthicum, Bryen, & Ribeiro, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Because of
the high comorbidity and the bidirectionality of sleep disturbances and depression, sleepfocused interventions are recommended to be included in the treatment of MDD (Harvey,
Murray, Chandler, & Soehner, 2011).
Sleep treatments, in particular CBT for insomnia (CBT-I), are efficacious in alleviating
non-sleep symptoms in MDD (Ballesio et al., 2018; Feng, Han, Li, Geng, & Miao, 2020;
Ho, Chan, Lo, & Leung, 2020). Among those with comorbid depression and insomnia,
improvement in sleep in treatment predicts improvements in depression (Ballesio et al.,
2018; Bei et al., 2018).
Sleep-focused treatments are well received (Ho, Chung, Yeung, Ng, & Cheng, 2014), in part
because they are perceived by some to be more ‘physiological’ than ‘psychological’ (Parker,
Cheah, & Roy, 2001). CBT-I can be a preparatory and first-step prior to other more intensive

treatments (Baddeley & Gros, 2013; Ho, Yeung, Ng, & Chan,
2016). This study examined the efficacy of a non-assisted
smartphone-based CBT-I for those with both depression and
insomnia.

Internet-based and smartphone-based CBT-I

There is evidence to suggest that some help-seekers prefer selfhelp treatments (Hanson, Webb, Sheeran, & Turpin, 2016;
Segal, Hodges, & Hardiman, 2002). Self-help treatments can be
a particularly viable alternative for those who are reluctant to
seek professional help for mental health issues (Chin, Chan,
Lam, Lam, & Wan, 2015). Numerous studies have demonstrated
the efficacy of self-help CBT-I in treating insomnia (Blom et al.,
2015; Horsch et al., 2017; Krieger et al., 2019; Vedaa et al.,
2020). Internet-based CBT-I (iCBT-I), in particular, is efficacious
in alleviating not just insomnia but also depressive mood in
insomnia patients (Ho et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2015).
Therapist-guided iCBT-I has been demonstrated to have comparable efficacy for insomnia and depression as therapist-guided
iCBT-D in patients suffering from both (Blom, Jernelöv, Rück,
Lindefors, & Kaldo, 2017).
The current study further extends this line of work to test the
efficacy of iCBT-I in a pure self-help format, without any input
from a therapist, for those with both depression and insomnia.
Previous trials have demonstrated the efficacy of unguided iCBT
on symptoms of depression and insomnia (Christensen et al.,
2016; Glozier et al., 2019). The current trial tested the efficacy
of a smartphone-based intervention. Given the high accessibility
of smartphones, mobile application is a promising platform to
deliver timely treatment and professional help for common mental health problems (Economides et al., 2019; Linardon, Cuijpers,
Carlbring, Messer, & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2019; Mantani et al.,
2017). Considering the increasing smartphone penetration,
smartphone self-help application as a flexible and scalable modality of intervention can potentially help lessen the pressing needs
for treatments of common mental disorders, including depression
and insomnia.
Well-received, low-intensity treatments for depression and
insomnia via smartphones might be a convenient and costeffective adjunct to professional mental health services to overcome the economic, cultural, and personal barriers. This might
be particularly pertinent in the context of the unprecedented
COVID-19 pandemic. The detrimental impacts of the pandemic
on mental health (Salari et al., 2020), especially for those with preexisting mental disorders (Campion, Javed, Sartorius, & Marmot,
2020), further overwhelm the already overstretched public healthcare system and leave those in need without proper and timely
care. Social distancing has made it difficult for those in need of
professional help from seeking them. Smartphone-based services
might help alleviate such burdens on both patients and their care
providers.

Current study

The present study was a two-arm parallel waitlist controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of
proACT-S, a smartphone-based, non-assisted self-help CBT-I in
patients with comorbid depression and insomnia. The trial was
conducted in Hong Kong, where the high smartphone penetration is high (85.8%; Census and Statistics Department, 2017).
We hypothesized a greater reduction in both depression and


insomnia severity, and improvement in sleep quality in the treatment group compared to waitlist control at the post-treatment
follow-up. The waitlist control group was anticipated to have a
significant decrease in the outcome measures after receiving the
same treatment.
Anxiety symptomology was included as a secondary outcome
because of the high comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders (Kaufman & Charney, 2000) and the overlap in
their symptoms and risk factors, including sleep disturbances.
Many have recognized the potentials of sleep treatments, such
as CBT-I, and advocate for its use as a transdiagnostic approach
to common mental disorders (Harvey et al., 2011). Subjective
health was also included as a secondary outcome because of the
potential health implications of sleep disturbances (Lekander
et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2018).
Treatment expectancy refers to the prognostic expectations
about the treatment outcomes, both positive and negative
(Goldstein, 1962). Because treatment expectancy of posttreatment outcomes has been found to influence CBT treatment
outcomes (Alaoui et al., 2016), we included it as a covariate.
We also measured user’s acceptability of the treatment, given its
relative novelty. COVID-19 has brought about an unprecedented
crisis to global health. Our trial started before, and closed during,
the pandemic. We included a comparison between those who
completed the trial before and those during the pandemic.

Methods

Participants

The study was conducted in Hong Kong. Participants were
recruited from university mass emails, community posters, and
online advertisements on various platforms. Eligible participants
who completed the study received HKD$100 as a token of appreciation. Interested participants went through two stages of screening to confirm their eligibility (reported below and in the
published protocol; Hui, Wong, Ma, Ho, & Chan, 2020). All participants provided written informed consent before proceeding to
the screening.
A total of 2224 individuals completed the first stage of screening, which was a brief online self-report assessment. Eligible
respondents were Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or above
who were able to comprehend Chinese and type in Chinese or
English, bothered by their sleep complaints for at least 3 months
and for at least three nights per week, scored 8 or above on the
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 10 or above on the Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), able to access the Internet with
smart devices using iOS or Android operational system, have a
regularly used email address, and were able to provide informed
consent.
The 685 respondents who met the above criteria were invited
to proceed to the second stage of screening, which was a telephone diagnostic interview using the modified Chinese version
of the Revised Clinical Schedule (CIS-R) (Chan et al., 2017).
The interview identified the diagnosis of MDD, insomnia, as
well as other comorbidities based on the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – Tenth
Revision (ICD-10). The exclusion criteria included the diagnosis
of psychosis or schizophrenia, past participation in the pilot
trial of proACT-S, current and regular intake of prescribed psychiatric drugs for depression or insomnia, scored 2 or above on the
suicidal ideation item of the Beck Depression Inventory-II


-----

(BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996), report of current or past suicidal plans
or acts in last 12 months, received psychological intervention on
at least a monthly basis, or concurrent participation of any clinical
trials targeting depression and/or insomnia. The prospective
respondents (n = 188) who did not attend the diagnostic interview
were excluded from the study.
For the diagnosis of insomnia, prospective participants were
asked about their subjective experience of sleep disturbances
and the additional criteria to quantify their sleep complaints as
noted in DSM-5, such as the duration, severity, and frequency
of their sleep problems (American Psychiatric Association,
2013; Chung et al., 2014; Sivertsen et al., 2021). The average
total sleep time of the participants was <6.5 h. A CONSORT
flow diagram is displayed in Fig. 1.

Trial design

In this two-arm parallel RCT, after the baseline assessment
described above, participants were randomized to the treatment
or the waitlist control group based on a 1:1 allocation ratio algorithm in the back-end of the smartphone application. Eligible participants completed the two scheduled assessments and 6-week
self-help CBT-I treatment using proACT-S, which was developed
by the principal investigator.
Eligible participants in the treatment group started the treatment immediately after randomization. They were invited to complete the second assessment, i.e. the week 6 follow-up, after the
6-week treatment. The third assessment, the week 12 follow-up,
was administrated 6 weeks after the second assessment. Six
weeks after the randomization, the waitlist control group was
invited to complete the week 6 follow-up. They were then invited
to begin the treatment and to complete the week 12 follow-up
after the treatment.
This clinical trial was registered retrospectively at
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04228146), and the corresponding RCT protocol was published (Hui et al., 2020). The
authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All procedures
involving human subjects were approved by The University of
Hong Kong prior to the data collection (EA1810026).

Blinding

The participants were told that the treatment start date would be
randomly assigned to them by proACT-S, after they completed the
baseline assessment. This was done to minimize participants’
knowledge of their group assignment in the study. The principal investigator was blind to both the outcome assessments and group assignment. The research team was blind to the outcome assessments as they
were all completed by the participants via proACT-S. Two research
members were not blind to the group assignment as they had to
send out reminder emails and messages to the participants to enhance
treatment compliance. The data analyst was not blinded to group allo[cation. However, all the codes are included on OSF (https://osf.io/](https://osf.io/psk8h/?view_only=4b6e04f61ed24a7a93dfb28d5dbe9056)
[psk8h/?view_only=4b6e04f61ed24a7a93dfb28d5dbe9056).](https://osf.io/psk8h/?view_only=4b6e04f61ed24a7a93dfb28d5dbe9056)

CBT-I intervention

The treatment content was constructed based on the Chinese
translated version (Yang, Huang, & Lin, 2008) of a CBT-I


treatment manual (Morin & Espie, 2003). The details of the treatment content are reported elsewhere (Hui et al., 2020) and are
included in the Supplementary material.

Withdrawal conditions

Participants were regarded as withdrawn from the study if they
reported in any of the follow-up assessments: (1) having concurrent psychological treatment at least once per month; (2) taking
prescribed psychiatric drugs such as antidepressants, tranquilizers, sleeping pills regularly; or (3) participating in any other academic studies or clinical trials related to insomnia and/or
depression. These participants were allowed to continue to use
proACT-S within the study period, but their study participation
was regarded as withdrawn from the day they reported any of
the abovementioned withdrawal conditions. As these participants
could potentially produce bias in the treatment evaluation, we
treated them as withdrawn. That is, their data available prior to
withdrawal were analyzed, but the data since withdrawal were
treated as missing. No participants were excluded from analyses
in the post-randomization period.

Sample size calculation

A sample size of 199 was required to detect a small-sized effect of
0.2 (Ho et al., 2020) using mixed ANCOVA with 12 covariates,
assuming a power of 80% and an α value of 5% (Hui et al.,
2020). The study set an expected attrition rate of 30%, referencing
the mean attrition rates reported in a meta-analysis of self-help
CBT-I RCTs (Ho et al., 2020); we increased the target sample
size to 285 to detect a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.2) for the
score differences in each of the primary outcomes from baseline
to post-intervention.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

Depression symptoms
The Chinese version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to measure
the severity of depressive symptoms during the past week.
Cronbach’s α in this study across the assessments ranged from
0.83 to 0.92.

Insomnia severity
The Chinese version of ISI (Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001) was
used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms and the associated daytime impairment over the past 2 weeks. Cronbach’s α
in this study ranged from 0.77 to 0.87.

Sleep quality
The Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI;
Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989) was used to
measure sleep quality and disturbances during the past month.
Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 0.46 to 0.68, which is relatively low but consistent with previous studies (α = 0.55, Chung &
Tang, 2006; α = 0.66, Guo, Sun, Liu, & Wu, 2016; α = 0.71–0.72
for insomniacs, Tsai et al., 2005). There are debates regarding
the dimensionality of PSQI, which potentially explains the variations in the scale’s internal consistency (Manzar et al., 2018).

Secondary outcomes

Subjective health
The Chinese version of 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12)
Version 1 (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1995) was used to measure
subjective physical and mental health status.

Anxiety
The Chinese version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale –
Anxiety subscale (HADS; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was used to
measure the severity of anxiety symptoms during the past week.
Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 0.70 to 0.84.

Other measures

Treatment expectancy
The 6-item Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (Devilly &
Borkovec, 2000) was modified to measure expectancy toward
the treatment. It has been validated in CBT for people with
depression or insomnia. Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from
0.90 to 0.93.

Acceptability of treatment
The 26-item modified Participant Acceptability/Usability Rating
Scale (Ben-Zeev et al., 2014) was used to evaluate the self-help
treatment delivered via proACT-S.

Demographic information
Participants’ age, education level, marital status, gender, and
occupation were obtained in the first stage of screening process.

Clinical comorbidities
Participants’ clinical comorbidities on generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder
as defined in the ICD-10 were assessed in the second stage of
screening by telephone interview.

Adverse events
Questions checking on any potential adverse events in the
follow-up questionnaires. Participants were given the contact
information (phone and SMS) of the trial team as well as referral
information in case additional support was needed.

Statistical analyses

An intention to treat analysis was conducted. Multilevel modeling
was employed to evaluate the within-group and between-group
effects, and to assess randomized conditions by time interaction.
No imputation was performed as previous literature showed that
multilevel modeling can handle high attrition without substantially reducing statistical power (Chakraborty & Gu, 2009). All
analyses were conducted in R. The lme4 package was used to
run the multilevel models. Time points were nested within participants and a random participant-level intercept was included in
the model. Randomized group, time, and their two-way interaction effect were included as fixed effects. Models were adjusted
for baseline differences, if any, in demographic variables and
comorbidity. A p value of <0.05 and 95% confidence interval
were employed for main effects and interactions. Model fit was
evaluated by the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Post-hoc t tests
were performed to examine the between and within-group score
differences. Sensitivity analyses were performed, including the


adjusted models with baseline differences in treatment expectancy, per-protocol analyses on those who accomplished a satisfactory number of modules, and a selection of subgroup on
participants who were recruited during the COVID-19 as secondary analyses to check the robustness of the results. Post-hoc subgroup analyses were also performed on whether having a
comorbid anxiety disorder would modify the treatment effect.

Results

Demographic information

Participant recruitment started in March 2019 and closed in
March 2020. The trial began in May 2019 and ended in August
2020, after the expiration date for the last participant to complete
the week 12 assessment. A total of 320 eligible participants (73%
female; Mage = 27.3, S.D.age = 7.2) passed the two stages of screening, completed the baseline assessment, and enrolled in the clinical trial. All participants completed high school, and 90% had
attained some university education (Table 1). There were significant differences between the two groups in marital status (χ[2] =
6.33, p = 0.012) and gender distribution (χ[2] = 9.93, p = 0.002);
both variables were included in all analyses as covariates. There
were no significant differences between the groups in education
background, occupation, clinical comorbidities, and age.
Among the eligible participants, 52% (n = 167, 65% female;
Mage = 27.3, S.D.age = 7.3) were randomized to the treatment
group and 48% (n = 153, 81% female; Mage = 27.3, S.D.age = 7.2)
to the waitlist control group.

Preliminary analyses

No significant baseline differences were found between the groups
on any outcome measures (Table 1). The intra-class correlations
in the unconditional models ranged from 0.26 to 0.58, suggesting
it was appropriate to conduct multilevel models for the outcome
measures. Both the adjusted and unadjusted models gave comparable results on the treatment effects, the results of the former are
presented. Multilevel modeling results and the corresponding
LRTs for both primary and secondary outcomes are presented
in Tables 2 and 3.

Primary outcomes

Depressive symptoms
In the multilevel model predicting depression symptoms, fixed
effects for gender, marital status, and treatment condition were
not significant. The week 6 follow-up time point [B = −2.39,

S.E. = 0.72, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.81 to −0.99)] and the week 12
follow-up time point [B = −9.28, S.E. = 0.79, p < 0.001, 95% CI
(−10.83 to −7.73)] showed significant negative associations with
depression symptoms. Consistent with our hypothesis, the
group by week 6 follow-up interaction showed significant association with depression symptoms B = −6.72, S.E. = 1.07, p < 0.001,
95% CI (−8.82 to −4.62) (Fig. 2). Follow-up simple effect analysis
indicated that the treatment effect was significant at week 6
follow-up, B = −7.73, S.E. = 1.11, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−9.91 to
−5.55).
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was significant, in favor of the treatment group, t(188) = −6.44, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.86, 95% Cl (−10.11 to −5.37). In the within-group
score comparison, the treatment group corresponded to a large

Insomnia
In the multilevel model predicting insomnia severity, fixed
effects for gender, marital status, and treatment condition were
not significant. Both the week 6 follow-up time point [B =
−1.58, S.E. = 0.44, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−2.44 to −0.71)] and week
12 follow-up time point [B = −6.01, S.E. = 0.49, p < 0.001, 95%
CI (−6.96 to −5.06)] showed significant associations with
insomnia severity. Consistent with our hypothesis, the treatment
condition by week 6 follow-up interaction showed a significant
association with insomnia severity, B = −4.28, S.E. = 0.66, p <
0.001, 95% CI (−5.58 to −2.99) (Fig. 2). Follow-up simple effect
analysis indicated that the treatment effect was significant at
week 6 follow-up, B = −4.52, S.E. = 0.62, p < 0.001, 95% Cl
(−5.74 to −3.30).
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was significant, in favor of the treatment group, t(227) = −7.75, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 1.00, 95% Cl (−5.93 to −3.53). Both the treatment

[t(101) = 10.41, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.03, 95% Cl (4.40–6.47)]
and control [t(137) = 4.49, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.38, 95% Cl
(0.91–2.35)] groups showed a significant drop in the insomnia
severity at the week 6 follow-up; the control group corresponded
to a small effect size in the change, while the treatment group
yielded a large effect size in the reduction of insomnia (Table 4).


Sleep quality
In the multilevel model predicting sleep quality, fixed effects for
gender, marital status, and treatment condition were not significant; while the week 6 follow-up [B = −0.74, S.E. = 0.29, p =
0.011, 95% CI (−1.31 to −0.17)] and the week 12 follow-up [B
= −2.80, S.E. = 0.32, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.42 to −2.17)] showed
significant associations with sleep quality. The treatment condition by week 6 follow-up interaction yielded a significant association on sleep quality, B = −2.71, S.E. = 0.43, p < 0.001, 95% CI
(−3.56 to −1.87). Follow-up simple effect analysis showed that
the treatment effect was significant at week 6 follow-up, B =
−2.42, S.E. = 0.40, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−3.21 to −1.63) (Fig. 2).
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was significant, in favor of the treatment group, t(206) = −6.74, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.91, 95% Cl (−3.34 to −1.83). In the within-group
comparison, the treatment group showed a large difference before
and after the treatment, t(87) = 8.68, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.93,
95% Cl (2.42–3.85). The change in the control group corresponded to a small effect size, t(116) = 2.41, p = 0.018, Cohen’s
d = 0.22, 95% Cl (0.10–1.04) (Table 4).

Secondary outcomes

Anxiety symptoms
In the multilevel model predicting anxiety severity, fixed effects
for gender, marital status, treatment condition, and the week 6
follow-up time point were not significant. The week 12 follow-up
time point showed a significant association with anxiety symptoms, B = −2.25, S.E. = 0.32, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−2.88 to −1.63).

Treatment condition by week 6 follow-up interaction yielded a
significant association with anxiety symptoms, B = −2.77, S.E. =
0.43, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.62 to −1.92). Follow-up simple effect
analysis found that the treatment effect was significant at week 6
follow-up, B = −2.94, S.E. = 0.41, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−3.74 to
−2.13) (Fig. 2).
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was significant, in favor of the treatment group, t(209) = −6.30, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.83, 95% Cl (−3.75 to −1.96). In the within-group
comparison, the treatment group showed medium-to-large difference before and after the treatment, t(107) = 6.69, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.64, 95% Cl (1.71–3.16), while the control group
showed no significant change (Table 4).

Subjective health
In the multilevel model predicting subjective physical health, fixed
effects for gender, marital status, treatment condition, and the time
points were not significant. Neither treatment group-by-time interaction terms were significant (all ps > 0.05; Fig. 2). Post-hoc t tests
found no between and within-group differences across the
follow-up time points on subjective physical health. Results on


subjective mental health are consistent with the findings on other
mental health measures reported above (see Supplementary
material).

Clinical significance

Depression
Adopting a cut-off score at 20 or above (Vilagut, Forero,
Barbaglia, & Alonso, 2016), the percentage of participants in
the treatment group scoring above the clinical threshold following
the intervention decreased from 98% at baseline to 81% at the
week 6 follow-up. The control group had a 1% decrease, from
99% at baseline to 98% at the week 6 follow-up. At the week 12
follow-up, the percentage in the treatment group scoring above
the threshold sustained at 81% and the percentage in the control
group reduced to 79% (Table 5).

Insomnia
With a cut-off score at 11 or above (Morin, Belleville, Bélanger, &
Ivers, 2011), the percentage of participants in the treatment group
meeting the clinical threshold decreased from 96% to 61% at the

week 6 follow-up, while the control group found a decrease from
96% to 88%. At the week 12 follow-up, participants scoring above
the threshold dropped from 61% to 52%. The control group saw a
drop to 60% at the week 12 follow-up, after the given treatment
(Table 5). We reported the results using 8 (i.e. in remission) as
the cut-off score in online Supplementary Table S3.

Sleep quality
Using the cut-off score at above five (Buysse et al., 1989), the percentage of participants in the treatment group scoring above the
poor sleep quality threshold decreased from 100% to 87%. The
waitlist control group had a 1% decrease, from 100% at baseline
to 99% at the week 6 follow-up. At the week 12 follow-up, the
treatment group showed the maintenance of treatment effect
with 87% scoring above the threshold. Among the control
group, 84% scored above the threshold (Table 5).

Anxiety
Using the cut-off scores of 11–15 and 16–21 for moderate and
severe anxiety symptoms, respectively (Snaith & Zigmond,
1994), the percentages of participants in the treatment group
scoring above the clinical thresholds dropped from 61% at baseline to 32% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and from 11% at
baseline to 5% for severe anxiety symptoms, at the week 6 follow
up. The control group saw no improvement in the percentages of
participants scoring above the threshold; those with moderate
anxiety symptoms increased from 55% at baseline to 57% at the
week 6 follow-up, and those with severe anxiety symptoms
remained at 15% in both assessments. At the week 12 follow-up,


the clinical threshold percentages in the treatment group showed
the maintenance of the treatment effect, where 31% had moderate
anxiety symptoms and 5% had severe anxiety symptoms. The
waitlist control group showed a reduction in anxiety severity
after the given treatment, where the percentages of participants
with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms dropped from 57%
at the week 6 follow-up to 37% at the week 12 follow-up and
from 15% at the week 6 follow-up to 4% at the week 12 follow-up,
respectively (Table 5).

Dropout

Dropout varied from 1.2% to 37.7% at different time points
(Fig. 1). The total dropout for the treatment and waitlist control
groups was 37.7% and 26.8%, respectively.

Acceptability and usability

Over half of the participants found proACT-S easy to use. Nearly
90% of the participants found proACT-S clear and easy to understand. Over 60% of the participants were satisfied with the experience using proACT-S and nearly 70% would like to continue to
use proACT-S if it was available. Half of the participants found
it helpful in managing their symptoms. Taking a more conservative view, if we included all dropout participants as perceiving a
negative view toward proACT-S, the perception of ‘ease of use’
was 50% or above. By-item ratings are reported in online
Supplementary Table S4.

Sensitivity analyses

First, to test whether treatment expectancy affected the primary
outcomes of the study, adjusted models with the inclusion of
treatment expectancy as a covariate were conducted. The results
were similar to those reported above (online Supplementary
Table S5). Second, the per-protocol analyses were performed, in


which the reported multilevel models were conducted with a subsample that excluded those who did not complete at least five of
the six treatment modules. The per-protocol analyses gave identical significant results (online Supplementary Table S6). Third, a
subgroup of participants who started the study during the
COVID-19 (52%), i.e. from February 2020 onwards, were


-----

included in another set of multilevel model analyses to check the
intervention effects. Similar results were found (online
Supplementary Table S7). Subgroup analyses on participants having comorbid anxiety disorder found a similar significant interaction effect between treatment conditions and time. In the
model of anxiety severity, having an anxiety disorder was not a
factor impacting the treatment (online Supplementary
Table S8). Baseline severity of depression and insomnia were
included along with other baseline characteristics in simple
regression analyses to observe the impacts on the maintenance
of treatment effects. The initial treatment expectation on depression alleviation, gender, or having comorbid anxiety disorder
could likely be a factor impacting the maintenance of the treatment effects (online Supplementary Table S9).

Harms

No adverse events, increased suicidal risk, nor significant deterioration in primary outcome measures was reported throughout
the study.

Discussion

This RCT demonstrated the efficacy of a 6-week, non-assisted,
self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in adults with both depression
and insomnia. The effect was sustained at 6 weeks postintervention. The treatment group demonstrated greater reductions in depressive, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms, as well as
greater improvements in sleep quality at follow-up compared to
the waitlist control group. A higher proportion of participants
in the treatment group no longer met clinical cut-offs for depression, insomnia, and anxiety at post-treatment compared to the
control group. Sensitivity analysis revealed that participants with
and without anxiety reported similar treatment effects at week 6
and week 12 follow-ups. Similar improvements were seen in the
control group after they were given the treatment.
This study added to the literature to show that smartphonebased self-help CBT-I can be efficacious in treating depression
and that the treatment effect can be sustained to at least 6
weeks after the end of treatment. The effect size in improvement
in depression was large and comparable to the previous results of
CBT-I (Feng et al., 2020). While several studies have examined the
efficacy of fully automated iCBT-I on depressive symptoms
(Christensen et al., 2016; Glozier et al., 2019), ours is one of the
first to test a fully automated smartphone app CBT-I on those
with comorbid depression and insomnia.
The results should be interpreted in the context of the
strengths and limitations of unguided self-help treatments,
which, according to a network meta-analysis of the effect of
CBT-D, is more efficacious than waitlist but less so than treatment
modalities that have some input from a therapist (Cuijpers,
Noma, Karyotaki, Cipriani, & Furukawa, 2019). The low-intensity
nature of the treatment allows unguided self-help treatments to be
readily disseminated, but, as our remission rate and adherence
results suggest, it is far from being universally effective or helpful.
As those suffering from depression would likely benefit from at
least some forms of interactions with professionals (Newman,
Szkodny, Llera, & Przeworski, 2011), we speculate that, if
resources permit, augmenting the current treatment with therapist
support would further improve outcomes.
Not surprisingly, post-treatment improvements in sleep symptoms were observed. The effect sizes of the improvement in


insomnia and sleep quality are similar to those reported in previous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Horsch et al., 2017). In our treatment, sleep restriction was introduced at week 4, which is late
than other iCBT-Is that reported the sequence of treatment components (Krieger et al., 2019; van der Zweerde, van Straten,
Effting, Kyle, & Lancee, 2019). The effects of sleep restriction
on sleep parameters would likely be more pronounced with
time, especially if the recommendations are followed through.
The adjusted sleep time would be reduced during sleep restriction,
which explains the observed improvement in sleep efficiency at
the follow-up assessments (reported in online Supplementary
Table S10).
The findings of our secondary outcomes were largely consistent with previous studies of iCBT-I for anxiety (Ye et al., 2015).
Our results suggest CBT-I can also help alleviate anxiety symptoms among those with depression and insomnia. Half of the participants’ anxiety symptoms had reduced to mild to normal levels
after the treatment and this improvement was sustained at the
week 12 follow-up. The cognitive restructuring elements in our
self-help treatment might have acted as an aid to alleviate anxiety
symptoms, and hence helped to improve sleep. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the relationship between anxiety symptoms
and sleep improvement in self-help treatments.
Our participants saw improvement in subjective mental health
but not physical health at the end of the 6-week intervention. The
low-intensity treatment might not be sufficiently robust to bring
changes in subjective physical health. This is consistent with previous RCTs reporting that CBT-I failed to demonstrate significant
between-group improvement in physical health during the study
period (Chakravorty et al., 2019; Espie et al., 2019; Siebmanns
et al., 2021; Vedaa et al., 2020). However, better sleep is generally
associated with better daytime functioning and subjective wellbeing (Chan, Poon, Leung, Lau, & Lau, 2018; Weinberg, Noble,
& Hammond, 2016). It is plausible that if the participants continued to see improvements in their sleep and mental health, their
subjective physical health may enhance.
The improvement in anxiety and subjective mental health is
particularly noteworthy at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The overall acceptability and receptiveness of proACT-S were
positive. These figures are similar to previous smartphone-based
studies (Rost et al., 2017).
Taken together, proACT-S demonstrated efficacy in reducing
depressive and insomnia symptoms without any human input.
Balancing the need to reduce cost and to improve retention as
well as to boost the treatment effect, future advancement of similar self-help treatments might consider including simple and
automated means of providing users with reminders, feedback,
and encouragement, such as using in-app notifications.

Implications

In many countries, the mental health burden overwhelms existing
healthcare services. COVID-19 further widened the gap between
the demand and supply of mental health services (Campion
et al., 2020). Efficacious psychological treatments are available,
but their accessibility is restricted by their resource-demanding
nature, unaffordability, preference for self-reliance and alternative
forms of support, and stigma toward mental health issues (Chung,
Tse, Lee, Wong, & Chan, 2019; Corrigan et al., 2014; Hospital
Authority, 2019; Shi et al., 2020). Furthermore, Kazlauskas,
Eimontas, Olff, Zelviene, and Andersson (2020) indicated that
populations with relatively high stigma toward mental health


-----

tend to have higher adherence to self-help intervention and
receive greater benefits from low-intensity and highly accessible
treatments, such as Internet-based ones. Considering the relative
imbalance between the demand and supply of mental health services, the relatively high degree of mental health stigma in
Chinese communities, and the preference for self-reliant (Shi
et al., 2020), proACT-S and other app-based self-help treatments
might be able to help overcome some of the cultural barriers to
access mental healthcare among Chinese-speakers. The study
adds to the literature to demonstrate the efficacy of an app in
Chinese, which can potentially provide support to a large group
of patients.
proACT-S, like other CBT-I treatments, focuses on sleep but its
efficacy was observable in depressive and anxiety symptoms. The
bidirectionality of impact between sleep and mental health, especially the fact that sleep disturbance predisposes individuals to
common mental disorders (Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Riemann,
2007; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), suggests that sleep-related intervention may be one of the means to promote psychological wellbeing. The sequence of improvement in depressive symptoms in
response to transdiagnostic approaches such as sleep intervention
is under ongoing investigation. There is evidence to suggest that
sleep improvement established through CBT-I has a positive
effect on the overall severity of depression (Cunningham &
Shapiro, 2018). CBT is also believed to facilitate changes in information processing to ameliorate vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression that, in turn, would contribute to the
improvement of other depressive symptoms (Bhar et al., 2008).
An RCT examining the efficacy of guided online CBT-I on
depression reported promising effects on reducing preservative
thinking (van der Zweerde et al., 2019), further suggesting the
underlying mechanism of the influence of improved sleep. The
specific contributions of different sleep outcomes impacting daytime functioning and particular depressive symptoms warrant
further investigation (Wong et al., 2013).
Our study adds to the growing call for using sleep interventions, such as CBT-I, as a first-line treatment for common mental
disorders (Blom et al., 2017; Hagatun et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2014;
Thorndike et al., 2013; van der Zweerde et al., 2019).
Smartphone-based treatments have lower barriers even compared
with Internet-based treatments (Wilhelm et al., 2020). Our results
suggest that proACT-S is not only efficacious but also wellreceived by some of its users. Rather than replacing the professional mental health services, proACT-S can be considered in conjunction with intensive treatment delivery by mental health
professionals. It can, for example, be incorporated into a stepped
care service delivery model as an early step in the treatment of
common mental health problems (Ho et al., 2016).

Limitations

The current study has several limitations. First, the study participants were mostly young and well-educated. The findings have
limited generalizability to the older and less educated population.
To increasing the usability of proACT-S to those who are older or
less-educated, further refinement of the app can be done, for
example, by simplifying the contents and consider user feedback
to further enhance the user experience.
Second, the study did not include a sleep diary as an outcome
measure. Sleep diary could provide more precise and less
memory-dependent sleep data than self-reported questionnaires
(Ibáñez, Silva, & Cauli, 2018).


Third, beyond the baseline assessment stage, our study relied
on self-report measures. Future research could include actigraphy
or polysomnography for observing the changes in objective sleep
parameters (Ibáñez et al., 2018) and conduct a follow-up clinical
interview.
Fourth, the efficacy of the treatment was compared against a
waitlist control group, as opposed to an active control group.
Treatment studies with active control groups tend to show more
modest effect sizes (e.g. Firth et al., 2017a, b). The use of a waitlist
or no treatment condition as the control group is common in
RCTs of self-help CBT-I (Ho et al., 2020). Future studies may
include an inactive treatment, such as the monitoring of sleep
using a sleep diary, in the control condition to enhance the validity of the evidence.
Fifth, while the treatment gains remained apparent at 6 weeks
post-treatment, the lack of a longer-term follow-up limited our
confidence in whether the treatment effect would sustain over
time. van der Zweerde et al. (2019) reported that the positive
effect of guided online CBT-I on depressive symptoms was maintained at a 6-month follow-up. Similarly, a study reported that
participants continued to see treatment gain from iCBT-I on
reduced depressive symptoms at 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year
follow-up (Blom et al., 2017). Further work is needed to see
proACT-S can also stand the test of time.
Last, this study had a high attrition rate; the figures are not
incomparable with those reported in previous RCTs of
smartphone-based intervention (mean attrition of 24.1% at shortterm follow-up, Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020; mean attrition = 47.8% adjusted for publication bias, Torous, Lipschitz, Ng,
& Firth, 2020). Several factors were identified to associate with a
lower dropout rate in clinical trials of smartphone-based intervention, including integrating mood monitoring, providing monetary
incentives, use of online enrollment, and provide human feedback/practice reminders (Torous et al., 2020). In the current
study, we included a monetary incentive to attract and retain participants; this may hinder the generalizability of the findings as
the incentive may have had an impact on adherence to the treatment and completion of outcome assessment.

Conclusion

This two-arm RCT study demonstrates the efficacy of proACT-S,
an unguided smartphone-based CBT-I for depression. The transdiagnostic approach of sleep intervention for depression can help
tackle the existing structural and cultural barriers of mental health
needs. Because of its low cost, high accessibility, and minimal
therapist involvement, we recommend considering a smartphonebased CBT-I such as proACT-S as a first-step intervention that can
be disseminated at the community level to enhance the coverage
of mental health services.
