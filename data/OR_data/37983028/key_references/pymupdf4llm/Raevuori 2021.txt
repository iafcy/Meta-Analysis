**1. Introduction**


A B S T R A C T

_Background: Meru Health Program (MHP) is a therapist-guided, 8-week intervention for depression delivered via_
smartphone. The aim was to test its efficacy in patients with clinical depression in a Finnish university student
health service.
_Methods:_ Patients (n=124, women 72.6%, mean age 25y) were stratified based on antidepressant status, and
randomized into intervention group receiving MHP plus treatment as usual (TAU), and control group receiving
TAU only. Depression, measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, was the primary outcome.
After baseline (T0), follow-ups were at mid-intervention (T4), immediately post-intervention (T8); 3 months
(T20), and 6 months (T32) post-intervention.
_Results: The intervention group and control group did not have significant differences in depression outcomes_
throughout end of treatment and follow-up. Among secondary outcomes, increase in resilience (d=0.32, p=0.03)
and mindfulness (d=0.57, _p=0.002), and reduction in perceived stress (d=-0.52,_ _p=0.008) were greater in_
MHP+TAU versus TAU at T32; no differences were found in anxiety, sleep disturbances, and quality of life
between groups. Post-hoc comparisons of patients on antidepressants showed significantly greater reduction in
depression at T32 for MHP+TAU versus TAU (d=-0.73, _p=0.01); patients not on antidepressants showed no_
between-group differences.
_Limitations: Limitations include unknown characteristics of TAU, potential bias from patients and providers not_
being blinded to treatment group, and failure to specify examination of differences by antidepressant status in the
protocol.
_Conclusions:_ Most outcomes, including depression, did not significantly differ between MHP+TAU and TAU.
Exploratory analysis revealed intervention effect at the end of the 6-month follow-up among patients on anti­
depressant medication.


The rate of untreated depression is estimated to exceed 50% in
developed countries (Kohn et al., 2004), and its disease burden continues
rising globally (Malhi and Mann, 2018). Traditional ways of providing


mental health care were hampered by insufficient availability and low
scaling (Barkil-Oteo, 2013) already before the outburst of a COVID-19
pandemia, which has mounted further challenges to the field by
increasing the need of psychological support (World Health Organiza­
tion, 2020) and simultaneously demanding physical distancing. Digitally

delivered mental health care has potential to address these challenges.
Internet- and smartphone-based programs have demonstrated clin­
ical efficacy in the treatment of depression (Firth et al., 2017; Graham
et al., 2020; Kerst et al., 2020) with similar effect sizes and attrition rates
as traditional interventions (Carlbring et al., 2018). Predictably, com­
parisons to inactive controls have yielded larger, moderately positive
effects, whereas comparisons to active controls have yielded smaller
positive effects (Firth et al., 2017). Mixed results have been reported of
the effects of the programs with live-therapist support compared to
automated programs; either that the former is larger (Richards and
Richardson, 2012), or smaller (Firth et al., 2017). Health care pro­
fessionals tend to view digital interventions more suitable for mild to
moderate than severe depression (Kerst et al. 2020), and evidence from
the meta-analysis supports the notion (Firth et al., 2017). However, no
difference in the treatment effect sizes between community and pri­
mary-/secondary health care settings, where severity of depression is
likely to differ, has also been reported in a meta-analysis (Richards and
Richardson, 2012). The attitudes towards digital applications for
depression treatment have been reported positive both among users and
health care professionals (Kerst et al., 2020), which promotes their
dissemination.
Delivered via smartphone app, Meru Health Program (MHP) pro­
vides a comprehensive intervention by combining elements from three
evidence-based interventions for depression - behavioral activation,
mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (Economides
et al., 2019). The content includes support by a licensed remote thera­
pist; and text, videos, audio-guided mindfulness meditation exercises,
infographics illustrating CBT principles, and journal prompts. In this
study, we tested the efficacy of 8-week MHP in a randomized-clinical
trial (RCT) among patients with major depression from Finnish Stu­
dent Health Service (FSHS). Participants were young adults representing
a cohort where lifetime prevalence of depression is suggested to be
higher than in older cohorts, and an age group by which three-fourths of
lifetime cases of mood disorders have had their onset (Richards, 2011).
The primary aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of the MHP
plus treatment as usual (TAU) (intervention group) to TAU only (control
group) in the change of depression symptoms. Secondary aims were to
1) examine whether the treatment response between the intervention
and the control groups differed in anxiety symptoms, sleep problems,
perceived stress, quality of life, resilience, mindfulness, and attrition;
and 2) explore whether there was an association between the quantity of
mindfulness practice and change in depression and anxiety symptoms.
We hypothesized that depression symptoms would decrease among
patients in the intervention group across the 8-week MHP, and that the
difference in the depression score between the intervention and the
control group would be statistically and clinically significant immedi­
ately post-intervention, remaining at a lower level through the followup. We also hypothesized that anxiety, sleep problems and perceived
stress would show greater reduction among the intervention group
across the study period than those in the control group, remaining at a
lower level during the follow-up. We assumed that quality of life,
resilience and mindfulness would show greater increase among the
intervention group during the intervention, remaining at a higher level
at the follow-up. We also assumed that the attrition would be smaller in
the intervention group versus control group. Finally, we hypothesized
that there would be a dose-response relationship between the level of the
engagement to the intervention mindfulness practice regimen and the
reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms, and that this would be
modified by the internalization of mindfulness skills.

**2. Methods**

_2.1. Study design_

We used a randomized-controlled multi-center intervention study
design with simple random sampling. Randomization was performed


using block randomization by the Clinpal software, a data secure online
patient data collection and storage platform for clinical trials by eCli­
[nicalHealth Ltd (https://www.clinpal.com/). The random allocation](https://www.clinpal.com/)
sequence was automatically generated by the Clinpal. Randomization
was done in permuted blocks stratified by participants’ antidepressant
medication (AD) status (self-reported AD status at baseline, yes versus
no) with a 1:1 allocation ratio using random block sizes of 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10. Researchers, assistants and patients were blind to the stratification
and randomization sequence. Statistical analyses were conducted by an
independent statistician.
Participants from both groups received TAU, whereas those in the
intervention group additionally received 8-week MHP. Baseline (T0)
data were gathered within 2-week time frame before the MHP for the
intervention groups started. Follow-up points were at mid-intervention
(T4); at the intervention completion (T8); 3 months (T20), and 6
months after the intervention completion (T32).
The trial is registered with ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN17156687,
[accessible at https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17156687. Approvals for](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17156687)
the study were provided by the Ethics Committee of the Tampere Uni­
versity Central Hospital (ref: 09/2017, ETL-code R17128) and FSHS
(12/2017). Patient safety was monitored by systematic monitoring of
adverse/ serious adverse events by therapists and a psychiatrist of the
team.

_2.2. Participants and procedure_

Participants were university students recruited from general practi­
tioners’ (GPs, the vast majority) and psychiatrists’ appointments in
FSHS clinics in 11 cities. FSHS provides nationwide primary level health
care for all university students in Finland (coverage n=127 000 stu­
dents). The access to services is easy and low cost.
GPs and psychiatrists in FSHS were instructed to provide initial in­
formation and documents for the study screening for their patients with
a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Diagnosis was required to be
made by GP or psychiatrist. If a patient was willing to enroll into the
study screening, she/he returned the informed consent for the screening
in a pre-paid envelope to MHP therapist, after which a therapist
scheduled a screening phone call. In the screening call, therapist pro­
vided information of the study, underwent the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and answered patient’s questions. After the call, each patient
decided whether she/he wanted to participate in the study, and the
therapist considered patient’s eligibility. Therapists sent an email invi­
tation from the Clinpal contacting eligible patients who could log in and
setup an account into the online patient data collection platform, where
all self-reported instruments were administered. In the first login to the
platform, each patient signed the informed consent for the study, pro­
vided details of her/his potential AD, and filled in the baseline ques­
tionnaires. These baseline data were gathered before the stratification
and randomization, simultaneously within the first login to get infor­
mation of the AD status for the stratification. Recruitment started in
April 10[th ] 2018 and completed June 30th 2019. The follow-up
completed March 31[st ] 2020. The intervention was free of charge for
patients; no compensation was provided.

_2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria_

Study eligibility criteria included having ICD-10 diagnosis of a major
depressive disorder (single or recurrent episode; ICD-10 codes F32.0,
F32.1, F32.2, or F33.0, F33.1, F33.2, F33.4, F33.8, F33.9) documented
in the medical records at the time of enrollment, age 18-45 y, having no
established mindfulness practice, having a smartphone with iOS/
Android system, and willingness to commit to the intervention. Exclu­
sion criteria included ongoing psychotherapy, active substance abuse,
severe suicidal ideation, previous suicide attempt, and severe comorbid
mental disorder such as psychosis.

_2.4. Measures_

The following self-reported instruments were addressed at baseline
(T0) and every follow-up (T4, T8, T20, T32), except for the System
Usability Scale (SUS), which was administered only at the postintervention follow-up (T8).

_2.4.1. Patient Health Questionnaire 9-point (PHQ-9)_
The primary outcome measure was Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9) for depression symptoms (Lowe et al., 2004¨ ); PHQ-9 has
demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.89 in primary care settings, and excellent test-retest reliability
(Kroenke et al., 2001).

_2.4.2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)_
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), a secondary outcome

measure, was used to measure for anxiety symptoms (Lowe et al., 2008¨ ).
The instrument has shown an excellent internal consistency in the
general population with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89 (Lowe et al., 2008¨ ).

_2.4.3. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)_
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin et al., 2011), a secondary
outcome measure, was used to measure sleep disturbance. ISI has been
shown to be reliable and valid tool of measuring insomnia in the general
population and assessing treatment response in patient populations. It
has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.90-0.91 (Morin et al., 2011).

_2.4.4. EUROHIS-Qol 8-item index (EUROHIS-Qol-8)_
EUROHIS-Qol 8-item index (EUROHIS-Qol-8), a secondary outcome
measure, was used to measure quality of life (Schmidt et al., 2006).
EUROHIS-Qol 8-item index has demonstrated a good internal

_2.4.5. Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire–Short Form (FFMQ-SF)_
Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form (FFMQ-SF)
(Bohlmeijer et al., 2011), a secondary outcome measure, was used to
measure the internalization of mindfulness skills. Internal consistency of
FFMQ-SF has been shown to be good with Cronbach’s alpha ranging
from 0.77 to 0.93 (Williams et al., 2014).

_2.4.6. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)_
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) (Cohen et al., 1983), a secondary
outcome measure, was used to measure the level of perceived psycho­
logical stress. PSS-10 has demonstrated good internal consistency with
Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.78 to 0.91 (Lee, 2012).

_2.4.7. Resilience Scale_
Resilience Scale (Wagnild and Young, 1993), a secondary outcome
measure, was used to measure resilience. The Resilience Scale has
demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha ranging
from 0.76 to 0.91 (Wagnild and Young, 1993).


_2.4.8. System Usability Scale (SUS)_
System Usability Scale (SUS) (Jordan et al., 1996), a secondary
outcome measure, was used to measure the usability of the mobile app
among patients in the intervention group. SUS has demonstrated
excellent internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 (Lewis,
2018).

_2.4.9. The intervention engagement_
Total engagement time (frequency x duration) to the intervention
mindfulness practices and chat activity (total message count), i.e. par­
ticipants’ engagement with a therapist and vice versa, were measured
automatically in the smartphone app.

_2.4.10. Social support_
Social support was assessed by a study therapist by an informal scale,
weak/ moderate/strong, based on the baseline information.

_2.5. Intervention_

MHP is a comprehensive therapist-guided intervention for depres­
sion delivered via a smartphone app (Economides et al., 2019). In the
current trial, we used 8-week version of the MHP, which consists of 8
sequentially delivered modules, with content derived from
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (Kabat-Zinn, 1982),
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (Segal et al., 2002), CBT (Beck,
1976), and Behavioral Activation Therapy (Jacobson et al., 2001). The
content includes text, videos, audio-guided mindfulness exercises,
infographics illustrating CBT principles, and journal prompts. Daily
content and practice time range between 10-45 min. MHP includes
anonymous peer support via moderated group discussion board, and
asynchronous support by a remote therapist. Therapists are
board-certified and licensed master’s level mental health professionals,
who review participant engagement and provide one-to-one support via
chat messaging, and infrequently, by phone calls. If there were signs of
patient’s mental state deterioration, therapist conducted additional
phone-based assessment.

_2.6. Treatment as usual (TAU)_

TAU comprised of pragmatic treatment for depression as provided at
the FSHS. TAU could or could not include AD, laboratory tests, and
appointments with healthcare professionals such as nurses, psycholo­
gists, and doctors. Frequency of the appointments was tailored to each
patient’s individual needs.

_2.7. Statistical analysis_

Assuming 85% power, α-level of 0.05, and allowing 35% drop-out, a
mean difference of 5 points (SD 5.2) in primary outcome measure be­
tween the intervention and the control group could be expected to be
detected with 30 patients in each stratified group, which yielded 60
patients per arm (n total 120). Baseline differences in outcomes between
intervention and control groups were tested with two-sample t-test.
Differences in the changes in primary and secondary outcomes between
intervention and control groups and the changes within groups were
analyzed with a restricted maximum likelihood estimation method
based repeated measures model using the PROC MIXED in SAS. The
model included the effects of group, week and group*week interaction.
Least squares means (LSM) for changes (from baseline to follow-up)
within groups and for the difference in the changes between groups
were estimated using contrasts in the repeated measures model. Followup measurements were compared to the baseline using Dunnett’s
adjustment in pairwise comparisons. Analyses followed intent to treat
approach under a missing at random assumption. As a sensitivity anal­
ysis, last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute
the missing values. The effect sizes between the intervention and the

control group were calculated by _Cohen’s d. Effect sizes of 0.2 were_
considered as small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large. Clinical signifi­
cance for the primary outcome was defined as ≥5 points’ reduction in
PHQ-9 score (Lowe et al., 2004¨ ). Binary logistic regression was applied
to compare ≥5 points’ decrease in PHQ-9 score at T8 and T32 between
the groups. Relationship between the amount of mindfulness practice
and the change of depression and anxiety symptoms among the inter­
vention group was examined using Pearson correlation coefficients. The
potential modifying effect of internalization of mindfulness skills by
FFMQ-SF (divided into tertiles) on the association of the quantity of
mindfulness practice and the PHQ-9 change and GAD-7 change were
examined using linear model. The potential modifying effect of AD on
intervention effect was tested post-hoc, and exploratory subgroup ana­
lyses, including primary and secondary 1 outcome analyses, by AD
status, were done. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS soft­
ware (SAS software). Two-sided statistical tests with 0.05 level of sig­
nificance were used.

**3. Results**

_3.1. Sample and participant characteristics_

Altogether 180 patients were enrolled, and 170 were screened; of
these, 12 declined to participate, 29 were ineligible, 5 did not provide
baseline information, and 124 were randomized – 63 to receive MHP
plus TAU and 61 to receive TAU. Drop-out was defined as having pro­
vided no follow-up information after the baseline (attrition 12.8%, n =
10 control, _n_ = 6 intervention, _p_ = 0.27). The CONSORT diagram is
presented in Fig. 1. Participants’ baseline characteristics are summa­
rized in Table 1; the differences between the two groups suggest no
significant effect of randomization.

_3.2. Primary outcome_

There was no statistically or clinically significant difference between
the intervention group and the control group in the reduction in
depression symptoms by PHQ-9 from baseline to immediately postintervention, T8 (LSM difference 0.44, 95% CI = -1.29, 2.17, p = 0.62,
_Cohen’s d = 0.10), or to T32 (LSM difference -1.42, 95% CI = -3.21, 0.36,_
_p_ =0.12, _Cohen’s d_ = -0.32) (Table 2). At T8, 27.0% (17/63) in the
intervention group versus 26.2% (16/61) in the control group achieved
≥5 points’ decrease in PHQ-9 (LOCF-analysis, _OR_ = 1.04, _95% CI_ =
0.47, 2.31, p = 0.92). At T32, the respective was true for 39.7% (25/63)
in the intervention group versus 26.2% (16/61) in the control group
(LOCF-analysis, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 0.86, 3.96, p = 0.11).

_3.3. Secondary outcomes_

No statistically significant differences between the intervention


group and the control group in change of anxiety by GAD-7, sleep dis­
turbances by ISI, and quality of life by EUROHIS-Qol-8 were detected
(Table 2). The increase in mindfulness by FFMQ-SF was larger in the
intervention group than in the control group at T20 and at T32 (LSM
difference 5.30, 95% CI = 1.93, 8.67, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.57). The
reduction of the perceived stress by PSS-10 was larger in the interven­
tion group than in the control group at T20 and at T32 (LSM difference
-2.71, 95% CI = -4.73, -0.70, p = 0.008, Cohen’s d = -0.52). The increase
in Resilience Scale was larger in the intervention group than in the
control group at T32 (LSM difference 3.63, 95% CI = 0.44, 6.82, p =
0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.32) (Table 2).
The mean total minutes of the intervention-associated mindfulness
practice was 496 (SD = 274, median 501, range 29 - 1161), equaling 8.9
minutes of daily practice during the intervention. The associations be­
tween total minutes of completed mindfulness practices and reduction of
depression by PHQ-9 at T8 (r = -0.22, p = 0.15), T20 (r = -0.08, p =
0.63) and T32 (r = -0.0002, p = 0.99) were not significant. The same was
true for anxiety by GAD-7 at T8 (r = -0.16, p = 0.29), T20 (r = -0.02, p =
0.89) and T32 (r = 0.11, p = 0.51).
The level of mindfulness skills by FFMQ-SF did not significantly
modify the association of the total time of completed mindfulness
practice and change of depression symptoms by PHQ-9 at T8 (p = 0.91),
T20 (p = 0.18), or T32 (p = 0.19) or change of GAD-7 at T8 (p = 0.41) or
T20 (p = 0.06). At T32, FFMQ-SF modified the association of the amount
of mindfulness practice and change of GAD-7 score (p = 0.017): higher
total minutes were associated with the reduction of anxiety by GAD-7 in
the lowest tertile (β = -0.014, SE = 0.006, p = 0.048). In the medium
tertile, however, higher amount of practice was marginally significantly
associated with the increase of anxiety by GAD-7 (β = 0.012, SE = 0.006,
p = 0.054), and no association was detected in the highest tertile (β =
0.002, SE = 0.004, p = 0.58).

_3.4. Sensitivity analysis_

In the sensitivity analyses (LOCF) of primary and secondary outcome
1 analyses (Table S2), mindfulness by FFMQ-SF was no longer signifi­
cant at T20. Otherwise results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent
with the results of the main analyses.

_3.5. Intervention effects by antidepressant medication (AD)_

To assess whether the intervention effects were modified by AD,
exploratory analysis of the interaction AD x intervention x time were
conducted. There was a trend for the interaction on primary outcome,
depression by PHQ-9 (AD x group x time effect, p = 0.10). Primary and
secondary outcome 1 analyses were therefore conducted separately for
those on AD and those not on AD.
No significant differences between the intervention and the control
group were seen in the baseline scores among patients on AD (n = 70)

and not on AD at baseline (n = 54) (Table S1). The intervention group on
AD had a statistically significantly greater reduction in depression by
PHQ-9 from baseline to T32 (LSM difference -3.35, _95% CI_ = -5.92,
-0.77, p = 0.01, Cohen’s d = -0.73) compared to the control group on AD
(Table 3). Decrease of ≥5 points’ in PHQ-9 score in those on AD was
achieved by 22.2% (8/36) in the intervention group versus 26.5% (9/
34) in the control group at T8 (LOCF-analysis, OR = 0.79, 95% CI =
0.27, 2.37, p = 0.68), and by 38.9% (14/36) in the intervention group
versus 26.5% (9/34) in the control group at T32 (LOCF-analysis, OR =
1.77, 95% CI = 0.64, 4.88, p = 0.27). Control group on AD had statis­
tically significantly greater reduction in anxiety by GAD-7 compared to
the intervention group on AD from baseline to T4 (LSM difference 2.50,
_95% CI = 0.25, 4.74, p = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.59). Intervention group on_
AD had greater reduction in stress by PSS-10 compared to controls on
AD from baseline to T32 (LSM difference -4.02, 95% CI = -6.65, -1.40, p
= 0.003, Cohen’s d = -0.72). Respectively, from baseline to T32, there
was an increase among intervention group on AD in mindfulness by
FFMQ-SF (LSM difference 7.43, _95% CI_ = 2.42, 12.44, _p_ = 0.004,
_Cohen’s d = 0.74), and in resilience by Resilience Scale (LSM difference_
6.02, 95% CI = 1 .72, 10.32, p = 0.006, Cohen’s d = 0.49) (Table 3).
Among those not on AD (Table 4), comparing the intervention group to
the control group, controls had greater decrease of sleep disturbances by
ISI at T8 and at T32 (LSM difference 2.82, 95% CI = 0.61, 5.03, p =
0.013, Cohen’s d = 0.59). Decrease of ≥5 points’ in PHQ-9 in those not
on AD was achieved by 33.3% (9/27) in the intervention group versus
25.% (7/27) in the control group at T8 (LOCF-analysis, OR = 1.43, 95%
_CI = 0.44, 4.63, p = 0.55), and by 40.7% (11/27) in the intervention_

_OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.45, 4.36, p = 0.56). Results of the sensitivity an­_
alyses at T4, T8, T20 and T32 in those on and not on AD were consistent
with the results from the main analyses (data not shown).

median 19, range 1-77), or from therapist to patient (mean 54, median
55, range 17-122) were not associated with the change of depression by
PHQ-9. There were no study-related adverse events.

**4. Discussion**

The overall aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy of
an app-based mobile intervention, MHP, plus TAU compared to TAU in
patients with clinical depression recruited from the Finnish university
students’ health services. The results showed that the intervention group


receiving 8-week MHP plus TAU and the control group receiving only
TAU did not differ significantly from one another on depression symp­
toms, either from baseline to immediately post-intervention or to the 6month follow-up after the intervention. The therapist-guided mobile
app did thus not provide additional benefit over TAU alone for the
treatment of depression among young adults representing highly
educated population. Within the intervention group, reduction of PHQ-9
score was 4.4, and the difference to controls was 1.4 (d = -0.32), clearly
below the minimal clinically important difference for the measure. Of
secondary outcomes, we observed significant improvement among
intervention group in mindfulness skills, which is unsurprising given that
mindfulness is a central method in MHP; but additionally, the interven­
tion group demonstrated significant improvement in resilience and
reduction in experienced stress, i.e. in qualities highly relevant for
recovering from depression and for protection of depressive relapse
(Strain, 2018). The time spent on intervention-associated mindfulness
practices did not associate with the change of depression or anxiety,
suggesting that at least in the examined range, increasing mindfulness
practice time was not associated with improved outcomes. Results also
suggested that internalization of the mindfulness skills did not modify the
effect of the mindfulness practice on the change of depression symptoms,
which implies that internalization of the mindfulness does not influence
the relationship between the amount of practice and the change of
depression. In anxiety however, total time of the mindfulness practice was
associated with the reduction of anxiety among those with lower mind­
fulness skills at the end of the follow-up. This suggests that in the long run,
increasing the mindfulness practice time has relevance for the improve­
ment of anxiety among those with lower but not higher mindfulness skills.
AD seemed to modify the intervention effect on primary outcome,
depression, and overall, patients on AD benefitted from the MHP more
than those not on AD. Intervention effect size for depression symptoms
in those on AD was moderate, whereas in the whole intervention group
it was small and non-significant, and in those not on AD, it was nonexistent. Within the intervention group on AD, reduction of PHQ-9
score was 5.5; the difference to controls was 3.4, which is below clin­
ical significance (≥ 5 points) as defined in the current trial. However,
Lowe et al. (2004) ¨ have also suggested range 3 - 5 points for the minimal
clinically important difference of PHQ-9, which would allow interpre­
tation that the difference to control group was clinically significant
among those on AD. Significant differences between the patients on AD
in the intervention and the control group, at the direction of hypotheses,
were also apparent in mindfulness skills, experienced stress, and resil­
ience. The hypothesized pattern that the maximum intervention benefit
would manifest immediately post-intervention (T8), and decrease
slightly during the 6-month follow-up, turned out not be true among
those on AD; instead, the effects of the intervention on all outcomes
increased as a function of time. In contrast to patients on AD, the only
difference between the intervention and the control group among

patients not on AD was greater reduction in sleep problems among
controls. Our findings from these post-hoc analyses hence suggest that
factors either directly or indirectly related to AD contribute to the
capability of benefitting from the MHP among patients with major
depression.
The improved treatment response among those with combined AD
and psychological treatment is supported by earlier evidence: a metaanalysis showed that combined treatment against depression was
more effective (d = 0.35) than the same psychological treatment alone
(Cuijpers et al., 2009b). Inversely, other meta-analyses demonstrated
psychotherapy (d = 0.31) (Cuijpers et al., 2009a) and other psycho­
logical interventions (Pampallona et al., 2004) combined with phar­
macotherapy having additional value compared to pharmacotherapy
alone in the treatment of depression. Furthermore, in AD-resistant
clinical depression, adding smartphone CBT to medication was more
effective than treatment by AD change alone (Mantani et al., 2017).
Neurobiological mechanism for the improved treatment response of the
combined treatment has also been demonstrated, as ADs have been
shown to reactivate juvenile-like plasticity in the adult cortex in humans
and animals (Castr´en, 2013; Sharif et al., 2019), which may allow the
enhanced influence of the psychological treatment.
There are only few previous RCTs of mobile app-interventions for
depression among patient samples. Perhaps most comparable with ours,
a recent trial (Graham et al., 2020) of a coach-supported platform of a
suite of apps versus usual treatment among primary care patients with
depression or anxiety demonstrated between group effect sizes of 0.78
and 0.64 at the completion of the 8-week intervention, respectively. The
intervention effects were sustained from posttreatment to 16-week
follow-up. In another RCT of the 6-month guided access to online
computerized CBT versus usual care for mood and anxiety disorders in
primary care (Rollman et al., 2018), between group effect sizes of 0.31
and 0.26 were reported at 6-month follow-up; these persisted 6-months
later, and completing more sessions produced greater effect sizes, but
combining an internet support group with computerized CBT provided
no additional benefit. Subgroup results by AD were not reported in
either trial. Both defined depression with PHQ-9 instead of clinical
diagnosis as in the current trial. Both had college graduates without
clinical experience as intervention coaches, whereas MHP has master’s
level mental health professionals as therapists. In a meta-analysis (Firth
et al., 2017) of RCT’s, depressive symptoms were reduced significantly
more in smartphone apps group than in the overall control group (g =
0.38, p<0.001; comparison to inactive controls g = 0.56; comparison to
active control treatments g = 0.22). The overall lost-to-follow-up rate in
our RCT was 12.9%, which fits the range reported in most previous
studies. A meta-analysis of smartphone-based interventions for depres­
sion symptoms reported drop-out around 30% (Firth et al., 2017). Using
similar definition as in this trial, the RCT among primary care patients
with depression/ anxiety in turn reported very low, 3.4%,
lost-to-follow-up rate (Graham et al., 2020).


Are there comparable previous reports as related to the lack of maingroup differences in depression symptom change, but improvements in
resilience, experience of stress, and mindfulness skills, as in our trial? In
psychotherapy research, exclusive focus on symptom reduction to
evaluate therapeutic gain, and to guide the choice of the treatment, has
been questioned (Messer, 2004), while broader ability to cope with
potential life stressors has been emphasized equally (Blatt et al., 2000).
Resembling the findings in our study, further analysis of the NIMH
Treatment for Depression Collaborative Research Program indicated
lack of significant differences between brief psychotherapies and clinical
management (among patients on AD and not on AD) in depression
symptom reduction, as measured by primary measures (Blatt et al.,
2000). In the follow-up however, patients who had received brief psy­
chotherapy reported feeling in fuller control of important aspects in
their lives, and that their treatment had enabled them to develop more
adaptive coping mechanisms and to deal more effectively with their
experiences of depression. The authors concluded that different types of
therapeutic interventions should not only aim to reduce symptoms of
depression, but also vulnerability to subsequent disruptive life experi­
ences (Blatt et al., 2000).

_4.1. Limitations_

Some limitations should be noted. Due to the nature of the study
design, we were unable to detail TAU (appointment type/ frequency);
the same was true for specific depression diagnoses and psychiatric
comorbidity. We had concern over the possibility that the intervention
group received significantly less TAU compared to the control group,
among whom TAU was the only treatment. Due to ethical reasons, the
intervention group however needed to have access to TAU. Social sup­
port was assessed informally by a study therapist instead of using vali­
dated measures. Sociodemographic data was collected scarcely and was
not statistically controlled in the analyses. Blinding of the patients,
therapists or researchers for patients’ group status was impossible; this
awareness might have biased reporting. Analyses of the intervention
effects by ADs were not pre-specified in the protocol, but since the
question was clinically highly relevant, we decided that it was appro­
priate to report these post-hoc analyses.

**5. Conclusions**

Therapist-guided intervention delivered through a smartphone app
plus TAU was not more effective against clinical depression among
young adults than TAU alone. However, examination of a subgroup of
patients on AD revealed an intervention effect that appeared at the end
of the 6-month follow-up. Future studies in patient samples with major
depression are needed with focus on whether and how depression
medication, and other potential contributing factors, modify the efficacy
of smartphone app-based interventions.
