Background. Despite its efficacy in treating comorbid insomnia and depression, cognitive 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited in its accessibility and, in many countries, 
cultural compatibility. Smartphone-based treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative 
modality. This study evaluated a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major 
depression and insomnia. 
Methods. A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted with 320 
adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized to receive either 
a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or waitlist condition. The primary 
outcomes included depression severity, insomnia severity, and sleep quality. The secondary 
outcomes included anxiety severity, subjective health, and acceptability of 
treatment. 
Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week 
12 follow-up. The waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up. 
Results. Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In all but one 
model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 6 follow-up was 
significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment group had lower levels of depres- 
sion [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen’s d = 0.86, 95% CI 
(−10.11 to −5.37)], insomnia [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen’s d = 1.00, 95% CI (−5.93 
to −3.53)], and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale – Anxiety subscale (HADS- 
A): Cohen’s d = 0.83, 95% CI (−3.75 to −1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality [Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen’s d = 0.91, 95% CI (−3.34 to −1.83)]. No differences across 
any measures were found at week 12, after the waitlist control group received the treatment. 
Conclusion. proACT-S is an efficacious sleep-focused self-help treatment for major depression 
and insomnia.

Despite its efficacy (Santoft et al., 2019), the accessibility of cognitive behavioral therapy for 
depression (CBT-D) is often limited by high cost and cultural barriers (Corrigan, Druss, & 
Perlick, 2014; Shi, Shen, Wang, & Hall, 2020). The preference for self-reliance and stigma 
in some communities may hamper help-seeking behavior from mental health professionals 
(e.g. Corrigan et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2020). 
In addition to being a common symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) 
(McClintock et al., 2011; Tsuno, Besset, & Ritchie, 2005), sleep disturbance, in particular 
insomnia, also predicts its onset, maintenance, and reoccurrence (Fang, Tu, Sheng, & Shao, 
2019; Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), as well as suicidal ideations and 
attempts (Harris, Huang, Linthicum, Bryen, & Ribeiro, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Because of 
the high comorbidity and the bidirectionality of sleep disturbances and depression, sleep- 
focused interventions are recommended to be included in the treatment of MDD (Harvey, 
Murray, Chandler, & Soehner, 2011). 
Sleep treatments, in particular CBT for insomnia (CBT-I), are efficacious in alleviating 
non-sleep symptoms in MDD (Ballesio et al., 2018; Feng, Han, Li, Geng, & Miao, 2020; 
Ho, Chan, Lo, & Leung, 2020). Among those with comorbid depression and insomnia, 
improvement in sleep in treatment predicts improvements in depression (Ballesio et al., 
2018; Bei et al., 2018). 
Sleep-focused treatments are well received (Ho, Chung, Yeung, Ng, & Cheng, 2014), in part 
because they are perceived by some to be more ‘physiological’ than ‘psychological’ (Parker, 
Cheah, & Roy, 2001). CBT-I can be a preparatory and first-step prior to other more intensive 




treatments (Baddeley & Gros, 2013; Ho, Yeung, Ng, & Chan, 
2016). This study examined the efficacy of a non-assisted 
smartphone-based CBT-I for those with both depression and 
insomnia. 

There is evidence to suggest that some help-seekers prefer self- 
help treatments (Hanson, Webb, Sheeran, & Turpin, 2016; 
Segal, Hodges, & Hardiman, 2002). Self-help treatments can be 
a particularly viable alternative for those who are reluctant to 
seek professional help for mental health issues (Chin, Chan, 
Lam, Lam, & Wan, 2015). Numerous studies have demonstrated 
the efficacy of self-help CBT-I in treating insomnia (Blom et al., 
2015; Horsch et al., 2017; Krieger et al., 2019; Vedaa et al., 
2020). Internet-based CBT-I (iCBT-I), in particular, is efficacious 
in alleviating not just insomnia but also depressive mood in 
insomnia patients 
al., 2015). 
Therapist-guided iCBT-I has been demonstrated to have compar- 
able efficacy for insomnia and depression as therapist-guided 
iCBT-D in patients suffering from both (Blom, Jernelöv, Rück, 
Lindefors, & Kaldo, 2017). 



The current study further extends this line of work to test the 
efficacy of iCBT-I in a pure self-help format, without any input 
from a therapist, for those with both depression and insomnia. 
Previous trials have demonstrated the efficacy of unguided iCBT 
on symptoms of depression and insomnia (Christensen et al., 
2016; Glozier et al., 2019). The current trial tested the efficacy 
of a smartphone-based intervention. Given the high accessibility 
of smartphones, mobile application is a promising platform to 
deliver timely treatment and professional help for common men- 
tal health problems (Economides et al., 2019; Linardon, Cuijpers, 
Carlbring, Messer, & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2019; Mantani et al., 
2017). Considering the increasing smartphone penetration, 
smartphone self-help application as a flexible and scalable modal- 
ity of intervention can potentially help lessen the pressing needs 
for treatments of common mental disorders, including depression 
and insomnia. 

low-intensity treatments for depression and 
insomnia via smartphones might be a convenient and cost- 
effective adjunct to professional mental health services to over- 
come the economic, cultural, and personal barriers. This might 
be particularly pertinent in the context of the unprecedented 
COVID-19 pandemic. The detrimental impacts of the pandemic 
on mental health (Salari et al., 2020), especially for those with pre- 
existing mental disorders (Campion, Javed, Sartorius, & Marmot, 
2020), further overwhelm the already overstretched public health- 
care system and leave those in need without proper and timely 
care. Social distancing has made it difficult for those in need of 
professional help from seeking them. Smartphone-based services 
might help alleviate such burdens on both patients and their care 
providers. 

The present study was a two-arm parallel waitlist controlled ran- 
domized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of 
proACT-S, a smartphone-based, non-assisted self-help CBT-I in 
patients with comorbid depression and insomnia. The trial was 
conducted in Hong Kong, where the high smartphone penetra- 
tion is high (85.8%; Census and Statistics Department, 2017). 
We hypothesized a greater reduction in both depression and 

insomnia severity, and improvement in sleep quality in the treat- 
ment group compared to waitlist control at the post-treatment 
follow-up. The waitlist control group was anticipated to have a 
significant decrease in the outcome measures after receiving the 
same treatment. 
Anxiety symptomology was included as a secondary outcome 
because of the high comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depres- 
sive disorders (Kaufman & Charney, 2000) and the overlap in 
their symptoms and risk factors, including sleep disturbances. 
Many have recognized the potentials of sleep treatments, such 
as CBT-I, and advocate for its use as a transdiagnostic approach 
to common mental disorders (Harvey et al., 2011). Subjective 
health was also included as a secondary outcome because of the 
potential health implications of sleep disturbances (Lekander 
et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2018). 
Treatment expectancy refers to the prognostic expectations 
the treatment outcomes, both positive and negative 
about 
(Goldstein, 1962). Because 
expectancy of post- 
treatment 
treatment outcomes has been found to influence CBT treatment 
outcomes (Alaoui et al., 2016), we included it as a covariate. 
We also measured user’s acceptability of the treatment, given its 
relative novelty. COVID-19 has brought about an unprecedented 
crisis to global health. Our trial started before, and closed during, 
the pandemic. We included a comparison between those who 
completed the trial before and those during the pandemic. 


The study was conducted in Hong Kong. Participants were 
recruited from university mass emails, community posters, and 
online advertisements on various platforms. Eligible participants 
who completed the study received HKD$100 as a token of appre- 
ciation. Interested participants went through two stages of screen- 
ing to confirm their eligibility (reported below and in the 
published protocol; Hui, Wong, Ma, Ho, & Chan, 2020). All par- 
ticipants provided written informed consent before proceeding to 
the screening. 
A total of 2224 individuals completed the first stage of screen- 
ing, which was a brief online self-report assessment. Eligible 
respondents were Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or above 
who were able to comprehend Chinese and type in Chinese or 
English, bothered by their sleep complaints for at least 3 months 
and for at least three nights per week, scored 8 or above on the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 10 or above on the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), able to access the Internet with 
smart devices using iOS or Android operational system, have a 
regularly used email address, and were able to provide informed 
consent. 
The 685 respondents who met the above criteria were invited 
to proceed to the second stage of screening, which was a tele- 
phone diagnostic interview using the modified Chinese version 
of the Revised Clinical Schedule (CIS-R) (Chan et al., 2017). 
The interview identified the diagnosis of MDD, 
insomnia, as 
well as other comorbidities based on the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10). The exclusion criteria included the diagnosis 
of psychosis or schizophrenia, past participation in the pilot 
trial of proACT-S, current and regular intake of prescribed psychi- 
atric drugs for depression or insomnia, scored 2 or above on the 
the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
suicidal 



(BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996), report of current or past suicidal plans 
or acts in last 12 months, received psychological intervention on 
at least a monthly basis, or concurrent participation of any clinical 
trials targeting depression and/or insomnia. The prospective 
respondents (n = 188) who did not attend the diagnostic interview 
were excluded from the study. 
For the diagnosis of insomnia, prospective participants were 
asked about their subjective experience of sleep disturbances 
and the additional criteria to quantify their sleep complaints as 
noted in DSM-5, such as the duration, severity, and frequency 
(American Psychiatric Association, 
of 
2013; Chung et al., 2014; Sivertsen et al., 2021). The average 
total sleep time of the participants was <6.5 h. A CONSORT 
flow diagram is displayed in Fig. 1. 



In this two-arm parallel RCT, after the baseline assessment 
described above, participants were randomized to the treatment 
or the waitlist control group based on a 1:1 allocation ratio algo- 
rithm in the back-end of the smartphone application. Eligible par- 
ticipants completed the two scheduled assessments and 6-week 
self-help CBT-I treatment using proACT-S, which was developed 
by the principal investigator. 
Eligible participants in the treatment group started the treat- 
ment immediately after randomization. They were invited to com- 
plete the second assessment, i.e. the week 6 follow-up, after the 
6-week treatment. The third assessment, the week 12 follow-up, 
was administrated 6 weeks after the second assessment. Six 
weeks after the randomization, the waitlist control group was 
invited to complete the week 6 follow-up. They were then invited 
to begin the treatment and to complete the week 12 follow-up 
after the treatment. 





at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04228146), and the corre- 
sponding RCT protocol was published (Hui et al., 2020). The 
authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work com- 
ply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institu- 
tional committees on human experimentation and with the 
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All procedures 
involving human subjects were approved by The University of 
Hong Kong prior to the data collection (EA1810026). 

The participants were told that the treatment start date would be 
randomly assigned to them by proACT-S, after they completed the 
baseline assessment. This was done to minimize participants’ 
knowledge of their group assignment in the study. The principal inves- 
tigator was blind to both the outcome assessments and group assign- 
ment. The research team was blind to the outcome assessments as they 
were all completed by the participants via proACT-S. Two research 
members were not blind to the group assignment as they had to 
send out reminder emails and messages to the participants to enhance 
treatment compliance. The data analyst was not blinded to group allo- 
cation. However, all the codes are included on OSF (https://osf.io/ 
psk8h/?view_only=4b6e04f61ed24a7a93dfb28d5dbe9056). 

The treatment content was constructed based on the Chinese 
translated version (Yang, Huang, & Lin, 2008) of a CBT-I 

treatment manual (Morin & Espie, 2003). The details of the treat- 
ment content are reported elsewhere (Hui et al., 2020) and are 
included in the Supplementary material. 

Participants were regarded as withdrawn from the study if they 
reported in any of the follow-up assessments: (1) having concur- 
rent psychological treatment at least once per month; (2) taking 
prescribed psychiatric drugs such as antidepressants, tranquili- 
zers, sleeping pills regularly; or (3) participating in any other aca- 
demic studies or clinical 
trials related to insomnia and/or 
depression. These participants were allowed to continue to use 
proACT-S within the study period, but their study participation 
was regarded as withdrawn from the day they reported any of 
the abovementioned withdrawal conditions. As these participants 
could potentially produce bias in the treatment evaluation, we 
treated them as withdrawn. That is, their data available prior to 
withdrawal were analyzed, but the data since withdrawal were 
treated as missing. No participants were excluded from analyses 
in the post-randomization period. 

A sample size of 199 was required to detect a small-sized effect of 
0.2 (Ho et al., 2020) using mixed ANCOVA with 12 covariates, 
assuming a power of 80% and an α value of 5% (Hui et al., 
2020). The study set an expected attrition rate of 30%, referencing 
the mean attrition rates reported in a meta-analysis of self-help 
CBT-I RCTs (Ho et al., 2020); we increased the target sample 
size to 285 to detect a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.2) for the 
score differences in each of the primary outcomes from baseline 
to post-intervention. 


Depression symptoms 
The Chinese version of Center 
for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to measure 
the severity of depressive symptoms during the past week. 
Cronbach’s α in this study across the assessments ranged from 
0.83 to 0.92. 
Insomnia severity 
The Chinese version of ISI (Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001) was 
used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms and the asso- 
ciated daytime impairment over the past 2 weeks. Cronbach’s α 
in this study ranged from 0.77 to 0.87. 
Sleep quality 
The Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; 
Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989) was used to 
measure sleep quality and disturbances during the past month. 
Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 0.46 to 0.68, which is rela- 
tively low but consistent with previous studies (α = 0.55, Chung & 
Tang, 2006; α = 0.66, Guo, Sun, Liu, & Wu, 2016; α = 0.71–0.72 
for insomniacs, Tsai et al., 2005). There are debates regarding 
the dimensionality of PSQI, which potentially explains the varia- 
tions in the scale’s internal consistency (Manzar et al., 2018). 






Subjective health 
The Chinese version of 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) 
Version 1 (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1995) was used to measure 
subjective physical and mental health status. 
Anxiety 
The Chinese version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale – 
Anxiety subscale (HADS; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was used to 
measure the severity of anxiety symptoms during the past week. 
Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 0.70 to 0.84. 

Treatment expectancy 
The 6-item Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (Devilly & 
Borkovec, 2000) was modified to measure expectancy toward 
the treatment. It has been validated in CBT for people with 
depression or insomnia. Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 
0.90 to 0.93. 
Acceptability of treatment 
The 26-item modified Participant Acceptability/Usability Rating 
Scale (Ben-Zeev et al., 2014) was used to evaluate the self-help 
treatment delivered via proACT-S. 
Demographic information 
Participants’ age, education level, marital status, gender, and 
occupation were obtained in the first stage of screening process. 
Clinical comorbidities 
Participants’ clinical comorbidities on generalized anxiety dis- 
order, panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder 
as defined in the ICD-10 were assessed in the second stage of 
screening by telephone interview. 
Adverse events 
Questions checking on any potential adverse events in the 
follow-up questionnaires. Participants were given the contact 
information (phone and SMS) of the trial team as well as referral 
information in case additional support was needed. 

An intention to treat analysis was conducted. Multilevel modeling 
was employed to evaluate the within-group and between-group 
effects, and to assess randomized conditions by time interaction. 
No imputation was performed as previous literature showed that 
multilevel modeling can handle high attrition without substan- 
tially reducing statistical power (Chakraborty & Gu, 2009). All 
analyses were conducted in R. The lme4 package was used to 
run the multilevel models. Time points were nested within parti- 
cipants and a random participant-level intercept was included in 
the model. Randomized group, time, and their two-way inter- 
action effect were included as fixed effects. Models were adjusted 
in demographic variables and 
for baseline differences, 
comorbidity. A p value of <0.05 and 95% confidence interval 
were employed for main effects and interactions. Model fit was 
evaluated by the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Post-hoc t tests 
were performed to examine the between and within-group score 
including the 
differences. Sensitivity analyses were performed, 


adjusted models with baseline differences in treatment expect- 
ancy, per-protocol analyses on those who accomplished a satisfac- 
tory number of modules, and a selection of subgroup on 
participants who were recruited during the COVID-19 as second- 
ary analyses to check the robustness of the results. Post-hoc sub- 
group analyses were also performed on whether having a 
comorbid anxiety disorder would modify the treatment effect. 


Participant recruitment started in March 2019 and closed in 
March 2020. The trial began in May 2019 and ended in August 
2020, after the expiration date for the last participant to complete 
the week 12 assessment. A total of 320 eligible participants (73% 
female; Mage = 27.3, S.D.age = 7.2) passed the two stages of screen- 
ing, completed the baseline assessment, and enrolled in the clin- 
ical trial. All participants completed high school, and 90% had 
attained some university education (Table 1). There were signifi- 
cant differences between the two groups in marital status (χ2 = 
6.33, p = 0.012) and gender distribution (χ2 = 9.93, p = 0.002); 
both variables were included in all analyses as covariates. There 
were no significant differences between the groups in education 
background, occupation, clinical comorbidities, and age. 
Among the eligible participants, 52% (n = 167, 65% female; 
Mage = 27.3, 
S.D.age = 7.3) were randomized to the treatment 
group and 48% (n = 153, 81% female; Mage = 27.3, S.D.age = 7.2) 
to the waitlist control group. 

No significant baseline differences were found between the groups 
on any outcome measures (Table 1). The intra-class correlations 
in the unconditional models ranged from 0.26 to 0.58, suggesting 
it was appropriate to conduct multilevel models for the outcome 
measures. Both the adjusted and unadjusted models gave compar- 
able results on the treatment effects, the results of the former are 
presented. Multilevel modeling results and the corresponding 
LRTs for both primary and secondary outcomes are presented 
in Tables 2 and 3. 

Depressive symptoms 
In the multilevel model predicting depression symptoms, fixed 
effects for gender, marital status, and treatment condition were 
not significant. The week 6 follow-up time point [B = −2.39, 
S.E. = 0.72, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.81 to −0.99)] and the week 12 
follow-up time point [B = −9.28, S.E. = 0.79, p < 0.001, 95% CI 
(−10.83 to −7.73)] showed significant negative associations with 
the 
depression symptoms. Consistent with our hypothesis, 
group by week 6 follow-up interaction showed significant associ- 
ation with depression symptoms B = −6.72, S.E. = 1.07, p < 0.001, 
95% CI (−8.82 to −4.62) (Fig. 2). Follow-up simple effect analysis 
indicated that the treatment effect was significant at week 6 
follow-up, B = −7.73, S.E. = 1.11, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−9.91 to 
−5.55). 
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was signifi- 
cant, in favor of the treatment group, t(188) = −6.44, p < 0.001, 
Cohen’s d = 0.86, 95% Cl (−10.11 to −5.37). In the within-group 
score comparison, the treatment group corresponded to a large

effect before v. immediately after the treatment, t(107) = 9.66, p < 
0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.93, 95% Cl (7.18–10.89). The control group 
corresponded to a small effect before v. after the 6-week wait 
time, t(137) = 4.64, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.40, 95% Cl (1.36– 
3.38) (Table 4). 

Insomnia 
In the multilevel model predicting insomnia severity, 
fixed 
effects for gender, marital status, and treatment condition were 
not significant. Both the week 6 follow-up time point [B = 
−1.58, S.E. = 0.44, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−2.44 to −0.71)] and week 
12 follow-up time point [B = −6.01, S.E. = 0.49, p < 0.001, 95% 
CI 
showed significant associations with 
insomnia severity. Consistent with our hypothesis, the treatment 
condition by week 6 follow-up interaction showed a significant 
association with insomnia severity, B = −4.28, S.E. = 0.66, p < 
0.001, 95% CI (−5.58 to −2.99) (Fig. 2). Follow-up simple effect 
analysis indicated that the treatment effect was significant at 
week 6 follow-up, B = −4.52, 
S.E. = 0.62, p < 0.001, 95% Cl 
(−5.74 to −3.30). 
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was signifi- 
cant, in favor of the treatment group, t(227) = −7.75, p < 0.001, 
Cohen’s d = 1.00, 95% Cl (−5.93 to −3.53). Both the treatment 
[t(101) = 10.41, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.03, 95% Cl (4.40–6.47)] 
and control [t(137) = 4.49, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.38, 95% Cl 
(0.91–2.35)] groups showed a significant drop in the insomnia 
severity at the week 6 follow-up; the control group corresponded 
to a small effect size in the change, while the treatment group 
yielded a large effect size in the reduction of insomnia (Table 4). 
Sleep quality 
In the multilevel model predicting sleep quality, fixed effects for 
gender, marital status, and treatment condition were not signifi- 
cant; while the week 6 follow-up [B = −0.74, S.E. = 0.29, p = 
0.011, 95% CI (−1.31 to −0.17)] and the week 12 follow-up [B 
= −2.80, S.E. = 0.32, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.42 to −2.17)] showed 
significant associations with sleep quality. The treatment condi- 
tion by week 6 follow-up interaction yielded a significant associ- 
ation on sleep quality, B = −2.71, S.E. = 0.43, p < 0.001, 95% CI 
(−3.56 to −1.87). Follow-up simple effect analysis showed that 
the treatment effect was significant at week 6 follow-up, B = 
−2.42, S.E. = 0.40, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−3.21 to −1.63) (Fig. 2). 
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was signifi- 
cant, in favor of the treatment group, t(206) = −6.74, p < 0.001, 
Cohen’s d = 0.91, 95% Cl (−3.34 to −1.83). In the within-group 
comparison, the treatment group showed a large difference before 
and after the treatment, t(87) = 8.68, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.93, 
95% Cl (2.42–3.85). The change in the control group corre- 
sponded to a small effect size, t(116) = 2.41, p = 0.018, Cohen’s 
d = 0.22, 95% Cl (0.10–1.04) (Table 4). 

Anxiety symptoms 
In the multilevel model predicting anxiety severity, fixed effects 
for gender, marital status, treatment condition, and the week 6 
follow-up time point were not significant. The week 12 follow-up 
time point showed a significant association with anxiety symp- 
toms, B = −2.25, S.E. = 0.32, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−2.88 to −1.63). 










































































































































































































































































































Note. Male was the reference group for gender. Marital status was a binary variable, i.e. married v. not; single/no longer in marriage was the reference group. Treatment condition referred to 
the randomized group the participants were assigned to; waitlist control group was the reference group. 


Treatment condition by week 6 follow-up interaction yielded a 
significant association with anxiety symptoms, B = −2.77, S.E. = 
0.43, p < 0.001, 95% CI (−3.62 to −1.92). Follow-up simple effect 
analysis found that the treatment effect was significant at week 6 
follow-up, B = −2.94, S.E. = 0.41, p < 0.001, 95% Cl (−3.74 to 
−2.13) (Fig. 2). 
Between-group comparison at week 6 follow-up was signifi- 
cant, in favor of the treatment group, t(209) = −6.30, p < 0.001, 
Cohen’s d = 0.83, 95% Cl (−3.75 to −1.96). In the within-group 
comparison, the treatment group showed medium-to-large differ- 
ence before and after the treatment, 
t(107) = 6.69, p < 0.001, 
Cohen’s d = 0.64, 95% Cl (1.71–3.16), while the control group 
showed no significant change (Table 4). 
Subjective health 
In the multilevel model predicting subjective physical health, fixed 
effects for gender, marital status, treatment condition, and the time 
points were not significant. Neither treatment group-by-time inter- 
action terms were significant (all ps > 0.05; Fig. 2). Post-hoc t tests 
the 
found no between and within-group differences across 
follow-up time points on subjective physical health. Results on 
subjective mental health are consistent with the findings on other 
mental health measures 
reported above (see Supplementary 
material). 

Depression 
Adopting a cut-off score at 20 or above (Vilagut, Forero, 
Barbaglia, & Alonso, 2016), the percentage of participants in 
the treatment group scoring above the clinical threshold following 
the intervention decreased from 98% at baseline to 81% at the 
week 6 follow-up. The control group had a 1% decrease, from 
99% at baseline to 98% at the week 6 follow-up. At the week 12 
follow-up, the percentage in the treatment group scoring above 
the threshold sustained at 81% and the percentage in the control 
group reduced to 79% (Table 5). 
Insomnia 
With a cut-off score at 11 or above (Morin, Belleville, Bélanger, & 
Ivers, 2011), the percentage of participants in the treatment group 
meeting the clinical threshold decreased from 96% to 61% at the

week 6 follow-up, while the control group found a decrease from 
96% to 88%. At the week 12 follow-up, participants scoring above 
the threshold dropped from 61% to 52%. The control group saw a 
drop to 60% at the week 12 follow-up, after the given treatment 
(Table 5). We reported the results using 8 (i.e. in remission) as 
the cut-off score in online Supplementary Table S3. 
Sleep quality 
Using the cut-off score at above five (Buysse et al., 1989), the per- 
centage of participants in the treatment group scoring above the 
poor sleep quality threshold decreased from 100% to 87%. The 
waitlist control group had a 1% decrease, from 100% at baseline 
to 99% at the week 6 follow-up. At the week 12 follow-up, the 
treatment group showed the maintenance of treatment effect 
with 87% scoring above the threshold. Among the control 
group, 84% scored above the threshold (Table 5). 
Anxiety 
Using the cut-off scores of 11–15 and 16–21 for moderate and 
severe anxiety symptoms, 
respectively (Snaith & Zigmond, 
1994), the percentages of participants in the treatment group 
scoring above the clinical thresholds dropped from 61% at base- 
line to 32% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and from 11% at 
baseline to 5% for severe anxiety symptoms, at the week 6 follow 
up. The control group saw no improvement in the percentages of 
participants scoring above the threshold; those with moderate 
anxiety symptoms increased from 55% at baseline to 57% at the 
week 6 follow-up, and those with severe anxiety symptoms 
remained at 15% in both assessments. At the week 12 follow-up, 
the clinical threshold percentages in the treatment group showed 
the maintenance of the treatment effect, where 31% had moderate 
anxiety symptoms and 5% had severe anxiety symptoms. The 
waitlist control group showed a reduction in anxiety severity 
after the given treatment, where the percentages of participants 
with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms dropped from 57% 
at the week 6 follow-up to 37% at the week 12 follow-up and 
from 15% at the week 6 follow-up to 4% at the week 12 follow-up, 
respectively (Table 5). 

Dropout varied from 1.2% to 37.7% at different time points 
(Fig. 1). The total dropout for the treatment and waitlist control 
groups was 37.7% and 26.8%, respectively. 

Over half of the participants found proACT-S easy to use. Nearly 
90% of the participants found proACT-S clear and easy to under- 
stand. Over 60% of the participants were satisfied with the experi- 
ence using proACT-S and nearly 70% would like to continue to 
use proACT-S if it was available. Half of the participants found 
it helpful in managing their symptoms. Taking a more conserva- 
tive view, if we included all dropout participants as perceiving a 
negative view toward proACT-S, the perception of ‘ease of use’ 
was 50% or above. By-item ratings are reported in online 
Supplementary Table S4.

First, to test whether treatment expectancy affected the primary 
outcomes of the study, adjusted models with the inclusion of 
treatment expectancy as a covariate were conducted. The results 
were similar to those reported above (online Supplementary

which the reported multilevel models were conducted with a sub- 
sample that excluded those who did not complete at least five of 
the six treatment modules. The per-protocol analyses gave identi- 
cal significant results (online Supplementary Table S6). Third, a

included in another set of multilevel model analyses to check the

ing comorbid anxiety disorder found a similar significant inter- 
action effect between treatment conditions and time. In the 
model of anxiety severity, having an anxiety disorder was not a

treatment 
factor 
Table S8). Baseline severity of depression and insomnia were 
included along with other baseline characteristics in simple 
regression analyses to observe the impacts on the maintenance 
of treatment effects. The initial treatment expectation on depres- 
sion alleviation, gender, or having comorbid anxiety disorder 
could likely be a factor impacting the maintenance of the treat- 
ment effects (online Supplementary Table S9). 




No adverse events, increased suicidal risk, nor significant deteri- 
oration in primary outcome measures was reported throughout 
the study. 

This RCT demonstrated the efficacy of a 6-week, non-assisted, 
self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in adults with both depression 
and insomnia. The effect was sustained at 6 weeks post- 
intervention. The treatment group demonstrated greater reduc- 
tions in depressive, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms, as well as 
greater improvements in sleep quality at follow-up compared to 
the waitlist control group. A higher proportion of participants 
in the treatment group no longer met clinical cut-offs for depres- 
sion, insomnia, and anxiety at post-treatment compared to the 
control group. Sensitivity analysis revealed that participants with 
and without anxiety reported similar treatment effects at week 6 
and week 12 follow-ups. Similar improvements were seen in the 
control group after they were given the treatment. 
This study added to the literature to show that smartphone- 
based self-help CBT-I can be efficacious in treating depression 
and that the treatment effect can be sustained to at least 6 
weeks after the end of treatment. The effect size in improvement 
in depression was large and comparable to the previous results of 
CBT-I (Feng et al., 2020). While several studies have examined the 
fully automated iCBT-I on depressive symptoms 
efficacy of 
(Christensen et al., 2016; Glozier et al., 2019), ours is one of the 
first to test a fully automated smartphone app CBT-I on those 
with comorbid depression and insomnia. 
the 
The results should be interpreted in the context of 
strengths and limitations of unguided self-help treatments, 
which, according to a network meta-analysis of the effect of 
CBT-D, is more efficacious than waitlist but less so than treatment 
modalities that have some input from a therapist (Cuijpers, 
Noma, Karyotaki, Cipriani, & Furukawa, 2019). The low-intensity 
nature of the treatment allows unguided self-help treatments to be 
readily disseminated, but, as our remission rate and adherence 
results suggest, it is far from being universally effective or helpful. 
As those suffering from depression would likely benefit from at 
least some forms of interactions with professionals (Newman, 
Szkodny, Llera, & Przeworski, 2011), we speculate that, 
if 
resources permit, augmenting the current treatment with therapist 
support would further improve outcomes. 
Not surprisingly, post-treatment improvements in sleep symp- 
toms were observed. The effect sizes of the improvement in 

insomnia and sleep quality are similar to those reported in previ- 
ous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Horsch et al., 2017). In our treat- 
ment, sleep restriction was introduced at week 4, which is late 
than other iCBT-Is that reported the sequence of treatment com- 
ponents (Krieger et al., 2019; van der Zweerde, van Straten, 
Effting, Kyle, & Lancee, 2019). The effects of sleep restriction 
on sleep parameters would likely be more pronounced with 
time, especially if the recommendations are followed through. 
The adjusted sleep time would be reduced during sleep restriction, 
which explains the observed improvement in sleep efficiency at 
the follow-up assessments (reported in online Supplementary 
Table S10). 
The findings of our secondary outcomes were largely consist- 
ent with previous studies of iCBT-I for anxiety (Ye et al., 2015). 
Our results suggest CBT-I can also help alleviate anxiety symp- 
toms among those with depression and insomnia. Half of the par- 
ticipants’ anxiety symptoms had reduced to mild to normal levels 
after the treatment and this improvement was sustained at the 
week 12 follow-up. The cognitive restructuring elements in our 
self-help treatment might have acted as an aid to alleviate anxiety 
symptoms, and hence helped to improve sleep. Further studies are 
needed to elucidate the relationship between anxiety symptoms 
and sleep improvement in self-help treatments. 
Our participants saw improvement in subjective mental health 
but not physical health at the end of the 6-week intervention. The 
low-intensity treatment might not be sufficiently robust to bring 
changes in subjective physical health. This is consistent with pre- 
vious RCTs reporting that CBT-I failed to demonstrate significant 
between-group improvement in physical health during the study 
period (Chakravorty et al., 2019; Espie et al., 2019; Siebmanns 
et al., 2021; Vedaa et al., 2020). However, better sleep is generally 
associated with better daytime functioning and subjective well- 
being (Chan, Poon, Leung, Lau, & Lau, 2018; Weinberg, Noble, 
& Hammond, 2016). It is plausible that if the participants contin- 
ued to see improvements in their sleep and mental health, their 
subjective physical health may enhance. 
The improvement in anxiety and subjective mental health is 
particularly noteworthy at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The overall acceptability and receptiveness of proACT-S were 
positive. These figures are similar to previous smartphone-based 
studies (Rost et al., 2017). 
Taken together, proACT-S demonstrated efficacy in reducing 
depressive and insomnia symptoms without any human input. 
Balancing the need to reduce cost and to improve retention as 
well as to boost the treatment effect, future advancement of simi- 
lar self-help treatments might consider including simple and 
automated means of providing users with reminders, feedback, 
and encouragement, such as using in-app notifications. 

In many countries, the mental health burden overwhelms existing 
healthcare services. COVID-19 further widened the gap between 
the demand and supply of mental health services (Campion 
et al., 2020). Efficacious psychological treatments are available, 
but their accessibility is restricted by their resource-demanding 
nature, unaffordability, preference for self-reliance and alternative 
forms of support, and stigma toward mental health issues (Chung, 
Tse, Lee, Wong, & Chan, 2019; Corrigan et al., 2014; Hospital 
Authority, 2019; Shi et al., 2020). Furthermore, Kazlauskas, 
Eimontas, Olff, Zelviene, and Andersson (2020) indicated that 
populations with relatively high stigma toward mental health 


tend to have higher adherence to self-help intervention and 
receive greater benefits from low-intensity and highly accessible 
treatments, such as Internet-based ones. Considering the relative 
imbalance between the demand and supply of mental health ser- 
vices, 
the relatively high degree of mental health stigma in 
Chinese communities, and the preference for self-reliant (Shi 
et al., 2020), proACT-S and other app-based self-help treatments 
might be able to help overcome some of the cultural barriers to 
access mental healthcare among Chinese-speakers. The study 
adds to the literature to demonstrate the efficacy of an app in 
Chinese, which can potentially provide support to a large group 
of patients. 
proACT-S, like other CBT-I treatments, focuses on sleep but its 
efficacy was observable in depressive and anxiety symptoms. The 
bidirectionality of impact between sleep and mental health, espe- 
cially the fact that sleep disturbance predisposes individuals to 
common mental disorders (Franzen & Buysse, 2008; Riemann, 
2007; Vargas & Perlis, 2020), suggests that sleep-related interven- 
tion may be one of the means to promote psychological well- 
being. The sequence of improvement in depressive symptoms in 
response to transdiagnostic approaches such as sleep intervention 
is under ongoing investigation. There is evidence to suggest that 
sleep improvement established through CBT-I has a positive 
effect on the overall severity of depression (Cunningham & 
Shapiro, 2018). CBT is also believed to facilitate changes in infor- 
mation processing to ameliorate vegetative and cognitive symp- 
toms of depression that, 
in turn, would contribute to the 
improvement of other depressive symptoms (Bhar et al., 2008). 
An RCT examining the efficacy of guided online CBT-I on 
depression reported promising effects on reducing preservative 
thinking (van der Zweerde et al., 2019), further suggesting the 
underlying mechanism of the influence of improved sleep. The 
specific contributions of different sleep outcomes impacting day- 
time functioning and particular depressive symptoms warrant 
further investigation (Wong et al., 2013). 

Our study adds to the growing call for using sleep interven- 
tions, such as CBT-I, as a first-line treatment for common mental 
disorders (Blom et al., 2017; Hagatun et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2014; 
Thorndike 
et al., 2019). 
Smartphone-based treatments have lower barriers even compared 
with Internet-based treatments (Wilhelm et al., 2020). Our results 
suggest that proACT-S is not only efficacious but also well- 
received by some of its users. Rather than replacing the profes- 
sional mental health services, proACT-S can be considered in con- 
junction with intensive treatment delivery by mental health 
professionals. It can, for example, be incorporated into a stepped 
care service delivery model as an early step in the treatment of 
common mental health problems (Ho et al., 2016). 

The current study has several limitations. First, the study partici- 
pants were mostly young and well-educated. The findings have 
limited generalizability to the older and less educated population. 
To increasing the usability of proACT-S to those who are older or 
less-educated, further refinement of the app can be done, for 
example, by simplifying the contents and consider user feedback 
to further enhance the user experience. 
Second, the study did not include a sleep diary as an outcome 
measure. Sleep diary could provide more precise and less 
memory-dependent sleep data than self-reported questionnaires 
(Ibáñez, Silva, & Cauli, 2018). 
Third, beyond the baseline assessment stage, our study relied 
on self-report measures. Future research could include actigraphy 
or polysomnography for observing the changes in objective sleep 
parameters (Ibáñez et al., 2018) and conduct a follow-up clinical 
interview. 
Fourth, the efficacy of the treatment was compared against a 
waitlist control group, as opposed to an active control group. 
Treatment studies with active control groups tend to show more 
modest effect sizes (e.g. Firth et al., 2017a, b). The use of a waitlist 
or no treatment condition as the control group is common in 
RCTs of self-help CBT-I (Ho et al., 2020). Future studies may 
include an inactive treatment, such as the monitoring of sleep 
using a sleep diary, in the control condition to enhance the valid- 
ity of the evidence. 
Fifth, while the treatment gains remained apparent at 6 weeks 
post-treatment, the lack of a longer-term follow-up limited our 
confidence in whether the treatment effect would sustain over 
time. van der Zweerde et al. (2019) reported that the positive 
effect of guided online CBT-I on depressive symptoms was main- 
tained at a 6-month follow-up. Similarly, a study reported that 
participants continued to see treatment gain from iCBT-I on 
reduced depressive symptoms at 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year 
follow-up (Blom et al., 2017). Further work is needed to see 
proACT-S can also stand the test of time. 
Last, this study had a high attrition rate; the figures are not 
incomparable with those 
reported in previous RCTs of 
smartphone-based intervention (mean attrition of 24.1% at short- 
term follow-up, Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020; mean attri- 
tion = 47.8% adjusted for publication bias, Torous, Lipschitz, Ng, 
& Firth, 2020). Several factors were identified to associate with a 
lower dropout rate in clinical trials of smartphone-based interven- 
tion, including integrating mood monitoring, providing monetary 
incentives, use of online enrollment, and provide human feed- 
back/practice reminders (Torous et al., 2020). In the current 
study, we included a monetary incentive to attract and retain par- 
ticipants; this may hinder the generalizability of the findings as 
the incentive may have had an impact on adherence to the treat- 
ment and completion of outcome assessment. 

This two-arm RCT study demonstrates the efficacy of proACT-S, 
an unguided smartphone-based CBT-I for depression. The trans- 
diagnostic approach of sleep intervention for depression can help 
tackle the existing structural and cultural barriers of mental health 
needs. Because of its low cost, high accessibility, and minimal 
therapist involvement, we recommend considering a smartphone- 
based CBT-I such as proACT-S as a first-step intervention that can 
be disseminated at the community level to enhance the coverage 
of mental health services.
