            "criteria": "In the first filtering step, we read the titles and abstracts of the 4682 articles and determined whether they (1) presented an empirical study, (2) were written in English, (3) were published in a peer-reviewed journal (or were a thesis or dissertation), and (4) specifically examined screen time and ASD (as multiple studies were conducted among ASD populations but addressed other negative outcomes, such as sleep problems). In the second filtering step, we read the remaining articles thoroughly and excluded those that did not meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria. In the second step, we also excluded studies that (1) did not report any statistics or reported a single case study, (2) presented a literature review and did not include an empirical study, and (3) had no comparison group, provided that they had a group of participants with ASD (studies without a comparison group were only included if they measured ASD symptoms). Research quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.20",
