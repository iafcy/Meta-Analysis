**SUMMARY**

**Objective:** Aim of this study was to explore the screen
characteristics of children who have been newly diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and context
of initial concerns of parents at the time of the first diagnosis. Method: Fifty-seven ASD and 63 typically developing children were included. Data retrieved from families such as concerns at the time of referal and characteristics that comprised use of electronics were recorded.
The Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Behavior
Checklist was administered by the clinician to evaluate
the symptom severity of ASD. Furthermore, the Ankara
Development and Screening Inventory were applied to
the children to evaluate the general developmental level.
**Results: ASD was generally diagnosed around 36th**
month and parents of these children were found to have
suspected of something going wrong regarding developmental characteristics of their children approximately
14 months prior formal diagnosis. Age at index use of
electronics was smaller and screen time was higher in
children with ASD. It has also been found that families
most frequently were referred to the clinician due to
problems in communication. **Discussion:** Our findings
suggest children with ASD might be more prone to problematic use of electronics. Smaller index age for initiating
use of electronic devices might predominantly affect
socioemotional processes negatively. The clinicians
should evaluate screen characteristics in these children.
Lastly, It is important to encourage parents to report
concerns to clinicians for early detection of ASD.

**INTRODUCTION**

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in the early developmental period of life and characterized by
deficits in social communication and interaction,
along with limited, repetitive behavior or interests
(1). The disorder predominantly presenting in male
gender by four times (2) and affecting one in every
59 children (3). It is now largely believed that ASD
manifests itself based on coexisting genetic and
environmental factors of vulnerability.

Nowadays, screen based electronic devices have
progressively become an integral part in the daily
life and age at onset of screen use tends to decrease
gradually. Therefore, children and adolescents
spend considerable amounts of their time, using
electronic devices, social media, and playing video
games. In this context, interest in the electronic use
of children diagnosed with ASD has also increased.
Even electronics devices may be useful in learning
context, excessice exposure to screen may have
adverse effect on children (4). Direct exposure to
screen impact development of behavior (5), language (6), cognition (7) and attention (8) in children. These influences could be severe in children
with ASD who have already difficulties in communication and social process (1).

Many children diagnosed with ASD spend significant amounts of their time in activities related to
the video games and that involve screen use (9,10).
Parents have also indicated that these children
have prolonged screen use, which also includes
playing games, compared to time spent for other
leisure time activities (10). Parents of boys with
ASD reported that their sons spent more time playing video games per day (on average 2.1 h/day)
than typically developing boys (on average
1.2h/day) did (11). Individuals with ASD may be
particularly prone to problematic electronic use,
and studies have also shown that problematic electronic use is associated with social, behavioral, and
academic challenges (12). In additon, higher screen
time may results diminished parent-child interaction which is very important for cognitive and language development in the early period of life.
Hermawati et al. showed that more than half of


children (66.6%) had no parents-child interaction
during the screen exposure. Increased screen usage
has also possible impact on spending less time in
dailiy activities which may better advance in emotional-behavioral areas for children with ASD (13).
Moreover, parents of children who have emotional
and behavioral difficulties may use screen device as
a calming tool when their children are upset (14).
This may be one of the maintaining factor for difficulties with emotional/behavioral regulation in
children with ASD who have already prone to
develop behavioral-emotional problems (14).
Therefore, it is important to know the nature and
effect of using electronic devices in children with
ASD, in order to develop intervention strategies
towards relevant emerging behavioral and emotional problems.

Our current knowledge shows that the most effective treatment of this disorder is the behavior-based
intervention programs (15,16). Therefore, early
detection of autism is crucial to provide early intervention. Increasing knowledge and awareness of
parents, teachers, and physicans on autism in
recent years, and the well- known notion that early
treatment bearing better outcome might have contributed to the increase in early diagnosis of autism
(17). However, the age at diagnosis has not
decreased uniformly for all children, and the studies have shown that sex, ethnicity, access to health
care, and symptom severity were factors found to
be associated with age at diagnosis (18,19).
Although early diagnosis has not been maintained
for most cases, parents might suspect possible
developmental differences of their children
throughout infancy and early childhood. It has
been shown that 76.2% of parents were concerned
about their children's developmental process,
before the age of 3 (20). De Giacorno and
Fombonne reported that mean age of children with
ASD, when their parents first had suspicions
regarding their children’s development was 19
months, and mean age of the child when they
sought help for the first time was 24 months (21).
In another study, it was reported that mean age of
children when parents had their initial concerns
was 1.5 years for children diagnosed with Asperger
Disorder, and help was sought approximately at the
age of 3.5 years, and the children were diagnosed at
11 years (22). Findings indicate that parents report

significantly earlier and more concerns about their
child's, compared to parents of children with other
developmental disabilities (23-25). In addition to
these, it would also be important to identify what
types of early-on concerns were the most common
ones among parents of children with ASD. Howlin
and Moore showed, majority of parents stated that
their first concerns were about language delay, followed by social abnormalities, and behavioral problems (26).

In summary, previous findings have provided the
importance of early detection and problematic
electronics using in children with ASD. In the present study, we aimed to explore screen use characteristics, age at diagnosis, time and type of initial
parental concerns of children with ASD, and to
compare these variables with those of typically
developing peers. Based on previous research, we
hypothesized that individuals with ASD would
begin using electronics at an earlier age, have prolonged times of electronics use. We have also
hypothesized that parents of these children would
be more likely to report negatively impacts of electronic use on their children's life, compared to parents of typically developing children.

**METHOD**

**Participants and Procedure**

A total of 57 children with ASD (47 boys, 10 girls)
who were diagnosed for the first time and 63 typically developing (TD) were included in this crosssectional study between January 2020 and March
2020. Children with ASD were selected from pediatric psychiatry outpatient clinic and diagnosed by
an experienced child and adolescent psychiatrist,
based on DSM 5 diagnostic criteria, and diagnostic
confirmation was made by another child psychiatrist, who was experienced in the relevant field. The
typically developing children were selected from
pediatric outpatient unit who had no history of
physical or developmental disabilities. In determining process, one family rejected to participate to
the study owing to child’s agitation during the interview.

Written consents were obtained from all families


Screen time characteristics and early-term parental concerns
of children newly diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder

who had agreed to participate in the study. The
information obtained from families such as
parental concerns and screen use characteristics
were recorded to the checklist by physcian during
the interwiev. Parents were asked to report the
screen characteristics of children for the last
month. Questions about screen characteristics and
early concerns were asked by physican to the parents according and recorded. In the form, frequency of screen using were coded as “less than one
hour”, “1-2 hour”, “2-4 hour” and “more than 4
hours” a day. Parents were also asked about the initial time for using electronics and whether the
usage of screen affected their children. According
to the answers related to affected areas, we classified the answers into the following groups: communication, social/emotional, behavioral problems
and hyperactivity. Childhood Autism Rating Scale
(CARS) and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC)
were administered by the clinician, to evaluate
autism-related symptom severity of children with
ASD. Furthermore, Ankara Development and
Screening Inventory (ADSI) was applied to all children, in order to determine their development levels. Ethical approval was granted by the local ethics
committee of the Eskisehir Osmangazi University
(date: 07/01/2020, number:2019-417).


_Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS): CARS is a_
scale consisting of 15 items that was developed to
rate autism severity (27). The scale is mainly used
in the assessment of children with autism and in
differentiating the disorder from other developmental disorders. Turkish validity and reliability
studies of the scale have been performed, and cutoff score was found to be 30 in (28).

_Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC): ABC is a scale_
consisting of 57 items that describe symptoms associated with autism as well as more general behavior
problems often seen in children with autism (29).
Scores of the scale range from 0 to 159 points (the
higher the score, the more severe symptoms). The
Turkish validity and reliability of scale was performed (30).

Screen time characteristics and early-term parental concerns
of children newly diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder


Competible with our finding it was shown that living with parents who have less education was associated with more screen time in ASD children (36).
Another important aspect of the present study is
possible difficulties in parent-child interaction in
the early period of life. Due to the nature of disorder, parents may are unsure of how to connect with
their infants and toddler, therefore they may let
their children to use screen as a copy mechanism.
In our study, children with ASD mostly use electronics devices alone. This is also diminished the
quality of relationship with ASD children and
decrease the duraion of caregiver-child reciprocal
interaction. Therefore, it should be kept in mind
that the negative impact of screen use, especially in
children with ASD might be overlooked by their
families. Our findings suggest that children with
ASD might be more prone to problematic electronics use, because of their individual characteristics
and nature of disorder. Because, as we know
restricted interests and repetitive behaviors may
increase the risk for problematic screen usage.
Additionally, deficits in impulse control and
response inhibition in ASD (37), might contribute
to the predisposition these children for developing
problematic electronics use. All aside, probably the
most important point is overly- prolonged screen
time exposure might further impair these childrens'
interaction within social contexts and experiences
with their peers. In line with the aforementioned
statement, parents in our study have also reported
use of electronics had the most negative impact on
socio-emotional areas. Problematic internet and
video game use have also shown to be associated
with inattention and impulsivity (38). In one study,
a relationship was reported between online gaming
and oppositional behavior, among children with
ASD (11). In general, evidence suggest that problematic electronics use is associated with social,
behavioral, and academic difficulties (12). This
would mean that the risk has increased a little more
for those who were already prone to develop
behavioral and emotional problems, due to the
nature of the disorder. Moreover, excessive use of
electronics might also affect families who would be
already under stress because of the challenging
nature of the disorder, much more negatively.
Therefore, families and clinicians need to be aware
of their children's use of electronics and inititate
and employ required interventions, without allow

Early identification of ASD has become more
important with increasing evidence that demonstrates positive outcomes of early behavioral interventions in afflicted children (39). Early recognition of atypical developmental features by parents
has also been found to associate with early diagnosis of autism (20,40). In our study, we found that
mean age of the children at the time of first
parental concerns about their children's development had emerged, was 21.5 months. In previous
studies that explored the same context, discrepant
results were found, such as 19, 15 and 14 months,
respectively (21, 41, 42). Increasing awareness of
parents regarding their children's development,
might possibly account for the earlier ages at when
the disorder would be suspected of. The age of the
children at the time of first parental concern in our
study seems a little bit higher, compared to the
results reported by previous studies. We think this
difference might be associated with lower levels of
maternal education in our ASD group. Such interpretation might have grounds, as supported by the
study that reported increased awareness of mothers on children's development, as education level
increased (43). Additionally, cultural differences
may impact the perception of symptoms of ASD
and parents' concerns may vary according to culture (44). Even there is no study investigating the
cultural differences in Turkish population, this differences may be also a factor that caused a little
elongation of the time for parental first concerns.
Turkish parents may not sufficiently aware about
the early developmental steps of their children and
this finding emphasizes the important of increasing
autism awareness once again.

It was reported that within the early developmental
period, communication impairments and language
delay were the most commonly reported initial
parental concerns of children with ASD (21,23,41).
These aforementioned concerns were followed by
impairments in social skills (41, 45). In the present
study, initial concerns of parents to children with
ASD were communication problems and social
impairments; and they most frequently were
referred to the clinician due to problems in communication, especially speech delay. Consistent
with the results of previous studies, we have found

our results related to high frequency of screen time
in ASD children. Future researches is essential in
order to inform the parents how to use of electronic
devices properly to possible improvements on functional outcomes in children with ASD.

**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, we have found that children with
ASD were diagnosed when they were at approximately 36 months old, parental concerns about
their children's developmental steps emerged 14
months prior to formal diagnosis, children with
ASD had more electronics use than their healthy
peers, even before they were formally diagnosed
with the disorder, they had met electronic devices
at an earlier age, and their parents reported electronics use had specifically had a negative impact
on the social-emotional area. In addition, children
with ASD may be at higher risk of exceeding the
AAP total screen recommendation. It was considered that electronics use starting at such an early
age posed a risk for children with ASD. Further
studies are required for families and clinicians to
develop strategies for coping with this problem.
The results of the present study highlight the clinical importance of examining electronics using pattern and need for increased awareness of problematic electronics use for individuals with ASD. In
addition, subsequent researches should also focus
on identifying factors that affect age of children at
the time first parental concerns emerged, and
improved techniques and methods to adopt, for
earlier detection of the disorder. Further experimental and longitudinal researches may help to
improve our knowledge about etiology, early detection and effect of electronic in ASD.
