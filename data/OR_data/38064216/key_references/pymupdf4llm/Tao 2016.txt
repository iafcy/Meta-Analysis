**Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the**
relationships between screen time (ST), nighttime sleep
duration, and behavioural problems in a sample of preschool children in China. A sample of 8900 children aged
3–6 years was enrolled from 35 kindergartens, in four
cities, in two provinces, in China to evaluate the relationships between ST, nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems. Children’s ST and nighttime sleep duration were assessed by questionnaires completed by parents
or guardians. Behavioural problems were assessed using
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and
the Clancy Autism Behaviour Scale (CABS). Multivariate
analysis was used to assess the associations between ST,
nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems. The
total SDQ and CABS scores were higher in children with
ST 2 h/day and sleep duration <9.15 h/day (a P < 0.001

for all). After adjusting for potential confounders, children with ST 2 h/day had a significantly increased risk

of having total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct
problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial problems, as well as behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum
disorder. Similar results were found in children with sleep
duration <9.15 h/day. No significantly increased risk of
emotional symptoms was observed for short sleep duration.
Preschool children with more ST and short nighttime sleep

### Introduction

A growing body of evidence suggests that excessive sedentary behaviour begins at a very young age, particularly
for screen-based sedentary behaviours [1]. However, a
previous study found that most parents believed that their
young child did not have excessive screen time (ST) [2].
There is a growing body of evidence which demonstrated
that the negative health effects of ST include behavioural
and emotional problems in children [3–5], as well as negative health outcomes in adults [6]. Another important health
issue, which should be noted in relation to ST, is adequate
sleep among children [7]. ST exposure, such as TV viewing
and computer use, was associated with shorter sleep duration in a previous study [8]. Children who had insufficient
sleep were significantly more likely to have had sleep and
behavioural problems [9], and these associations appeared
to be bidirectional in longitudinal research [10].
Behavioural problems in children are quite common
worldwide [11], and persist until at least late childhood,
imposing substantial burdens on children and parents [12].
To date, a small but emerging number of studies found
that ST and sleep duration were risk factors for behavioural problems among young children [13–15]. Therefore,
early detection of such problems in children is important.
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a

## 1 3

validated tool for the identification of psychosocial problems in preschool-aged children [16]. Although ST and
sleep duration both affect children’s behaviours and emotions, there is a limited amount of research on the effects
of ST and sleep duration on behavioural problems using
the most common screening instruments, such as the SDQ.
Moreover, little is known about the associations between
ST and sleep duration and behaviours relating to autism
spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies have reported
that the mainly leisure time for ASD children is ST [17].
This is important because behavioural problems are common in young children with ASD [18].
The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the
relationships between ST and nighttime sleep duration and
behavioural problems in a representative cross-sectional
sample of children aged 3–6 years old. Behavioural problems were assessed using the SDQ and the CABS. We
hypothesized that preschool children who had more ST and
slept less were more likely to have had behavioural problems compared with those who had less ST and slept more.

### Method

**Study design**

This cross-sectional study was conducted in Anhui and
Jiangsu Provinces, located in east China, between March
and June 2015. Four cities, Tongling, Anqing, Wuhu, and
Yangzhou, were randomly selected in two provinces. Children aged 3–6 years, from 35 kindergartens, were enrolled
in the study. Questionnaires were distributed by maternal
and child health care professionals. The parents or guardians of each child completed a structured questionnaire,
which included the SDQ and CABS. A total of 9103 children were identified to take part in the survey. Questionnaires which were missing too much information were
excluded from the analysis. Complete or almost complete questionnaires were returned from 8900 children.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Anhui Medical University. Informed consent was obtained
from all the parents or guardians who completed the
questionnaires.

**Exposure variables**

_Screen time_

The parents or guardians reported their children’s ST
using the following question: “How many hours per day
does your child usually (a) spend watching TV; (b) spend
using a computer to play games (other than homework); (c)
spend using a cell phone; (d) spend using iPad and other

## 1 3


electronic devices; at weekdays and weekend days, respectively?” Total weekly ST was the sum of TV time, computer time, cell phone time, and iPad and other electronic
device time during weekdays and weekends. Average daily
ST was calculated (5/7 [ST on weekdays] 2/7 [ST
× + ×
during the weekend]). ST was categorized as low (<2 h/
day) or high ( 2 h/day), according to the recommendation
≥
of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

_Nighttime sleep duration_

Nighttime sleep duration was assessed with the following two questions with two parts each: (1) “During the
past month, when have your child usually gone to bed on
a weeknight?”; “During the past month, when have your
child usually gotten up on a weekday?”; and “During the
past month, how long has it usually take your child to fall
asleep on a weeknight?”. (2) “During the past month, when
have your child usually gone to bed during the weekend
night?”; “During the past month, when have your child usually gotten up during the weekend day?”; and “During the
past month, how long has it usually take your child to fall
asleep during the weekend night?”. These questions were
used to create the duration of nighttime sleep on weekdays
and weekends, separately. Sleep duration was calculated
by (hours in bed–hour taking to fall asleep). Average daily
duration of nighttime sleep was calculated (5/7 [night×
time sleep duration on weekdays] 2/7 [duration of
+ ×
nighttime sleep on weekend days]). Duration of nighttime
sleep was categorized as short (<sample mean) or long
( sample mean), using the mean of the average nightly
≥
duration of sleep for the whole sample (9.15 h/day).

**Outcome variables**

_The strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ)_

Parents or guardians completed the SDQ, a screening
instrument with 25 items relating to strengths and difficulties and eight items relating to the severity and the impact
of problems. The SDQ-P contained five subscales: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviour.
Parents or guardians rated items as 0, 1, or 2 for “not true”,
“somewhat true”, and “certainly true”, respectively. The
total difficulties score (range 0–40) was obtained by summing the scores of the emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer relationship problems. Higher scores are indicating more serious problems,
except for the “prosocial behaviour” subscale, for which
higher scores indicated more positive behaviours. Each
subscale and the total difficulties score were dichotomized
into healthy (normal category) or at-risk (borderline and


-----

abnormal categories) group [13]. Previous research demonstrated that the internal consistency for the total difficulties
score was good (Cronbach’α, 0.78) [16].

_The Clancy Autism Behaviour Scale (CABS)_

The CABS was assessed by parents or guardians to identify children’s behavioural symptoms relating to ASD. This
scale was first reported in 1969 [19] and was widely used
in mainland China [20]. The CABS contained 14 items that
were scored on a three point scale from 0 to 2 for “Never”,
“Occasionally”, and “Often”, respectively. The total score
can be categorized into three groups using cutoffs of 14 and
21. Children who scores 14 and had <3 “never” responses
≥
and >6 “often” responses were considered potential cases
of autism. In the present study, children with scores 14
≥
were considered at-risk. The at-risk categorizations for the
SDQ and CABS scales were used to identify children at
risk of behavioural and emotional problems.

**Covariates**

The variables included in the analysis as potential confounders were gender, age, number of siblings, parental
educational level, and family income. Maximum educational level of the parents was classified as the highest
educational level of the parent who had more formal education. Maternal and birth information were also retrospective reported. These variables included gestational weeks,
maternal age, delivery mode, birth weight, and breastfeeding. Preterm birth was defined as gestational age <37 completed weeks.
Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained
maternal and child healthcare personnel at each kindergarten. Height (measured to the nearest 0.1 cm) and weight
(measured to the nearest 0.1 kg) were measured when the
children wore light clothes. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m[2]).
The World Health Organization Child Growth Standards
for age- and sex-specific cutoffs were used [21]. Overweight was defined as BMI between the 85th and <95th
percentile for age and sex, and obesity was defined as BMI
95th percentile.
≥

**Statistical analysis**

The frequencies and proportions of parental socio-demographic characteristics, birth information, and child information were calculated for different groups of ST and
sleep duration using Chi-square tests. Descriptive statistics
(mean and standard deviation [SD]) for the total CABS
scores and SDQ subscale, and total scores were calculated for the different ST and sleep duration groups. The


distributions of the total CABS score and SDQ subscale
scores and total scores were skewed; thus, the relationships
between ST, sleep duration, CABS, and SDQ scores were
assessed using Mann–Whitney _U tests. Spearman correla-_
tion coefficients (r) were used to assess the associations of
ST and sleep duration with CABS and SDQ scores. Multiple logistic regression models were used to test whether
each exposure variables was independently associated
with an increased risk of behavioural problems. A wide
range of variables that were correlated with behaviour and
could potentially bias the associations between ST, sleep
duration, and outcome were adjusted for in the regression
models. These potential confounders included gender,
age, number of siblings, child’s BMI, maternal income,
maximum educational level of parents, gestational weeks,
maternal age, breastfeeding, delivery mode, birth weight,
and ST/sleep duration.
Data were analysed using the SPSS version 10.0. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Results

**Characteristics of the study sample**

The mean (SD) age of the study sample was 4.37 (0.99)
years, and 47.1% were female. A maximum educational
level of no more than high school was reported by 28.9%
of parents, and 44.1% of parents reported a family income
>4000 Yuan/month. Of the children, 11.7% were overweight and 14.5% were obese.
The percentages of children with ST 2 h/day and <2 h/
≥
day were 42.7% (3801/8900) and 57.3% (5099/8900),
respectively. The percentages of children with sleep duration <9.15 h/day and 9.15 h/day were 57.0% (5069/8900)
≥
and 43.0% (3831/8900), respectively. The sample characteristics stratified by ST and sleep duration are shown in
Table 1. The proportion of the sample which had ST 2 h/
≥
day did not vary significantly by age, gestational weeks,
or delivery mode. There were significant differences in the
prevalence of sleep duration <9.15 h/day between different
age, family income, and delivery mode groups.

Table 2 reports the mean scores for SDQ total and subscale
scores, and total CABS scores for the different ST and
sleep duration groups. The total SDQ and CABS scores
were higher in children with longer ST (both _P < 0.001)._
The SDQ subscale scores for emotional symptoms, conduct
problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems were higher in
children with longer ST (P < 0.001 for all). The prosocial

subscale scores were lower for children with more ST
(P < 0.001). Similar results were found for the relationship
between SDQ total and subscale scores, and between total
CABS scores and shorter sleep duration.

**Correlations between the predictors and behavioural**

The correlations of the total and subscale behaviour scores
with the continuous predicators variables are shown in
Table 3. The mean (SD) total SDQ and CABS scores were
11.07 (4.76) and 6.40 (4.08),
respectively. ST was positively correlated with the
total SDQ and CABS scores. ST was positively correlated
with the SDQ subscales, except for the prosocial subscale
(r 0.075, _P < 0.001). Inversely, sleep duration was_

negatively correlated with the total SDQ and CABS scores
as well as of the SDQ subscales scores, except for prosocial
(r 0.058, _P < 0.001). All of the correlations described_
=
here were statistically significant (P < 0.001 for all).

**Associations between long ST, short sleep duration,**
**and risk for behavioural problems**

Table 4 shows the odds ratios that estimated the associations between ST, sleep duration, and being at risk for
behavioural problems. Most associations were evident in
both crude and adjusted models. Children with more ST
were significantly more likely to be at risk for behavioural
problems compared with those with less ST. Children with
shorter sleep duration had a significantly increased risk of
behavioural problems compared with those who had longer
sleep duration. These findings were consistent for each of
the SDQ subscale scores.
The simultaneous associations of ST and sleep on being
at risk for behavioural problems were stronger than ST
or sleep, separately. All associations were evident in both
crude and adjusted models (Table 4).

### Discussion

As hypothesized, the present study found that preschool children with long ST and short sleep duration were significantly
more likely to have behavioural problems, after controlling
for potential confounding factors. Specifically, children with
long ST and short sleep duration had higher scores on CABS
(which assessed ASD-related behaviours) compared with
children with short ST and long sleep duration.
Children are spending an increasing amount of their
time engaged in screen exposure. Compared with other
cultural backgrounds of children, Chinese preschool children have a less ST exposure with 2.03 h an average day.

Preschool-aged children in the United States spend an
average 4.1 h of ST daily at home and in day care settings

[22]. International statistics indicate that children in Canada, the United States, and Australia are spending between
1.5 and 7.0 h daily in screen-viewing activities [23]. ST
contributes to a variety of pediatric health problems [4].
Exploration of the associations between ST exposure and
behavioural problems during early childhood is an emerging research area, and a variety of assessments to identify
psychosocial problems have been used [24, 25]. Previous
researches have suggested that ST might be associated with
increased behavioural and emotional problems in children,
including aggression [26], reduced prosocial behaviour

[27], and attentional problems [28], which are consistent
with our results. Hinkley et al. suggested that higher levels

of early childhood electronic media use were associated
with risk for emotional and peer problems [13]. Findings
from the present study support the conclusion that there is
an adverse influence of electronic media use on children’s
psychosocial well-being.
Our result differs from those from a nationally representative US study, which showed no evidence that children
with ASD differ in their ST habits from other children [17].
A possible explanation for this inconsistency is that the US
study used parental-reported history of ASD, instead of a
standardized screening tool for ASD.
ST may affect children by displacing their sleep time

[29]. However, previous studies focused solely on ST or
sleep duration and did not investigate associations with the
two factors simultaneously, as was done in this study. The

present study provides evidence that short sleep duration
was significantly associated with emotional and behavioural
problems among children aged 3–6 years, even after adjustment for potential confounders. The relationship between
sleep problems and behavioural problems in children is well
established. A population-based longitudinal study showed
that short sleep duration at 18 months of age significantly
predicted the incidence of behavioural problems at 5 years
of age [30]. Scharf et al. [14] reported that shorter nighttime sleep duration in preschool children is associated with
higher likelihood of externalizing behavioural symptoms
based on parental report, using the Preschool and Kindergarten Behaviour Scale. However, different assessments of
behavioural problems were used in aforementioned studies.
The use of a uniform measurement for childhood behavioural problems in future studies is necessary to confirm
the observed associations. Our study found that preschool
children with short sleep duration had higher risk of ASD
behaviour than children with long sleep duration. These
findings confirm the results of previous studies which examined the relationship between sleep problems and daytime
behaviour of children with ASD [15].
Several possible mechanisms may explain the aforementioned associations. The effect of ST on children might be
also via influencing beliefs and behaviours. Based on social
learning theory, children can easily learn by observing and
imitating contents they see on the screen [5]. High ST has
been associated with poor health outcomes such as increased
sleep problems among children with ASD [31]. The social
withdrawal hypothesis suggests that increased ST leads to
less social interaction, which may have subsequent detrimental effects on positive well-being [32]. Further researches on
mechanisms are needed to undertake in the early childhood
population, to identify these associations clearly.
The strengths of this study include the large sample
size and the statistical adjustment for a large number of
potential covariates. In addition to information the children, maternal and birth data were assessed as potential
confounders to better estimate the associations between
ST and sleep time and behavioural problems. Despite these
strengths, our study has several limitations. The data about
bed time and wakeup time were retrospective and reported
by parents and might have been subject to recall biases.
However, as suggested in a previous study on sleep start
and end time reported by parents, the actual sleep duration was accurately estimated by actigraphy [33]. ST was
also reported by parental proxy, which might have been
inaccurate as parents were not always with their children.
However, as preschool children’s ST exposure occurs
mostly at home, there is good reason to believe that ST
was accurately measured. ST and sleep duration were categorized, and so small associations might not have been
detected, leading to conservative estimates in this analysis.


A previous study suggested that children’s emerging prosocial behaviour might have been shaped by the interactive
contributions of interpersonal maternal emotion socialization [34]. Our study did not control for maternal emotion
status for mothers. Finally, this survey was cross-sectional
and an etiologic relationship cannot be determined. It is
important to note that the relationships between ST, sleep
duration, and behaviour in preschool children are likely
bidirectional [9]. However, there is good reason to believe
that long ST and short sleep duration led to behavioural
problems, as data from previous prospective studies have
established the temporal order in other populations [13,
30]. Further longitudinal studies are required to examine
causal pathways in these associations and to determine the
potential roles of ST and sleep duration in preventing mental health problems. Particularly, the mechanism underlying
these relationships requires further research.

### Conclusion

This study offers insight into the associations between ST
and sleep duration and behavioural problems among preschool children in China. Our findings suggest that preschool
children with long ST and short sleep duration were significantly more likely to have behavioural problems. Only by
understanding the distinct links of ST and sleep duration
with behaviour, we can pinpoint potential avenues for intervention. Based on our results, it is important for parents to
limit their children’s ST to no more than 1–2 h/day. Parents
are also advised to regulate their children’s sleep habits to
ensure that their children received adequate amount of sleep.
