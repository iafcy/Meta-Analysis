Background: The COVID-19 pandemic may affect the screen time of children
and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study aimed
to examine the screen time of children and adolescents with ASD during
a discrete lockdown period in France and identify risk factors for excessive
screen time.

Methods: The study sample consisted of 249 ASD subjects, 3–17 years of age,
enrolled in the ELENA cohort. Information about the screen time was collected
using the COVID-19 questionnaire specially created for this study. The clinical,
socio-demographic and familial characteristics were collected from the last
ELENA follow-up visit.

Results: More than one third of subjects exceeded recommended levels of
screen time and almost half of parents reported that their child spent more
time using screen since COVID-19 pandemic beginning. Excessive screen
time was significantly related to age with higher screen time in adolescents.
Risk factors for excessive screen time were high withdrawn behaviors and
low socioeconomic status for children, and older age and male gender
for adolescents.

Conclusion: These results imply to adapt the recommendations already
formulated in general population concerning the good use of screens in youth
with ASD. Specific recommendations and suitable guidance are needed to
help children and adolescents with ASD and their parents implement the
more optimal use of screen time activities for educational, therapeutic and
social goals.

Trial registration number: NCT02625116.

## Introduction

The use of television and mobile devices by children and
adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) occupies a
central place in their everyday lives. Current measure of screen
time is the total duration (usually in hours/day) of time spent
viewing programs, or playing video games, on television, a
computer, or a mobile device. Other consistent finding is that,
over the ensuing decades, the screen time among children and
adolescents has been increasing. To date, studies of screen time
of children and adolescents in the general population pointed
to poorer health outcomes in terms of sedentary health risks,
behavioral strengths and difficulties scores, prosocial behaviors
(1, 2), psychological wellbeing, quality of life (3), sleep (4), as
well as depressive (3, 5), and anxiety disorders (6). It has also
been suggested that excessive screen time can lead to worsening
of autism-like symptoms (7–10), attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) (11, 12), dyslexia (13), as well as language,
cognitive, and motor acquisition delays (14, 15).
To date, the indicators of risk for excessive screen time
in children and adolescents in the general population have
included male gender, older age, urban residence, insufficient
home living and play space, lower parental education, lower
household income, and inconsistent parenting practice in terms
of ability to control screen time behaviors (16–20).
Given the concerns about the negative impact of excessive
screen time of children and adolescents, a number of
international guidelines have been proposed (21–24). The
guidelines consistently recommend for children and adolescents
not to exceed an hour of screen time daily for ages 2–5 years, and
2 h daily for ages older than 5 years. Surprisingly, studies have
consistently found that at least half the children in the general
population exceed these limits (19, 25, 26) increasing with age
(25, 27).
Although currently there are no specific recommendations
on acceptable screen time in children and adolescents with ASD,
studies consistently show that they spend more screen time
compared to their typically developing peers (28–32) and may
therefore be at greater risk of becoming dependent (33–35), or
attracted to video gaming that may correspond to their solitary
and repetitive social patterns of interaction (36). Number of
studies have also pointed to unfavorable effects of excessive
screen time in children and adolescents with ASD that included
enhanced sedentary behavior (29, 31, 32), ADHD symptoms
(33), reduced mother-child reciprocal interaction (30) and sleep
problems (37–39). The National Survey of Children’s Health
(26) involving a representative sample of U.S. children, age 6–17
years, showed that although more than half of children with ASD
were high users (more than 2 h/day), nevertheless compared
to non-ASD children, they had similar amounts of screen
time. Montes (26) has further cautioned against assumption
of increased risk of excessive screen time among children and
adolescents with ASD especially given the utility of visual
electronic devices in ASD as communication and teaching aids.


A recent study examining the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on health behaviors among adolescents with ASD
reported significant increase in screen times in terms of both
weekday (3.7 h/week) and weekend (5.9 h/week) use (39).
Others studies also emphasized the negative effect of the
COVID-19 lockdown on youth physical activity and recreational
opportunities during the lockdown (40, 41). The stay-home
orders during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to doubling
or tripling of screen time among children and adolescents with
ASD (16, 19, 39–46).
The purpose of the current study was to examine and
describe screen time in a sample of children and adolescents
with validated ASD diagnoses enrolled in the ELENA cohort
study in France during a discrete lockdown period, and to
identify clinical and socio-demographic risk factors for excessive
screen time.
We first hypothesized that screen time of children with
ASD will increase during the lockdown period, as observed by
previous studies. Moreover, based on prior studies, we expect
to identify several risk factors for excessive screen time in
these children, both clinical (severe autistic symptoms, low
intellectual and adaptive functioning and behavioral issues)
and socio-demographic (low parental educational levels and
socioeconomic status).

## Methods

### Study design

The present study is a cross-sectional survey of parentinformants of children and adolescents with ASD enrolled in
the ELENA regional cohort in France carried out between
November 5 and December 18, 2020 corresponding to the
second COVID-19 lockdown in France. The participants were
recruited from the ELENA cohort, an ongoing, prospective, and
multicenter study of developmental trajectories in ASD. The
subjects followed in the study were 2–16 years at inclusion
(V0), all with confirmed ASD according to DSM5 criteria
and multidimensional assessments including ADOS, ADI, and
psychological assessments. Inclusions in ELENA were carried
out over a period from 2013 to 2019. Thereafter, all children are
followed for 72 months with standardized clinical data collection
times at 36 (V1) and 72 months (V2) after inclusion. The clinical
data collected at these times are similar. Complete details about
the ELENA protocol have been published elsewhere (47).

### Participants

For the present study, the participants consisted of children
with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and fulfilled the following
inclusion criteria: (1) active follow-up in the ELENA cohort; (2)
aged 3–17 years; (3) completed COVID-19 questionnaire; and


-----

(4) living full-time or shared custodial arrangement with the
responding parent.
The 249 children and adolescents were mainly boys (80.3%)
and their mean age was 9.1 years (SD = 3.8). Fifty height
percent of children had a middle or high parental socioeconomic
status (SES). Over half of the mothers (62.2%) and the fathers
(53%) had a college or university education. Children involved
in this study were younger and had a higher estimate intellectual
level and VABS-II scores for communication and daily living
skills then the other children included in the ELENA cohort
(Supplementary Table 1).

### Procedure

For the present study, parents were invited by a letter
to complete an online questionnaire related to the specified
lockdown period via the ELENA cohort database electronic
system. A reminder was sent to parents 2 weeks later by
e-mail or telephone. Only one questionnaire was completed
per child by corresponding parent. As the COVID study was
carried out in addition to the ELENA follow-up, we did not
automatically collect the motives for declining to participate
in this survey, but the few families who did cite a lack of
time. Signed informed consent has been obtained from all
participating families included in the ELENA cohort. This study
was approved by the Internal Review Board of the University
Hospital of Montpellier and was conducted according to the
recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Measures

##### COVID-19 questionnaire
The COVID-19 questionnaire included: (i) child
characteristics, education and leisure activities, specialized
care (i.e., speech therapy, occupational therapy, psychosocial
intervention; social skills training), sleep (within the last 15
days), social home environment and relationships; and (ii) child
screen time from the inclusion of the pandemic in March 2020:
average screen time (hours/day) assessed on a 5-point Likert
response scale (none; <1 h/day; 1–2 h/day; 2–4 h/day; >4 h/
day), change in screen time since the COVID-19 lockdown
(November 5–December 18, 2020), assessed as increased,
decreased, same as before, or not applicable (i.e., “my child does
not spend any time on screens”).

##### Clinical characteristics
The clinical characteristics of subjects have been previously
assessed by licensed study psychologists using standardized tools
within the ELENA Cohort. The child and adolescent adaptive
skills were assessed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales,


Second Edition (VABS-II) (48). Autism symptom severity was
measured using the calibrated severity score (CSS) of the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) (49, 50).
A best estimate intellectual functioning was calculated using
standardized and validated instruments [Brunet-Lézine R (51);
BECS (52); PEP-3 (53); WPPSI-IV (54); WISC-V (55); WAIS-IV
(56); K-ABC (57)] based on child age and level, according to
the approach of Howlin et al. (58). Psychiatric comorbidities
were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL; (59)],
a norm-referenced measure assessing emotional and behavioral
disorders in children. A CBCL score <65 corresponds to a
normal range and a score greater or equal to 65 corresponds to a
borderline or clinical range. Children and adolescents responses
to sensory stimuli were assessed by the Sensory Profile (SP), a
parent-reported 125-items questionnaire (60) for which a total
score (SP total score) was calculated from 36 items (61), lower
scores indicating greater SP difficulties. The tools and measures
have been described in detail in the ELENA protocol (47).
The clinical characteristics used in this paper were collected at
the last ELENA follow-up visit closest to the beginning of the
containment with a mean delay of 12 months between these
times (standard deviations ± 10.7).

##### Socio-demographic and familial characteristics
The socio-demographic and familial characteristics
included: sibship size, household composition, parental ages,
educational levels and socioeconomic status (SES) studied as
a composite variable based on the mother and/or the father’s
professional background. When the parents were living together,
the highest SES in the household was taken into consideration;
when separated, the SES of parent with whom the child lived
most of the time was taken into consideration. Only current
occupational professional activities were considered; if a parent
did not work at the time of the study, her/his SES was not taken
into account. Parental SES was scored as high (business owners,
professionals, executives), middle (farmers, supervisors, skilled
craftsmen), or low (farm workers, laborers, service employees,
and unemployed). Middle and high SES classes were grouped to
increase the power of data. All data about socio-demographic
and familial characteristics used in this paper were extracted
from the last ELENA follow-up visit.

### Statistical analysis

The outcome variable was screen time of children and
adolescents during the specified COVID-19 lockdown period,
defined as greater than recommended (21, 23) (<1 h/day for
2–5-year-old group, and <2 h/day for >5-year-old group). The
following potential explanatory variables were considered for the
analysis: (i) data from ELENA follow-up: for the child (gender
and clinical characteristics: CSS, VABS-II, CBCL and SP scores,


-----

best estimate intellectual functioning), and the parents (number
of siblings, parental SES and educational level); and (ii) data
collected during lockdown: for the child (age, education, leisure
activities, weekly social relationships with peers and family and
continuation of specialized care) and the parents (age, household
composition and perception of their child’s sleep).
Descriptive analysis was performed according three age
subgroups identified according to school levels (preschool,
elementary and beyond than middle school, respectively): <6
years old, 6–11 years old and ≥12 years old. Means with
± standard deviations (SDs) were reported for continuous
variables. Categorical variables were described into frequency
and percentage. Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact tests and
ANOVA tests were used to compare sub-groups characteristics.
Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni
post-hoc test. Chi square test was used to compare the excessive
screen time between groups.
The risk factors analysis was performed for the subgroups:
children (<12 years) and adolescents (≥12 years). The groups
<6 years, and 6–11 years, were pooled into a group <12 years,
because of (1) the homogeneous prevalence of screen time for
the age subgroups <6 years and 6–11 years and to address (2)
the limited sample size of the age subgroup <6 years.
The association between potential explanatory factors and
screen time during the lockdown was studied using Pearson
chi-square or Fisher exact tests for the categorical variables and
T-Test or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables. The
following effect sizes, Cramer’s V, Cohen’s d and eta², were
calculated as appropriate (62).
For the multivariable logistic regression models of excessive
screen time risk factors, variables with a p <0.20 according to the
univariate analysis were included in the model and the model
that minimized the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was
selected using a backward selection. The multivariable model
for the <12 years group was adjusted with the delay between
the date of the last CBCL and the filling time of the COVID-19
questionnaire. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. The goodness-of-fit
of the models was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow
test. A sensitivity analysis was performed using chained equation
missing data method to impute the missing explanatory variables
(100 imputation datasets), assuming that the data were missing
at random. All statistical tests were considered significant
for p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
Enterprise Guide V7.13 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

## Results

### Population

The sample study included 249 children and adolescents
who were mainly boys (80.3%). The caregivers who filled the


COVID-19 questionnaire were mothers for 202 participants
(81.2%), fathers for 20 of them (8%) and both parents combined
for 27 of them (10.8%). The means ADOS-2 CSS was 7.37
(SD = 1.8) and the mean estimate intellectual functioning was
79.1 (SD = 30.2). The mean VABS-II scores were 73.3 (SD
= 17.4) for communication, 73.0 (SD = 15.7) for daily living
skills and 69.1 (SD = 14.3) for socialization. The three age
groups considered for this study: <6 years (n = 40, 16.1%);
6–11 years (n = 143, 57.4%); and ≥12 years (n = 66, 26.5%)
were comparable on CSS and VABS-II scores but significantly
different on intellectual level (p < 0.001, eta² = 0.17), that
increased with age. Most children were in school (N = 225,
90.4%) and had no leisure activities (n = 169, 67.9%). Specialized
care was maintained for most children and adolescents (n = 227,
91.2%) but it was significantly more frequent in 6–11 years than
≥12 years subgroup (94.4 and 83.3%, respectively; p = 0.01).
More details are presented in Table 1.

### Screen time in ASD children and adolescents during lockdown

Excessive screen time was found in 37.4% (n = 93) of
our sample and was significantly related to age [p < 0.001,
Cramer’s V(df=2) = 0.33] as follows: 63.6%, ≥12 year (n = 42);
27.3%, 6–11 year (n = 39) groups; and 30%, <6 years group
(n = 12). Gender was linked to excessive screen time for the
≥12 years group [p = 0.03, Cramer’s V(df=1) = −0.28], with
males more likely to have excessive screen time (83.3%) than
females (16.7%). Highest screen times (>4 h/day) were: 16.7%,
<6 year; 20.5%, aged 6–11 year; and 50.0%, ≥12 year groups.
Almost half of parents (48.8%) reported that their child spent
more time using screen since COVID-19 pandemic beginning
as 44.0 % reported no change and only 4.0 % reported a screen
time decrease.

### Univariate analysis of excessive screen time during lockdown

Children (<12 years) with excessive screen time vs. within
recommended level had significantly: lower VABS-II scores
for Daily Living Skills [mean = 69.5 (SD = 14.6) vs. 74.28
(SD = 15.8), respectively; p = 0.02, Cohen’s d = 0.31],
higher CBCL scores for withdrawn [70.7% with borderline
or clinical range vs. 53.9%, respectively; p = 0.06, Cramer’s
V(df=1) = −0.15] and lower parental SES [58.0 vs. 35.7%,
respectively; p = 0.01, Cramer’s V(df=1) = 0.20].
Adolescents (≥12 years) with excessive screen time vs.
within recommended level had: older age [mean = 14.7 years
(SD = 1.5) vs. 13.4 years (SD = 1.9), respectively; p = 0.002,
Cohen’s d = −0.76]; male gender (83.3 vs. 58.3%, respectively;

### Multivariable assessment of risk for excessive screen time during lockdown

Children (<12 years): after adjustment, higher withdrawn
CBCL score (borderline/clinical range) and low parental SES
were both noted to increase risk of excessive screen time: (ORa
= 2.39 (95%CI 1.06–5.36, p = 0.04); and ORa = 2.67 (95%CI
1.25–5.71, p = 0.01]), respectively. Using multiple imputation of
missing data, the sensitivity analysis confirms the result of the
complete case multivariable analysis in children (Table 2).
Adolescents (≥12 years): after backward selection, only older
age was a risk factor of excessive screen time [OR = 2.24
(1.30–3.86), p = 0.04]. The sensitivity analysis conducted on
imputed data showed that child age and male gender were
significant risk factors for excessive screen time in adolescents:
ORa = 1.64 (95%CI: 1.53–2.34; p = 0.01) and ORa = 4.25
(95%CI: 1.67–15.47; p = 0.03), respectively (Table 3).

## Discussion

The current study provided a unique opportunity to
examine screen time during a discrete COVID-19 lockdown
period among a sample of 249 children and adolescents with


well-characterized diagnosis of ASD enrolled in a regional ASD
cohort in France. We found that 37.4% of subjects had above
recommended levels of screen time during lockdown. This figure
is comparable to that obtained in the U.S. general population
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that
reported sedentary behavior profiles comprised of television
viewing or engaging with electronic media that exceeded 2-h/day
or more of screen time for 47% of the population of 2–15 year
old children and adolescents (27). It is notable that the latter
study classified sedentary behaviors depending on the screen
time activities involved as “productive” (e.g., computer use for
homework or reading, or other educational activity) or “leisure”
(e.g., viewing television or playing computer or video games).
Regarding the impact of lockdown on children’s screen
time, half of parents reported an increase since the beginning
of the pandemic, which is congruent with previous studies
(39). This indicates that screen time measured during the
pandemic does not necessarily represent the usual screen time
of children. In particular, children and adolescents had to adapt
to a new virtual system for education and work purposes, so that
“excessive” screen time can be biased by this constrains during
the lock-down.

The results of the current study were consistent with that of
Must et al. (32) that compared children with ASD and typically
developing children under 12 years of age. Must et al. (32)
reported significantly elevated screen times, 2.5 vs. 1.6 h/day,
among ASD and non-ASD children, respectively, albeit during a
non-lockdown period. A study by Krupa et al. (30) involving 2–4

year-old children with ASD vs. typically developing non-ASD
children also reported significantly elevated weekly screen times,
8.4 vs. 6.9 h, respectively, that did not exceed recommended
levels. Nonetheless, although not at excessive screen time levels,
for these young children, the Krupa et al. (30) study emphasized
the importance of joint family-child screen time that had an
impact on mother-child reciprocal interaction.
The present study allowed to identify factors associated
to excessive screen time. First, above recommended screen
time was higher for adolescents (63%), almost double that of
under 12-year-olds. Excessive screen time experience among
adolescents is also supported by prior studies and likely relate to
ease of screen access, attraction to social networks, and difficulty
in implementing stricter controls (19, 63). Second, our analysis
found that children with excessive screen time had lower daily
living skills (as assessed with VABS-II). This is consistent with
the previously reported association of excessive screen time with
negative health conditions in children and adolescents with
ASD (29, 33, 37). Third, children and adolescents with ASD
with excessive screen time were significantly more withdrawn
(as assessed with CBCL) suggesting that children with these
clinical characteristics may are more likely to have greater screen
time. However, it is difficult to understand the true nature
of this interaction, which can reflect either greater interest in
solitary screen-based activities, or adverse effect of excessive
screen time on prosocial behavior. Alternatively, the degree of
withdrawal observed in children and adolescents with excessive
screen time could be related to greater autism severity, as noted
by Dong et al. (64), who found that children with significant
sensory characteristics, were more likely to be fascinated by the
visual stimuli of screens. It is also possible that they were given


these devices because it was a convenient way to keep them
occupied during the lockdown. Fourth, the univariate analysis
found that adolescents with excessive screen time were not
only older but were more likely to be males, a finding again
consistent with previous literature (19, 63). Fifth, the adolescents
with excessive screen time received less special care services
and less educational resources at home. In such uniformed
circumstances, it has also been noted that parents themselves
may be involved in excessive screen time (65). As already been
reported in previous studies (19) low parental SES has also
been noted to be a risk factor for excessive screen time among
children with less opportunities for non-screen based leisure and
vocational activities.
Finally, the multivariable and sensitivity analyses,
underscored that be more withdrawn and had lower parental
SES were the risk factors for excessive screen time among
children. Among adolescents, older age and male gender were
the risk factors for excessive screen time, two factors commonly
supported by prior population based studies (17–20, 63).
Number of limitations of the study should be noted. The
subsample of children and adolescents examined for the present
study were younger and had higher intellectual and adaptive
functioning scores than in the overall ELENA cohort, which
limits the generalization of our results. ELENA is a regional
cohort and not a nationally representative sample, which may
bias our results on the link between socio-economic status
and screen time and therefore we cannot generalize. Data
on socio-familial characteristics were only available for a
subset of children, who did not differ from the whole cohort
on these variables. We do not have a measurement of the
screen exposure before confinement or a comparison to the


-----

population without ASD or the general population. Part of the
clinical data used in this article was collected at the last visit
in ELENA about 12 months before our COVID-19 survey.
However, the clinical presentation in other cohorts with ASD
(66) was found to be stable in the short term. Nevertheless, an
important strength of the current study included the use of a
large sample of children and adolescents with confirmed ASD
diagnosis with consideration of a wide range of clinical and
socio-familial variables collected using validated instruments
and potential risk factors. Although the sample size was limited,
the significance of the findings for a relatively small subgroup
was important and consistent with prior research. Given the
positive relationship found between age and excessive screen
time, future research is needed to examine long-term effects of
excessive screen time from adolescence onwards.

### Implications

The experience of above recommended level of screen time
among children and adolescents with ASD is equally important
with consequent negative effects of excessive screen time on
health. It is therefore paramount to develop recommendations
on screen time and to provide guidance to parents of children
and adolescents with ASD. Further studies are needed to
examine the relationship between sedentary behaviors, screen
time and healthy and behavioral outcomes in children and
adolescents with ASD. The clinical and social risk factors
identified in the current study also make it possible for
professionals to consider measures to implement the more
optimal use of screen time activities for educational, therapeutic
and social goals. It is particularly important to encourage
the access of children to non-screen time based leisure and
cultural activities that complement educational interventions in
particular during period of lockdowns.
