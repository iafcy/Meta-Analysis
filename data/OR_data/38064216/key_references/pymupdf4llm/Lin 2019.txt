ABSTRACT: Objective: Despite evidence that excessive screen use may contribute to negative health, developmental, emotional, and behavioral outcomes, more children are engaging in increasing amounts of
screen-related activities. For children with neurodevelopmental conditions, increased screen use could exacerbate emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBDs) by interfering with sleep quantity and quality. Aims: This
study examined the possible mediating role of sleep in the relationship between screen use and EBDs in
preschool children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) clinically referred to a child development
center in Singapore. Methods: A screen use questionnaire developed for the purposes of the present study,
the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were completed
by 367 caregivers of 2- to 5-year-old children with NDDs (39.5% autism spectrum disorder; 36.8% speechlanguage disorders; 23.7% others). Results: Average daily screen use duration was 3.98 hours, with 93.9%
exceeding 1 hour of screen time daily. 57.7% of children had screen devices in their bedrooms, while 52%
commenced screen use at the age of 18 months or earlier. Sleep problems fully mediated the relationship
between the number of bedroom screen devices and children’s EBDs, as well as between the age of first
screen use and EBDs, but not between hours of screen use and EBDs. Controlling for age, developmental
level, and family income, children who started using screens earlier than 18 months and who had screen
devices in their bedrooms had significantly more sleep problems and EBDs than those without. Conclusion:
Children with neurodevelopmental conditions may have more difficulties disengaging from screen devices in
their bedrooms, and an earlier age of screen exposure may contribute to more chronic disruption of sleep.

children are upset, thereby over time displacing the development of the child’s internal self-regulation mechanisms, in turn increasing screen use over time and
perpetuating difficulties with emotional/behavioral
regulation.[10]

##### Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Screen Use
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth
Editior[11] include intellectual disability (ID), global
developmental delay (GDD), speech and language disorders (SLs), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific
learning disorders (LDs).
Lo[12] conducted a retrospective analysis of more than
56,000 US school-aged children and adolescents with
and without NDDs using data extracted from the 2007
National Survey of Children’s Health. Compared with
typically developing children, children with NDDs (ASD,
ADHD, GDD, and LD) in this study had higher daily average screen times, although ADHD was reported to be
the main NDD impacting screen time behavior. Considering how children with NDDs are at overall higher risk
for poorer developmental outcomes, it is possible that
increased screen use may further exacerbate these.
Currently, research is scarce in this population, and
findings are mixed, making it premature to draw any
firm causal links. Most research to date has been published in relation to children with ASD and ADHD,[13,14]

with very few, if any, to our knowledge, studies in children with other NDDs. Compared with typically developing children, children with ASD have more
compulsive Internet and video game use and more difficulties disengaging from screen use, possibly due to the
repetitive and restricted nature of the screen content;
they also present with more inattention and are more
negatively impacted by screen use in their social, educational, and family life.[15] At the same time, other studies
have suggested that screen devices can be useful as enabling tools of communication and support in teaching
activities of daily living, vocational/employment, language, and promoting communication and social skills in
people with ID and ASD.[16]

###### Screen Use and Sleep in Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders
In typically developing children, one possible mechanism through which screen use may exert negative
effects is by affecting their sleep: by quantitatively displacing sleep or activities related to good sleep hygiene
and/or by qualitatively disrupting sleep through physiological arousal, suppressing melatonin production,[17] or
delaying circadian rhythm.[18] One review[19] explains that
children’s sleep disturbances can contribute to problems
of executive function hyperactivity social function


have also been associated with excessive screen use and
may suggest overlapping pathways in how screen use
and sleep may affect children.
Sleep problems are often much more common and
impairing among children with NDDs than among their
typically developing peers, whereas the presence of
bedroom screen devices has been associated with
shorter sleep duration among children with ASD and
ADHD, possibly attributed to more trouble disengaging
from screen devices; greater susceptibility to lit screens
disrupting their melatonin levels; and/or greater susceptibility to screen arousal and insomnia due to their
higher risk for autonomic hyperarousal.[13] Further analyses of screen use specifically by children with ASD appear to suggest that it may matter less whether bedroom
screen devices are present or not but what was more
important was whether screen use was carried out during preparation to bedtime routines; in particular, violent
content prior to bedtime was significantly associated
with delayed sleep onset in a study of 101 young people
with ASD aged 6 to 14 years in the United States using
caregiver report.[14]

###### Does Sleep Mediate the Relationship Between Screen Use and Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties in Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorder?
The consistent relationships found across different
studies between screen use, sleep, and EBDs in both
neurotypical children and children with NDDs point toward a possible mediating role of sleep. Supporting this,
laboratory-controlled and cross-sectional studies of typically developing children and adolescents have found
reduced sleep and poorer sleep quality to mediate the
influence of screen time on attention problems, physical
aggression, and emotional and somatic problems.[20,21]

Considering how children with NDDs are already at
an elevated risk for EBDs in addition to sleep problems,
when screen time disrupts sleep, these difficulties may
be exacerbated. In an effort to manage some of the
challenges of caring for a child with NDDs, caregivers
may also resort to more screen use to soothe or engage
their child, further interfering with the child’s sleep and
development in a negative developmental trajectory.[22]

###### The Present Study: Rationale, Aims, and Research Questions
There are currently several gaps and limitations in the
existing literature. First, studies are often limited to
specific NDD subgroups, particularly ASD and ADHD,
while underrepresenting other groups; to date, very few
studies have examined factors implicated in screen use
and child outcomes in preschool children with neurodevelopmental concerns presenting to routine developmental pediatric clinic settings.[23] Second, research
has largely been limited to examining screen time, when
other aspects of screen use (i.e., settings, age of onset)
also need to be considered Finally to our knowledge no

between screen use, emotional/behavioral problems,
and sleep in young children with NDD.
Singapore is one of the most tech-savvy countries
worldwide. Singaporean children aged 0 to 6 years are
reported to spend an average of 2.5 hours daily on
television and an additional 1.6 hours online,[24] while
more than half of Singaporean children aged 2 years and
younger (n 5 388; 53.5%) engage in daily screen use for
60–80 minutes.[25]

The present study sought to address some of the
above limitations in the existing literature by exploring
screen use, sleep, and EBDs in a large sample of preschool children routinely presenting to a developmental
pediatric clinic. Pragmatically too, this study did not
want to exclude any particular NDD diagnostic group
from the diverse range of clinical cases typically seen in
such settings, particularly because non-ASD, SL, and
ADHD groups are already underrepresented in the literature on screen use. The following hypotheses were
examined:

1. Increased screen use (defined as average daily
screen time, age of first screen exposure, or the
number of bedroom screen devices) will be associated with poorer sleep quantity and quality and
more caregiver-reported EBDs.
2. Sleep quantity and/or quality will mediate the relationship between screen use (screen time, age of
first screen exposure, or the number of bedroom
devices) and EBDs.

##### METHODS
###### Participants
Setting
Participants were recruited among caregivers attending appointments for their child at the Department of
Child Development (DCD), KK Women’s and Children’s
Hospital (KKH), Singapore, which sees the majority of
children aged 1 to 6 years referred for neurodevelopmental concerns in Singapore yearly. Children
are referred to the DCD by family physicians or primary
care pediatricians from both public and private health
care sectors. (children in Singapore start formal schooling at 7 years; should they be referred for assessment
after they have started school, they would be seen in
a different health care organization and clinic for young
people of 7 to 18 years of age). At each child’s first visit
to the DCD, a detailed developmental history, physical
examination, and developmental screening assessment
using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition
(ASQ-3[26]), is conducted by a multidisciplinary team of
qualified doctors, nurses, and associate psychologists or
allied professionals. Further formal psychological or
speech and language/occupational therapy assessments
would usually then be conducted for those children with
suspected autism spectrum disorder intellectual disabil


are made using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for
Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, taking all
the assessment information gathered into consideration.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Children younger than 6 years, who were Singaporean citizens or permanent residents, and had obtained
a clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) were included in this study. The children
were all assessed and diagnosed by qualified DCD-KKH
pediatricians, with 172 (46.9%) having completed additional standardized and/or clinical assessments by psychologists, speech and language therapists, or
occupational therapists as part of standard clinical care at
the time of data collection. Diagnostic NDD information
and previous assessment results were extracted from
children’s case files. There were no exclusion criteria
pertaining to children’s intellectual or verbal
functioning.
Participant Characteristics
The final sample included 367 children, most of
whom were Singaporean ethnically Chinese, male, English speaking, and from middle and upper middle class
married families (Table 1).

###### Procedure
Ethics
Ethics approval was granted by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (Reference
2015/2459).
Recruitment
From July 2015 to July 2016, caregivers who attended
appointments with their child at the DCD-KKH were
recruited by the first and third authors who approached
the caregivers to inform them about the study, answer
any questions they had, and provide them with a participant information sheet and consent form. Of 500 participants approached, 25 refused or withdrew
participation, and 108 did not meet study inclusion criteria (11 were aged 61 years, 1 was nonresident, and 96
had no NDD diagnosis); therefore, the final sample size
was 367.
Data Collection
Once information about the study was shared and
signed consent obtained, caregivers were given the
questionnaires to complete during their appointment
waiting time or at home, to then be returned to the research team by post in addressed and stamped envelopes
provided.

developmental performance of young children aged 1 to
60 months. It is a 30-item parent-reported age-grouped
questionnaire with good test-retest reliability (r 50.75–
0.82), internal consistency ranging from a 5 0.51 to
0.87, and very good sensitivity (86.1%) and specificity
(85.6%) in identifying children with developmental delay. Raw scores for each domain were standardized into
z scores and averaged to give an ASQ-3 average z score
(ASQ-3-z); 38.4% (n 5 113) of the sample had clinical
levels of developmental delay, 35.1% (n 5 103) had
borderline developmental delay, and the remaining
26.5% (n 5 81) were developmentally normal.

Screen Use and Correlates
These were measured by a questionnaire developed
for the purposes of this study comprising 31 items, including questions on the number of bedroom screen
devices, age of first screen exposure (in months), and
weekday and weekend screen times of the child and the
parent across multiple devices (television, computers,
game consoles, mobile devices), which were used to
calculate an average daily screen time (in hours) as


consistent with the previous literature (after summing
screen times across all devices, averaging was done by
multiplying weekday screen time by 5, multiplying
weekend screen time by 2, summing them together, and
dividing by 7).[13,25] The questionnaire was adapted from
a previous version used by Goh et al.[25] in a Singapore
study on sociodemographic, home environment, and
parental influences on screen viewing in children younger than 2 years.

Sleep Quantity and Quality
The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ[27])
was used. Average daily sleep duration was calculated
from the CSHQ fields of the child’s sleep, wake, and nap
times, for weekdays and weekends. The CSHQ also
includes a 33-item measure of sleep problems
(i.e., quality) that make up a total CSHQ total score
(range, 31–97; there are 2 items scored on 0, 1, 2,
whereas the remaining 31 items are scored on 1, 2, 3).
The CSHQ showed adequate internal consistency in both

sleep disorders in school-aged children.[27] Normative
comparisons can also be made with an earlier study on
372 typically developing Singaporean preschool
children.[28]

Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties
Caregivers completed the age-appropriate version of
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ[29]) (for
2–4 years or for 4–17 years). Both comprise 25 items and
make up a total difficulties index raw score (range, 0–40;
higher scores 5 more difficulties). It has adequate internal consistency (a 5 0.73) and discriminates well
between psychiatric and nonpsychiatric samples (specificity, 0.95; sensitivity, 0.63[29]).

###### Statistical Analyses
Missing Data and Erroneous Responses
Missing data were replaced with the mean of the
subscale only if there was no more than 1 missing item
(in 28 cases [7.6%] for SDQ subscales; 55 cases [15.0%]
for CSHQ subscales). Multiple responses to a single
question were removed and treated as missing data.Extreme and/or erroneous entries were treated as missing data: screen time duration entries exceeding 14.8
hours per day [Accounts for the sample’s awake duration; 24 hours – 11.34 (sample’s mean sleep duration) 1
2*1.07 (SD) 5 14.8; 3 cases; 0.8%]; as well as sleep duration entries exceeding 14.1 hours or below 7.5 hours
per day [Derived from a previous study on Singaporean
preschool children's sleep (Aishworiya et al., 2012); 10.8
hours (mean sleep duration) 1 3*1.1 (SD) 5 7.5 to
14.1 hours; 32 cases; 8.7%] Missing data (including
errors) were most apparent in summary measures of the
number of bedroom screen devices (n 5 147; 40.1%),
average daily screen time (n 5 89; 24.3%), and average
daily sleep duration (n 5 72; 19.6%) because these could
not be calculated if their component items had missing
values (analyses using subscale scores with fewer missing data were also carried out, but results and patterns of
significant/nonsignificant findings and strengths were
similar; hence, using summary scores was adopted and
presented in this article).
Data Analytic Plans
The study sought to examine screen use, sleep, and
emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBDs) in children with
NDDs referred to the developmental pediatric clinic. To
investigate the sample as a whole, differences between
the NDD subgroups were first explored with multivariate analyses of variance, and those variables were controlled for in subsequent analyses (see preliminary
analyses in Results). Correlational analyses examined the
relationship between screen use, sleep, and EBD variables; both composite and subscale variables were explored. Using Process macro (model 4) in SPSS, we then
aimed to address the mediation hypotheses that increased screen use (predictor) contributed to more EBDs
(outcome) through more sleep problems (mediator). A
bootstrap analysis of 5000 samples (i e to derive un


mating distribution) was used to derive the indirect
effect of the mediator. Because of the large number of
analyses and the relatively large sample size, effect sizes
are reported and guided the interpretation of the
findings.

##### RESULTS
###### Preliminary Analyses
Descriptive Statistics
Most participants (93.9%) exceeded the 1 hour of
average daily screen time recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (Table 2). Just under
60% had 1 or more bedroom screen devices, whereas
more than half were exposed to screens at the age of 18
months or earlier (Table 2).
On the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire
(CSHQ), caregivers reported average daily sleep duration of 11.34 hours including naps, and almost half of
the children were cosleeping in the same bed as their
parents or siblings (Table 2). The sample had a mean
total CSHQ sleep problems score of 45.7 (out of 97),
with 72.3% exceeding the cutoff score of 41, indicating
elevated sleep problems. On the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), participants reported
a mean total SDQ emotional/behavioral difficulties
(EBDs) score of 13.91 (out of 40), with 59.9% scoring
above the cutoff score of 13 for clinically elevated
EBDs. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha values of the total
CSHQ and SDQ score items were 0.76 and 0.73, respectively, indicating acceptable internal consistency
for the use of the total scores.

Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnostic
Subgroup Differences
Multivariate analyses of variance using Pillai’s Trace
examined child/demographic characteristics, screen
use, sleep, and EBDs between the 3 neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) diagnostic subgroups
in the sample [autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n 5
145; 39.5%), speech and language disorders (SL) (n 5
135; 36.7%), and “others” (n 5 87; 23.7%) including
global developmental delay, learning disorders, motor
disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, and multiple NDD]. There was
a significant difference, F (26,186) 5 1.69 (p 5 0.025;
h[2] 5 0.19; Table 1). Univariate tests showed group
differences in Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Third
Edition (ASQ-3) z-scores (ASQ-3-z) [F (2,104) 5 13.61;
p, 0.001; h[2] 5 0.21; ASD subgroup had lower
functioning than the other 2 groups] and age [F
(2,104) 5 4.32; p 5 0.016; h[2] 5 0.08; “Others” subgroup was older than ASD and SL participants] with
large and medium effect sizes, respectively (Table 1).
There were no significant group differences in screen
use, sleep, or EBDs (h[2] 5 0.002–0.055, all small effect
sizes). Subsequent analyses therefore controlled for

Intercorrelations and Controlling for
Confounding Variables
Significant associations were found between children’s lower ASQ-3-z, younger age, lower family monthly
income, and higher parental average daily screen time
with increased children’s screen use, poorer sleep quality, and more EBDs, with small to medium effect sizes
(Table 3); hence, these variables were also controlled for
in the main analyses


###### Main Analyses

Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties
Adjusting for children’s NDD diagnostic subgroup,
ASQ-3-z, age, family income, and parents’ average daily
screen time, more bedroom screen devices and earlier
age of first screen exposure, respectively, were both
associated with poorer caregiver-reported sleep quality
and higher EBDs total scores with small effect sizes

(Table 4). Average daily screen time was not associated
with sleep quantity, sleep quality, or EBD and therefore
was not examined further as a predictor in the subsequent mediation analyses (see also Discussion for more
on data relating to duration of screen use obtained in this
study). More EBDs were associated with reduced sleep
quality and quantity with small effect sizes. There were
no significant differences in analyses using the EBD
subscales (externalizing vs internalizing factor subscale
scores) as outcome variables, so the EBD total score
analyses are reported here.

###### Exploring Sleep Problems as a Mediator Between Screen Use and Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties
Number of Bedroom Devices, Sleep Problems,
and Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties
Adjusting for children’s NDD diagnostic subgroup,
ASQ-3-z, age, family income, and parents’ average daily
screen time, there was a full mediation effect (Fig. 1).
The indirect effect of total CSHQ score was significant,
with a small effect size (k[2] 5 0.080; SE 5 0.037; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.018–0.160). Approximately
13% of variance in total SDQ score was accounted for by
the predictors examined (R[2] 5 0.13; F (6,143) 5 3.71;
p 5 0.002). The relationship between higher number of
bedroom screen devices and more EBDs was fully
explained by increased sleep problems in this sample.
Age of First Screen Exposure, Sleep Problems,
and Emotional/Behavioral Difficulties
Adjusting for children’s NDD diagnostic subgroup,
ASQ-3-z, age, family income, and parents’ average daily
screen time a full mediation effect was found (Fig 2)


The indirect effect of total CSHQ score was significant,
with a small effect size (k[2] 5 20.055; SE 5 0.024; 95%
CI, 20.107 to 20.014). These results indicated that the
relationship between children’s age of first screen exposure and caregiver-reported EBDs was fully explained
by sleep problems, with the model explaining a relatively small 10% of the variance in total SDQ scores (R[2] 5
0.10; F (6,235) 5 4.14; p, 0.001).
The same mediation analyses were performed separately by individual NDD diagnostic subgroups and also
with EBD internalizing and externalizing subscales as the
outcome variables. However, there were no significant
findings.

###### Additional Analyses
Additional analyses explored differences between
those who deviated from both AAP recommendations
(having 1 or more bedroom screen device and age of
first screen exposure under 18 months; n 5 70) compared with those who adhered to 1 or both recommendations (no bedroom screen device and/or first
screen exposure after 18 months; n 5 147). Controlling
for NDD diagnostic subgroup, ASQ-3-z, age, family income, and parents’ average daily screen time, multivariate tests using Pillai’s trace showed significant
differences between the 2 groups, F (2,141) 5 5.51 (p 5
0.005; h[2] 5 0.072) with a medium effect size. Further
univariate tests found that those who deviated from both
recommendations had higher total CSHQ sleep problem
scores [F(1,142) 5 8.64; p 5 0.004; h[2] 5 0.057] and
more caregiver-reported EBD problems (higher SDQ
scores; [F(1 142) 5 6 05; p 5 0 015; h[2] 5 0 041])

##### DISCUSSION
To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is one of
the only few to explore the possible mediating role of
sleep problems in the relationship between the number
of bedroom devices, age of first screen exposure, and
emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBDs) in preschool
children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)
presenting to a developmental pediatric clinic. At the
same time, considering the elevated risk of sleep and
EBDs in children with NDDs, even the small effect size
relationships found may be clinically relevant for psychoeducation, prevention, and intervention efforts.

###### Patterns of Screen Use
The majority of children with NDDs in this study
considerably exceeded American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended screen time limits of 1 hour
per day, and more than half were first exposed to
screens at the age of 18 months and younger and had at
least 1 screen device in their bedrooms. Although this
is comparable to the general Singaporean preschool
population,[24,25] it is higher than reported international


rates of screen use among preschool children and by
children with NDDs in the United States.[1,12]

Consistent with the current literature, the present
study also found a relationship between higher screen
use and lower family income. This has been attributed to
several factors, including parents having reduced alternative resources and limited knowledge of the potential
impact of screen use,[23] and this higher screen use by
preschoolers from lower-income families has also been
associated with poorer self-regulatory behaviors.[30] The
other inverse relationship between average daily screen
time and Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition
(ASQ-3)-z scores suggests that the use of screen devices
may be accentuated among children with lower developmental functioning.[22]

###### Presence of Bedroom Screen Devices
The current study adds to the literature on children
with NDDs by suggesting that bedroom screen devices
may be associated with more EBDs indirectly through
affecting children’s sleep. One explanation is that children with NDDs may have more difficulty disengaging
from screen devices compared with typically developing
children; hence, the continued presence of these devices
may signal possible reengagement and maintain elevated
arousal, which interferes with sleep.[18]

Another possibility is that children’s sleep may be affected by lights and sounds emitted from incoming
messages, e-mails, calls, and app notifications[31] because
half have at least 1 mobile device in the bedroom where
the child sleeps, and a substantial proportion cosleep
with their parents or older siblings (a culturally common
sleeping practice) who may engage with these devices.
Supporting this, studies on adults found a high prevalence of engagement with or being woken up by mobile
devices after lights out, which predicted poorer sleep
quality, more fatigue, and higher insomnia.[32] Other
possible explanations include light or electromagnetic
emission from mobile devices altering sleep architecture
and delayed melatonin production, which children with
NDDs may be particularly vulnerable to.[17]

###### Age of First Screen Exposure
Earlier screen use has been posited to be associated
with higher EBDs possibly because infants tend to have
less mature self-regulation and may present with more
self-regulatory problems than older children, increasing
parental stress and thereby reliance on screen use.[9] The
present study also suggests that earlier screen exposure
may affect EBDs indirectly through affecting sleep. Given
that children with NDDs are at a higher risk for sleep
problems, earlier screen exposure may precipitate sleep
problems sooner and cascade down a negative trajectory
in emotional/behavioral development over time.[33] In
particular, the present study found sleep problems but
not daily sleep duration to mediate the relationship between age of first screen exposure and emotional/
behavioral problems, suggesting that the qualitative disruption of sleep may be more important than the quantitative displacement of sleep.

###### Strengths and Limitations of the Present Study
Study strengths include the use of developmental functioning screening, sleep and EBD measures with good
psychometric properties, the large sample size and high
participation rates of invited participants, and diversity and
representativeness of the sample recruited from Department of Child Development-KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which sees the largest number of children
referred for developmental concerns in Singapore. This
study also expands screen use operationalization by ex


amining other screen variables besides screen time, such as
bedroom screen devices and age of first screen exposure.
At the same time, the study’s findings should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, its cross-sectional
design limits the ability to draw directional/causal connections between screen use, sleep, and EBDs. Other
studies have suggested bidirectional relationships.[34] A
longitudinal design will allow better interpretation of
effects over time and impact on developmental trajectories, and hence a short-term follow-up study is currently
underway. Second, the study relied on parent-reported
measures, which may be subject to demand characteristics, reporting subjectivity or errors, and/or missing data.
The measures used were screening tools, and there were
no direct assessments of actual screen time, sleep duration, or behavior. The relatively large amount of missing
data in the composite measures of screen time and sleep
duration is largely likely due to ambiguous interpretation
of the question item “single weekday/weekend” to denote
1 day (and not 5 days or 2 days, respectively); this may to
some extent also explain the nonsignificant associations
between screen time and EBDs, contrary to what other
studies found.[18] Third, the ASQ-3 was designed as
a screening tool for categorically identifying developmental delay, but for the study’s purposes, raw
scores were standardized to make a continuous scale for
more fidelity in the degree of developmental delay. Ideally, a developmental assessment scale could be used,
such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) or Vineland Adaptive Behavior
Scales (Vineland-3), but this was not part of the clinic’s
routine administration and not feasible within the scope,
timeframe, and resources of the present study. Although
participants were diagnosed clinically by a multidisciplinary team using evidence-based clinical diagnostic methods
and tools, these diagnoses were not additionally confirmed by the research team. Other factors, such as parental depression, were also not included.

###### Future Directions, Implications, and Recommendations
For Research
Future studies may utilize more objective measures such
as electronic monitoring for screen use and actigraphy for
sleep, corroborated with informant reports, although these
studies may pragmatically be smaller in sample size


-----

of variance in EBDs in children with NDDs. This points
toward other possible variables being implicated in addition to the ones studied here. For example, parental
depression may be implicated. Other possible mediating
processes are also likely implicated, for example, screen
use interfering with parent-child interactions or displacing social relationships,[35] which may consequently affect
the child’s emotional/behavioral functioning, and these
would be important to investigate in future studies.
A recent study on parental mobile technology use
highlighted that parents of young children experience
conflicts within themselves about screen use for work or
family purposes yet recognize that too much screen use
can disrupt family routines and induce stress.[36] It may be
useful to investigate how this internal conflict and stress
experienced by parents around screen use may affect
parent-child interactions and EBD in children.

For Policy and Practice
This study’s cross-sectional findings in a multiethnic
Asian sample of children with NDDs provide some support
for AAP’s recommendations to keep children’s bedrooms
free from screen devices, to encourage caregivers in
cosleeping cultures to reduce and avoid screen use in
bedtime routines and while their children are sleeping, and
to discourage screen use before 18 months of age. This
could pave the way for psychoeducation as part of routine
pediatric clinic visits, parenting classes, school curriculum,
and hospital- or government-endorsed policies regarding
healthier screen use, particularly in groups at a higher risk
for excessive screen use, such as in children with NDDs.

children might gravitate toward the
chapter on resilience in homeless children
and youth. For those interested in health
implications, she briefly touches on possible stress-related health consequences of
resiliency in the final chapter, although
she could have devoted more space to
this topic and to her interpretation. The
“Conclusions and Future Directions”
chapter provides a succinct summary of
the research and lessons learned for the
general reader.
Dr. Masten does acknowledge limits
of the field, including differing opinions
among researchers on how to define and
measure resilience. She concludes by
emphasizing the importance of using the
knowledge gained through resilience
research to help promote resilience in
children in a world in which there are
growing concerns about economic, environmental, and health crises across
many sectors. Her final note is positive,
highlighting opportunities to foster
resilience in young children that can
then lead to better outcomes for generations to come. Overall, Ordinary
Magic is informative, well considered in
its breadth, and thought provoking.

In Ordinary Magic, Dr. Masten
describes the history, progress, and current state of research on resilience in
children and youth. Her target audience
includes established and burgeoning
resilience scholars, as well as professionals in related fields of science,
education, medicine, and social science.
Dr. Masten begins part I with a conceptual overview by introducing the
topic and defining terminology, reviewing the history of resilience science, and
describing resilience models. In part II,
she transitions to studies of individual
resilience, including a longitudinal study
assessing resilience in a community
sample, research exploring resilience in
homeless children, and studies of resilience during mass trauma, such as war,
terrorism, and disasters. Part III segues to
adaptive and protective systems in resilience. Dr. Masten first elucidates the
protective factors that have been consistently identified across studies. She
then summarizes the research on neurobiology of adaptive systems, including
attachment, adaptive thinking and problem solving, executive function and selfregulation, stress regulation and coping,
and reward systems. Dr. Masten moves
on in the final chapters of part III to
describe resilience in the context of
families, schools, and culture.
Part IV is entitled “Moving Forward:
Implications for Action and Future Research.” In this section, Dr. Masten puts
forth what she describes as “a resilience framework for action,” which
includes the following 5 components:
mission, models, measures, methods, and
multilevel/multidisciplinary approaches.
She highlights each component, focusing
on including strengths and positive aspects


in models, tracking the positive outcomes,
preventing risk/adversity, increasing
resources, mobilizing adaptive systems,
and involving multiple disciplines at
multiple levels. In the final chapter of
part IV, Dr. Masten summarizes the book
and expands upon her key conclusions.
With only minor flaws, including a
few scattered typos, this text successfully
provides a comprehensive overview of
resilience in child development. Emphasizing that resiliency is not a trait in itself
and that it can vary over time and under
different circumstances, Dr. Masten tackles the interesting idea that certain attributes are both protective of and threatening
to resilience. For example, she describes
more advanced cognitive skills as being
both protective (by improving problemsolving abilities) and threatening (by
increasing a person’s awareness of danger,
which can lead to increased stress). Readers with interest in child development will
appreciate the developmental approach
Dr. Masten takes in this book. She suggests
that the timing of exposures to extreme
stressors with respect to developmental
levels of the child is critical and considerably affects the manifestation of resilience,
particularly during “windows of opportunity for change.”
One of the primary strengths of Ordinary Magic is the range of perspectives
from which resilience is considered. In
addition to resilience researchers, this
book holds appeal for a variety of other
professionals. Chapters are segmented by
theme, allowing readers to choose the
sections that are most applicable to their
interests. Teachers or school administrators, for example, might find the
chapter “Resilience in the Context of
Schools” illuminating. Social workers or
