Abstract

Background: Autism impacts the lives of the family looking after a child with the condition in different ways, and
forces family members to modify their daily lives to suit their reality. To our knowledge, no previous research
investigated concern and considerations of parents/caregivers of children with autism in Qatar or the Arabic
speaking Middle Eastern region.
Methods: Caregivers of a child who was between the age of 3 to17 years old at the time of the study and who
was diagnosed with ASD (Autistic Group or AG) were recruited from the two main developmental pediatric and
children rehabilitation clinics in Qatar. The control group (non-autism group, or NAG) was represented by
caregivers of a non-autistic child between the age of 3 to 17 years old at the time of the study and who were
visiting a family clinic of a primary health care facility for routine medical check-up. Data collected from both
groups included related to the child (e.g. the child’s date of birth, his/her relation to the caregiver, number of
siblings, number of hours of sleep in a day, number of hours spent watching television or videos prior to age 3,
time spent indoors prior to age 3, absenteeism from school, and use of a nanny to care for the child) and to the
caregiver (education level, profession, level of consanguinity using the phylogram method). In addition to these
questions, caregivers in the AG were asked specific questions around maternal concern and considerations in
respect to the future of their children and the specialized services they receive.
Results: Children in the autism group spent more time indoors, watching television, or sleeping than children in
the non-autism group. Only around 40% of caregivers in the autism group said they would encourage their child to
get married and become a parent when s/he grows up. A number of caregivers of children with autism frequently
utilize specialized rehabilitation services; others did express their needs for these services and made comments
about having to wait a long time before they were provided with some of the services. Religious faith helped
caregivers in accepting having a child with autism. General health-related quality of life did not differ significantly
between the caregivers of the two groups, although mental health was consistently poorer in the autism group of
caregivers.

Conclusions: The study draws attention to the concerns of the families of children with autism and their
expectations about the future of their children. The findings can be used by policy makers in planning services to
support these families in Qatar.

Background
Children with autism may present a clear psychological
concern to their parents and caregivers. Factors such as
lack of functional independence, severe maladaptive
behaviors and severity of autism were strongly linked to
poorer quality of life (QoL) [1]. In addition, physical
health issues which are recently becoming recognized in
the literature and the volume of hours spent looking
after a child with autism can also contribute to caregiver
burden [2-4]. There are also financial concerns associated with raising a child with autism which impacts on
the society and families. A recent study showed that
children with autism cost their families more than children with physical disability and three times as much as
their typical peers [5]. Maternal pessimism was found to
be associated with functional independence and severity
of autism, the characteristics of the mother (lower levels
of pessimism) were predictive of more positive mother–
child relationships [6]. A plethora of psychosocial problems affecting caregivers of children with autism
ranging from stress, depression, anxiety, restrictions of
roles and activities, strain in marital relationships and
diminished physical health were reported in the literature [7,8]. To our knowledge, no previous research has
assessed the concerns and pessimism of parents/
caregivers of children with autism in Qatar or the
Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern region. There is undoubtedly a need to investigate how caring for a child
with autism affects the lives of the parents/caregivers
and to develop comprehensive health care strategies that
not only target the persons diagnosed with autism, but
also cares for and supports those who are in direct daily
contact with someone with autism. This research project
seeks to explore these relationships and to specifically
assess the level of concern and pessimism of the primary
caregiver of a child with autism in Qatar.

Methodology
Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from
the Medical Research Centre of Hamad Medical Corporation and Shafallah Medical Genetics Center. Caregivers
of a child who was between the age of 3 to17 years old
at the time of the study and who was diagnosed with
autism using established screening and diagnostic tools
(the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS); the Autism
Diagnostic Interview (ADI); the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule-General (ADOS-G); or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)) were invited to participate in
this cross-sectional exploratory study (Autism Group or
AG) from the two main developmental pediatric and
children rehabilitation clinics in Qatar [9,10]. Exclusion
criteria were the presence of chronic medical conditions
that might interfere with study, recent (<2 months)


initiation of behavior therapy, and/or recent (<2 months)
changes in the nuclear family’s life (marriage, divorce,
death of a family member).
The non-autism group (NAG) was represented by
caregivers of a typically developing child between the
age of 3 to 17 years old at the time of the study and who
were visiting a family clinic of a primary health care facility for routine medical check-up. Exclusion criteria in
the NAG were the presence of a household child with
autistic disorder, other neurodevelopental disorder,
psychotic disorders, and/or recent (<2 months) changes
in nuclear family’s life (marriage, divorce, death of a
family member).
During a scheduled visit to the clinic, eligible participants from both groups (i.e. AG and NAG) were provided with information about the study and asked if they
would participate. Those who agreed, signed informed
consent. Demographic and information related to the
child’s life at home were collected from both groups and
included information related to the child (e.g. the child’s
date of birth, his/her relation to the caregiver, number of
siblings, number of hours of sleep in a day, number of
hours spent watching television or videos prior to age 3,
time spent indoors prior to age 3, absenteeism from
school, and use of a nanny to care for the child) and to
the caregiver (education level, profession, level of consanguinity using the phylogram method) [11]. In
addition to these questions, caregivers in the AG were
asked specific questions relating to maternal concern
and considerations related to the future of their children
and the specialized services they receive. These questions included whether the caregiver will encourage the
child to marry or have children and how accepting the
caregiver was of having a child with autism. They also
included a question about whether religious faith helped
the caregiver accept having a child with autism, and a
set of questions related to the specialized services provided by the health care system or that the caregiver
wished to receive were asked. The questions were developed utilizing information about maternal concern in
the published literature and a consultative process and
meetings that included members of the research team
with pediatricians specializing in neurodevelopmental
disorders, and other healthcare providers who work
closely with families with children diagnosed with autism

[12].
Quality of life was assessed using the Lebanese Arabic
version of the Standard Recall SF-36v2 obtained through
license from QualityMetric Incorporated. The SF-36v2
was interviewer-administered to all participants to protect against bias associated with issues of literacy.
Quality of life data manipulation, entering, and scoring
followed instructions provided in the SF-36v2 Health
Survey: A Primer for Health Care Providers.

Data were managed according to standard epidemiological practice. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS[W]) version 18.
Chi-Square was used to assess change between group
variables (categorical data) and the Student’s t-test
assessed differences between group variables (numerical
data). Statistical significance was set at p value of <0.05.
Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the
association between QoL variables and patient
demographics.

Results
Sample characteristics
From a total of 100 caregivers eligible for inclusion in
the AG group and invited to participate in the study, 56
(56%) gave consent and ultimately provided data. Forty
eight caregivers of a neurotypically-growing child (NAG)
from a total of 100 approached participated (48%). The
remaining 44 AG children and 52 NAG children were
unable to be contacted despite numerous attempts.
Given the high mobility of families in Qatar this response rate is not alarming. No statistically significant
difference in the education level was found between the
two groups of caregivers (p > 0.05).

As illustrated in Table 1, the majority of the respondents in both groups of caregivers held professional jobs
or were homemakers (or retirees) (p > 0.05).
While most of the spouses in the two groups were not
consanguineously related, about 8% of the AG and 3% of
the spouses in NAG were double-first cousins (where
two siblings marry two siblings). The number of siblings
of the selected child of the parent/caregiver in each
group is listed in Table 2. AG children had more siblings
than NAG children (average of 2.6 for AG and 2.2 for
NAG, p = 0.002) but looking at the full distribution we
see that a higher percentage of NAG children had 2 or 3
siblings.
The number of mothers interviewed was more than
twice the number of fathers (64 to 27; p < 0.05). In the
AG, 23 fathers were interviewed (mostly caretakers of
their sons) while in the NAG only 4 fathers were interviewed about their sons.
In the AG group, data were missing for sex of the
caregiver in 2 cases and the sex of the child in 1 case. In
the NAG group there were 4 children for whom the sex
of the caregiver was not collected.
The majority of children in the two groups had no
other health conditions (77% and 80% of the AG and
NAG, respectively). However, around 70% of the children in the AG were prescribed other medications for a
variety of acute and minor conditions (e.g., influenza,
ear infection, gastrointestinal problems).
The time that the child spent indoors, watching television or videos before age 3, and sleeping is presented in
Table 3. In the case where the child did the activity “all
day” this was coded to the maximum value of 22 h for
time spent indoors and 16 h for the television and video
watching hours.
The longest time a boy in the NAG spent indoors before the age of 3, on average, was 16 h. Two girls in this
group were reported to spend on average 22 h a day indoors before the age of 3.
When the data were stratified by sex we see that the
mean number of hours spent watching television before
the age of 3 for the AG boys is not significantly different
from the mean number of hours of the NAG group.
However, girls in the AG spent more time watching television before the age of 3 than girls in the NAG
(p ≤ 0.05). The AG boys have a statistically significant
lower number of sleeping hours before the age of 3 than
the NAG boys but for the girls there is no statistical
difference.
When asked if they would encourage their child to get
married when s/he grows up, 40% of the caregivers in
the AG said they would and 20% said they would not (p
< 0.05). The remaining 40% said they did not know if
they would encourage this child to ever get married.
Thirty eight percent of the caregivers in the AG would

encourage their child to become a parent when the child
gets older, but 18% said they would not (p < 0.05). The
remaining caregivers did not know if they would encourage their child to have children of their own.
Around 45% of the caregivers said they ‘now’ accept
having a child with autism compared to around 9% who
do not accept this reality (p < 0.05). However, over 45%
of the caregivers refused to answer this question. When
the child was first diagnosed, around 20% did not accept
the idea of having a child with autism compared to
around 22% who still do not accept this idea. Again, the
remaining caregivers did not wish to answer this question. When asked if their religious faith helped them
cope with the challenges of having a child with autism,
around 50% agreed that it did, and 48% declined to
answer this question.
Only 30 of the 56 caregivers in the AG (54%)
responded to the service questions. Of these, 57% indicated that special education classes are available for their
child, and the remaining said that these were not available and they desired these classes for other caregivers
(p < 0.05). Around 50% of parents said that (as caregivers) they have access to parent support groups to help
them cope, but 50% said they do not have access to such
services and that they wished that they did have access.
A small minority (3%) said there was no need for special
classes for caregivers of children with autism.
In respect to QoL, there appears to be no statistically
significant difference between QoL domains of the two
groups of caregivers, but caregivers in the AG rated their
health as poor and likely to get worse (p < 0.05). An analysis of the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS, respectively)
scores of the Short Form-36v2 revealed an overall poorer
mental health in the AG compared to the NAG although
neither reached statistical significance (p > 0.05). The
sex of the parent/caregiver appears to be associated with
several quality of life domains. Female caregivers suffered more bodily pain than men (p = 0.000). They also


had more fatigue and tiredness (low vitality) than men
(p = 0.003). They had more problems with work or other
usual activities as a result of emotional problems
(p = 0.039). Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores
indicated significantly poorer mental health among the
females in this study compared to males (p < 0.05).

Discussion
This study provides a snapshot of the concerns the caregivers of children with autism in Qatar harbor regarding
their child’s life, future, and care. Studies conducted elsewhere suggested that parents of children with autism
seem to experience more stress than parents of typically
developing children, and that maternal pessimism was
associated with functional independence and severity of
autism [12,13]. The degree of social impairment of the
child and the severity of his/her condition are believed
to be associated with the caregiver’s burden and concern

[12]. Our cohort of children in the AG spent more time
indoors, watching television or sleeping before the age
of 3 than children in the NAG, showing features of social deprivation, isolation, and low functional ability. The
long time a child spends indoor in this group could additionally reflect a tendency among caregivers of children
with autism to keep their children isolated from the outside world. This could be due to a perceived lack of
social and community understanding of the nature of
autism and may mirror the stigma attached with this
condition in the mind of the average person in this region. People may feel helpless and awkward when they
find themselves in a situation where they have to deal
with a child with autism or with his/her family, and this
feeling may be intuited by the caregivers of the children,
adding to their psychosocial burden.
Although it was assumed that the average time indoors until the age of 3 might be greater for girls with
autism, an effect of gender on time spent indoors has
not been demonstrated in this study. Whether greater
time indoors after the age of 3 as compared to neurotypical children continues to be shown as children age
will have to be investigated in future studies. The
amount of time spent indoors prior to the age of 3
could be an interesting risk factor to explore further

[14]. With respect to the watching of television, studies conducted elsewhere reported similar findings to
ours. For example, Chonchaiya and colleagues found
that children with autism spectrum disorders began to
watch television significantly earlier than controls and
spent more time watching television than typically
developing children [15]. Since television is nearly always watched indoors, separating out the affect of
being indoors versus watching television in and of itself would have to be considered. And as Larsson
et al., (2009) demonstrated, the issues may be exposure

to maternal smoking, low ventilation in the home and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flooring which this study did
not consider [14]. Interestingly, a study published in
2011 reported that adolescents with autism spectrum
disorders spent considerable time in discretionary activities, with watching television and using a computer
as the most frequent activities. The children in their
study also spent little time engaged in conversations or
doing activities with peers. This behavior could be perceived as a predictor for future development of the
child. Indeed, it had been suggested that greater time
spent in conversation and reading predicted future
decreases in severity of social impairment, and the way
that children and adolescents with autism spend their
free time may have implications for their development
and the course of their autism symptoms [16].
Questions related to the caregiver’s predictions about
the future of their child (getting married or having children) were used as indicators of the caregiver’s concerns.
Around half of the AG caregivers did not wish to answer
questions about whether they would encourage their
children to get married or become parents when they
grow up. This might be a reflection of the innate concern and pessimism these caregivers experience in


respect to the future of their children. Refusing to answer these set of questions could also be associated with
parental concern and stress. We had more fathers in the
AG than mothers, and studies have shown that concern
of fathers of children with intellectual disabilities was
associated with the experienced social acceptance of the
child, whereas in mothers it was the child’s behavioral
problems [17]. This could explain why so many respondents refused to answer these specific questions, all of
which had social implications. Another explanation
could be cultural, in that speculation on what will happen in a child’s life questions the tenent of one’s life
being in God’s (Allah’s) hands. However, the true reasons
of this phenomenon remain speculative. This is a limitation of our study and might be addressed through focus
groups in the future. Faith did help a number of the
caregivers of children with autism in coping. In an Islamic society like the one in Qatar, this should not be a
surprising finding. Islamic teaching emphasizes virtues
of endurance, resilience and acceptance of ill health, just
like good health and good fortune, as both are the will
of God and could be to test one’s faith and belief according to Islamic teachings. Indeed, studies on families of
children with autism reported that parents coped


-----

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756 0500/5/290

through their religious faith and other emotion-focused
strategies [18,19].
Interestingly, the number of fathers who answered our
questionnaires as the principal caregivers of their children with autism far exceeded the number of mothers in
our AG in this study. This is a somewhat unexpected
finding that suggests greater involvement of fathers in
the care of their children in an area that has traditionally
been dominated by mothers. However, another explanation is that given the societal penchant in the Middle
East for men to be in the public sphere more than
women, it could be that more fathers in our sample took
the AG child to the clinic than would be expected and
presented as the primary caretaker. Additionally, within
the Middle Eastern culture, often the male is considered
head of household and tends to speak on behalf of the
family.
While AG had slightly more siblings overall than NAG
siblings (Table 2), interesting suggestions can be made
from the comparison of the two groups. Nine percent of
the AG had no siblings as compared to 7% of the NAG.
Twenty-three percent of the AG only had one sibling as
compared to 14% of the NAG. At 2 siblings, the trend
reverses with 20% of the AG having 2 siblings and 33%
of the NAG having 2 siblings. In the AG group, only
27% had 3 siblings but 40% had 3 siblings in the NAG
group. This could indicate that, in some families, a decision is made to limit family size based on the fact that
there is an autistic child in the family who needs care although this conclusion would require further study.
While a number of caregivers in the AG utilize specialized services, like special education classes and parent
support groups, others said these services were unavailable
to them. Other studies overseas suggested that participation in such services reflects some degree of perceived
benefit, especially given the competing time and resource
demands of caring for a child with autism [20]. They also
concluded that support group participants are more likely
to be middle income and well educated individuals. Qatar
has made tremendous efforts towards improving and upgrading the available services in the last few years. The
two clinics from which participants in the study were
recruited provide a number of free services, which include
parent support group classes, speech therapy, music therapy, field trips, sibling day, and at least one of the two
clinics is actively planning for an adaptive physical education class to integrate sport in the comprehensive care
package for the the children. However, the expressed need
for special services among a subset of participants in this
study reflects some genuine caregivers’ concern about
challenges facing the service providers in Qatar at the time
of writing this manuscript, and possibly also reflects a degree of ignorance among caregivers about the availability of
some of these services . Based on informal communications


and interactions with staff, clinicians and families of children with autism during the course of this project, some of
the challenges include long waiting lists, inconsistent
provision of services, inadequacy in respect to staff numbers and expertise, complicated processes of referral, and
sometime language barriers between the service providers
and service beneficiaries.
Most of the QoL domains of caregivers of children
with autism reflected poorer mental health compared to
caregivers of neurotypical children, although the differences were not reaching statistical significance in most
of the domains compared. Only the General Health domain was significantly poorer in the AG caregivers. This
is the domain that reflects how respondents rate their
health and how they estimate it to become in future. It
was clear that caregivers of children with autism rated
their general wellbeing as poor and they were expecting
it to get worse.
There is so far no QoL instrument specifically designed
for use with caregivers of developmental disorders, including autism. Most of the instruments available were constructed as measures for caregiver’s burden or strain, and
only a few of them are autism-specific instruments

[21,22]. It is important to make a distinction between
these attributes of health and well-being; where burden
and strain are conceptually different from, and not necessarily synonymous with, health-related QoL. Indeed, it had
been articulated in the literature that the QoL of caregivers could be improved even with the pressures in their
lives. It has been suggested that the focus in caregiving research on burden should be supplemented with an emphasis on QoL [23].
The results of our study may suffer from information
bias. The persons who reported that they were the primary caregiver (usually the biological mother or the
father) may not have been the actual day-to-day caregiver. We allowed the caregiver to self-identify as we
could not ask the child with autism. Hence, realistically
the actual primary caregiver of the person with autism
in this population could have been the mother, the
father, or the nanny or housemaid. Housemaids are easily employed in Qatar through employment agencies.
However these caregivers are usually from a low socioeconomic class and with low literacy skills; thus not especially trained to work with people with special needs.
Another limitation was the large number of caregivers in
the AG who refused to answer questions relating to their
predictions of their child’s future, their acceptance of
having a child with autism, and the role of faith in helping them cope. While this is obviously an important
limitation, it does reflect a degree of innate concern and
pessimism, thus providing further proof to the degree of
anxiety, concern, and pessimism these caregivers might
be feeling.

One of the major limitations of our work was the poor
response rate. Only 56% of the 100 families with autistic
children were able to be contacted and interviewed. For the
controls it was only 48%. This would likely introduce
response bias. However, with respect to the AG families,
mobility in Qatar is so frequent and spans socio-economic
strata that we may have in fact captured a random selection
of families with autistic children. With respect to the NAG,
the research assistants (students) systematically collected
the data, but were unable to contact all the 100 families
due to academic responsibilities. Therefore, the findings
from this study should be treated cautiously.

Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest innate concerns harbored by caregivers of children with autism and translated into pessimism about the future of the child in
respect to living a socially normal life (marriage, having children). Children with autism also spent more
time indoors before the age of 3 than neurotypically
developing children, which could be predictor for
greater social impairment in the future. The study
revealed areas relating to concerns about support provided to children with autism and their caregivers and
the status of these children in different aspects. The
findings should help health policy-makers provide better and more focused supports to the children with
autism and their families.
