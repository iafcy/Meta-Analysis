OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationships between media
use (television, computer, and video games) and sleep among boys with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or with typical development (TD).

METHODS: Participants included parents of boys with ASD (n = 49), ADHD
(n = 38), or TD (n = 41) (ages 8–17 years). Questionnaires assessed daily
hours of media use, bedroom access to media, and average sleep hours
per night.

RESULTS: Bedroom media access was associated with less time spent
sleeping per night, irrespective of diagnostic group. Bedroom access to
a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced
sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Multivariate models showed that, in addition to bedroom access, the
amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated
with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the relationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep
was mediated by hours of video game play.

CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that media-related variables
may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances
in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize
the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals
with ASD. Overall, the current findings suggest that screen-based media
time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may
be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in
children with ASD. Pediatrics 2013;132:1081–1089

Children with neurodevelopmental disorders are at increased risk for a variety ofsleep-related disturbances.[1] Sleep
problems are common among children with autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs), with prevalence rates ranging
from 50% to 80%,[2][–][5] and include high
rates of delayed sleep onset and night
waking.[6,7] Children with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also experience difficulties with sleep, including bedtime resistance and increased
difficulty falling asleep.[8] Sleep problems are more common among children with ASD or ADHD than among
typically developing (TD) children[9][–][11]
and can have detrimental effects on
daytime functioning for both children
and their families.[12][–][14]

The etiologies of sleep problems in
individuals with ASD or ADHD are multifaceted, including, for example, disruptionsincircadianrhythmsandmelatonin
regulation.[7,8]

Because these biological processes are
primarily influenced by the light/dark
cycle,[15] children with ASD or ADHD may
be particularly susceptible to sleeprelated environmental factors that
emit bright light, such as computer or
television screens.[16]

Screen-based media use is one wellestablished environmental correlate of
sleep problems in TD children.[16] Indeed,
in-room access to a TV, computer, or
electronic games has been shown to be
associated with less total sleep in previous studies.[17][–][20] Similarly, children
who spend more time using these media sleep less,[17,21][–][23] leading some
researchers to speculate that bedroom
access to screen-based media may have
an indirect effect on sleep.[16] However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has
specifically tested this indirect effect
hypothesis, nor has any study examined
how media use relates to sleep among
individuals with ASD or ADHD.

Screen-based media use may be a particularlyimportantvariabletoconsider


asitrelatestosleepinchildrenwithASD
and ADHD. Compared with TD children,
children with ASD or ADHD spend more
time playing video games and watching
TV,[24][–][27] exhibit higher rates of problematic game use,[28][–][30] and have more
difficulty disengaging from screenbased media.[31] This increased use
and preoccupation with screen-based
media, coupled with the potential influence of bright screens on melatonin
production and circadian rhythms,
might place individuals with ASD or
ADHD at greater risk for media-related
sleep problems than TD children.

The purpose ofthe current study wasto
examine the relationships between
bedroom media access, average media
exposure, and average time spent
sleeping. The first hypothesis was that
bedroom access (and average exposure) to screen-based media would be
associated with less time spent sleeping.Consistentwithresearchindicating
that individuals with ASD and ADHD are
atincreasedriskforsleepproblemsand
problems disengaging from screenbased media, our second hypothesis
wasthattherelationshipsbetweenmedia
use and sleep would be more pronounced in the ASD and ADHD groups
(relative to the TD group). Finally, consistent with research on media use and
sleep in the general population,[16] we
specifically tested the hypothesis that
in-room access to screen-based media
would have an indirect effect on total
sleep time through average media
hours.

### METHODS

Participants

Parents of boys with ASD, ADHD, or TD
wererecruitedforparticipationinastudy
on screen-based media use. Data from
boys taking melatonin (n = 14) were removed before analyses. Thus, the final
sample consisted of 128 boys (ASD = 49,
ADHD=38,TD=41)ranginginagefrom8
to 17 years (mean 6 SD: 11.8 6 2.5


years). The majority of the boys were
white (85%). Most participants earned
more than $41 000 per year (63%) and
were currently married (71%). Some
participants also indicated that their
child was taking medications associated
with insomnia (18%; eg, stimulants) or
drowsiness (28%; eg, a1 agonists) (see
Table 1 for demographic characteristics
by group).

Boys in the ASD group all had a previous
diagnosis of ASD, including autistic disorder (42.9%), Asperger’s disorder (26.5%),
or pervasive developmental disorder
not otherwise specified (30.6%). They
were recruited through an academic
medical center specializing in the
treatment and diagnosis of individuals
with ASD. The standard diagnostic
process includes evaluation by a physician and/or a psychologist and standardized diagnostic tools, such as the
AutismDiagnosticObservationSchedule[32]
and/or Autism Diagnostic Interview–
Revised.[33] Three boys with ASD had an
IQ of #70, and only 2 were reported
by parents to have no current use of
phrase speech.

Boys with ADHD all had a previous diagnosis of ADHD and were recruited
throughabehavioralanddevelopmental
pediatricsclinic atanacademicmedical
center.

Boys in the TD group were recruited by
word of mouth and with the use of flyers
placed in community locations and in
local general pediatric offices. They had
no previous diagnosis of ASD, ADHD,
or other developmental disorder (as reported by their parents); were not taking medications for developmental or
behavioral problems; and did not score
above clinical cutoffs on the diagnostic
screening measures described below.

income, current medications, and diagnostic information.

Current ASD Symptoms

Current ASD symptoms (past 3 months)
were measured by using the Social
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ).[34]
Parents respond to 40 “yes” or “no”
items, yielding a composite score ranging from 0 to 39. The SCQ has adequate
reliability,[35,36] as was the case here
(Cronbach’s a ranged from 0.62 to 0.81
across groups).

ADHD Symptoms

ADHD symptoms were measured by
using the 18-item ADHD Total score


from the Vanderbilt Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating
Scale.[37] Parents responded to items by
using a scale ranging from 0 (never) to
3 (very often). The Vanderbilt AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent
Rating Scale has shown adequate reliability in previous research,[38] as was
the case here (Cronbach’s a ranged
from 0.87 to 0.93 across groups), and
has been used in previous research
examining ASD samples.[39]

In-Room Access to Screen-Based
Media

Parents responded to 3 separate questions indicating whether their child had


in-room access to a (1) TV, (2) computer,
or (3) video game system.

Average Hours Spent Watching TV and
Playing Video Games per Day

Parents indicated the number of hours
per average weekday and per average
weekenddaytheirchild spent watching
TV and playing video games (on a computer or dedicated game system). The
average number of hours per day (for
each activity) was calculated by multiplying the weekend and weekday responses by 2 and 5, respectively, and
then dividing the sum of this total by 7,
consistent with previous research.[26,30]

Sleep Hours

Parents were asked “How many hours
does your child sleep per night?”

Analytic Approach

Totestour firsthypothesis,thebivariate
associations between in-room media
access and sleep, and the associations
betweendailyhoursofmediaandsleep,
were analyzed separately. Our second
hypothesis that the relationship between these variables differed as
a function of diagnostic group was
tested by using general linear models
(GLMs). Sleep hours served as the dependent variable; diagnostic group,
media variable, and group 3 media
variable interaction terms served as
independent variables. All GLMs controlled for the following variables
(which will not be mentioned further):
marital status, income, use of medications associated with insomnia or
drowsiness, and age. Our hypothesis
that the association between in-room
access to screen-based media and
time spent sleeping would be mediated
by the daily hours spent with that
particular media was tested by using 2
linear equations.[40] Mediation analyses
were conducted for average TV and
video game hours separately by group.

sleeping per night (r = 20.14, P = .12).
Boys with an in-room computer spent
less time sleeping per night (mean 6
SD: 7.9 6 1.2 hours) than boys without
an in-room computer (mean 6 SD: 8.7 6
1.0 hours; F[1,121] = 9.9, P = .002, d =
0.72), and boys with an in-room video
game system slept fewer hours per
night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6 1.1 hours)
than boys without an in-room system
(mean 6 SD: 8.8 6 1.0 hours; F[1,121] =
7.2, P, .01, d = 0.48). Additionally, the
amount of time spent playing video
games per day was negatively associated with the number of hours spent
sleeping per night (r = 20.50, P,
.0001).

Hypothesis 2: Group Differences in
the Relations Between Media Use
and Sleep

The relationship between having an inroom TV and sleep was moderated by
group (F[2,112] = 3.8, P = .03) (see
Fig 1). Post-hoc mean comparisons
using Tukey’s adjustment showed that
the association between having an inroom TV and sleep was pronounced
among the ASD group (t = 4.2, P, .001,
d = 0.78), but not among the ADHD
group (t = 0.55, P = .99) or the TD group
(t = 0.35, P = 1.0). Group diagnosis did
not moderate the relationship between
the average amount of time spent
watching TV per day and time spent
sleeping (F[2,109] = 0.93, P = .40). The
relationship between having an inroom computer and sleep also was
moderated by group (F[2,112] = 5.2,
P, .01) (see Fig 2). Post hoc mean
comparisons using Tukey’s adjustment
suggests that the association between
an in-room computer and sleep was
large in the ASD group (t = 3.7, P, .01,
d = 1.0) but negligible in the ADHD (t =
0.64, P = .99) and the TD (t = 0.19, P =
1.0) groups. The relationship between
in-room video game access and sleep
was found to be similar across groups
(F[2,112] = 1.0, P = .36). The relationship between sleep and time spent


### RESULTS

Only boys with complete data on the
variablesincluded ina specific analysis
were retained for that analysis. As
a result, different degrees of freedom
were observed across the models
reported below. Table 2 shows the zeroorder relationships between all continuous variables. All reported means
depict least square estimates.

Sample Characteristics

Groups differed on parental marital
status, total family income, and use of
medications associated with insomnia
or drowsiness and on SCQ and ADHD
Total scores but did not differ on age,
number of siblings, or race (see Table 1
for sample characteristics by group).
The ASD group had higher SCQ scores
than both the ADHD and TD groups
(Cohen’s ds = 1.2 and 2.0, respectively);
the ADHD group had higher SCQ scores
than the TD group (d = 0.71). The ASD


and ADHD groups had higher ADHD
Total scores than the TD group (ds = 2.1
and 2.4, respectively); the ASD and
ADHD groups did not differ on ADHD
Total scores.

A GLM showed that the average number
of hours spent sleeping per night did
not differ between the ASD, ADHD, or TD
groups. The ASD group spent more time
watching TV and playing video games
perdaythantheTDgroup(ds=0.54and
0.80, respectively); the ADHD group did
not differ from the ASD or TD group on
these measures.

Hypothesis 1: Media Use and Sleep

Boys with an in-room TV spent less time
sleeping per night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6
1.1 hours) than boys without an inroom TV (mean 6 SD: 9.0 6 0.9
hours; F[1,121] = 16.9, P, .001, d =
0.70). However, the average amount of
time spent watching TV per day was
unrelated to the number of hours spent

medications associated with insomnia
or drowsiness. Table 3 depicts all model
results by group. Only the significant
results are discussed. In the ASD group,
age and average video game hours per
day were negatively associated with
sleep, and boys with in-room access to
a TV slept less than boys without inroom access to a TV. No predictors
were significant in the ADHD group. In
the TD group, age was the only significant predictor, such that older boys
slept less per night than younger boys.

Hypothesis 3: Indirect Effects
(Mediation) of In-Room Media
Access on Sleep

In the ASD group, in-room access to
video games (ie, access to a computer
or dedicated game system) was associatedwithdailyvideogamehours(P,
.0001), and daily video game hours
were associated with less sleep after
accounting for the association between in-room game access and sleep
(P, .0001; see Fig 4A). The 95% confidence interval for the magnitude of this
indirect effect ranged from 20.42 to 2
1.50, suggesting significant mediation
(see Fig 4B). Notably, although in-room
access to a video game was associated
with less sleep (P, .001) in a simple
linear regression, this relationship
disappeared (P = .52) after controlling
for daily video game hours. That is,
among boys with ASD, the variance in
sleep hours accounted for by in-room
access to a game system and/or computer is largely transmitted through
average hours spent playing video
games per day. All other models testing
for mediation were nonsignificant and
are not discussed.

### DISCUSSION

This is the first study, to our knowledge,
to examine how access and exposure
to media relate to sleep among boys
with ASD, ADHD, or TD. Results showed
that in-room access to a video game


playing video games per daydiffered by
group (F[2,108] = 3.5, P = .03). This interaction was probed by inspecting the
bivariate correlations between sleep
hours and average video game hours
played per day as a function of group
(a scatterplot depicting the nature of
this interaction is shown in Fig 3).
These analyses showed that the relationship between sleep and average
video game hours per day among boys


withASDwas large(r = 20.70, P, .001).
This same pattern, although smaller,
held among boys with ADHD (r = 20.35,
P = .04) but was nonexistent in the TD
group (r = 20.10, P = .56).

Separate GLMs were also conducted
withindiagnosticgrouptodeterminethe
extent to which each of these mediarelated variables accounted for variability in sleep, the outcome variable,
while also controlling for age and

system was associated with less time
spent sleeping per night for all groups,
consistent with previous research.[17,19]
Interestingly, in-room access to a computer or TV was significantly related to
less sleep among boys with ASD but not
among those with ADHD or TD. Average
video game exposure per day was also


associated with less time spent sleeping in the ASD and ADHD groups but not
in the TD group. Among boys with ASD,
multivariate regression models examining the unique contribution of mediarelated variables to sleep revealed that
in-room TVs and average video game
hours per day were associated with


less sleep, above and beyond the effect
of additional media and sleep-related
variables. The results also indicated
that in-room access to video games
had an indirect effect on time spent
sleeping among boys with ASD.

Althoughthecurrentresultsindicatethat
media-relatedsleepeffectsaremarkedly
greater among children with ASD, the
reasons for this finding are unclear.
Perhaps the most intuitive explanation is
that exposure to video games, particularly at night, intrudes on the amount of
time that could be spent sleeping, otherwise known as the displacement hypothesis.[16] Because children with ASD
have more trouble disengaging from
screen-based media,[31] it may be more
likely that these media would contribute
to bedtime resistance and delayed sleep
onset for this group. Another possibility
is that exposure to brightly lit screens
may disrupt melatonin production,[41][–][45]

which could have a particularly detrimental effect on sleep quality in children
with ASD because they are already at
risk for abnormally low melatonin concentrations.[42][–][44] Alternatively, mediarelated physiologic arousal may interfere with sleep onset. For example,
video game play has been shown to increase physiologic arousal,[46] which
couldbe especially problematic if games
are played immediately before bedtime.
Given that children with ASD are at risk
for autonomic hyperarousal,[47,48] and
that hyperarousal has been linked to
insomnia in the general population,[49,50]

these potential physiologic effects may
be especially pronounced for children
with ASD.

Sleep-related disturbances are a clinically important issue for children with
neurodevelopmentaldisordersandtheir
families. For example, sleep problems
can exacerbate and worsen repetitive
and stereotypic behaviors,[51] inattention
and hyperactivity, and other problematic daytime behaviors.[52][–][54] Sleep problems can also interfere with learning

and cognition,[55] contributing to worsening functional impairment. Evidence
also suggests that problems with sleep
can adversely affect family functioning.[56,57] Although much of the data
reported on the relationship between
sleep problems and outcomes have
been correlational, treatment intervention studies suggest that efforts
aimed at treating sleep problems can
help mitigate daytime behavioral problems in children with ASD.[58,59]

Limitations and Future Directions

Our study provides important preliminary informationabout therelations
between screen-based media and sleep
in childrenwithASD and ADHD. However,
several limitations should be noted.
First, our measure of sleep consisted of
a simple parent-reported estimate of
averagenighttimehoursofsleep.Future
research should include more comprehensive standardized sleep measures,
including multidimensional tools that
assess different features of sleep, such
assleeponset,bedtimeresistance,sleep
duration, night waking, and parasomnias.[60] Additionally, the use of multiple
informants, sleep diaries, or objective
measures (eg, actigraphy) may also be
helpful.[61]

An additional limitation of the current
study is that we were unable to accurately assess the timing of screen-based
media use. As a result, although we
suspect that much of the reductions in
total sleep time in the current study are
related to nighttime (versus daytime)
media use, similar to previous research,[62] we cannot definitively say that
this is the case. Therefore, future studies
in individuals with ASD or ADHD should
include measures that better approximate prebedtime media exposure.[62]
Additionally, experimental designs[63] may
be especially helpful in investigating the
effect of screen-based media on both
sleep and daytime behavior in children
with ASD or ADHD. Such studies may
involve randomized assignment into
presleep media exposure versus no
exposure groups to investigate withinand between-subject effects. These
study designs would allow for the most
direct testingof hypothesizedprocesses
(eg, displacement, hyperarousal, melatonin interference) by which media exposure may affect sleep and behavioral
outcomes.

Finally, although diagnostic screening
instruments and information about
previous diagnoses were collected,
comprehensive diagnostic measures
were not administered as part of the

current study. Future research on media use and sleep in children with ASD
and ADHD should include gold standard
diagnostic tools to further examine the
relationships between these variables
among well-characterized samples.

Conclusions

The current findings suggest that the
associations between media exposure
and sleep are more pronounced among
boys with ASD than among boys with
ADHD or TD and suggest that in-room
access to screen-based media and
time spent playing video games may
place individuals with ASD at increased
risk for sleep problems. These findings
highlighttheimportanceofconsidering
screen-basedmediauseinbothresearch
and assessment of sleep problems in
children with ASD. Autism specialists
and primary care physicians should
routinely assess screen-based media
habits when addressing sleep problems in children ASD, because this may
represent an important intervention
target for improving sleep.

FLIGHT TO THE CITY: We live in a beautiful rural area of Vermont. The views of the
meadows, mountains, and farms are gorgeous. However, maintaining the yard
and animals is a lot of work. We cannot simply walk a few blocks or even a few
miles to a restaurant, and buying milk involves a two mile bike ride or walk. As the
children leave the nest, my wife and I keep thinking about returning to the city.
Evidently we are not alone in our thoughts.
As reported in The Wall Street Journal (August 9, 2013), baby boomers are
flocking to cities. Hip urban neighborhoods are the new hot spot – not only for the
young with money, but the middle-aged as well. Baby boomers have been migrating to the cities since the early 1990s. The movement slowed during the recession, but has picked up speed again. Based on online real estate brokerage
data, over the past decade, more than a million baby boomers have moved within
five miles of the downtown of the 50 largest cities in the US.
The reasons for the migration are myriad. Cities are now safer and cleaner,
offering immediate access to restaurants, theater, movies, concert venues, and
shops.Often,thecommutecanbeonfootorviapublictransportation.Withchildren
out of the house, baby boomers do not have to worry about schools or having
enough space for all the children and their friends. Many baby boomers like the
ethnic and age diversity of the city, preferring not to stay in the same spot with the
sameacquaintancesforever.Oneproblemwiththemigrationisthatthecosttolive
in these trendy areas continues to rise as baby boomers are competing for
a limited number of condominiums with other baby boomers and young adults.
WhileIdonotexpect wewillmoveanytimesoon,asIridethetwomilestobuysome
