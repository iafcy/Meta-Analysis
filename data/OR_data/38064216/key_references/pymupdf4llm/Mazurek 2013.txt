preoccupation with video games. Studies have shown that children with ASD
spend substantial amounts of time
playing video games,[1][–][3] have difficulty
disengaging from them,[4] and show
higher levels of problematic (addictive)
video game use than do children with
typical development.[5] Similarly, children
with ADHD exhibit greater problematic
video game use than do children with
TD,[6] and ADHD symptomsare associated
with greater time spent on video
games[7,8] and with greater problematic
game use.[8] Han et al[9] also found a reduction in problematic video game use
among children with ADHD after an
8-weektrialofmethylphenidate.Thisline
of research suggests that the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms
of ADHD may be closely related to
problematic video game use, as discussed in 2 recent reviews on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and
video game addiction.[10,11] Although video
game addiction is not a formal diagnosis, studies have found that it is
characterized by the same features as
other behavioral addictions, including
salience, tolerance, withdrawal, relapse,
mood modification, and conflict.[12][–][14] Additionally, theproblematicvideogameuse
construct can be reliably assessed,[15,16]

has good construct validity,[17] and is
associated with negative functional
outcomes.[18]

The primary diagnostic features of ASD
include impairment in social and communication skills and engagement in
restricted/repetitive behaviors.[19] These
core symptoms may be directly related to
the development of problematic video
game play patterns. Specifically, a tendency to develop encompassing preoccupations or intense interests may
lead to difficulty disengaging from video
games. The audiovisual and structural
features of video games, coupled with
their relative lack of social demands, may


also make them particularly reinforcing
for children with ASD. However, symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity are
also common co-occurring problems for
children with ASD,[20][–][22] which may also
relate to problematic game use. Given
that children with ASD and ADHD have
distinct diagnostic features, yet share
common symptoms and are at risk for
problematic video game use, a better
understanding of the relations among
these variables across diagnostic groups
is important. Surprisingly, studies have
not yet examined how these groups
compare in video game play or whether
the correlates of problematic game use
are similar across groups.

The current study investigated these
issuesby(1)comparingvideogameuse
in boys with ASD, ADHD, or TD and (2)
examining the relative contribution of
specific symptom types and game features in predicting problematic video
game use. Due to the significant gender
differencesinASDandADHDprevalence
and phenotypes[23][–][26] and the increased
risk for problematic game use among
boys,[12,18] the current study examined
video game use among boys only.

Thiswasthe firststudytoexaminethese
issues, so competing hypotheses were
tested. Specifically, if inattention and
hyperactivity largely account for variability in problematic video game use
across groups, no differences in video
game use would be expected when
comparing ASD and ADHD groups,
but significant differences would be
expected (for both groups) compared
with TD children. Alternatively, if problematic video game use is more closely
related to core ASD symptoms, differences would be expected when comparing ASD and ADHD groups.

### METHODS

Participants

The sample included parents of 56 boys
with ASD, 44 boys with ADHD, and 41
boyswithTD,ranginginagefrom8to18


(mean 11.7 years, SD 2.5 years). See
Table 1 for demographic information.

Participants with ASD were recruited
through an academic medical center
specializing in ASD diagnosis and
treatment and had been previously diagnosed with an ASD, including autistic
disorder (46.4%), Asperger’s disorder
(25.0%), or pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified (PDD
NOS) (28.6%), according to the center’s
clinical care model. The standard diagnostic battery generally includes
evaluations by a physician and/or
psychologist and the use of standardized tools, including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule[27] and/or
Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised.[28]
Only 4 participants had an IQ of #70,
and only 2 were reported by parents to
have no current use of phrase speech.
Participants with ADHD were recruited
through a university-affiliated developmental and behavioral pediatrics clinic,
and they all had been previously diagnosed with ADHD. See Table 2 fora list
of current medications.

Participants in the TD group were
recruited through the community with
the use of fliers and word-of-mouth
recruitment and had no previous diagnosis of ASD, ADHD, or other developmental disorder as reported by
parents.TDgroupparticipantsfellbelow

measures (described later) and were
not taking medications for behavioral
or developmental concerns.

Measures

Video game use was assessed by using
a questionnaire designed for the current study. Parents reported the number of hours per day their child spent
“playing video or computer games”
during out-of-school hours (data were
collected during months in which
school was in session). Parents provided separate estimates for “typical”
weekday and weekend days. An average

Group comparisons for continuous variables were conducted by using ANOVA; group comparisons for categorical variables
were conducted by using x[2] tests.


SCQ is a parent-report questionnaire
with strong reliability and validity.[32][–][34]
The Current form was used, focusing
on behavior over the most recent
3-month period. Items are rated as “Yes”
or “No” (totalpossiblescoresrangefrom
0 to 39). Cronbach’s a ranged from 0.62
to 0.83 across groups.

### RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

Groups did not differ by age, race, or
number of siblings. Group differences
in parent marital status and household
income were observed (see Table 1). A
1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
revealed that SCQ scores differed significantly across groups, F(2, 138) =
45.5, P, .001. Tukey post-hoc comparisons showed that the ASD group
had higher SCQ scores (mean 13.7, SD
5.6) than both ADHD (mean 8.1, SD 5.4,
P, .001) and TD groups (mean 4.4, SD
2.4, P, .001). The ADHD group also
had higher scores than the TD group
(P = .001). A 1-way ANOVA also showed
group differences on the ADHD Total
score: F(2, 138) = 60.2, P, .001. Tukey
post-hoc comparisons showed that the
ADHD group exhibited higher ADHD Total scores (mean 30.3, SD 12.1) than the
TD group (mean 7.5, SD 5.9, P, .001).
However, the ADHD and ASD (mean 28.0,
SD 12.0) groups did not differ.

Video Game Use

We examined diagnostic group differences in daily video game hours
using the general linear model while
controlling for household income (dichotomousvariable,1=income #$80 000,
and 2 = income .$80 000) and parent
marital status (dichotomous variable,
1 = married, and 2 = not married). The
results revealed significant diagnostic
group differences in daily video game
hours (Table 3). Bonferroni post-hoc
comparisons revealed that boys with
ASD spent more time playing video
games than did boys with TD (P = .01,

daily use variable was created by multiplying the weekday value by 5 and the
weekend value by 2, and dividing the
sum of these values by 7, consistent
with previous research.[1,5] Parents were
also asked: “Does your child have
a video game system in his room?”

Parents also listed their child’s 3 most
commonly played video games during
the past month. Game titles were coded
into mutually exclusive genre categories based on descriptions from the
Entertainment Software Rating Board
website and were cross-referenced
with descriptions from 2 popular gaming websites (Gamespot and IGN). Genre
categories included (1) action/actionadventure, (2) adventure, (3) role-playing,
(4) strategy, (5) puzzle/mini-game, (6)
educational, (7) fighting, (8) first-person
shooter, (9) music, (10) platform, (11)


racing, (12) simulation, (13) sports
simulation, and (14) fitness.

Problematic video game use was
assessed by using a modified version of
the Problem Video Game Playing Test
(PVGT).[15] The original PVGT was developed as a self-report measure of
problematic video game use based on
the behavioral addiction model[13] but
was modified in a previous study for
use with children.[5] This parent-report
version includes 19 items rated on a
4-point scale ranging from 1 (Never) to
4 (Always); total PVGT scores represent
a sum of all items. Cronbach’s a ranged
from 0.90 to 0.94 across groups.

Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity
symptoms were assessed by using the
Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
DisorderParentRatingScale(VADPRS).[29]
Items are rated on a 4-point scale
ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 (Very Often),
and the Inattention (9 items), Hyperactivity (9 items), and ADHD Total scale
scores were examined. The VADPRS has
good internal consistency, validity, and
reliability[30] and has been used in ASD
studies.[31] Cronbach’s a ranged from
0.87 to 0.94 across groups.

Current ASD symptoms were assessed
by using the Social Communication
Questionnaire–Current (SCQ).[32] The

not differ significantly from either
group.

In-Room Video Game Access

The x[2] tests revealed significant group
differences for in-room video game
access (Table 4). Post-hoc bivariate x[2]

tests showed that a greater percentage of both the ASD and ADHD groups
had in-room video game systems
compared with the TD group, (P = .001
and P = .002, respectively), whereas the
ASD and ADHD groups did not differ.

Video Game Genre

Dichotomous variables (coded 0 = no,
1 = yes) were created to indicate
whether each game genre was 1 of the
top 3 most frequently played. To reduce
thepossibilityofTypeIerror,aBonferroni
correction was applied by dividing the
a level (a = .05) by the number of total
comparisons (14), yielding an adjusted
significance level (a = .004). Two-tailed
Fisher exact tests comparing all 3
groups revealed significant differences
in the shooter and sports genres (see
Table 4). Post-hoc bivariate Fisher exact
tests showed that a greater percentage of the TD (P = .002) group preferred
shooter games compared with the
ASD group. Also, a greater percentage
of the TD group preferred sports
games compared with the ADHD group
(P = .001).

Problematic Video Game Use

Diagnostic group differences in PVGT

general linear model, controlling for

anddailyvideogamehours(acorrelate
of problematic game use in previous
research[12] and r = 0.51, P, .001 in the
current study). The results indicated
diagnostic group differences in PVGT
score (P = .001). Bonferroni post-hoc
comparisons indicated that the ASD
and ADHD groups had higher PVGT
scores than the TD group (P = .001, d =
1.12, and P = .03, d = .98, respectively).
However, the ASD and ADHD groups did
not differ (see Table 3).

Regarding video game genre preference, 1-way ANOVA revealed that boys
who played role-playing games had
higherPVGTscores(mean45.0,SD11.9)
than those who did not (mean 35.6, SD
10.7): F(1, 142) = 11.2, P = 001. A factorial ANOVA showed that the diagnostic group 3 role-playing game
interaction was nonsignificant, F(2,
135) = 1.7, P = .18, suggesting a similar
relationship between role-playing
preferences and PVGT scores across
groups.

Associations Between Symptoms
and Problematic Video Game Use

Subsequent analyses were conducted
separately by group to examine the
relative contribution of particular symptoms in predicting problematic video
game use.

ASD Group

PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.36, P = .008),
inattention (r = 0.48, P, .001), and
hyperactivity (r = 0.38, P = .004) but
not with SCQ (r = 20.01, P = .97). To


determine the relative contribution of
these variables to PVGT score, a simultaneous linear regression was conducted
withPVGTscoreasthedependentvariable
and daily video game hours, roleplaying genre, inattention, and hyperactivity as independent variables. The
results indicated that daily video game
hours (b = .29, t = 2.6, P = .01), roleplaying genre (b = .25, t = 2.2, P = .03),
and inattention (b = .43, t = 2.8, P = .01)
remained significant predictors of PVGT,
whereas hyperactivity was not a significant predictor (P = .54) when controlling for the other variables in the model.

ADHD Group

PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.47, P = .002)
and inattention (r = 0.37, P = .01) but
not with hyperactivity (r = 0.20, P = .19).
Linear regression results indicated
that daily video game hours (b = .49, t =
3.7, P = .001) and inattention (b = .36,
t = 2.1, P = .04) remained significant
predictors of PVGT, whereas hyperactivity and role-playing genre (P = .97
and P = .70, respectively) were not.

TD Group

PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.70, P, .001),
inattention (r = 0.55, P, .001), and
hyperactivity (r = 0.50, P = .001). Linear
regression results showed that daily
video game hours (b = .59, t = 5.9, P,
.001) and hyperactivity (b = .32, t = 2.9,
P = .006) remained significant predictors of PVGT, whereas inattention
and role-playing genre (P = .07 and
P = .87, respectively) were not.

### DISCUSSION

This is the first study to examine video
game use among boys with ASD compared with those with ADHD or TD.
Consistent with previous findings,[5]

exceeded the American Academy of
Pediatrics’ recommendation for combined screen-based media exposure.[35]
The estimates of daily video game time
for both ASD and TD groups were highly
consistent with those from another
recent study of similarly aged children[5]
and extend those findings by including
a comparison group of boys with ADHD.
Estimates of video game hours per day
in children with ADHD have not been
previously reported, yet our findings
were also consistent with a small study
showing that children with ADHD and
TD did not differ on broader measures
of game play frequency or duration.[6]

Importantly, the current study extends
previous findings with regard to problematic patterns of video game play.
Boys with ASD and boys with ADHD
demonstrated significantly greater
problematic video game use than did
boyswithTD,whereastheASDandADHD
groups did not differ from one another.
These findings replicate and extend
previous research that has found differencesinproblematicvideogameuse
whenseparatelycomparingASDandTD
groups[5] and ADHD and TD groups.[6] To
further explore this issue, we examined the role of particular symptoms in


relation to problematic video game
use. Among boys with ASD, problematic
video game use was positively correlated with inattention and hyperactivity
but not with overall ASD symptoms.
Furthermore, in multivariate models,
hyperactivity was not a significant
predictor of problematic video game
use beyond the effects of game play
variables, whereas inattention was
significantly associated with problematic video game use across the ASD and
ADHD groups.

These results shed light into potential
associated features of problematic
game use and are consistent with
previousstudieslinkingimpulsivityand
inattention with problematic video
game use.[6,8,18] Children with ASD and
those with ADHD experience difficulties
with impulse control and response inhibition,[36] and these problems appear
to be closely related to video game
preoccupation. In contrast, core ASD
symptoms were not associated with
either hours of video game play or
problematic video game use. Longitudinal studies among children with ASD
will be essential to determine whether
attention problems contribute to maladaptive video game use, whether


problematic video game use leads to
attention problems, and whether there
are bidirectional influences (as in
general population studies).[7]

This was also the first study to examine
game genre preferences among children with ASD compared with other
children. A somewhat greater, though
not significantly different, percentage
of boys with ASD preferred role-playing
games (eg, the Pokémon series) compared with boys with TD. This finding
is noteworthy, because role-playing
games have been associated with
problematic video game use in previous
studies.[37][–][39] In fact, boys who preferred
role-playing games had higher problematic video game use than did those
who did not. This relationship remained
significant even when controlling for
additional game- and symptom-level
variables in multivariate regression
models. These results suggest that
game genre may provide its own unique
contribution in the prediction of problematic game use, above and beyond
the effects of other well-known correlates of problematic game use. Moreover, boys with ASD who prefer this
genre may be at even greater risk for
negative game-related sequelae.

Interestingly, boys with ASD were much
lesslikelythanboyswithTDtoplay firstperson shooter games. Because we did
notassessthereasonsforgamechoice,
wecanonlyhypothesizethereasonsfor
this difference. First-person shooter
games are fast-paced, audiovisually
intense, and violent, and game play
often results in increased physiologic
arousal.[40,41] Given that individuals with
ASD are at increased risk for anxiety[42]
and sensory reactivity,[43,44] these types
of games may be less appealing for
many individuals with ASD.

Finally, the results showed that boys
with ASD or ADHD had greater in-room
access to video games than did boys
with TD. It is possible that their preoccupation with games results in


-----

increased access. Alternatively, greater
access may lead to more problematic
use or preoccupation. Another possibility is that parents of children with
ASD or ADHD may offer increased access to these media as a means of
managing difficult behavior. This idea
has been discussed in other studies of
families of children with ASD[4] and disruptive behavior disorders.[45]

### LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Primarylimitationsofthecurrentstudy
included reliance on parent-report
measures and a lack of comprehensive measures for diagnostic confirmation. Future studies should include
a multimethod, multi-informant approach, including gold standard diagnostic tools, to evaluate the impact of
particular symptoms on screen-based
media use. Although overall ASD symptoms, as measured by the SCQ, were not
related to problematic game use, the
use of multidimensional measures of
core symptoms may yield different results. In particular, specific difficulties

problems related to video game play,
including excessive and problematic
video game use. Attention problems, in
particular, are associated with problematic video game play for children
with ASD and ADHD, and role-playing
games appear to be related to problematic game use particularly among
children with ASD. Although longitudinal research is needed to examine the
outcomes of problematic video game
use in these special populations, generalpopulationstudieshaveshownthat
problematic game use can have significant detrimental effects.[19] Thus, the
current findings indicate a need for
heightened awareness and assessment of problematic video game use in
clinical care settings for children with
ASD and ADHD.
