**IMPORTANCE It is unclear to what extent the duration of screen time in infancy is associated**
with the subsequent diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

**OBJECTIVE To examine the association between screen time in infancy and the development**
of autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed data from mother-child**
dyads in a large birth cohort in Japan. This study included children born to women recruited
between January 2011 and March 2014, and data were analyzed in December 2020. The
study was conducted by the Japan Environment and Children’s Study Group in collaboration
with 15 regional centers across Japan.

**EXPOSURES Screen time at 1 year of age.**

**MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome variable, children diagnosed with autism**
spectrum disorder at 3 years of age, was assessed using a questionnaire administered to
mothers of the participating children.

**RESULTS A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. The prevalence of children**
with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age was 392 per 100 000 (0.4%), and boys were
3 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than were girls.
Logistic regression analysis showed that among boys, when “no screen” was the reference,
the adjusted odds ratios were as follows: less than 1 hour, odds ratio, 1.38 (95 % CI, 0.71-2.69;
_P = .35), 1 hour to less than 2 hours, odds ratio, 2.16 (95 % CI, 1.13-4.14; P = .02), 2 hours to_
less than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.48 (95% CI, 1.83-6.65; P < .001), and more than 4 hours, odds
ratio, 3.02 (95% CI, 1.44-6.34; P = .04). Among girls, however, there was no association
between autism spectrum disorder and screen time.

**CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among boys, longer screen time at 1 year of age was**
significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age. With the rapid
increase in device usage, it is necessary to review the health effects of screen time on infants
and to control excessive screen time.

utism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested to
be associated with congenital factors, such as genomic mutations[1-4] and prenatal, perinatal, and neo
# A

natal risk factors.[5-7] In addition, abnormalities in brain morphologyandfunctionhavebeenobservedinchildrenwithASD
since early childhood.[8,9] In studies conducted in 2019 and
2020, it has been reported that as a postnatal environmental
factor, duration of screen time may be associated with ASD
characteristics[10,11] and brain morphology specific to ASD.[12]

Thus, screen time during infancy, a period of rapid development, may be one of the acquired factors that may be associated with ASD.
In 2019, the World Health Organization published guidelinesonhealthyphysicalactivity,sedentarybehavior,andsleep
in children younger than 5 years of age, stating that children
should not be exposed to screens at 1 year of age or younger.[13]

The American Academy of Pediatrics has also recommended
that children should not be exposed to screens until they are
18 months of age; warnings about the adverse effects of screen
exposure on the health of children have been issued.
In Japan, the most frequent age at diagnosis for ASD is 3.0
years.[14] However, there are few large cohort studies that have
focusedonprolongedscreenexposureandASDininfancy.Furthermore, amid the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid change in lifestyles, with
electronic devices being used as the main channels of communication and social interactions; thus, screen time among
children has increased worldwide.[15-17] Amid this social climate, examining the associations of screen exposure with a
child’s health is an important public health issue.
Therefore, this study aimed to examine the association of
screen exposure (an environmental factor) with the development of ASD during early childhood. To achieve this objective,weexaminedtheassociationbetweenscreentimeat1year
of age and the presence or absence of ASD diagnosis at 3 years
of age based on parental responses using data derived from a
large Japanese birth cohort study (the Japan Environment and
Children’s Study).

### Methods

#### Study Design and Participants
We conducted a large birth cohort study in Japan. The Japan
Environment and Children’s Study Group operated in collaboration with 15 regional centers across Japan. Its protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Ministry of the Environment’s
InstitutionalReviewBoardonEpidemiologicalStudiesandthe
ethics committees of all the participating institutions. Approximately 100 000 pregnant women were recruited to participate in the study, and all of the participants provided written informed consent.[18] The research was conducted in
accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health
Research Involving Human Subjects established by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The recruitmentperiodwasfromJanuary2011toMarch2014,andthedata
were analyzed during December 2020. The data used were de

rived from the strictly controlled jecs-ta-20190930-qsn data
set, which was released in October 2019. The target population was selected as follows: first, the study included 100 304
live births of the 104 062 fetal records. Consequently, 382 stillbirths and 1254 miscarriages were excluded. We also excluded 2122 individuals with missing data once we calculatedlivebirths,stillbirths,andmiscarriages.Next,weexcluded
6449 children with cerebral palsy, a congenital condition, at 1
year of age, which may have influenced screen time. We also
excluded 9825 children with missing data once we calculated
congenital diseases or cerebral palsy. Finally, 84 030 motherchild dyads were included in the analysis (Figure).

#### Variables
The main exposure variable was screen time at 1 year of age,
which was assessed using a questionnaire. When their child
turned 1 year of age, the mothers were asked about the number of hours spent per day they let the child watch TV or DVDs.
The responses were collected as variables and categorized as,
“none (no screen time),” “less than 1 hour,” “1 hour or more
but less than 2 hours,” “2 hours or more but less than 4 hours,”
and “4 hours or more.” When the participating child turned 3
years of age, we asked mothers the same question. The outcomevariable,ASDat3yearsofage,wasassessedusingaquestionnaire. Specifically, mothers were asked the following question when their child turned 3 years of age: “Have they ever


-----

been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (eg, autism,
pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger’s syndrome) by
a doctor from the age of 2 years until now?” An option of 2 responses was provided, namely, with and without ASD, which
were labeled as “yes (ASD)” or “no (no ASD),” respectively.
Previousstudieshaveindicatedthatmaternalnurturingattitudesandabusemaybeassociatedwithscreentime.[19-21] Therefore,thefollowingfactorsservedasadjustmentvariables:scores
ontheKesslerPsychologicalDistressScale(K6)andBondingScale
when the child was 1 year of age; depression, anxiety disorders,
integrationdisorders,andothermentalandneurologicalillnesses;
mother’s age at delivery; and household income. In addition,
when examining the association between ASD at 3 years of age
and screen time at 1 year of age, we considered that predisposition to ASD may affect the outcome and may be attributable to
reversecausality.Weusedparticipantscoresoneachofthe5Ages

ofageiscurrentlydifficulttodiagnose,theASQ-3wasusedinthis
study, and all of its 5 items were used as adjustment variables.
Each adjustment variable is described below. The Japanese version of the K6 scale was used to assess depressive
tendencies,[24] and the cutoff value was set at 5 points or more
(Japanese version).[25] A score above the cutoff value of K6 (≥5
points) indicated poor mental health. The Japanese version of
the Bonding Scale was used to assess mother-child attachment. The scale consists of 10 questions and can yield a maximum score of 30 points; higher scores indicate more negative
feelings toward one’s baby.[26] However, no clear cutoff value
was assigned for this scale; therefore, it was treated as a continuousvariable.Asyoungermothersareatriskofabuse,acutoffvalueof19yearsoryoungeratthetimeofdeliverywasused.
Because poverty is also a risk factor for abuse, the poverty line
reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (annual household income ≤¥ 1.27 million [$11 060.41 USD) was
used as the standard,[27] and the lowest income item (<¥ 2 million [$17 417.96 USD]) was used as the cutoff value for responses related to annual household income. The calculation
of the poverty line reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare is based on the standards of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development standards. For the
5 ASQ-3 items, we used the cutoff values specified for the Japanese version.[28]Additionally, because there are sex differences in ASD,[1,29] sex was used as a stratification variable to examine sex differences in the results.

#### Statistical Analysis
First, we aggregated the key variables by screen time at 1 year
of age and at 3 years of age, and examined their attributes.
Thereafter, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated to


examine the association between screen time and ASD. In addition,becausesexdifferenceshavebeenreportedintheprevalenceofASD,weexaminedtheinteractionbysexandthenconductedasex-stratifiedanalysis.Inthetrendtestintheadjusted
model, the categorical variable (screen time) was statistically
examined as an ordinal variable (continuous variable). Jonckheere-Terpstra tests were conducted to examine the association between screen time at 1 year of age and 3 years of age.
The statistical significance level was set at .05 and 2-tailed.
SPSS, version 27 (IBM), was used for statistical analysis.

### Results

#### Aggregate Proportions of ASD at 3 Years of Age to Screen Time at 1 Year
A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. In 330
(0.4%) of the 84 030 children included in the analysis, ASD had
been diagnosed at 3 years of age (Table 1). Of these, 251 were
[boys (76.0%) and 79 were girls (24.0%) (eTable 4 in Supple-](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
[ment 1). There were 83 237 responses for screen time at 1 year](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
of age and 74 554 responses for screen time at 3 years of
age (Table 1). Irrespective of whether the child had ASD at 3
years of age, at the age 1 year, less than 1 hour was the most
commonly provided response for daily screen time (Table 1).
The proportion of children with ASD increased as screen time
increased (Table 1). The attributes of children and
mothers by screen time are shown in Table 1 and eTable 3 in
[Supplement 1.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)

#### Association Between Screen Time at 1 Year and ASD at 3 Years of Age
Logistic regression analysis of the association between screen
time at 1 year and ASD at 3 years of age is shown in Table 2.
Longer screen time at 1 year of age was associated with the statistically significantly higher odds of ASD at 3 years of age. Furthermore, the longer screen time at 1 year of age was associated with the statistically significantly higher odds of ASD at
3 years of age in boys. The distribution of screen time was similar across the sexes (Table 1). However, among girls, no association between screen time and ASD was found.

#### Association Between Screen Time at 3 Years and ASD at 3 Years of Age
The results of the trend test between screen time at 1 year of
age and at 3 years of age showed that screen time at 1 year of
age was statistically significantly associated with screen time
at 3 years of age (Table 3). Namely, as the screen time increased, the proportion of children with ASD at 3 years of age
also increased (Table 2). Moreover, logistic regression analysis reported that screen time at 3 years of age was not associated with ASD at 3 years of age (Table 3).

time at 1 year of age and ASD at 3 years of age, irrespective of
potential maternal maltreatment or predisposition to ASD at
1yearofage.Inthisstudy,theprevalenceofASDamong3-yearold children was 0.4%, which is slightly lower than the prevalence of ASD among children younger than 5 years in Asia
(0.70%).[30,31] However, given that the prevalence of ASD increases with age, this study’s finding is comparable with those
of previous studies. In addition, the sex ratio of children with
ASD in this study is consistent with what has been observed
in previous studies conducted in Japan and abroad.[14,32,33] In
Japan, parents who are concerned about their child having a
developmental disability often visit medical institutions directly to receive a diagnosis. They could also receive a diagnosis after being advised to visit a medical institution for a possible developmental disability by an infant health checkup
(conducted at 4 months, 1 ½ years, and 3 years of age), nursery school, kindergarten, or elementary school. Medical institutions make a diagnosis of ASD based on the Diagnostic and
_Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition)._
Despite the World Health Organization and the American
Academy of Pediatrics recommendations,[13] 90% of the children in this study had been exposed to screens at 1 year of age.
Few studies on screen time at 1 year of age have been reported in other countries. According to a survey conducted by
the Cabinet Office in Japan, 85.7% of children younger than 1
year and 75.7% of 1-year-old children were using mobile
phones, and many of them shared mobile phones with their
parents.[34] Thus, at 1 year of age, child-rearing environments
may be associated with the development of ASD.


Multivariable analysis of the association between ASD and
screen time was conducted to account for the influence of maternal maltreatment and children’s predisposition on the result. Among boys, irrespective of their predisposition to ASD
at 1 year of age and maternal maltreatment factors, a longer
screen time at 1 year of age was associated with ASD at 3 years
of age.
In this study, we used the ASQ-3, which has a reported ASD
diagnostic accuracy of more than 80%, to adjust for the predisposition of ASD at 1 year of age. However, the diagnostic criteria for ASD include, “Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment”
and a strong response to visual information such as lights or
movement.[35] This screening is limited because it does not fully
reflect the characteristics of ASD. Therefore, we cannot deny
the possibility of reverse causality. However, even in that case,
screen time can be an effective indicator of ASD during early
screening. In addition, this study examined the association between screen time at 1 year of age and ASD by excluding children who received a red flag on any of the 5 ASQ-3 items at 1
[year of age (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), thereby helping the ar-](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
gument that screen time is a risk factor for the development
of ASD.
The results of previous studies that have investigated the
association between screen time and ASD in cross-sectional
studies are not consistent.[32,36-38] In this study, we examined
the association between ASD at 3 years of age, at a single point
in time, and screen time at the same age. The results showed
no association between screen time and ASD at 3 years of age.

4 hours of screen time. However, the results of the estimates
were close to the reference values before they were changed.
This indicates that the association of screen time at 1 year of
age with ASD diagnosis is still greater than at 3 years of age.
This may be because the association with environmental factors on brain development varies with age.


In addition to genetic factors, the role of environmental
factorshasbeennotedinASD.Electromagneticfieldshavebeen
cited as an environmental factor associated with health and
screen exposure.[39] Experiments using mice have demonstratedthatexposuretohigh-frequencyelectromagneticfields
affects neurotransmitters[40] and behavior (hyperactivity and
memory impairment)[41] in mice during the developmental period. Additionally, several molecular networks as genetic factors have been associated with the development of ASD, and
the core of these molecular networks include α-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA

receptor), protein kinase B (AKT), repressor activator protein
1 (RAP1), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), extracellular signalregulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), methyl-CpG-binding protein 2
(MECP2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), activator protein 1 (AP-1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
and ras protein/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/
MAPK).Previousstudieshavereportedthatlow-frequencyand
high-frequency electrical stimulation, microwave irradiation, and light stimulation of AMPA receptors,[42] Rfn2,[43]

GABA,[44] MECP2,[45] and BDNF[1,46-48] are associated with autismlike symptoms. In particular, in infancy when neurodevelopment is active, environmental factors such as electrical
stimulation through screens and light stimulation from vision may affect neurodevelopment and de novo sequence alterations.
In this study, we examined the interaction by sex and then
conducted a sex-differentiated analysis. The results suggested an association between screen time and ASD only in
boys, even if boys and girls have similar screen times (eTable 4
[in Supplement 1). This result could be due to the higher preva-](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
lence of the disorder in boys. Previous studies on the genetic
factors that contribute to the development of ASD have not yet
explained the male predominance in ASD.[1] However, among
the factors listed as the core genes responsible for the development of ASD, sex differences have been reported for brainderived neurotrophic factor[49,50] and MECP2.[51] Thus, genetic
factors may be involved in the observed sex differences in the
association between ASD and screen time.

#### Strengths and Limitations
The strength of this study is that it provides new insights into
the association of screen time with the onset of ASD in early
childhood, which had not yet been examined. Furthermore,
the results of this study are reliable because the analysis was
conducted using a large birth cohort data set representative of
the Japanese population.[52]


A limitation of this study is that ASD (outcome) and screen
time(exposure)wereassessedbasedonparentalreports,which
may have led to reporting bias. Data on the exact amount of
time children are gazing at the screen are not available, and it
may differ from what parents report. Medical institutions diagnose ASD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
_Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) but only when ASD can be di-_
agnosed with certainty because it is still in a developmental
stage when children are 3 years of age. Therefore, mild cases
may not be diagnosed as ASD at 3 years of age, when the child
is at a developmental stage, and may be observed in subsequent years. As a result, the study may be biased toward children with severe ASD. To account for potential risks, we conducted a multivariable analysis with ASD predisposition
(ASQ-3) at 1 year of age. Additionally, external (eg, prenatal, living, and childcare environment) and internal factors (eg, genetic factors, diseases, and disabilities) other than screen time,
which were examined as exposure factors in this study, were
not adequately considered. Therefore, this study conducted
a sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding as an additional analysis (the E-value),[53-57] and it was found that the ef[fect of residual confounding remained (eTable 5 in Supple-](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
[ment 1). Further research is needed to examine other factors](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5778?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2021.5778)
involved in the association between ASD and screen time, and
the combination of factors at a given time of the year associated with increased risk of ASD.

### Conclusions

In this cohort study, even after accounting for predisposition
to ASD at 1 year of age and maternal maltreatment factors, longer screen time at 1 year of age was associated with ASD at 3
years of age in boys. With the rapid increase in the use of devices, it is necessary to review its health effects on infants and
control excessive screen time.
