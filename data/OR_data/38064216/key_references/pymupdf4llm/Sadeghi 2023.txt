**Abstract: There is growing evidence that prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are**
increasing. A number of factors appear to contribute to this increase, including excessive screen
time. Screen time seems to be linked to the severity of the symptoms of ASD. Given this, the aim
of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between early screen time
and ASD symptoms severity in the first 36 months of life. To this end, sixty-eight Iranian toddlers
(mean age: 27.09 months; 22.1% females) with ASD were recruited. Parents completed the modified
checklist for autism in toddlers (M-CHAT), the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), and a
lifestyle checklist. Next, parents rated children’s daily exposure to content specifically designed
(foreground media) and not specifically designed (background media) for children, along with
their daily exposure to social interaction. Per day, toddlers spent 5.12 h (±3.77) with foreground
media, 3.72 h (±3.57) with background media, and 2.89 h (±2.74) in interaction with other people
(parents). To test the hypotheses, we performed a series of Pearson’s correlations and multiple
regression analyses. Toddlers’ higher severity scores for ASD symptoms were associated with longer
foreground (r = 0.234, p = 0.001) and longer background (r = 0.180, p = 0.012) media duration, and
with shorter duration of interaction with others (r = 0.192, p = 0.009). Toddlers spending 1 h more
in foreground screen time and background screen time have 0.38 and 0.29 more units in the ASD
symptom severity scale, respectively, while toddlers spending 1 h more in social interactions have
0.42 fewer units in the ASD symptom severity scale. The screen time and interaction duration are
related to ASD symptoms severity of toddlers. The cross-sectional study design precludes causal
associations, although bi-directional relationships appear plausible.

**1. Introduction**

Compared to other neurodevelopmental disorders, the prevalence rates of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased within the last two decades [1], with a rise of up
to 500% from 1992 to about 2000 [2]. According to the Salari and Rasoulpoor [3] study,
the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has increased worldwide. Nevertheless,
the prevalence of ASD differs by country due to differences in awareness levels, cultural
differences in how children’s behavior is interpreted, variability in screening tools, the


-----

lack of culture-sensitive diagnostic tools, the evaluation year, and the sample and study
populations. Currently, one out of 54 children appears to show symptoms of ASD [4].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased prevalence rates, such as
expanded diagnostic criteria, increased awareness of ASD, earlier diagnosis, recognition
that ASD is a lifelong condition, and alterations in lifestyle [5–7] (see also further details
below). Further, descriptively, as the prevalence of ASD has increased, the exposure of
young children to digital devices (smartphones, tablets, televisions, etc.) has increased in
parallel [8,9]. It has been reported that parental screen time, parental attitudes, parents’
workload, and having a television in the bedroom, as well as the availability of digital
devices, are the most important factors influencing children’s screen time [10,11].

_1.1. Symptoms of ASD and Exposure to Screens_

Associations between ASD and television viewing were further investigated. To illustrate, Waldman and Nicholson [12] concluded that early childhood television viewing was
an important trigger for autism; about 38% of ASD diagnoses appeared to be attributable
to an excess of television watching. Similarly, Hermawati and Rahmadi [13] observed
a statistical association between early electronic screen exposure and autistic-like behaviors (e.g., language delay, short attention span, and hyperactivity) in nine children aged
44 to 78 months. A similar pattern of association was further observed in a child aged
5 years [14]. In a further cross-sectional study Heffler and Sienko [15] investigated the
associations between early life social and digital media experiences and the development
of autism spectrum disorder-like symptoms. Heffler and Sienko [15] found that, among
12-month-old toddlers, the combination of increased exposure to television or video or both
and shorter caregiver-child interactive play duration were significantly associated with
more significant ASD-like symptoms, but not with the risk of ASD. Chen and Strodl [16]
investigated in their cross-sectional study the relationship between early electronic screen
exposure and autistic-like behaviors among 29,461 preschoolers aged 0–36 months and
observed that a longer screen time per day was associated with autistic-like behaviors at
preschool age. Dong and Wang [17] examined the association between screen time and
ASD symptoms in children with ASD. Results showed that a longer screen time correlated
with a higher ASD severity and with limited language abilities. The causal associations
between screen time and the development of ASD at three years was further investigated
among a large cohort of 84,030 children [18], with the finding that a longer screen time
at the age of one year predicted symptoms of ASD at the age of 3 among boys, but not
among girls.

_1.2. Theoretical and Evidence-Based Explanations for Symptoms of ASD and Exposure to Screens_

Seven theories have been proposed to explain the associations between symptoms of
ASD and exposure to screens.
First, over-engagement with screen-based media may cause social isolation and deprivation [19–22]. In this view, there is evidence that restricted environments and experiences
and early social isolation can cause autism symptoms and repetitive behaviors. To illustrate,
children growing up in institutions were at increased risk for “quasi-autistic” patterns of
behavior [23,24], also labelled post-institutional autistic syndrome (PIAS) [25]. Furthermore,
Pouretemad and Sadeghi [26] defined Post-Digital Nanning Autism Syndrome (PDNAS) as
a condition in which young children develop subclinical autism symptoms due to excessive
exposure to digital devices (for more than half of their waking hours). The researchers
hypothesized that PDNAS is a new subtype of ASD caused by and associated with the
children’s lifestyle and excessive screen time at an early age. In this case, it is assumed
that young children’s autism symptoms are probably causally associated with the early
excessive exposure to digital devices. Previous studies have indicated that social interaction
is very important for toddlers with autism [27]. According to Sadeghi and Pouretemad [28],
parent–child interactions decreased children’s autism symptoms and repetitive behaviors
and normalized their electrophysiological characteristics. It seems that the increase in social


-----

_Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 208_ 3 of 15

interactions leads to the development of neural circuits of social behaviors and, as a result,
this reduces the severity of autism symptoms. In the Dawson [29] model, early behavioral
intervention that leads to adaptive interactions between the child and its environment
reduces autism symptoms.
Second, a prolonged screen time may contribute to non-social neural circuits formation
during critical periods of brain development and neuroplasticity, and a prolonged screen
time may inhibit the development of neuronal social networks [15,30,31]. In accordance
with this theoretical framework, excessively watching television appeared to unfavorably impact on the typical development of the visual cortex, hypothalamus/septum, and
sensorimotor structures in children [32].
Third, interventional studies indicated that reducing young children’s screen time and
promoting social interaction reduced autism severity and normalized brain electrophysiological patterns in children with ASD-like symptoms [28,33–35].
Fourth, while these theories indicated that excessive screen time appeared to be
causally associated with higher symptoms of ASD, an inverse direction of influence is also
highly conceivable; children, at a very early age, with socioemotional deficits appeared to
be more likely to prefer screens to social interactions [36–38]. Indeed, among six-month-old
toddlers, the diagnosis of ASD was associated with earlier and more intensive preference
for and use of screens [39].
Fifth, children with ASD may also intuitively and deliberately use screens as a coping
strategy for impulse control and response inhibition [40].
Sixth, and plausibly, difficult children’s behavior may encourage their parents to
expose their children to more screen time as a coping strategy [41].
Seventh, and last, longer screen time was associated with higher sleep issues and
feeding problems in young children with ASD [42]; in such cases, longer screen time
exposure may be understood as a coping strategy.

_1.3. The Present Study_

As described above, research on the associations between screen time exposure and
symptom severity of ASD has mainly assessed children of school age and adolescents.
In contrast, such research is scarce among toddlers with ASD. Given this, the present
study was the first to examine the relationship between screen time and the severity
of ASD symptoms, before a toddler was formally diagnosed with ASD and before any
standardized treatment intervention was implemented. Further, while previous research
showed that background and foreground media have different effects among typically
developing young children, such as reducing attention control [43], decreased inhibitory
control [44], reduced cognitive flexibility [45], and decreased their ability to process verbal
information [46], such fine-grained research on the association between background and
foreground media and ASD among toddlers has received less attention so far. Note that the
term ‘foreground programs’ refers to content specifically designed for children to actively
draw their attention. Unlike foreground programs, ‘background programs’ refers to the
situation where an older family member chooses a program that is not explicitly designed
for children, or when the TV is left on but does not explicitly elicit the child’s attention [47].
With this background in mind, the following four hypotheses and one research question were formulated.
First, based on research other than in toddlers with ASD [16–18], we hypothesized
that a longer exposure to screen time was associated with a higher symptom severity.
Second, based on research other than in toddlers with ASD [33,47–50], we hypothesized that a longer exposure to screen time was associated with a shorter duration of social
interactions.
Third, based on research other than in toddlers with ASD [51–53], we hypothesized
that a higher symptom severity was associated with a lower duration of social interactions.
Fourth, based on research other than in toddlers with ASD [43–46], we hypothesized
that foreground and background screens impacted on children’s symptom severity.

_Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 208_ 4 of 15

The research question investigated the relationship between duration of foreground
screens exposure, background screens exposure, and exposure to social interaction and
toddlers’ symptom severity.
The present results have the potential to further understand the associations within
a fine-grained analysis of screen exposure, social interaction, and symptom severity in
toddlers, before a formally diagnosis of ASD and before starting a standardized treatment intervention.

**2. Materials and Methods**
_2.1. Participants and Procedure_

Parents of toddlers aged 16 to 36 months with a suspected diagnosis of ASD and
referred to Tehran Autism Center (Tehran, Iran) between February 2021 and September 2022
were approached to participate in the present study. Eligible parents were fully informed
about the aims of the study and the secure and anonymous data handling. Thereafter,
parents signed a written informed consent form. Parents completed a booklet of questions
covering sociodemographic information and their toddlers’ behavior (see details below).
Next, experts in ASD performed a formal diagnosis based on the DSM-5 criteria [54]. The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition (DSM-5) is a guide to
mental health and brain-related conditions and disorders, written, edited, reviewed, and
published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The Ethics Committee of the
Shahid Beheshti University (Tehran, Iran: code: SBU.ICBS 96/1020) approved the study,
which was conducted following the seventh and current revision [55] of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Toddlers under 36 months of age. 2. Both
parents’ age was 18 years or older. 3. Parents expressed concerns that their toddler showed
abnormal behavior and interactions. 4. Based on the DSM-5 criteria for ASD [54], a toddler
was identified to suffer from ASD. 5. Parents signed a written informed consent form.
6. Children did not have genetic syndromes or somatic comorbidities such as hearing and
visual deficits.

_2.2. Formal Testing_

All toddlers were evaluated by an ASD specialist with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology
and at least one assistant (with at least a master’s degree in clinical psychology). The
diagnosis was made based on informed clinical judgment, following interaction with the
child, formal testing, and review of parent reports and records. Diagnoses were based on
DSM-5 guidelines. Formal testing lasted between 90 and 120 min. Parents needed between
30 to 45 min to complete the questionnaires (see below).

_2.3. Measures_
2.3.1. Sociodemographic Information

Parents reported their age (years), the number of children in the same family household, their highest educational level (high school; undergraduate; master degree; PhD/MD),
and their current working status (working: yes vs. no). Parents reported their toddler’s age
(months) and gender (male; female).

2.3.2. Toddlers’ Symptom Severity of ASD

To assess toddlers’ symptom severity of ASD, parents completed the Farsi version [56]
of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT); M-CHAT [57] consists of
23 yes/no items. The M-CHAT is a simple measure to screen for toddlers’ symptoms of
ASD between 16 and 30 months of age. Robins and Fein [57] present M-CHAT for clinical
and research purposes. Higher scores indicate greater symptoms of ASD in the child.
Validity and reliability of M-CHAT have been examined in Iranian children [56,58,59]. In
this study, the internal consistency of the M-CHAT was demonstrated by a Cronbach’s
alpha score of 0.78.

_Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 208_ 5 of 15

2.3.3. Toddlers’ Repetitive Behavior

To assess toddlers’ repetitive behavior, parents completed the Farsi version [60,61] of
Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) [62]: This scale is a 43-item parent rating scale
that measures six dimensions of repetitive behavior (stereotyped behavior, self-injurious
behavior, compulsive behavior, ritualistic behavior, sameness behavior, and restricted
behavior). A higher score on RBS-R means repetitive behaviors are more severe. Lam and
Aman [63] showed construct validity of subscales from 0.68 to 0.98 and internal consistency
of subscales from 0.78 to 0.91. Most of these descriptions were reproduced from our
previous studies using a similar scale [28,35,64]. The RBS-R has already been validated
in the Iranian population [60,61]. In this study, the internal consistency of the RBS-R was
demonstrated by Cronbach’s alpha scores for the subscales of between 0.76 and 0.88.

2.3.4. Children’s Screen Time and Communication Duration

To assess the children’s screen time and communication duration, we compiled a
checklist in which parents had to estimate the child’s screen time, interaction, and sleep.
With this checklist, we measured the amount of children’s sleep, waking time, screen time,
and interactions during a day. We calculated the average hours of children’s foreground
and background screen time and communication. The total screen time was calculated by
summing the foreground and background screen times. In addition, in this checklist, we
collected demographic information about families and children. Most of the mothers, who
are the main caregivers of children, were not working and were at home for the whole
week. For this reason, we did not separate the weekdays and weekends in terms of the
amount of screen time and interactions.

_2.4. Statistical Analysis_

First, to test the four hypotheses, we performed a series of Pearson’s correlations to
investigate the associations between the toddlers’ age, scores for autism spectrum, repetitive
behavior, screen time (foreground, background, total screen time) and the duration of
interaction.
Second, to answer the research question, that is, to predict toddlers’ symptoms of
ASD, multiple regression analyses were performed with toddlers’ symptoms of ASD as the
dependent variable, and screen time (foreground, background, total time) and interaction
duration as predictors. Following others [65,66], preliminary conditions to perform a
multiple regression analysis were generally met, and as the sample size (n = 68) not very
close to 100, the number of predictors × 10 should not be greater than sample size (here:
4 × 10 = 40 < 68); predictors should sufficiently explain the dependent variable (Rs and
R[2][′]s); and the Durbin Watson (DW) coefficient should be between 1.5 and 2.5, indicating
that the residuals of the predictors were independent of each other (DW = 1.59). Last, the
variance inflation factors (VIF) to test multicollinearity should be 1 < VIF < 10. In our model,
the VIF was 3.09.
The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical computations were performed
with SPSS[®] 28.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows[®].

**3. Results**
_3.1. General Sociodemographic Information_

Table 1 provides a descriptive statistical overview of the sociodemographic information. More than half of the parents had undergraduate degrees. The fathers were all
employed, whereas the mothers were mostly housewives (86.8%). Most families only had
one child (69.1%).

Toddlers’ higher symptoms of ASD were associated with higher foreground and
background screen time and lower interaction duration. Toddlers’ higher foreground screen
time was associated with their higher sameness and restricted behaviors. Toddlers’ higher
background screen time was associated with their higher ritualistic and sameness behaviors.
Additionally, toddlers’ higher repetitive behaviors (all subscales) were associated with a
lower interaction duration.

_3.3. Predicting Toddlers’ Symptoms of ASD_


To predict toddlers’ symptoms of ASD, a multiple regression analysis was performed
with toddlers’ symptoms of ASD and their’ screen time and interaction duration as predictors. Table 3 provides the statistical overview.

A toddler’s higher foreground, background, and total screen time, and a toddler’s
lower interaction duration, predicted a toddler’s higher symptoms of ASD. When the
amount of foreground screen time is increased by one hour, toddlers have 0.38 more units
on the ASD symptoms severity scale. In addition, toddlers spending 1 h more in foreground
screen time have 0.38 and 0.30 more units in sameness behaviors and restricted behaviors
subscales of the RBS-R, respectively. In addition, ASD symptoms severity scores in toddlers
increase by 0.29 units when background screen time is increased by 1 h. Toddlers spending
1 h more in background screen time have 0.30 and 0.41 more units in ritualistic behaviors
and sameness behaviors subscales of the RBS-R, respectively. Furthermore, for 1 h decrease
in the toddlers’ interaction duration, the toddlers’ ASD symptoms severity, stereotyped
behaviors, self-injurious behaviors, sameness behaviors, compulsive behaviors and RBS-R
total scores increased by 0.42, 0.49, 0.29, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.36 units, respectively.

**4. Discussion**


The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between screen time
and interaction duration of toddlers with ASD and their ASD symptom severity. The key
findings were that toddlers’ higher symptoms of ASD were associated with their higher
screen time duration and lower interaction duration. As such, the present results add
to the current literature in the following four ways: First, among toddlers aged about
27 months, both a higher foreground and background screen time was associated with
higher parent-rated symptoms of ASD. Second, and complementarily, a higher foreground
and background screen time and higher parent-rated symptoms of ASD were associated
with a shorter duration of social interactions. Third, a longer foreground and background
screen time, and a shorter social interactional time, independently predicted parent-rated

toddlers’ symptom severity of ASD. Fourth, and most importantly, it appears that such
unfavorable patterns of associations were already observable among toddlers with a mean
age of about 27 months.
Four hypotheses and one research question were formulated and each of these is
considered below in turn.

_4.1. Toddlers’ Longer Exposure to Screen Time and Higher Symptom Severity_

Results showed a positive association of foreground, background, and total screen
time with toddlers’ ASD symptoms severity. These correlations are consistent with our first
hypothesis that a longer exposure to screen time is strongly associated with a higher ASD
symptom severity. Furthermore, toddlers’ higher foreground screen time was associated
with their higher sameness and restricted behaviors. Toddlers’ higher background screen
time was associated with their higher ritualistic and sameness behaviors. These results
are consistent with the results of Chen and Strodl [16], Dong and Wang [17] and Kushima
and Kojima [18], which showed that a longer screen time was associated with higher
ASD symptoms severity. To explain such a pattern of results, we rely on the theoretical
framework of Heffler and Oestreicher [30], as follows: a prolonged screen time may
contribute to ASD through the formation of non-social neural circuits during critical periods
of brain development and neuroplasticity [15,30,31]. In addition to theories suggesting
that prolonged exposure to digital devices can trigger ASD symptoms, theories in which
the relationship is reversed may also explain this finding. For instance, Tamana and
Ezeugwu [38], Montes [37], Tamana and Ezeugwu [38], and Tandon and Sasser [36] showed
that very young children with socioemotional deficits appeared to be more likely to prefer
screens to social interactions. Furthermore, Chonchaiya and Nuntnarumit [39] found
among six-month-old toddlers that the diagnosis of ASD was associated with earlier and
more intensive preference for and use of screens.

_4.2. Toddlers’ Longer Exposure to Screen Time and Shorter Time of Social Interaction_

Our second hypothesis was that a longer exposure to screen time was associated
with a shorter duration of social interactions, and our data did confirm this assumption.
Results showed that higher foreground and background screen time duration was strongly
associated with lower interaction duration. The results are in line with previous studies
in children, which reported that the more time children spent watching television, the
less time they spent with others [22]. These findings can be explained by the fact that
screen time usually replaces children’s social interactions and activities [49,50]. Further, the
present findings are consistent with the theory that over-engagement with screen-based
media may cause social isolation and deprivation [19–22].

_4.3. Toddlers’ Higher Symptom Severity and Shorter Time of Social Interaction_

Results showed that a higher symptom severity of ASD was associated with a shorter
duration of social interactions. This confirms our third hypothesis, that the severity of ASD
symptoms was associated with a shorter duration of social interactions [51–53]. Further, it
appears plausible that a two-way relationship between the degree of interaction and the
severity of autism symptoms should be considered. A child with ASD exhibits significant
weaknesses in basic communication skills such as eye contact and joint attention. When a
child scores high in ASD symptoms, other persons might be less likely to communicate with
him or her. On the other hand, when parents score low in skills or time to communicate
with their children, the child’s symptoms might become more pronounced [51,52].
The social motivation theory in autism [67] may further help to the explain the present
pattern of results. The social motivation theory argues that children with ASD find social
stimuli less rewarding than do children with typical development [68–70]. Based on
this theory, children with ASD are less likely at an early age to pay attention to social
information, such as faces and gaze directions, thereby limiting opportunities for social
learning (e.g., less joint attention, collaborative play, fewer friendships), thus blunting

social skill development [70]. In line with our findings, Chawarska and Macari [71] have
shown that the attention of infants with ASD was more focused on background objects
than on people. Furthermore, our results have a number of similarities with previous
findings that indicated that encouraging young children’s social interaction reduced autism
severity and normalized brain electrophysiological patterns in children with ASD-like
symptoms [28,33,34].

_4.4. Foreground and Background Screen Time and Toddler’s Symptom Severity_

With the fourth hypothesis we assumed that foreground and background screen
time impacted differently on toddlers’ symptom severity, and our data did confirm this.
Results showed that there were significant correlations between foreground screen time
(r = 0.38) and background screen time (r = 0.29), with severity of ASD, and with a stronger
relationship with ASD severity for foreground screen time than background screen time. As
such, the present pattern of results is in line with what has been observed elsewhere [43–46].
To explain such a pattern of results, previous research has suggested that the effects of
digital devices on young children’s cognitive and psychosocial development may vary,
depending on whether digital devices were used in the foreground or background [72].
From this perspective, a number of studies among typically developing infants and children
have shown that foreground exposure negatively impacted on attention, cognitive abilities,
and language skills [73–75], whereas background exposure negatively impacted on parent–
child interactions, and the quantity and quality of play [49,50,76,77]. Foreground screens
seem to have a greater “barrier effect” between a parent and a child, and such a barrier
effect may result in higher scores for autism symptoms. The screen time ‘barrier effect’
means that a child’s exposure to screens appears to reduce the quality and quantity of
parent–child communication [78].

_4.5. Screen Time and Social Interaction Time to Predict Toddlers’ Symptom Severity_

With the research question, we investigated the relationship between foreground
screens exposure, background screens exposure, exposure to social interaction and a toddler’s ASD symptom severity. Results showed that foreground screen time, background
screen time, total screens time, and social interaction duration predicted a child’s ASD
severity. This pattern of results in in line with studies that showed that prolonged screen
time in children with autism spectrum disorders negatively impacted on the development
of children’s communication and social skills [17]. Such results further evidence that the
environment has a significant effect on the clinical symptoms of children with ASD, in that
a prolonged screen time appears to have an adverse effect on children’s social interaction
and behavior regulation. Following Yousef and Eapen [79], a longer screen time was related
to children’s higher degree of autism-like symptoms, and such a relationship was more
apparent among younger children and those with more screen time. This is in line with
our findings.
To explain such a pattern of results, the quality of the present data do not allow a
conclusive neuronal, psychological or social-interactional answer. However, we advance
the following five assumptions:
First, ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and, during the early stages after birth,
the brain develops rapidly and is influenced both by internal neuronal developmental
processes [80–83] and by external, and thus environmental, stimuli [84–86]. As a result,
we hypothesize that the brain maturation of a child with ASD exposed to prolonged
and excessive screen time might be slowed down in terms of less grey and white matter
and ramification, fewer dendritic spikes, disrupted myelination, and higher levels of
local functional connectivity and dysmaturation of interconnected regions responsible for
processing higher-order social information.
Second, in contrast and in addition to the above mentioned assumptions and evidence,
studies have shown that children with ASD may also intuitively and deliberately use
screens as a coping strategy for their impulse control and response inhibition [40]. Nally

and Houlton [87] investigated parental perceptions of television and video use of children
with ASD. Their study found that TV was used to distract children with ASD and minimize
behavioral outbursts. Lane and Radesky [88] assumed that children with ASD were
experiencing more screen time, both because of the children’s social communication deficits,
and because the content of children’s programs were more predictable; here, we note
that individuals with ASD prefer precise anticipation, that is, the absence of unexpected
changes, to unpredictability. In the similar vein, Thompson and Christakis [41] suggested
that children with ASD may also use screen time to regulate their behavior.
The third assumption is that parents of children with ASD might expose their children
to more screen time as a parent coping strategy to handle their children’s challenging social
and interactional behavior.
The fourth assumption is that the child’s inherent neuronal development, the quantity
and quality of external stimuli, the child’s coping preferences, and parents’ parenting styles
and coping preferences do interact, so to increase the child’s ASD symptom severity. Again,
the quality of the present data do not allow us to confirm such an assumption of interaction.
The fifth, last and, again, admittedly highly speculative assumption is that latent,
unassessed and thus unknown factors may moderate the association between screen time
exposure and a child’s ASD symptom severity.

_4.6. Limitations and Future Directions_

In spite of the novelty of the combination of predictors and sample group age, the
following limitations need to be considered. First, the sample itself might be considered
small, which can result in a low level of statistical power. However, our data convincingly
demonstrated strong correlations between screen time and interaction duration among
toddlers with ASD, thus 68 parents of toddlers with ASD constituted a homogeneous and
reliable sample. Second, measurement issues must be addressed. To assess the child’s
screen time and communication, we used a parent-rated, self-report lifestyle checklist; by
their nature, subjective ratings might be biased. This holds particularly true as parents were
fully informed about the purpose of the study, and such information might have triggered
social desirability biases in the completion of the checklists. Third, clinical and psychiatric
evaluations of parents’ and toddlers’ psychiatric concerns might have improved the quality
of the data and the reliability of the pattern of results. Fourth, in this study screen time was
measured overall. To measure screen time, it is better to distinguish between the type of
device and the day of the week. This will help us better understand how digital devices
affect autism symptoms. The fifth limitation relates to the toddlers’ age. The subjects we
studied were very young. Often, autism diagnoses at this age are provisional and can be
changed. Therefore, generalizing findings to other age groups should be performed with
caution. Sixth, as comprehensively discussed above, the cross-sectional nature of the study
design precludes causal interpretations. Given this, we propose that future studies should
use longitudinal and interventional designs.

**5. Conclusions**

It can be concluded that, in toddlers, a higher level of foreground and background
screen time is associated with symptoms of ASD and repetitive behaviors. Furthermore, a
higher foreground and background screen time, as well as higher parent-rated symptoms of
ASD, are associated with a shorter time of social interaction. It is conceivable that neuronal
developmental characteristics, a child’s preferences for objects, a child’s preference for
non-social coping styles, and parents’ parenting and coping styles with the social behavior
of a child with ASD might independently and reciprocally increase a child’s ASD symptom
severity. The exposure of young children to excessive screen time, regardless of the type of
media, is a serious educational mistake. Parents often allow their children long screen time
while they do various household chores, which may inhibit children’s social development.
Toddler caregivers should manage screen time and provide natural opportunities for
toddlers to develop their social skills and communication abilities.
