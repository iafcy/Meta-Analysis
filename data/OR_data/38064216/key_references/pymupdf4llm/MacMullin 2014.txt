**Abstract**
Although electronic technology currently plays an integral role for most youth, there are growing concerns of its excessive
and compulsive use. This study documents patterns and impact of electronics use in individuals with autism spectrum
disorder compared to typically developing peers. Participants included 172 parents of typically developing individuals
and 139 parents of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, ranging in age from 6 to 21 years. Parents
completed an online survey of demographics and the frequency, duration, and problematic patterns of electronics use in
their youth and young adults. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder were reported to use certain electronics more
often in the last month and on an average day, and had greater compulsive Internet and video game use than individuals
without autism spectrum disorder. Across both samples, males used video games more often than females. Compared
to parents of individuals without autism spectrum disorder, parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder were
significantly more likely to report that electronics use was currently having a negative impact. The implications of
problematic electronics use for individuals with autism spectrum disorder are discussed.

Electronic technology currently plays an integral role in
the lives of youth around the world (Durkin et al., 2010;
Madell and Muncer, 2004). The vast majority of youth
spend a considerable amount of time engaged in electronics
use, playing video games, using computer applications,
and carrying cell phones (Madell and Muncer, 2004;
Willoughby, 2008; Witt et al., 2011), and there is research
on positive and negative characteristics associated with
these activities (Green and Bavelier, 2007). There has also
been an increasing emphasis on electronics use in youth
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Mazurek, 2013;
Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013a, 2013b; Mazurek and
Wenstrup, 2013). Understanding the frequency, type, and
impacts of electronics use for individuals with ASD is
important for ensuring that policies and programs are in
place to maximize the benefits and address any problems
associated with its use.

## Frequency of electronics use

Many individuals with ASD are particularly drawn to
video games and other screen-based entertainment, and
spend a considerable amount of time engaged in these
activities (Mineo et al., 2009; Shane and Albert, 2008).


Parents and caregivers report that individuals with ASD
spend more time on electronic screen media (which
includes video game use) compared to any other leisure
activity (Shane and Albert, 2008). Approximately 41% of
parents participating in the US National Longitudinal
Transition Study-2 reported that their child with ASD
(aged 13–17 years) spent most of his or her free time playing video games (Mazurek et al., 2012), and parents of
boys with ASD reported that their sons spent more time
playing video games per day (on average 2.1 h/day) than
typically developing boys (on average 1.2 h/day) (Mazurek
and Engelhardt, 2013b). In the general population, gender
differences are observed in the use of video games,
with males spending more time on video game playing
(16.4 h/week) than females (9.2 h/week) (Gentile, 2009;
Willoughby, 2008; Witt et al., 2011).

There may be some key differences in the type of electronics use between those with and without ASD. In a survey
of 91 adolescents with ASD and their parents, 98% of
youth reported that they used a computer on any given day
for an average of 4.9 h (Kuo et al., 2014). With regard to
social electronics use, though, children with ASD spend
significantly less time using email, Facebook, or texting
than their typically developing siblings (Mazurek and
Wenstrup, 2013). In a small sample of 35 adolescents with
Asperger syndrome, Durkin et al. (2010) reported that
60% used a cell phone, compared to 94% of a matched
typically developing sample. Compared to the comparison
group, individuals with ASD were less likely to value calling
peers and were more likely to use mobile phones for games
than their peers.

## Impact of electronics use

There is growing concern about the impact prolonged electronics use may have on youth both with and without ASD.
Studies have highlighted addictive characteristics associated
with Internet use, such as withdrawal when Internet use
is impossible, inability to manage time spent online, and
conflicts about Internet use (Chou et al., 2005; Kerkhof
et al., 2011; Meerkerk et al., 2009). Problematic Internet use
(also known as compulsive Internet use) is characterized:

by continued use of the Internet despite the intention to stop,
Internet use dominating a person’s cognitions and behaviors,
unpleasant emotions when Internet is impossible, the use of
Internet to escape from negative feelings, and Internet use
which results in conflict with others or with oneself. (Meerkerk
et al., 2009: 3)

In adults, problematic Internet use is associated with feelings
of loneliness (Morahan-Martin and Schumacher, 2000),
depressive feelings (Van den Eijnden et al., 2008), and
diminished relationship quality (Kerkhof et al., 2011). The
addictive potential of Internet applications, combined with
the impulsive and premature adolescent brain, means that
adolescents may be particularly susceptible to problematic
Internet use (Van den Eijnden et al., 2010).
Problematic video game use has also emerged as a
major concern for adolescents, with characteristics similar to other forms of dependency. Youth have been found
to steal money to play or buy games, skip school to play,
ignore academic tasks and social activities to play games,
become irritable if unable to play, and report playing for
longer than intended (Griffiths and Hunt, 1998; Griffiths
and Meredith, 2009). Online gaming, in particular, may
be even more problematic than games that are offline,
combining the issues surrounding both video game use
and Internet use (Griffiths et al., 2004). Grüsser et al.
(2006) found that in a sample of 7069 game players
(M = 21.11 years, standard deviation (SD) = 6.35), one out
of nine met at least three diagnostic criteria of gaming


addiction based on the dependence syndrome outlined
by the World Health Organization: “craving, tolerance,
withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, neglect of other
activities, and other negative consequences” (Griffiths and
Meredith, 2009: 248).
Individuals with ASD may be particularly susceptible
to problematic electronics use (including both problematic Internet and video game use), and research and
anecdotal evidence suggest that problematic electronics
use is associated with social, behavioral, and academic
challenges in families of children with ASD. Like many
typically developing individuals with problematic
Internet use (Caplan, 2003), individuals with ASD are
noted to prefer online communication over face-to-face
interaction (Benford, 2008; Mazurek and Wenstrup,
2013) and have a propensity toward computer-mediated
communication (Burke et al., 2010). One recent study
found an association between ASD symptoms and compulsive Internet use in a non-clinical adult sample
(Finkenauer et al., 2012). A second study found that boys
with ASD (n = 56) had more problematic video game use
compared to typically developing boys (n = 41) (Mazurek
and Engelhardt, 2013b). Individuals with ASD are more
likely to report having difficulty disengaging from playing
video games, feeling upset when not able to play, getting
angry when interrupted from games, and playing longer
than intended compared to their typically developing
siblings (Mazurek and Wenstrup, 2013). Furthermore,
problematic video game use was predictive of oppositional behavior in boys with ASD (Engelhardt and
Mazurek, 2014).

## This study

We are just beginning to understand the phenomenon of
electronics use for individuals with ASD. The existing
research indicates that individuals with ASD are actively
engaging in electronics; however, most studies have examined general electronics use, so we know little about the
pattern of electronics use across the electronic devices
(e.g. tablets) and electronic activities (e.g. video games,
Internet, social activities, and general computing) now
available. Few studies have included male and female participants with ASD, along with a typically developing
comparison group, so we do not know how this electronics
use differs by gender in individuals with ASD, compared
to same age peers. Furthermore, research has yet to explore
the issue of problematic Internet use along with problematic video game use in youth with ASD and the impact of
such use on youth and their families. This study explores
the experience of electronics use (age of use, duration and
frequency, interference, or compulsion) across a host of
different electronics types, by gender and compared to a
typically developing comparison group. This is also the
first study to examine the reported impact of electronics
use for individuals with ASD and their families.

Based on previous research that examined rates of electronics use (Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013b), we hypothesized that individuals with ASD would begin using
electronics at a younger age and have higher rates of electronics use (both frequency and duration) than same-aged
individuals without ASD, with non-social activities being
more common than social ones. We also hypothesized that
individuals with ASD would have higher rates of problematic Internet and video game use than individuals without
ASD. Finally, we predicted that parents of individuals with
ASD would be more likely to report that electronics use
negatively impacted their child’s life and their family life
compared to parents of individuals without ASD.

## Method

 Participants

Participants originally included 195 parents of typically
developing youth and 149 parents of youth diagnosed with
ASD between 6 and 21 years of age. All parents completed
the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) about
their son or daughter to determine eligibility for the study
(Berument et al., 1999), which has strong diagnostic validity
(Berument et al., 1999). Based on previous research and
recommendations from the developers, this study used the
clinical cutoff of 12 to increase sensitivity (Corsello et al.,
2007; Zablotsky et al., 2012); individuals in the comparison
group were included if they had an SCQ score lower than
12 (23 participants were excluded out of the 195), and
individuals in the ASD sample had to have a score of 12 or
greater (10 were excluded out of the 149). Previous research
has validated the use of parent reports of professional ASD
diagnoses in Internet-based research, especially when


combined with reliable screening measures (Daniels et al.,
2012).
The final sample included 172 parents of typically
developing children (M = 11.72, SD = 3.61) and 139 parents
of children with an ASD diagnosis (M =12.25, SD _= 3.97)._
There was no difference in the age of youth in the two
samples, _t(309) = −1.22,_ _p = 0.22, or in levels of family_
income between groups, U = 11,701, z _= −0.11, and p = 0.92_
(See Table 1). As shown in Table 1, there were also no
significant differences between the two samples on gender,
nationality, marital status, and minority status. Reported
_Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_
(4th ed., text rev.) diagnoses for the ASD group included
autism (51.8%, n = 72), Asperger syndrome (36.0%, n = 50),
and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; 10.8% n = 10), with one individual who
had a pending diagnosis but had an SCQ score above the
clinical cutoff. The vast majority of individuals in both
groups were reported by parents to be able to talk using
short phrases or sentences, although fewer in the ASD
group compared to the comparison group (92.1% vs
99.1%, respectively), χ[2] = 11.14, p = 0.001.

## Procedure

Convenience and snowball sampling were employed to
recruit parents of children with an ASD diagnosis using
several Canadian and US Asperger syndrome and ASD
organizations. Emails were sent to these organizations asking whether our recruitment flyer could be emailed to individuals on their listserve, posted on their website, and/or
displayed onsite. Our recruitment flyer explained that we
knew that electronics use was associated with advantages
and possible concerns and that we wanted to understand


-----

the benefits and the problems of electronics use. The
recruitment flyer also included a link to the consent form
and survey. Qualtrics panel management, whose panel is
for research purposes only, was employed to email parents
of children without an ASD diagnosis. Qualtrics emailed
invitations to their participant lists, ensuring a representative sample of new and old members, until the comparison
group reflected the distribution of our ASD sample in
terms of age, gender, and country (Canada and the United
States). After giving informed consent, parents completed
online measures of demographics, electronics use, and
social interaction. The survey took approximately 20 min
to complete. Surveys were completed between October
2012 and May 2013. The survey was approved by the university research ethics board.

_Measures_
_Electronics use. Parents were asked whether their child_
knew how to use a number of electronic devices (lap top
computer, desk top computer, iphone or other smart phone,
and ipad/ipod/tablet) and electronic activities (play video
games on a computer, play video games on a console, play
video games on a portable gaming system, surf the web,
use a search engine, watch videos, create a web page,
download music files, create documents for school, save
or edit images/graphics, use a photo editing program, use
social networking sites, talk on a cell phone, text message on a cell phone, instant message with friends, visit a
chat room, send and receive emails), similar to Witt et al.
(2011). Activity items were totaled to create four subscales:
video games (i.e. play video games on a computer, play
video games on a console, play video games on a portable
gaming system); Internet (i.e. surf the web, use a search
engine, watch videos, create a web page, download music
files); social (i.e. use social networking sites, talk on a cell
phone, text message on a cell phone, instant message with
friends, visit a chat room, send and receive emails); and
general computing (i.e. create documents for school, save
or edit images/graphics, use a photo editing program). Parents were then asked, using a 12-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (less than 4 years old) to 12 (older than 14 years
_old), the age at which their child started using each of the_
electronic devices and activities that were endorsed (that
the youth knew how to use or do). Parents were also asked
how often in the last month (i.e. frequency) their child used
the electronic devices and activities on a 7-point Likert
scale, ranging from 1 (less than once a month) to 7 (daily) and
about the amount of time on an average day (i.e. duration)
that their child used the electronic devices and activities
on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (less than 30 min)
to 6 (more than 3 h). Since parents of youth and young
adults are unlikely to know the precise number of hours
their child uses electronics, Likert scales were used to better capture the general trends of electronics use.


_Impacts of electronics use. Parents were asked whether_
their child’s electronics use was currently causing problems for them or their child in any way (yes/no). If the
parents responded yes, they were asked to select all of
the relevant ways in which electronics use was currently
causing programs (i.e. significantly impacting child’s
social life in a negative way, significantly impacting
child’s education in a negative way, and/or significantly
impacting their family life in a negative way), with
higher total scores reflecting more negative impact. Parents
were also asked whether their child’s electronics use
caused problems for them or their child in the past, which
were not currently causing problems (yes/no). If parents
responded yes, they were asked to select all the relevant
ways that electronics use caused problems for them or
their child in the past, which were not currently causing
problems (i.e. significantly impacted child’s social life
in a negative way, significantly impacted child’s education in a negative way, significantly impacted family life
in a negative way), with total scores reflecting greater
past impact.

_Problematic Internet use. Problematic Internet use was_
assessed using the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS;
Meerkerk et al., 2009). The CIUS consisted of 14 items
that assess compulsive Internet use (e.g. “I find it difficult
to stop using the Internet”). The items were adapted for
caregiver reporting, and rated on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The scale has
shown good factorial stability over time and across different samples. The CIUS was reported to have high internal
reliability (α = 0.88) and good validity (Meerkerk et al.,
2009). In this study, the internal consistency for the CIUS
was α = 0.94.

_Problematic video game use. Problematic video game use_
was measured by replacing “Internet” with “video game”
in the CIUS. In research, problematic video game is considered a specific problem, separate from problematic Internet
use (e.g. Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013a; Meerkerk et al.,
2009). In this study, the internal consistency for problematic
video game use was α = 0.96.

## Results

Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted with diagnosis and gender as between-subject
factors to examine potential differences in ability to use
electronics, age at which youth began using electronics,
frequency and duration of electronics use, as well as
impacts of electronics use. All statistical analyses were
carried out with SPSS 21.0 software, using two-tailed
tests with α = 0.05. Missing data were handled using pairwise deletion.

## Ability to use electronics

As shown in Table 2, two-way ANOVAs indicated no
diagnosis by gender interactions for the total number of
electronic devices or activities that youth knew how to use.
Individuals with ASD were reported to be able to use significantly more electronic devices (M = 3.82, _SD = 1.04)_
than the comparison group (M = 3.42, SD = 1.13), although
the effect size was small. There were significant main
effects of both diagnosis and gender for the ability to play
video games, with the comparison group having the ability
to play significantly more video game type activities
(M = 2.75, _SD = 0.60) compared to individuals with ASD_
(M = 2.35, _SD = 0.99) and males having the ability to_
play significantly more video game activities (M=2.63,
_SD=0.75) than females (M = 2.41, SD = 0.99), with a small_
effect size. The main effect of diagnosis, but not gender,
was significant for social activities, with individuals with
ASD using electronics for fewer social activities (M = 2.07,
_SD = 1.99) than the comparison group (M = 3.39, SD = 2.17)._
No main effects were significant for Internet activities and
general computing activities. Among individuals with
ASD, SCQ symptom severity was significantly correlated
with the number of electronic activities that they knew
how to use, r = −0.19, p = 0.03, although the size of the correlation was small.

## Age at which youth began using electronics

As shown in Table 3, there were no significant interactions
and no main effects for age at which individuals began
using electronic devices, video games, Internet, or general


computing activities. Individuals with ASD were significantly older (M = 8.76, SD = 3.09) when they began using
electronics for social activities compared to the comparison group (M = 8.07, SD = 2.88).

## Frequency and duration of electronics use

As shown in Table 4, there were no diagnosis by gender
interactions for the frequency or duration of electronics
use. Individuals with ASD were reported to spend significantly more time using electronic devices (M = 5.67,
_SD = 1.12) than individuals without ASD (M = 5.33,_
_SD = 1.23) in the previous month, with no gender differ-_
ences observed. Similarly, individuals with ASD spent
more time using Internet and general computing activities
(M = 6.14, _SD = 1.02;_ _M = 5.29,_ _SD = 1.28, respectively)_
compared to the individuals without ASD (M = 5.54,
_SD = 1.29;_ _M = 4.65,_ _SD = 1.56). There was a significant_
gender effect for video game use, with males spending significantly more time playing video games (M = 5.74,
_SD = 1.12) than females (M = 5.07,_ _SD = 1.25) in the last_
month, and no main effect for diagnosis. No differences
emerged with regard to the frequency of social activity use.
As shown in Table 4, none of the diagnosis by gender
interactions were significant for the duration of electronics
use on an average day. Males were found to spend more
time playing video games (M = 2.88; _SD = 0.97) than_
females (M = 2.40, _SD = 0.76), and individuals with ASD_
spent more time on the Internet (M = 2.95, SD = 1.09) compared to individuals without ASD (M = 2.50, _SD = 0.95)._
No differences emerged for the duration of social activities
and general computing.

## Impacts of electronics use

As shown in Table 5, there were significant main effects of
diagnosis for CIUS video game use and Internet use, and
no interactions. Individuals with ASD had higher levels of
compulsive video game and Internet use (M = 2.50,
_SD = 1.04; M = 2.47; SD = 0.92, respectively) compared to_
the individuals without ASD (M = 1.81, _SD = 0.74;_
_M = 1.85; SD = 0.72). Males had higher levels of compul-_
sive video game use (M = 2.17, _SD = 0.95) compared to_
females (M = 1.74, _SD = 0.79). As shown in Table 6, par-_
ents of individuals with ASD were significantly more
likely to report that electronics use was currently impacting their son or daughter’s life in a negative way than parents of the comparison group. They were also more likely
to report that electronics use had impacted their life in the
past (but not currently) than parents of the comparison
group. No gender differences or interactions emerged with
regard to impact.

## Discussion

While other studies have examined problematic video
game use in youth with ASD, this study is the first to


examine the frequency and duration of a number of different categories of electronic devices and activities with a
comparison group of individuals without ASD, taking into
account potential differences in gender. This is also the
first article to investigate both problematic Internet and
video game use and its impact on the lives of North
American children with ASD and their families compared
to a comparison group. Parents of individuals with ASD
reported that their youth and young adults were able to use
a greater number of electronic devices, however did not
engage in as many video game and social activities, as the
comparison sample. Individuals with ASD were significantly older when they began using electronics for social
activities, and spent more time using the Internet and
on general computing activities, than the comparison
sample.
These results are consistent in many respects with previous research. In a large, representative sample of youth
from the United States, youth with ASD had higher rates of
non-social media use (i.e. television and video games) and
lower rates of social media use (i.e. email and chat room
participation) than other disability groups (learning disabilities, speech/language impairments, and intellectual disabilities) (Mazurek et al., 2012). Similarly, Mazurek and


-----

Wenstrup (2013) found that compared to typically developing siblings, children with ASD spent more time watching
television and playing video games and less time using
social media or socially interactive video games. Television
and electronics use may be an attractive activity because it
requires little effort, and provides a break for individuals
who, because of the nature of their difficulties, have trouble engaging in activities that are cognitively or socially
demanding (Mazurek et al., 2012). Given that individuals
with ASD have difficulty with social interaction and have
fewer friendships compared to individuals without ASD,
the finding that individuals spend more time on non-social
electronics use may not be surprising, but is particularly
problematic, as it creates yet another context where individuals with ASD fail to experience practice and competence
with social contexts.
Our work extends what is known about problematic
electronics use in individuals with ASD. Mazurek and
Engelhardt (2013b) found that boys with ASD had higher
rates of problematic video game use compared to boys
without ASD, while another study found that children with
ASD had higher levels of problematic video game use
compared to their typically developing siblings (Mazurek
and Wenstrup, 2013). The results from our study indicate
that the compulsive behavior appears to be present with
other electronics beyond video game use, suggesting a
broader concern. Mazurek and Engelhardt (2013b) found
that core ASD symptoms were not related to hours of video
game play or problematic video game use; however,
another study found a connection between symptoms of
ASD and compulsive Internet use in a non-clinical adult
sample (Finkenauer et al., 2012), making it unclear how
deficits in social communication and restricted patterns of
behavior influence risk. Individuals with ASD may be
more prone to problematic electronics use because of other
characteristics associated with the disorder. For instance,
deficits in impulse control and response inhibition are
connected with a diagnosis of ASD (Corbett et al., 2009)
and with problematic video game play (Mazurek and
Engelhardt, 2013b). A link has also been found between
inattention and playing video games for more than one
hour per day (Chan and Rabinowitz, 2006). More research
is needed to examine the connection between these executive functioning deficits and problematic electronics use for
individuals with ASD.
Parents of individuals with ASD were significantly
more likely to report that electronics use negatively
impacted their child’s life compared to parents of individuals
without ASD. For typically developing individuals, problematic video game use has been associated with poorer
school performance (Gentile, 2009) and high Internet use
has been linked with poorer relationships with mothers
and peers (Sanders et al., 2000). For individuals with
ASD, the negative impacts of playing electronics may be


compounded by the social and academic difficulties they
already face due to the nature of their difficulties. When
individuals with ASD are engaging in problematic electronics use, they have even fewer opportunities to develop
social, academic, and occupational skills, which may be
associated with more negative impacts for their families,
who are already multiply stressed (Lecavalier et al., 2006).
While a number of positive experiences have been noted
about electronics use in individuals with ASD, particularly
as a teaching or communication device (e.g. Burton et al.,
2013), the current research also suggests that caregivers
and clinicians should be aware of early signs of interference
or compulsions related to these activities, particularly
because parents are reporting negative impacts.
A clear pattern of gender differences was found for
video game involvement, but not for any other type of
electronics activity. Across groups, males had the ability to
play significantly more video game activities and spent
more time on video games in the last month and on an
average day compared to females. Males also had higher
rates of problematic video game use than females. These
findings are consistent with the gender differences that are
found in the general population (Gentile, 2009; Witt et al.,
2011; Willoughby, 2008). These findings suggest that boys
with ASD are particularly vulnerable to problematic electronics use.

## Limitations and future directions

One of the main limitations of this study was that it relied
on parent reports, similar to other research on electronics
use and ASD (e.g. Mazurek et al., 2012; Mazurek and
Engelhardt, 2013a). Another limitation of the study was
the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to determine an
autism diagnosis. Although not a gold standard assessment, we did use the SCQ, which has strong diagnostic
validity, to confirm the ASD diagnosis reported by parents,
similar to other survey studies (e.g. Zablotsky et al., 2012).
Furthermore, parent report of a child’s ASD diagnosis has
been shown to be valid indicator of child diagnosis
(Daniels et al., 2012). Convenience sampling also presents
with the possibility of a sample bias, as parents of individuals with ASD were recruited through ASD organizations in
Canada and the United States, and these parents may have
children with higher levels of support needs compared to
parents of children with ASD who are not involved in
these organizations. Parents of both typically developing
children and those with ASD who were concerned about
problematic computer use may also have been more likely
to participate in our study. Our use of online surveys may
have excluded parents who did not have access to computers
or the Internet, who had less free time due to high parenting
demands, or who had lower literacy levels. While our two
samples were matched on certain characteristics (e.g. age


-----

and geographic location), they were not matched on verbal
or cognitive ability.
Certainly, a major strength of the study was its comprehensive nature and the use of a typically developing
comparison group to contextualize the pattern of ASD
use and provide a broader understanding of what might
be expected in the general population. We examined
frequency and duration of electronics use across a
broad array of activities and types, problematic use in
both video game, Internet, and other electronics, and
are the first to explore the potential negative impacts on
the child and the family. Future research can build on
this work by making use of multiple sources of information about electronics use, including both parent
report and self-report, direct observation, and diaries.
Having a comparison group that is matched on developmental level would be helpful. It would also be useful
to longitudinally examine the predictors and outcomes
of problematic electronics to understand trajectories
over time.

## Conclusion

The results confirm the central role that electronics
play in the lives of youth with and without ASD,
although for youth with ASD, it is less likely used for
social reasons. Given the propensity for electronics
among individuals with ASD, incorporating electronics
into interventions may help to increase engagement,
motivation, and reinforcement (Mazurek and Wenstrup,
2013), if done in a strategic way that enhances engagement rather than serving an isolating role. These results
also suggest that individuals with ASD may be at a
particularly high risk for problems related to electronics
use, including excessive and problematic video game
and Internet use, calling for further attention into ways
of helping individuals use electronics in a healthy way.
Given that electronics use has a significant negative
impact on families of individuals with ASD, more
research is needed to examine how families can make
informed decisions about introducing electronics and
how they can implement strategies for monitoring its
use. Research should also investigate how to support
families when they are facing problematic electronics
use. The current findings highlight the need for increased
awareness and assessment of problematic electronics
use for individuals with ASD.
