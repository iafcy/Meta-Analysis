**Abstract**
This study explores how adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) use media, and the factors associated with
their media use. A total of 91 adolescents with ASD and their parents completed mail-based surveys. In all, 78% of the
adolescents with ASD watched television (approximately 2 h/day), and 98% used computers (approximately 5 h/day)
on any given day. They most frequently watched cartoons, played computer or video games that involved shooting, and
visited websites that contained information on video games. Adolescents with ASD who watched television with parents
reported more positive parent–child relationships. Adolescents with ASD who visited social networking websites or
received emails from friends reported more positive friendships. The findings help us understand media-use habits of
adolescents with ASD and suggest areas for future research.

Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have
been reported to have difficulties with peer relationships
and participation in social and recreational activities,
spending much of their free time engaging in solitary activities and less time doing social activities (Orsmond et al.,
2004; Orsmond and Kuo, 2011). Previous research found
that watching television and using a computer were the two
most frequent free-time activities of adolescents with ASD
(Orsmond and Kuo, 2011). Researchers also found that
adolescents with ASD had a significantly high prevalence
of television viewing and computer usage compared with
adolescents with speech/language impairment and confirmed those with learning disabilities (Mazurek et al.,
2012). Given the frequency with which adolescents with
ASD engage in television viewing and use computers, and
the lack of research in this area, it is important to understand the factors associated with engagement in these activities. Media-use patterns and their developmental
consequences have been well documented for typically
developing adolescents (e.g. Blais et al., 2008; Rideout et
al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2004). The first step to understanding the developmental sequelae of media use in adolescents
with ASD is to better describe their patterns, and to begin to
understand the concurrent associations between media use
and characteristics of the adolescent. In this study, we
examined how adolescents with ASD spent time using


media, and the factors associated with their media use.
Specifically, we examined the television shows they
watched and what they were doing when using a
computer.
Research shows that television can be educational and
can positively change attitudes and perceptions of individuals (Larson and Verma, 1999). Moreover, the increased
variety of communication features available through the
Internet (e.g. instant messaging programs, emails, social
networking websites, and chat rooms) and the interaction
possibilities within computer games provide enriched
learning opportunities for children and adolescents. These
same features can also pose risks, such as violent behaviors
and social isolation (Anderson et al., 2001). Thus, engaging
in various forms of media use could have both positive and
negative consequences.
A relatively large body of research has documented the
associations between media usage, behavioral outcomes,
and social competences of typically developing youth. For

example, watching violent programs is associated with
increased aggression, viewing educational programs is
associated with higher grades and less aggressive behavior,
and viewing sports television is associated with higher athletic participation (Anderson et al., 2001; Shields and
Behrman, 2000). Individuals who engage in high levels of
violent first-person shooter video game (a video game centered on gun and weapon-based combat through a first-person perspective) have been reported to have more aggressive
behavior (Barlett et al., 2007). Similarly, adolescents who
use video games that are suitable for ages over 17 years
show more aggressive behavior (Olson et al., 2009). We
know very little about the types of television programs and
computer activities in which adolescents with ASD engage.
Given the fact that engaging in different contents of media
may have different influences on development, it is important to begin to understand what content and types of media
they are engaging in.
The social context of media use is important in adolescents. Children who watch television with their parents tend
to report more enjoyment of programs than those who do not
watch television with their parents (Nathanson, 1999). Youth
who watch television with their parents tend to have similar
viewing habits as their parents (Nathanson, 2002). Watching
television with a parent may have a negative effect, however,
if aggressive content is viewed together and parents do not
appropriately discuss the content (Nathanson, 1999).
Research also suggests that the effects of computer use
on the development of social relationships depend partly on
whether the online social contacts are with family members
and friends, or with strangers and acquaintances (Blais et
al., 2008; Valkenburg and Peter, 2007). Adolescents who
interact with family members and friends on the Internet
develop better social relationships than those interacting
with strangers and acquaintances because offline relationships with family and friends provide more social support
than strangers and acquaintances. Therefore, in this study,
we also examined the companions with whom adolescents
with ASD use media.
Research with typically developing adolescents indicates that media usage can impact personal relationships.
Using instant messaging is positively associated with positive friendships, whereas visiting chat rooms and playing
video game are associated with less positive friendships
(Blais et al., 2008). Higher frequency of Internet use has
been reported to be associated with less positive parent–
child relationships (Willoughby, 2008) and a decrease in
adolescents’ size of social networks (Kraut et al., 1998).
Given that adolescents with ASD have difficulties with
social skills and communication (American Psychological
Association (APA), 2000), it is important to examine the
associations between autism symptoms and media usage.
If we find an association between social and/or communication skills and media use, we might be able to use media
to positively impact these skills. Thus, understanding the


associations between media use and ASD will add to our
knowledge about which youth might be vulnerable to
engaging in excessive or negative types of media use, and
will have implications for intervention, either through monitoring of children’s behavior or through using media to
improve social and communication skills.
The emerging literature on media use by youth with
ASD indicates that these youth spend more time engaging
in television and movie viewing than any other leisure
activity, and animated programs were highly preferred by
those who engaged in those activities (Shane and Albert,
2005). These findings were based on parents’ or caregivers’
reports. However, parents or caregivers who are not viewing media together with their children may not be able to
accurately account for their children’s media use.
Furthermore, Shane and Albert’s (2005) sample included a
wide age range of both children and adolescents with ASD,
which may not represent the media-use patterns in different
developmental stages. Thus, the present study focused on
adolescents with ASD and gathered information directly
from adolescents.
In view of the lack of knowledge of how adolescents
with ASD use media in terms of patterns and companions,
and the need to understand the possible associations
between media usage and the factors such as social skills,
behavior problems, and personal relationships, the aims of
the current study were to (a) describe how adolescents with
ASD use media, in terms of the frequency, amount of time,
and media content; (b) identify the companions with whom
they spent time using media; (c) examine the factors (e.g.
demographics and severity of autism symptoms) associated
with their media use; and (d) examine the associations
between media use and parent–child relationships and
friendships.

## Methods
 Procedures

Participants were recruited through local practitioners or
private school teachers working with adolescents with
ASD, and advertisements posted on autism-related Web
pages, forums, or through e-newsletters. Participants were
also recruited with the assistance of the Interactive Autism
Network (IAN) Research Database at the Kennedy Krieger
Institute and Johns Hopkins Medicine—Baltimore, sponsored by the Autism Speaks Foundation.
Prior to participation in the study, a short phone interview with parents was conducted to assure that the adolescents: (1) had a reading level at the 5th grade or higher, so
that the adolescents could complete the measures independently; (2) had been previously diagnosed with ASD by a
licensed professional; and (3) had a score of 15 or higher
on the Lifetime Form of the Social Communication
Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter et al., 2003), which was

the adolescents and their parents completed the questionnaires and returned them to the research office, the adolescents were sent a gift card as a token of appreciation for
their participation.

## Participants

Screening phone interviews were conducted with 119 parents, and 113 adolescents qualified for the study. A total of
91 adolescents and their parents completed and returned
mailed surveys. The data were collected during the summer
months in the United States (May 2009 to August 2009).

## Measures

Data were collected from adolescents and their parents
through mailed questionnaires.

_Background information. During the phone screen, parents_
reported their child’s age, gender, and primary ASD diagnosis. By filling out the questionnaires, parents provided
information on adolescent characteristics, such as current
autism symptoms, speaking skills, and comorbidity of
intellectual disability. They were also asked about family
characteristics, such as household income, parental education level, and parental employment status.

_Past and present autism symptoms. Parents completed the_
Lifetime Form and Current Forms of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter et al., 2003). The SCQ


-----

contains 40 items in three domains (social interaction, communication, and repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behavior). A score of 1 is given for the presence of an abnormal
behavior. A cutoff score of 15 on the Lifetime Form indicates likely ASD. Good reliability and convergent validity
have been reported (Chandler et al., 2007; Witwer and
Lecavalier, 2008). In the present study, alpha reliability of
the Lifetime Form and the Current Form were .77 and .80,
respectively.

_Parent–child relationships. Adolescents completed the Inven-_
tory of Parent and Peer Attachment–Revised (IPPA-R; Gullone and Robinson, 2005). The IPPA-R has 28 items for
mother–child relationships and 28 items for father–child
relationships rated on a 3-point scale from 1 (never true) to
3 (always true), with a higher total score indicating more
positive parent–child relationships. The IPPA-R has good
internal consistency reliability and convergent validity
(Gullone and Robinson, 2005). Alpha reliabilities were .76
and .87 for mother–child relationships and father–child
relationships, respectively.

_Friendship qualities. Adolescents completed the Friendship_
Qualities Scale (FQS; Bukowski et al., 1994), which measures the adolescents’ friendship qualities with their best
friend. The FQS has 23 items rated on a 5-point scale from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and it contains
five dimensions of friendships, namely, companionship,
conflict, helpfulness, security, and closeness, which are
measured. The total scores are calculated using the mean
score in each dimension, with high scores reflecting friendships perceived to be high in the named dimension. Good
psychometric properties have been reported (Bukowski et
al., 1994). In this study, alpha reliability was .87.

_Media use. Adolescents completed activity reports for one_
weekday and one weekend day at the end of the day. Adolescents reported on time spent watching television and
engaging in computer activities, which included playing
video games on the computer as well as on a video game
console. Other computer activities queried included browsing websites, receiving/sending emails, visiting chat rooms,
using social networking programs, and using instant messaging programs.
If the adolescent indicated that he or she used media on
a given day, they were asked to indicate the total amount of
time they spent using each type of media, such as “How
much time did you spend watching TV today?” They were
also asked to write in the name of the television programs
watched, games played, and websites visited. For video
games, adolescents did not need to specify the format
(computer, console, or tablet), but rather reported on the
total number of hours spent playing video games, and the
specific games that they played. For each activity, they also
reported whether they engaged in the activity alone or with


their mother, father, sibling(s), other relative, peer(s) or
friend(s), professional staff, or someone else. Adolescents
who used instant messaging programs or emails were asked
to report the companions with whom they exchanged
instant messages or emails. Adolescents were allowed to
choose more than one companion.

## Results
 Frequency and amount of time

Table 3 shows the frequency and the amount of time that
adolescents watched television and used a computer. We
present the frequency of adolescents who watched television or used a computer on either the weekday or weekend
day or on both days. We calculated the average daily hours
spent watching television and using a computer over one
week by multiplying the weekday hours of each activity
by 5 and multiplying the weekend hours of each activity
by 2, and then dividing the sum of these two calculations
by 7. Thus, the average time shown in Table 3 is not
merely an average of the weekday and weekend hours but
is weighted to reflect more weekday than weekend days in
a week.
On any given day, 78% of adolescents watched television for an average of 2.3 h. Almost all adolescents (98%)
used a computer on any given day for an average of 4.9 h.
To examine weekday and weekend differences in media
use, we used matched-pairs t-tests for continuous data and
McNemar tests (the matched-pairs equivalent of a chisquare test) for categorical data (Sheskin, 2007). We report
the McNemar test statistic (z) because of small cell sizes.
The frequency of weekday and weekend television viewing
was not significantly different (66% versus 73%; z = 1.5, p
= .210). Similarly, the amount of time spent watching television between weekdays and weekend days was not significantly different (2.6 h vs 2.7 h; t(70) = −1.24, p = .221).
Similar to television viewing, there were no significant differences between weekday and weekend use in the frequency of computer use (92% vs 91%; z = 0.30, p = 1.000),
or the amount of time spent using a computer (4.8 h vs 5.0
h; t (90) = −.45, p = .651).
Regarding specific computer activities (video gaming,
visiting websites, emailing, visiting chat rooms, using
social networking programs, or using instant messaging
programs), exploring websites and playing video games
(including both video games on personal computers and on
video-game consoles) were the most common (see Table 3).
On average, adolescents spent over 2 h surfing websites
and 2 h playing video games per day. A small number of
adolescents used computers for emailing, social networking, chatting, instant messaging, and doing other activities
(instrumental use, e.g. working on a school project or
downloading software). Although they less frequently used
instant messaging programs or visited chat rooms, they

spent a relatively long duration of time when they engaged
in these two activities. The range of time spent in these
activities was large, which suggests that some adolescents
with ASD spent large amounts of time on these activities,
and many did not do these activities. No significant differences were found in the frequency and the amount of time
spent on each of the computer activities between weekdays
and weekend days.

## Content preferences

We further examined the contents of television programs, video games, and websites that adolescents with
ASD most frequently reported. A total of 359 television
programs (including movies played on television), 240
video games, and 439 websites were listed by adolescents. All reported media content was coded by the first
author and a graduate student (who was blind to the
study purpose). The genres of television programs and
video games were adapted from Roberts et al.’s (2004)
media activity coding scheme, and the definitions of the
genres were based on Newcomb (2004) and Adams
(2009), respectively. The genres of websites were created by the first author. The genres of television programs, video games, and websites are available from the
author upon request.
Inter-rater reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic
was performed to determine consistency between the two
coders. The inter-rater reliability Kappa was .925 (p < .001)
for television program, .918 (p < .001) for video games, and
.765 (p < .001) for websites. For discrepancies, the first and
the second authors made a consensus decision about which
genre was the most appropriate.


_Television programs. Cartoons were the most popular televi-_
sion genre, and accounted for 37% of television programs
reported by adolescents (see Figure 1). Frequently listed cartoons included SpongeBob SquarePants, Fairly Odd Parents,
_Total Drama Action, The Penguins of Madagascar, Family_
_Guy, and The Simpsons. Comedy (including situational com-_
edy) was the second most popular television genre, accounting for 15%. Each of the remainder of the television genres
accounted for less than 10% of reported television programs.

_Video games. Action games accounted for slightly less_
than half of reported video games (46%) (see Figure 2).
Action games typically challenge the player’s physical skills
and coordination. As shown in Figure 2, shooting games
were the most frequently reported games in the action
genre. Simulation games and role-playing games represented about 10%–20% of reported games. Adolescents less
frequently played classic games (including board games,
card games, puzzles, gambling, word games, and game
shows), racing games, and adventure games, with each of
them accounting for less than 5% of reported games.

_Websites. Websites used for information and research_
accounted for the majority of reported websites, with those
containing information on video games as the most common sites and those containing information on anime as the
second most frequently reported sites (see Figure 3). Adolescents also visited sites for entertainment (e.g. watching
online anime, reading online comics, and sharing and viewing video clips), sites for either maintaining or establishing
relationships (e.g. friendships and intimate relationships),
and sites for playing games. The remainder of the reported
websites accounted for less than 10%, and included search

engine websites, shopping sites, online news, and family/
children sites.

## Companions

Table 4 shows the frequency with which adolescents
with ASD used various media with different companions. About half of adolescents who watched television
did it either alone or with family members on any given
day. Adolescents most frequently watched television


with their mothers, followed by siblings and then fathers.
They less frequently watched television with peers and
other companions. Companions for television viewing
did not differ significantly between weekdays and weekend days.
Regarding video games, more than a half of adolescents
played video games alone, and about one-fourth with peers.
Peers were the companions with whom adolescents most
frequently used instant messaging programs, and either
sent or received emails.

## Factors associated with media use

We used chi-square and t-tests to examine factors associated with how adolescents with ASD used media. Because
of the non-normal distribution of variables, and the many
adolescents who did not engage in specific computer activities (e.g. instant messaging and using chat rooms), we used
a dichotomous variable to indicate whether adolescents
participated in each discretionary activity on any given day
(0 = no, 1 = yes). Dichotomous factors examined included
gender, comorbidity of intellectual disability (0 = without
ID, 1 = with ID), parental education level (1 = lower than
bachelor’s degree and 2 = bachelor’s degree or higher), and
parental employment status (1 = unemployed and 2 =
employed). Other factors were continuous (e.g. age and
autism symptoms).
None of the factors were significantly associated with
whether adolescents watched television or not, but gender
and the severity of autism symptoms (current total SCQ


score) were associated with the types of television programs they watched. Females were more likely to watch
reality TV shows than males (30% vs 7%; χ[2](1) = 7.25, p =
.007). Adolescents with more autism symptoms were more
likely to watch news programs (t(89) = 2.32, p = .023) than
those with fewer autism symptoms.
Age, gender, and household income were significantly
associated with adolescents’ computer use. Adolescents who
used social networking programs were older than those who
did not (15.6 years old vs 14.6 years old; t(89) = −2.21, p =
.030). Males were more likely to play video games than
females (68% vs 11%; χ[2] (1) = 4.49, p = .034). More males
than females played action games (53% vs 12%; χ[2](1) = 9.36,
_p = .002) and sport or competitive games (24% vs 0%; χ[2](1)_
= 5.16, p = .023). More females than males visited websites
devoted to shopping (29% vs 11%; χ[2](1) = 3.91, p = .048).
Adolescents in families with higher household incomes were
more likely to spend time using a computer than those in families with lower household incomes (t(89) = −2.05, p = .043).

## Associations between media use and important personal relationships

Adolescents who watched television with their mothers or
fathers reported more positive mother–child relationships
(t(89) = 2.11, p = .039) and more positive father–child relationships (t(89) = 2.22, p = .029), than those who did not
watch television with mothers or fathers.
In terms of friendships, adolescents who received email
from friends reported greater security in their friendships
(t(89) = 2.14, _p = .036). Similarly, adolescents who used_
social networking programs reported greater security in
their friendships (t(89) = 2.11, p = .039). Adolescents who
visited websites for establishing or maintaining relationships reported more positive overall friendships than those
who did not (t(89) = 2.19, p = .031).

## Discussion

This study helps us understand how adolescents with ASD
use media. A large number of adolescents with ASD in this
sample engaged in media activities. Cartoons were the television programs that they watched most frequently. When
using a computer, they tended to visit websites that contained information about video games and anime, and play
video games that involved killing and shooting. Age, gender, and severity of autism symptoms were associated with
whether adolescents with ASD engaged in media activities
and their media content preferences. Engaging in specific
activities with specific companions was associated with
adolescents’ relationships with those companions.
Because our study did not include typically developing
comparison, we can only compare our findings to those of
previous published studies on typically developing adolescents (Rideout et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2004). This provides us with some indication of the possible differences of
the media-use patterns between adolescents with ASD and
typically developing adolescents. In comparison to the
research on typically developing adolescents who spent an
average of 4.7 h watching television on a typical day
(Rideout et al., 2010), adolescents with ASD in our sample
spent half the amount of time watching television and twice
the amount of time using computers (including playing
games). This finding also differs from Shane and Albert’s
(2008) in which youth with ASD spent considerable time
watching television. Because Shane and Albert’s sample
included both children and adolescents with ASD, their
findings may not represent the media use patterns in adolescence. One key difference in our study was that adolescents with ASD frequently watched television with their
mothers, whereas typically developing adolescents tend to
watch television with friends rather than parents (Roberts et
al., 2004). Watching television, videos, or movies with
peers could be one method through which typically developing adolescents socialize (Roberts et al., 2004). For adolescents with ASD, watching television may not be the


method they utilize to socialize with peers or friends. Future
research directly comparing the media use between adolescents with ASD and typically developing adolescents is
needed to verify our indirect comparison.
Adolescents with ASD most frequently watched cartoons, some of which are targeted toward younger children.
These types of television programs usually contain less
suggestive dialog, humor, and coarse language, and might
be easier for adolescents with ASD to comprehend.
Regarding video games, adolescents with ASD frequently played video games that involved shooting or killing. Shooting games require the player to focus attention on
and identify specific targets within a complex background
(Adams, 2009). Individuals with ASD often show unusual
attention to details and preoccupation with parts of objects
instead of the whole object (O’Riordan et al., 2001). They
have strengths in visual search tasks and feature discrimination, which require the ability to pick out a small stimulus
from a surrounding background (O’Riordan and Plaisted,
2001). Adolescents with ASD may have the capacity to perform well in shooting games, and at the same time, they
might be able to have successful experiences in these kinds
of games. Although we did not find associations between
shooting games and stereotyped, restricted behaviors in our
sample, prior research has found that playing shooting
games is associated with aggressive behavior in young
adults (Barlett et al., 2007). Given that a large number of the
adolescents in our sample frequently played shooting game,
it is important for future researchers to explore whether
there is a similar association between shooting games and
problem behaviors in adolescents with ASD.
In terms of website preferences, adolescents with ASD
most frequently explored websites containing information
about video games and anime. One of the autism symptoms,
stereotyped interests, may explain the website preferences
of adolescents with ASD (APA, 2000). Winter-Messiers
(2007) interviewed children and adolescents with Asperger’s
syndrome about their special interests and found that video
games and arts (including anime) were two of the main
interest themes. Our data support this finding.
It was interesting to find that autism symptoms were
associated with adolescents’ media content preferences.
Adolescents with ASD with more autism symptoms were
more likely to watch news programs than those with fewer
autism symptoms. News programs primarily report current
events. The content is usually straightforward, rarely
requiring viewers to interpret the emotions and intentions
or others, or to understand meanings of metaphors.
Therefore, news programs may be relatively easy to understand. It is also possible that teens were passively watching
the television programs that their parents preferred.
We found that adolescents with ASD who used computers for social purposes reported more positive friendships
than those who used computers for other purposes. Notably,
peers were the companions with whom adolescents with
ASD most frequently engaged in these computer activities.

Research on typically developing adolescents suggests that
adolescents may have better social relationships if they
spend more time communicating online with family and
friends than with strangers or acquaintances because offline
relationships with family and friends may provide more
social support than strangers and acquaintances. Our data
support this assertion.
We also found that adolescents with ASD who watched
television with their parents reported more positive parent–
child relationships than those who did not watch television
with their parents. Watching television with children not
only provides opportunities for parents to gain knowledge
of their children’s preferences and reactions to the television content but also allows parents to clarify, explain, or
discuss the television content (Dorr et al., 1989). When
watching television together, parents and adolescents share
the same experience, and the television content may provide a concrete subject for conversation (Sang et al., 1993).
Moreover, watching television with parents may also provide children a sense of security (Dorr et al., 1989).
However, we do not know the causal relationship between
watching television together and parent–child relationships. Longitudinal research is needed.
Our study had several limitations, which should be noted
in interpreting the findings. First, the findings from our study
should be generalized with caution. All participating families
were from the United States. Adolescent participants were
almost exclusively Caucasian, and almost all had at least
phrase speech. Two-thirds had a parent-reported diagnosis of
Asperger’s syndrome. Through conducting a mail-based survey, we were able to gain regional representativeness across
the United States, but most participant families were well
educated and many came from middle to upper socio-economic status. Thus, this sample may represent adolescents
who are more skilled and have greater access to media than
the broader population of adolescents with ASD.
Second, we did not know whether parents set rules on
adolescents’ use of media, such as what types of television
programs adolescents could watch, how long adolescents
were allowed to play video games, and whether adolescents
were allowed to have an account on the social networking
websites. Rates of use may be influenced by household
rules. Moreover, adolescents might have engaged in more
than one activity simultaneously. For example, they may
have surfed websites and sent instant messages to friends at
the same time. Thus, our findings my represent an underreporting of media use by these adolescents.
Third, most measures were self-report by the adolescents with ASD. Although we view this as a methodological strength, it also comes with some limitations. The data
we gathered represents the adolescents’ perceptions and
memories. We do not know the accuracy of their reported
media use, and we do not know whether the days on which
adolescents completed the activity reports were representative of their typical days. Moreover, completing the activity
reports at the end of the day may have resulted in recall

bias. To solve these limitations, future studies could collect
data in real time via an electronic device (e.g. PDA) to
record the start and end time of each media activity. These
methods, however, may be burdensome to adolescents.
Fourth, we conducted a number of bivariate comparisons to examine the factors that may be associated with the
adolescents’ media use, which could have increased the
possibility of a Type 1 error. Due to the small sample size,
we did not adopt a more stringent p level. Readers should
interpret our findings with caution, and replication of our
findings with larger samples is warranted.
Another limitation of this study was that all data were
collected during the summer months. It is possible that adolescents with ASD were more likely to spend time using
media during the summer months than during the school
year because they have more free time. We do not know
how adolescents with ASD use media during the academic
year, and we do not know if adolescents’ use of media is
similar between summer months and other months.
Finally, we did not collect data from typically developing adolescents for direct comparison. There is considerable data on patterns of media use by typically developing
adolescents, but this information also becomes outdated
fairly quickly. Future studies that collect data from both
populations will facilitate a better understanding of the use
of media by adolescents with ASD compared with their
peers without ASD.
The present study is the first study investigating how
adolescents with ASD use media, focusing on watching television and using a computer. In addition to describing
media use patterns in adolescents with ASD, we identified
factors that are associated with adolescents’ media use. We
collected data directly from adolescents rather than proxies (e.g., parents, caregivers, and teachers), which provided the adolescents an active role in research, and also
yielded detailed media use information. Although we cannot compare adolescents’ media use between summer
months and academic years, one advantage of collecting
data during summer months is that adolescents had more
free time in summer months and thus they had more
opportunities to engage in these activities. Therefore, we
were able to gain more information on their television
viewing and computer use.
Management of media use has been reported to be a
major issue for parents of children and adolescents with
ASD and has caused stress within their family (Nally et al.,
2000). A better understanding of how adolescents with
ASD use media may help parents be less worried about
their adolescents’ frequent media use and help them monitor their adolescents’ exposure to media. Additional
research is needed to better understand if the social skills
applied to or learned from online interactions as well as the
relationships established online could be generalized to real
lives. Moreover, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the developmental consequences of media use for this
population.
