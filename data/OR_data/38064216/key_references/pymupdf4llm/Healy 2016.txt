**Abstract The primary purposes of this study were to**
compare (a) physical activity participation, screen-time
habits, obesity, and (b) reported reasons for lack of participation in sport, between a nationally representative sample
of Irish children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participation in moderate to vigorous activity,
light activity, and sports was significantly lower among the
group with ASD. On examination of screen time variables,
no significant differences were seen between groups. However, time spent watching TV was higher among children
with ASD. Overweight or obese status was more prevalent
among the group with ASD (34.4 vs. 24.7 %). The findings
are discussed in relation to international statistics on youth
physical activity, screen-time, and weight status, and recommendations are provided for future research.

### Introduction

The prevalence of obesity among youth is a public health
issue of global importance (Han et al. 2010). Lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity and excessive screen time
usage have been identified as modifiable causal factors
(Jimenez-Pavon et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2010). Regular
engagement in physical activity (PA) has been demonstrated
to help youth control their weight while decreasing the
chances of developing additional health-related issues, such
as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, anxiety,
and depression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). Independent of physical activity participation, sedentary behaviors (e.g., screen time) can have
potentially deleterious health consequences and have been
identified as a risk factor for several health-related issues
including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Starkoff et al. 2014). Recent research, utilizing a representative sample of youth aged 12–15 years in the United States
(U.S.) suggests that about one quarter engaged in the recommended daily 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (Fakhouri et al. 2014). Similarly, in Europe,
research shows that only one-in-five children, aged 11–15,
report that they undertake moderate-to-vigorous exercise
regularly, according to results from the 2009–2010 HBSC
survey (Curie et al. 2012). Ireland consistently stands out as
a strong performer; with 31 % of girls and 43 % of boys at
age 11 meeting the guidelines (Curie et al. 2012).

For all youth, physical activity and screen time habits are
important elements to promote and maintain health, fitness,
and well-being (Laurson et al. 2014). For children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), research has identified a
number of additional benefits to being physically active,
such as improvements in social skills, sleep quality, and
feelings of enjoyment (Ayvazoglu et al. 2015; Wachob and

Lorenzi 2015). Unfortunately, however, research suggests
that youth with ASD may be at especially high risk of not
engaging in PA during leisure time (Tyler et al. 2014) and
the school day compared to their TD peers (Memari et al.
2013; Pan et al. 2015). Research findings point to several
reasons for why youth with ASD refrain from PA, such as
limitations in social-communication, lack of motor domain
skills, and social exclusion from activities. (Srinivasan et al.
2014) (Must et al. 2015).
Rather than engaging in physical activities, youth with
ASD tend to spend more time engaging in screen time
activities (e.g., watching television, playing video games)
than their typically developing (TD) peers (Mazurek and
Wenstrup 2013; Memari et al. 2013; Must et al. 2014; Sandt
and Frey 2005). This may be partially attributed to parents,
who use screen time activities to occupy youth with ASD
during household chores (Sandt and Frey 2005). Because
children with ASD tend to be less physically active and
engage in more screen time activities than peers without
disabilities, they are at greater risk for experiencing healthrelated issues. As such, research suggests that youth with
ASD may have higher rates of obesity and lower fitness
levels than their TD peers (Curtin et al. 2010; Srinivasan
et al. 2014; Tyler et al. 2014). According to Curtin et al.
(2010), the prevalence of obesity in children with ASD in
the U.S. is approximately 30.4 %, in comparison to 23.6 %
among their TD peers. There is somewhat conflicting
evidence regarding the obesity of youth with ASD in the
United States, though, as more recent nationally representative data suggest ASD status is not independently related
to obesity once secondary conditions (e.g., learning disabilities) and medication use are taken into account (Corvey et
al. 2016).
Currently, research examining physical activity participation, screen time habits, and obesity in youth with ASD
is limited by geographic location and small samples (Corvey et al. 2016). Although a few population-based studies
have been conducted in North America pertaining to ASD
(Corvey et al. 2016; Curtin et al. 2010) and other disabilities (Kim et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2016), research of this
magnitude is currently absent in a number of European
countries, including Ireland. It is reasonable to suggest that
barriers to physical activity participation are contextually
influenced, and those experienced by youth with ASD in
Ireland will likely vary from those experienced by children
in other countries. Therefore, the primary purposes of this
investigation were to compare (a) physical activity participation, screen-time habits, and obesity, and (b) reported reasons for lack of participation in sport, between a nationally
representative sample of Irish children with and without
ASD. Furthermore, a secondary purpose was to examine
physical activity, screen-time habits and obesity among the

## 1 3


children with ASD, based on gender, age of diagnosis, and
comorbidities.

### Method

**Participants**

Data were obtained from wave two of the nationally representative data set; _Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) which_
included a range of physical, behavioral, psychological, environmental, and cognitive outcomes for 13 year olds living in
Ireland. A systematic stratified sampling procedure was utilized to recruit participants (n = 8570) from 910 schools (of
the national total of 3200 Primary schools) across Ireland.
Parents and children completed questionnaires on a range of
outcomes related to the child’s characteristics, experiences,
and development. In addition, the child’s teacher and school
principal provided information relating to the child’s social,
emotional, and cognitive development, as well as school
characteristics. The data were collected between September
2007 and June 2008, under ethical approval from the Health
Research Boards’ Research Ethics Committee. Response
rates were 82 and 57 % at the school and family levels,
respectively. For more detailed information on the data set,
including the conceptual framework and methodology, see
Murray et al. (2011).
The present study included 141 children; 67 children
with ASD, and a randomly extracted sample of 74 TD
children for comparison. Adolescents were included in the
‘ASD group’ if their primary caregiver reported that the
child had ASD diagnosed by a medical professional. In Ireland, professionals who may provide a diagnosis include
psychologists, psychiatrists and/or community paediatricians, in conjunction with other disciplines such as speech
and language therapist, clinical nurse specialist, and social
workers (Health Service Executive 2012).

**Measures**

_Physical Activity and Sport Participation_

Multiple self-report measures of physical activity and sport
participation were included in the analysis. First, the adolescents’ physical activity was measured though self-report,
using questions adapted from the Leisure Time Exercise
Questionnaire (Godin and Shepard 1985). To assess participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA),
the respondents answered the question “How many times,
in the past 14 days, have you done at least 20 min of hard
exercise to make you breathe fast and make your heart beat
faster?”; examples of activities were provided including

playing soccer, jogging and fast cycling. To assess participation in light physical activity, the participants were asked
“How many times in the past 14 days have you done at least
20 min of light exercise that was not hard enough for you
to breathe heavily and make your heart beat fast?” Examples provided included walking or slow cycling. For both
questions participants were instructed to include time spent
in physical education. Participants responded using a fivepoint scale, ranging from 1 (none) to 5 (9 or more days).
These measures were used in previous research (Cadogen et
al. 2014), have demonstrated concurrent validity with measures of maximum oxygen intake (VO2 max) and muscular
endurance (Godin et al. 1986), and acceptable test–retest
reliability (Sallis et al. 1993).
A series of questions were also asked regarding the
child’s participation in sport. The number of team or individual sports in which the child participates was assessed
with the question “Outside of your physical education
classes, how many team or individual sports or activities
did you participate in during the past 12 months?” Examples provided included a school or local soccer/netball
team, athletics, or tennis club. Respondents choose from
none, one, two, three, or four or more activities. Respondents were also asked if they “play sports or undertake
physical activities without a coach or instructors (e.g. biking, skate-boarding, etc.)?” and if they “play sports with
a coach or instructor, or as part of an organized team,
other than in Physical Education class (swimming, soccer, hockey, etc.)?”. Answer options for both questions
included: (1) never; (2) less than once a week; (3) 1–3
times a week; or, (4) 4 or more times a week.

_Screen Time Variables_

Children answered three questions that measured screen
time behavior of the sample with and without ASD. Questions included: (1) “on a normal weekday during term-time,
about how many hours do you spend watching television,
videos or DVDs? Please remember to include time before
school as well as time after school?” (2) “On a normal weekday, during term-time, about how much time do you spend
using the computer? Please include time before school as
well as time after school. Do not include time spent using
computers in school”; and (3), “On a normal weekday, during term-time, about how much time do you spend playing
video games such as Playstation, X-box, Nintendo, etc.?” In
response to these questions respondents selected one of 13
categories, representing 30 min increments (e.g., 1–30 min).
A total screen time scale variable was also created which
combined the three screen time variables (television, computer, and video games), thus resulting in a 39 point scale. A
higher score on all variables reflects higher levels of screen
time.


_Reasons for Lack of Team Sport Participation_

In addition to exploring numerical values for duration of
physical activity, the GUI also sought to explain reasons
why participants did not participate Participants were asked
the question,. “Outside of your physical education classes,
how many team or individual sports or activities did you
participate in during the past 12 months?,”If respondents
selected “none”, they were prompted to select reasons as
to why they “choose not to participation in sporting activities?.” Possible reasons that the respondent could choose
from included: (1) I do not like team games; (2) I prefer to
watch sports on TV; (3) I am no good at games; (4) I do not
fit in with the sporty crowd; (5) I have no opportunities to
play; (6) I do not like to get dirty or sweaty; (7) I feel people
laugh at me because of my size; (8) I am not competitive;
(9) I have a disability or health problem which prevents me
from playing; (10) I prefer to play computer games; and
finally, (11) respondents could select ‘other’ and to specify
their reason.

_Body Mass Index_

Body mass index is the most widely used method for measuring the degree of body fat in children and has shown to
correlate strongly with measures of body fat derived from
direct physiological assessment (Lindsay et al. 2001). To
derive a body mass index score for each child, in each
household the interviewer took the weight and height of
each study child. A Leicester portable height measure was
used to record height to the nearest millimeter. For weight,
a Class IV, medically approved scales (SECA 761) were
used to record the child’s weight to the nearest kilogram.
Body mass index was then calculated by dividing weight
in kilograms by height in meters squared. Body mass index
cut-offs, standardized by age and sex, as provided by the
International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) (Cole et al. 2000),
were used to classify children as non-overweight, overweight, or obese.

**Statistical Analyses**

Descriptive statistics for participants’ demographic data
were reported. Pearson correlations were conducted to
examine the relationship between the physical activity,
screen time variables, comorbidities, and age of diagnosis
(before 6, 6–10, and 10+). Mann–Whitney tests and Fisher
exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical physical activity, screen time, and BMI variables
between children with ASD and TD children. When ordinal or continuous dependent variables were not normally
distributed, Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to determine
if there were significant differences between two or more

groups. Moreover, exploratory analyses were completed,
with data stratified by gender, age of diagnosis, presence of
comorbidities, and weight status (IOTF BMI categories).
All analysis were conducted using SPSS 23, with an alpha
level set at 0.05.

### Results

A comparison of the TD children with the members of the
full dataset, showed there to be no significant differences on
physical activity, screen time behaviors, or BMI (p < .05).
Descriptive characteristics of the children are provided in
Table 1, presented as TD children and children with ASD.
Chi square tests were used to compare groups on gender
and mothers’ education level (college or not); Mann Whitney was used for comparison of the continuous variable,
equivalized-household income (weighted to account for differences in size and composition of households in terms of
the number of adults and children in the home). Fifty-three
members of the group who had ASD (57.6 %) were male, in
comparison to 39 males in the TD group (42.4 %) (p = .002).

**Physical Activity and Sport Participation**

The most commonly reported number of days that children
with ASD reported at least 20 min of MVPA over the past 14
days was “1–2 days”, with 32.85 % (n = 22) of the sample
selecting this response (Table 3). In contrast, only 10.8 %
of TD children selected the “1–2 days” response, with the
most commonly reported response for TD children (36.5 %)
being “9 or more days” during the 2 week period. Comparing MVPA participation on 5 or fewer days versus 6 or
more days per 2 week period, Fishers Exact test demonstrated the children with ASD participated in significantly
less MVPA (p < .001). Results showed that 70.1 % (n = 47)
of the children with ASD participated in less than 5 days
of MVPA compared to only 23.9 % (n = 16) of the TD children. Regarding number of days with at least 20 min of participation in light physical activity, there were no significant
differences between the children with ASD and the TD children (Table 3).
On the measure of participation in team or individual
sports outside of physical education, the children with ASD
reported to participate in a mean of 2.2 sports, in comparison to the mean of 3.07 sports participated in by the TD
group (U = 1513, p < .001) (Table 3). More specifically,
the group with ASD undertook significantly fewer activities that involved a coach or instructor per week (U = 1516,
p < .001). Results showed that 24 children with ASD
(37.5 %) reported never playing sports with a coach in comparison to 18 TD children (25 %). Conversely, 25 TD children (34.7 %) reported to participate in sports with a coach
four or more times a week, in comparison to only three children with ASD (4.7 %). Regarding participation in sports
or physical activity without a coach, no significant differences were revealed between TD children and children with
ASD (U = 1980, p = .106). However, 18 TD children (25 %)
participated in sports without a coach four or more times a
week in comparison to 9 children with ASD (14.1 %). For
children with ASD, Pearson correlations revealed a positive significant correlation between levels of MVPA and
participation in team or individual sports outside of physical education (r = .471, n = 63, p < .001), participation in
sports with a coach or instructor (r = .597, n = 63, p < .001),
and participation in sports without a coach or instructor
(r = .696, n = 63, p < .001).

**Physical Activity and Gender**

For TD children, males participated in more MVPA, with
the majority (51.3 %, n = 20) participating in 9 or more days

that included at least 20 min of MVPA, than females. Only
30 % (n = 7) of the females participated in this amount of
MVPA. When comparing reported MVPA participation as
being 5 or fewer days versus 6 or more days per 2 week
period, significant difference between males and females
was revealed (p = .001). Males also participated in significantly more sports without a coach (M = 2.87 vs. M = 2.18,
_U_ = 422, p = .009), and with a coach (M = 3.08 vs. 2.5,
_U_ = 478.5, p = .46). No significant differences were revealed
between males and females in the sample of children with
ASD on MVPA, LPA, or sports participation variables.

**Physical Activity, Comorbidities and Age of Diagnosis**

Pearson correlation did not indicate the number of comorbidities or age of diagnosis to be significantly correlated
with the physical activity variables of interest, for the children with ASD. Kruskal–Wallis Tests determined mean


levels of participation in MVPA, among the children with
ASD, did not differ depending upon age of diagnosis, number of comorbidities, or comorbidity type (p > .05).

**Screen Time**

For time spent watching television, children with ASD
reported spending, on average, between 121 and 150 min
per day in comparison to TD children who spent a mean
of 91–120 min a day. Time spent using the computer
per day was less, with both groups reporting spending
a mean of 61–90 min per day. Time spent playing video
games was also similar for both groups, with a mean of
31–60 min a day spent in this activity. Finally, although
not quite statistically significant, comparing groups on
the total screen time scale variable, children with ASD
engaged in more screen time (m = 11.8) than TD children
(m = 10.02),(U = 1901, p = .105). For the group with ASD,
Pearson’s correlation showed total screen time score to
be negatively correlated with both participation in light
physical activity (r = −.33, n = 62, p = .009), and number
of sports participated in outside of physical education
(r =− .34, n = 62, p = .−026).

**Screen Time, Comorbidities and Age of Diagnosis**

No significant correlations existed between number of
comorbidities and screen time variables, however, the age
of diagnosis was correlated with time spent watching television (r = −.26). Children diagnosed with ASD before the age
of five (n = 18), or between 5 and 10 years (n = 27), spent,
on average, 121–151 min watching television. Conversely,
the children who were diagnosed after age 10 spent an average of 61–91 min watching television. Kruskal–Wallis Tests
determined mean levels of total screen time, among the children with ASD, did not significantly differ depending upon
age of diagnosis, number of comorbidities, or comorbidity
type (p > .05).

**Reasons for Lack of Team Sport Participation**

Twenty-three children with ASD and 11 TD children
answered the question relating to reasons not to participate
in sport. The most prevalent response provided by both
groups for lack of participation in sports outside of physical
education, was “I prefer to play computer games” including 13 children with ASD (56.5 %) and four TD children
(36.4 %). The reasons “I do not like team games” and "I
am not competitive” were each chosen twice by children
with ASD. The other reasons for lack of participation were
each chosen once. Two children from each group provided
reasons identified as ‘other’ which were not available for
viewing in the data set available to the researchers.

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**

Height and weight measures were missing for three children
with ASD, and one TD child. The mean BMI for the children with ASD was 21.21, in comparison to 20.42 for the
TD children. Distributions were not significantly different
(U = 2122, p = .438). On comparing groups by weight status, overweight/obese status was more prevalent among the
group with ASD, with 22 children being overweight/obese
(34.9 %), in comparison to 18 children (24.7 %) in the TD
group. A Chi Square test demonstrated this difference to
not be significant (p = .190). See Table 4 for an overview of
weight status among children with ASD and TD children.
Kruskal–Wallis Tests determined mean BMI among the children with ASD did not differ depending upon age of diagnosis, number of comorbidities, or comorbidity type (p > .05).

### Discussion

A primary purpose of this article was to compare PA participation between a nationally representative sample of Irish
children with ASD and TD peers. In this study, over 70 % of
the children with ASD participated in <5 days of MVPA over
a two-week period, in comparison to only 23.9 % of the TD
children. Children with ASD most frequently reported to
participate in at least 20 min of MVPA on 1–2 days over a
two-week period. Conversely, TD children most frequently
reported to participate in MVPA on 9 or more days. Overall,
the findings of our study reflect the inactivity of youth with
ASD in other research. For example, Memari et al. (2015)
utilized parent-reported data on children with ASD, aged
6–15, (n = 83) finding that only 12 % (n = 10) of children with
ASD were active and 88 % (n = 73) were inactive based upon
activity guidelines and activity score measured by the GodinShephard Leisure Time Questionnaire (GLTEQ). This result
is in contrast to research by Corvey et al. (2016) who found
no significant differences in physical activity rates between
the sample with ASD and the TD control. In addition, Bandini
et al. (2013) demonstrated children with and without ASD,
with a mean age of 6.6, participated in similar amounts of
light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity as measured
by accelerometry, when adjusted for age and sex. However,

parent reports did reveal the children with ASD to participated in significantly fewer types of activities than the TD
children. (6.9 vs. 9.9 per year, respectively). The tendency for
youth with ASD to participate in fewer activities and sports
is reflected in the 2003 National Survey of Children’s Health
finding that children with ASD were less likely to participate
in sports (41 vs. 27 %, p < .005) or extracurricular activities
(45 vs. 34 %, p < .05) than children with other developmental disabilities. The finding in our study support this trend,
whereby the children with ASD reported to engage in fewer
sports outside of physical education compared to their TD
counterparts (2.2 vs. 3.07). More specifically, the majority
(n = 24, 35.7 %) of the group with ASD reported to never participate in sports or physical activities involving a coach, in
comparison the majority (n = 22, 29.7 %) of the TD children
who participated one to three times per week. This may be
due to the tendency for sport with a coach to typically be of
a more competitive nature, which may make it less appealing to children with ASD whom have been reported to have
movement impairments (Blanchard et al. 2006). In addition,
in Ireland sports that involve a coach would most commonly
be team sports such as football (soccer), and Gaelic games
(Gaelic football and Hurling). The social nature of these
sports may be demanding for a child with difficulties in the
social domain, such as those with ASD.
Research on barriers to physical activity for children
with ASD is sparse and predominantly focuses on parental
report. Common barriers cited by parents include time and
financial constraints, and lack of opportunities (Memari et
al. 2015; Lee et al. 2008). Albeit infrequent, the perspective
of children with ASD has been elicited also. Obrusnikova
and Cavalier (2011), utilized Photovoice to enable 14 children with ASD to recall barriers to physical activity. Among
their responses, intrapersonal barriers and a preference for
screen-based activities were the most commonly noted.
These finding reflect the results of our study. The preference
for screen-based activities as a barrier to physical activity
participation was the most commonly reported barrier in our
study as well (reported by 56.5 % of the sample). However,
depending on the view that is elicited, research on barriers to physical activity for children with disabilities differ.
For example, a systematic review on the topic demonstrates
children to commonly cite personal reasons, while parents
tend to focus on familial, social, and policy factors (Shields
et al. 2012). Future research may want to utilize a qualitative approach in order to better understand the barriers children with ASD face that prevent them from engaging in PA.
This may provide in depth information for researchers then
to develop more effective strategies for families and schools
that may help children with ASD to become more active.
In regards to screen time, this study revealed no significant difference between the children with ASD and the TD
children on computer, video, and television use. Children in

both groups reported spending the most time watching television, with children with ASD reporting to spend a mean of
121 and 150 min per day in comparison to the TD children
who spent a mean of 91–120 min. Previous research has
revealed screen-time behavior to be significantly higher for
children with ASD in comparison to TD children. For example, Must et al. (2014), utilizing parental report, showed
mean daily screen-time to be 2.5 hours for children with
ASD, in comparison to 1.6 hours for TD children. Similarly, Mazurek and Wenstrup (2013) compared screen-time
between siblings with and without ASD revealing that children with ASD spent more time in screen-based activities
per day than TD children.
Several factors are proposed as contributors to the
increased likelihood of children with ASD to engage in
screen time activities. Nally et al. (2000) found that television and video games served as a means to calm the
child with ASD, as reported by parents. In addition, children with ASD are visually orientated. This characteristic
might make screen viewing particularly appealing. Finally,
the social deficits experienced by children with ASD may
result in a reluctance to engage in play and sports that are
often socially demanding. This aversion to group games,
may lead to a preference for individual activities such as
television viewing and video games, and in particular, nonsocial screen-based activities of which children with ASD
choose to participate in (Mazurek et al. 2012). It has been
showed (Graf et al. 2009) that TD children can increase
energy expenditure using exergames. Exergaming has also
shown to provide fitness games for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (Lotan et al. 2009).
Future research must continue to assess how parents can
use screen-based media to motivate their children with ASD
to engage in increased amounts of MVPA. The behavioral,
cognitive, and social benefits of exergaming must also be
explored for this population.
In the US, the rates of overweight and obesity among
children with ASD is higher than those of TD children
(Curtin et al. 2010). For example, among a large clinical
sample, Broder-Fingert et al. (2014) found higher rates of
obesity among children with ASD (23.2 %) and Aspergers
syndrome (25.3 %) compared to a TD control (6.3 %). To
date, research outside of the US is limited to data representing a few countries: rates range from 31.5 % in China
(Xia et al. 2010) to 52 % in the United Kingdom (Whiteley et al. 2004). To the knowledge of the authors, the current study is the first to examine overweight and obesity
rates for children with ASD in Ireland. Our Chi square
analyses showed there was no relationship between being
overweight and having an ASD diagnosis, however rates
of overweight and obesity among the sample with ASD
were higher than the TD control, with 22 children being


overweight or obese (34.9 %), compared to 18 children
(24.7 %) in the TD group. This difference did not reach statistical significance. Various factors are proposed for the
difference in overweight prevalence among individuals
with ASD, including restricted food preferences (Schreck
et al. 2004), lower physical activity levels (Pan 2008;
Rimmer et al. 2010), and medication use associated with
weight gain (Esbensen et al. 2009). Research by Corvey
et al. (2016), using data from the 2011–2012 National Survey of Children’s Health indicate that ASD was not independently related to obesity when medication use and the
presence of secondary conditions were taken into account.
In the current study, overweight and obesity rates did not
significantly differ between the sample with and without
comorbidities. Future research should examine the factors
associated with weight status among children with ASD in
Ireland, examining individual (including ASD severity levels), social and environmental factors.

**Limitations and Recommendations**

This study overcomes a number of limitations of past
research (Corvey et al. 2016) on this topic including a relatively large sample size, use of a comparison group, and
involvement of children from an unresearched geographical
area. However, several limitations should be stated. First,
this study utilized a variety of self-report measures. Selfreport may be prone to recall error and bias, and research
has demonstrated social desirability to compromise the
validity of self-report use in measuring physical activity
(Dishman et al. 2005). However, due to the large number
of questionnaires used in the data collection, the effect of
social-desirability for the questions of interest for this study
will be minimized. The use of self-report measures presents
another challenge for the measurement of physical activity
for children with ASD. Past research (Bandini et al. 2013),
has demonstrated that physical activity participation as measured by accelerometery was not associated with parental
reports of the child’s activity. The authors proposed that this
may be due to the failure for the parent to report activities
such as pacing, spinning, or other motor movements commonly observed in children with ASD. It is possible that the
children with ASD in this study engaged in similar movements that went unidentified due to the self-report nature of
the data. Future research should seek to extend this research
by using objective data collection methods. In addition,
because of the nature of the nationally representative data
collection procedure, it was not possible to confirm the ASD
diagnosis, or establish severity levels of the children in this
study. Future research should seek to examine PA and screen
time levels by the severity of ASD, which will help to better
tailor future interventions for this population.

### Conclusion

There is a growing body of research on physical activity, screen-time and overweight status of individuals with
ASD; results remain ambiguous, and are limited by a lack
of comparison groups, constrained geographical areas,
small samples sizes, and reliance on self or parent report
data. The current study contributes to the literature on this
topic, revealing lower levels of physical activity among
children with ASD, and higher levels of TV watching, compared to a TD control. Future interventions to increase PA
and decrease screen time in children with ASD should be
tailored to this population, as results demonstrated differences in activity behaviors among children with ASD and
TD children.
