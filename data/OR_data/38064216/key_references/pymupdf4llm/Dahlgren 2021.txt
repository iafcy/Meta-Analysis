**Abstract**
To date, studies using cross-sectional methodologies make up a majority of the literature surrounding children with autism
spectrum disorders and participation in physical activity and screen time. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine how
physical activity and screen time behaviors co-develop for children with and without an autism spectrum disorder. To address
this research gap, this study compared how physical activity and screen time levels changed over time (9 to 18 years of age)
between youth with autism spectrum disorder and youth with neurotypical development. Data on the levels of moderateto-vigorous physical activity, light physical activity, television-, and video game-based screen time, collected as a part of the
“Growing up in Ireland” study, were compared between youth with autism spectrum disorder and a propensity-matched
sample of youth with neurotypical development (n = 88 per group; 176 in total). Robust regression analyses indicated that
children with autism spectrum disorder became less active over time compared to children with neurotypical development
and that video game screen time also differed significantly between the groups when children were 9 years old. These findings
elucidate important disparities present between these groups of children during pivotal developmental times.

Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at an
increased risk of poor health outcomes compared to youth
with neurotypical development (ND; Mannion & Leader,
2013). For example, youth with ASD tend to have a higher
prevalence of obesity (23.05% vs 15.91%; Healy et al.,
2018) and obesity-related health conditions, including Type
II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (Shedlock
et al., 2016) compared to their peers with ND. These health

disparities exacerbate as youth with ASD enter adulthood
(Croen et al., 2015; Eaves & Ho, 2008). Approximately
40% of adults with ASD have obesity and 25% are hypertensive, as compared to 23% and 15% of adults with ND,
respectively (Croen et al., 2015; Eaves & Ho, 2008). In an
effort to understand and ultimately reduce these health disparities, it is critical to examine the modifiable behaviors
that impact health, including physical activity (PA) and
sedentary behavior (SB). As health behaviors in childhood
track into adulthood (Hayes et al., 2019; Malina, 2001;
Telama, 2009), a focus on understanding trajectories of
health behaviors in childhood among individuals with ASD
is of utmost importance.
Children (i.e. aged <13 years) with ASD tend to have
lower (Ayvazoglu et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Tyler et al.,
2014) or comparable (Bandini et al., 2013; Boddy et al.,
2015; Corvey et al., 2016) levels of PA compared to children with ND. As children move into adolescence, the disparity in PA levels between groups is clear. PA levels of
adolescents with ASD are most often reported to be lower
than that of their peers with ND (MacDonald et al., 2011;
McManus et al., 2012; Memari et al., 2013; Pan et al.,
2016). Reflecting this deviation, age is consistently identified as being negatively associated with PA levels among
youth with ASD (Jones et al., 2017). Highlighting this,
MacDonald and colleagues (2011) examined the PA patterns of youth with ASD between the ages of 9 and 18 years
and demonstrated that the mean amount of time spent in
moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 17 min for the
youngest group and 10 min for the older group.
Comparisons of levels of SB, often represented by
screen time (ST), between youth with ASD and youth with
ND lead to mixed conclusions. Heavy ST use is well documented among youth with ASD (Stiller & Mößle, 2018),
and several studies report higher levels of ST among youth
with ASD compared to youth with ND (Chonchaiya et al.,
2011; Engelhardt et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2015; South
et al., 2005). On the contrary, however, studies comparing
levels of ST between youth with ASD and youth with ND
have also reported no differences (McCoy et al., 2016;
Montes, 2016; Potvin et al., 2013). Difference in trajectories of ST use with age do, however, appear to differ
between youth with ASD and ND; ST levels appear to be
positively associated with age among youth with ASD and
are negatively associated with age among youth with ND
(Montes, 2016; Must et al., 2014; South et al., 2005). In
other words, ST increases with age for youth with ASD
and ST decreases for youth with ND.
Thus far, studies of PA and ST among youth with ASD
have relied on cross-sectional studies, providing us with a
“once off” insight into PA and ST levels among this population (Scharoun et al., 2017; Stiller & Mößle, 2018). While
informative for comparing samples, cross-sectional methodologies do not observe trends over time, which is essential for drawing conclusions on how PA and ST behaviors


develop (Gordon-Larsen et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2013). A
paucity of longitudinal studies is a major gap in the literature. Longitudinal methods can enhance our understanding
of the timing, nature, and extent of the changes among PA
and ST behaviors across time and informs the development
of targeted interventions at times when health behaviors are
at risk of worsening. Therefore, to begin to address this
research gap, this study compared how PA and ST levels
changed over time (aged from 9 to 18 years) between youth
with ASD and youth with ND.

## Methods

 Procedures and participants

Data came from waves 1, 2, and 3 of the nationally representative longitudinal study “Growing up in Ireland.” This
study began in 2006 and employed a fixed panel design, following the progress of a cohort of 9-year-old children born
between November 1997 and October 1998. Data were collected at three time points. Wave 1 (9 years) was collected
between September 2007 and April 2008. Wave 2 (13 years)
was collected between August 2011 to March 2012, and
Wave 3 (17/18 years) was collected between April 2015 and
August 2016. The study administered child- and caregiverreport surveys garnering information on youth and their
families and explored the following key domains of the
youths’ lives: health and physical development, educational/
cognitive development, socio-emotional and behavioral
well-being, and economic and civic participation. A total of
8568 children who were 9 years of age and their families
were surveyed at Wave 1. At Wave 2, 7525 families participated in the study, a retention rate of 89%. At Wave 3, data
were collected on 6216 children who were 17/18 years of
age representing a 74% retention rate, excluding the 172
families who were positively identified during Wave 1 or
Wave 2 fieldwork as no longer living in Ireland from the
base of 8568 families who were initially interviewed in
Wave 1. Data were successfully collected at all waves on
6039 children. At Waves 2 and 3, data were collected from
the adolescent. Several strategies were employed to elicit an
accurate response from participants. For example, the interviewer received training about how to establish a good rapport with the adolescent and the power imbalance that may
exist between interviewer and participant (Murray et al.,
2010). In addition, the interviewer was instructed to explain
a question when not understood by the respondent, and
prompt cards were available with the possible answers if
necessary (Murray et al., 2010).
For the purpose of this study, youth with ASD were
defined as those who were identified by their parents as
having a current diagnosis of ASD, received by a medical
professional at any time in Wave 1 (9 years), Wave 2
(13 years), or Wave 3 (17/18 years). By Wave 3, 91 children
were identified as having a diagnosis of ASD. A propensity

score matched (PSM) sample of 88 youth with ND was
then created, matched to the youth with ASD based on gender and income adjusted for household size at Waves 1, 2,
and 3. This resulted in a full sample of 176 children.
The propensity-matched sample included 138 males
and 38 females. At Wave 3, the mean income adjusted
for household size was €14,068 (standard deviation
(SD) = 7811). Of the youth with ASD, 62.5% (n = 55)
received at least one type of support or service, compared to 8% (n = 7) of youth with ND. Resource teaching/learning support was the most frequently reported
support received by youth with ASD (50%, _n_ = 44),
followed by special needs assistant (29.5%, n = 26). A
third (n = 38) of youth with ASD also had an intellectual disability. No race or ethnicity information was
available to be utilized for this study. See Table 1 for an
overview of sample demographics.

## Measures

_Demographic measures._ Demographic variables examined
in this study included gender and income adjusted for
household size. To further characterize the sample with
ASD, data were also provided on (1) the presence of an
intellectual disability and (2) the number and type of services received by the child, including (a) teaching/learning
support, (b) special needs assistant, (c) speech and language therapy, (d) management programs, (e) school psychologist, (f) occupational therapist, (g) physical therapist,
(h) psychiatrist, and (i) special help or resources in such
because of limitations. This information was parentreported at Wave 2 (see Table 1).

_PA._ Data on MVPA levels were collected on children at
each wave using the question:

How many times in the past 14 days has [the Study Child/you]
done at least 20 minutes of exercise hard enough to make him/
her breathe heavily and make his/her heart beat faster? [Hard


_( )_

exercise includes, for example, playing football, jogging, or
fast cycling]. Include time in physical education class.

Response options included none, 1–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9 days
or more. Similarly, data on light physical activity (LPA)
were collected via the question:

How many times in the past 14 days has [the Study Child/you]
done at least 20 minutes of light exercise that was not hard
enough to make him/her breathe heavily and make his/her
heart beat fast? [Light exercise includes, walking or slow
cycling]. Include time in physical education class.

Response options included none, 1–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9 days
or more. The questions were posed to the parent at Wave 1
and the child at Wave 2 and 3.

_ST._ Time spent watching television (TV) was assessed
during all three Waves of data collection. At waves 1 and
2, respondents were asked “on a normal weekday during
term-time, how many hours does [the Study Child/you]
spend watching TV, videos or DVDs? Please remember to
include time before school as well as time after school?”
Response options included none, less than an hour, 1 hour
to less than 3 hours, 3 hours to less than 5 hours, 5 hours to
less than 7 hours, or 7 hours or more. At Wave 3, respondents were asked:

How much time do you spend on each of the following activities
on a typical day (where it is your main activity at the time)?
Respondents reported time spent “Watching television/films

on a weekday. Response options were 30-min increments from
(1) 0–30 min to (13) 361 min or more. The questions were
posed to the parent at Wave 1 and the child at Wave 2 and 3.
Time spent playing video games (VGs) was also
assessed during each wave of data collection. At Waves 1
and 2, respondents were asked

on a normal weekday, during term-time, about how much
time does spend playing videogames such as, Playstation,
X-box, Nintendo etc? Please include time before school as
well as time after school. DO NOT include time spent using
computers in school.

At Wave 3, the question posed was

How much time do you spend on each of the following activities
on a typical day (where it is your main activity at the time)?

Respondents reported time spent “Playing video/computer
games” on a weekday. Response options were 30-min increments from (1) 0–30 min to (13) 361 min or more. The questions were posed to the parent at Wave 1 and the child at
Waves 2 and 3. For consistency across waves, ST variables
were coded across waves as “1 = no screen time,” “2 = less
than 1 hour of screen time,” “3 = 1–3 hours of screen time,”
and “4 = 4 or more hours of screen time ”

## Community involvement

As this is a national data collection effort, children with an
ASD were not directly involved in the design, implementation, analysis, or interpretation of the “Growing Up in
Ireland” study.

## Statistical analysis

Our analytic approach employed PSM between youth with
ND and youth with ASD. PSM was utilized to estimate the
model similarly to an experimental design by creating a
group with ASD and a control group (i.e. children with
ND) matched on key socio-demographic variables
(Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). The two groups were
matched using income adjusted for household size at all
three waves of data and child gender. PSM models function under the assumption that the matched groups are
demographically similar, yet differ on a grouping variable
of interest (Austin, 2011); for this study that included the
presence of ASD.
The matched sample was then utilized to run chi-square
tests on variables of interest such as MVPA and LPA, time
spent watching TV, and time spent playing VGs. These preliminary analyses were used to understand how youth with
ASD and youth with ND compared descriptively on each
variable across each wave of data from the original study.
Several robust regression models were run via the
RREG command in Stata 14.0 to further understand the
relationship between the matched sample and the variables
of interest at the final wave of data collection while controlling for prior time points. Robust regression weights each
observation based on absolute residuals, with data possessing larger residuals being assigned smaller weights.
Separate models regressed each outcome variable of interest—vigorous and light PA, and TV- and VG-ST—on the
binary ASD/ND predictor. Four separate models were run,
one for each outcome of MVPA, LPA, TV-ST, and VG-ST.
All models utilized ASD status (ASD or ND) as the independent variable and Wave 3 assessment of each respective
variable as the dependent variable. All models controlled
for participate sex, income adjusted for household size, and
the prior scores of each respective outcome variable at
Waves 1 and 2. These prior time points were utilized in
order to understand how ASD status predicted participation
in both PA and ST activities when children were aged
17/18 years while controlling for prior participation.

## Results

 Descriptive results

_PA._ At the age of 9 years, 44.3% (n = 39) of children with
ASD engaged in 9 or more days of MVPA compared to
62.5% (n = 55) among children with ND, but this difference
was not statistically significant (χ[2](4) = 9.14, p = 0.057).


MVPA decreased for both groups by the age of 13 years,
with this decrease being greater among children with ASD.
At the age of 13 years, adolescents with ASD most commonly participated in 1–2 days of MVPA (31.8%, n = 28)
compared to adolescents with ND who most frequently
engaged in 9 or more days of MVPA (36.3%, n = 32; χ[2](4)
= 17.49, p < 0.001). Levels of MVPA continued to decrease
through the age of 17/18 years, whereby adolescents with
ASD participated in significantly fewer days compared to
adolescents with ND (χ[2](4) = 17.97, p < 0.001; see Table 2
and Figure 1). More specifically, by the age of 17/18 years,
adolescents with ASD most frequently participated in no
days of MVPA (29.5%, n = 26), compared to adolescents
with ND who most frequently engaged in 6–8 days of MVPA
(26.1%, n = 23).
Levels of LPA did not significantly differ between children with ASD and children with ND at the age of 9 years
(χ[2](4) = 3.32, p = 0.506). Children with ASD and children
with ND most commonly participated in 9 or more days of
LPA (65.9%, n = 58% and 76.1%, n = 67%, respectively).
However, by the age of 13 years, the difference in LPA levels between groups increased as adolescents with ASD participating in fewer days compared to adolescents with ND
(χ[2](4) = 15.22, p = 0.001). By the age of 13 years, adolescents with ASD most commonly participated in 3–5 days of
LPA (28.4%, _n_ = 25) compared to adolescents with ND
who most frequently engaged in 9 or more days of LPA
(36.3%, n = 32). The difference in LPA was not significant
between groups at the age of 17/18 years (χ[2](4) = 5.61, p =
0.230; see Table 2). At the age of 17/18 years, adolescents
with ASD and adolescents with ND most commonly participated in 9 or more days of LPA (32.9%, _n_ = 29% and
37.5%, n = 33, respectively; see Table 3 and Figure 1).

_ST._ Time spent watching TV did not differ between groups
at any data collection time points (p - 0.05 for Waves 1, 2,
and 3; see Table 4 and Figure 1). At Wave 1 and 2, youth
with ASD and youth with ND most commonly watched
1–3 hour of TV per day (Wave 1: 61.3%, _n_ = 54% and
71.5%, n = 63, respectively and Wave 2: 40.9%, n = 36%
and 59%, _n_ = 52, respectively). At Wave 3, adolescents
with ND were still most likely to engage in 1–3 hour of TV
time per day (47.7%, n = 42), whereas adolescents with
ASD were most likely to engage in 1–3 hour per day
(30.6%, n = 27) or 0 hour per day (30.6%, n = 27).
VG-related ST only significantly differed between
groups during Wave 1 of data collection (χ[2](3) = 8.42, p =
0.027; see Table 5). At Wave 1, children with ASD and
children with ND most commonly engaged in 1–3 hour of
VG play per day (34%, _n_ = 30% and 54.5%, _n_ = 48,
respectively). At Wave 2, most adolescents with ASD and
ND participants reported spending less than 1 hour playing
VG per day (31.8%, n = 28% and 48.8%, n = 43, respectively). At Wave 3, adolescents with ASD and ND reported
to most often spend no time playing VG (see Figure 1).

## Regression results

A robust regression analysis was run on each outcome of
interest (i.e. MVPA, LPA, ST-TV, and ST-VG) at Wave 3
when children were aged 17/18 years in order to understand if ASD status was related to participation in each
outcome at Wave 3 when controlling for earlier participation at Waves 1 and 2. The only statistically significant


difference found in activity participation at Wave 3 was
for MVPA. Specifically, having ASD was related to significantly less participation in MVPA when participants
were aged 17/18 years compared to their ND peers after
controlling for prior time points of MVPA participation
(b = −0.67, p = 0.002). There were no statistically significant differences based on ASD status for Wave 3 outcomes of LPA, ST-TV, or ST-VG (see Table 6).

## Discussion

By adolescence, youth with ASD are significantly less physically active compared to their peers with ND (MacDonald
et al., 2011; McManus et al., 2012; Memari et al., 2013; Pan
et al., 2016; Ratcliff et al., 2018). Our understanding of when
this disparity in PA levels develops is hampered by a lack of
longitudinal studies. This study, for the first time, begins to
address this research gap by revealing that disparities in
MVPA levels between children with ASD and children with
ND, which exist at the age of 9 years, progressively worsen
between the age of 9–13 years, and further worsen from the
age of 13–17/18 years. Moreover, this study suggests that the
disparities in LPA between groups emerge between the age


An age-related decline in PA levels is well documented
among youth with ND, as demonstrated by longitudinal studies (Sallis, 2000); this study suggests that this phenomenon is
exacerbated among youth with ASD. Several social factors are
reported to contribute to the decline of PA from childhood to
adolescents among youth with ND. These factors include a
lack of social support and negative self-perceptions of competence to perform (Bélanger et al., 2011). These factors may be
compounded among children with ASD due to their unique
social and communication behaviors associated with ASD
(Corvey et al., 2016). This speculation is supported by research
in which children with ASD and their parents reported a host
of social barriers to PA, including stress that arise from social
interaction (Arnell et al 2020) being victims of bullying in

practitioners (e.g. physical education teachers) (Blagrave &
Colombo-Dougovito, 2019; Healy et al., 2013; Must et al.,
2015), and having difficulty initiating social interactions
(Obrusnikova & Miccinello, 2012). To improve health behavior trajectories and reduce the steep decline in PA levels among
hild i h AS l i d h i


maintain PA among this population, as they enter adolescence,
is critical. Combatting the more-severe decline in PA levels
that exists for children with ASD will demand a focus on providing appropriate physical education, school-based extracurricular PA opportunities, and community and home-based
PA opportunities. Examining the multi-level factors that distinguish between children with ASD who decrease, maintain,
or increase their PA participation as they enter adolescence is
an important precursor to these efforts.
Our data showed both ST-TV and ST-VG levels were
comparable among children with ASD and children with
ND at the age of 9, 13, and 17/18 years, with the exception
of ST-VG at the age of 9 years. These results reflect previous studies reporting comparable levels of ST between
youth with ASD and youth with ND (McCoy et al., 2016;
Montes, 2016; Potvin et al., 2013). Interestingly, TV-ST
levels among children with ASD decreased from the age
of 13–17/18 years (to illustrate; only 30% of 17/18 years
with ASD participated in more than an hour of TV-ST at
the age of 17/18 years compared to 66% and 62% of children with ASD at the age of 9 and 13 years, respectively).
A lack of studies of ST-TV of youth with ASD at this age
make it difficult to ascertain the novelty of this finding.
These data suggest that intervening to reduce levels
among children with ASD and children with ND might be
particularly warranted between the age of 9 and 13 years,
when increases in VG-ST and TV-ST occur. Increased ST
is positively associated with conditions including obesity,
sleep problems, depression, and anxiety (DominguesMontanari, 2017) and negatively associated with academic performance (Zimmerman & Christakis, 2005).
Increased ST has also been associated with lower PA levels (Sandercock et al., 2012). The interdependence
between PA and ST may contribute to the inverse relationship that appears to exist between trajectories of these
behaviors, particular between LPA and ST levels for children with ASD. Giving further credence to the interded b A d S b h i hild

with ASD, the factors reported to promote ST use among
children with ASD reflect the barriers this population
reports for PA (e.g. the non-social aspect of TV and VGs,
the consistency and predictability of these forms of entertainment (Durkin, 2010)). Combatting decreasing levels
of PA and intervening to reduce ST levels might be best
tackled in unison, with multi-behavior interventions, targeting common social factors.

## Strengths and limitations

The longitudinal nature of the data, collected at three time
points across a critical, formative period of development
(i.e. 9–17/18 years) was a strength of the study. These data
provide insight into how PA and ST behaviors change or
intensify through childhood to adolescence. The propensity-matched groups of youth with ASD and ND was also
a strength, ensuring samples were comparable by gender
and socioeconomic status.
Several limitations should also be noted and considered
in the interpretation of findings. First, data collection was
self- and parent-report which can increase the risk of bias
as some participants may not accurately recall information. For example, previous studies have found that parentreported measures tend to overestimate children’s PA
(Adamo et al., 2009). Moreover, some adolescents with
ASD may not have been able to respond to the survey at
the age of 13 or 17/18 years, despite the efforts made to
make data collection accessible and thus dropped out of
the study. Data on reasons for attrition are not available.
Second, the sample size of this study was relatively small,
decreasing the statistical power of the results and making
generalizability difficult. This is particularly salient among
the heterogeneous population of children with ASD. Third,
data collection began in 2003 and ended in 2016. The benefit of having such a long time-period to study also incurs
the issue of having to consider socio-cultural and technological changes that occur during this time-period. For
example, use of the Internet has grown exponentially in
the last decade (Anderson et al., 2017). It is unknown how
trajectories of PA and ST from the age of 9–17/18 years
will evolve in the coming decades.

## Conclusion

Our understanding of PA and ST levels among children
with ASD is largely derived from cross-sectional studies,
which limit our ability to observe trajectories of behavior.
This study expands upon this research by examining PA
and ST over a longer time-period (8 years), with data collected at three different time points. This longitudinal data
provide a comprehensive account of PA and ST patterns.
Most notably, the data demonstrate disparities in MVPA
between children with ASD and ND to progressively
worsen from the age of 9–18 years, and disparities in levels


of LPA to worsen from the age of 9–13 years. Longitudinally
studies of PA and ST among younger children with ASD,
larger samples, and using objective measures of PA and ST
are urgently required.
