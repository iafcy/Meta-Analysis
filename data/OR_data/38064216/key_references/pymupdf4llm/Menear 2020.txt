**Abstract**
**Objective Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participate in less physical activity (PA) and more sedentary**
behavior than their peers without ASD.
**Methods The study employed Chi-square analyses of the NSCH 2016–2017 data to compare PA, TV/video watching/gam-**
ing, and usage of portable electronic devices by children with and without ASD by age and ASD severity.
**Results Results suggest more than two and a half times as many children 6–11 and 12–17 years old with ASD failed to**
engage in 60 min of PA during the past week compared to peers without ASD. As children aged, their PA time decreased,
with a larger percentage drop for children with ASD. For children ages 6–11 years, an inverse relationship was found between
PA and ASD severity that was not found for older children. As the children got older, children with ASD spent more time
watching TV/video watching/gaming than peers without ASD, with differing results by ASD severity. More children Birth
to 5 years ASD used portable electronic devices than their peers without ASD and more young children with ASD used
devices for 3 or more hours a day. Roughly the same proportions of children 12–17 years old used devices for more than 3 h
a day but differential results were found between children with and without ASD for less than 1 h of device use.
**Conclusions for Practice These data can be used to advocate for individualized PA interventions and services to increase PA**
and decrease sedentary behaviors of children with ASD.

### Significance

_What is already known on this subject? Previous research_
shows children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participate less in physical activity (PA) and exercise than their
typically developing peers and spend more time than their
peers in sedentary behaviors.
_What this study adds? This study analyzes the newest data_
from a national data set. The study compares participation
by children 0–17 years old without ASD to children with
ASD, by severity level, in PA, time spent TV/video watching/gaming, and use of a portable electronic device. To our

knowledge, this is the first study to include data on a wide
range of electronic devices, inclusive of tablets, that takes
into account the recent large swings in how often children
watch TV/video watching/gaming and use portable electronic devices. Given prior research that indicates strong
relationships between technology use and PA, this is the first
study to explore the severity levels of ASD as they relate to
technology use and PA. These data can be used to advocate
for individualized PA interventions and the appropriate supporting services in order to increase the PA behaviors and
decrease the sedentary behaviors of children with ASD.

### Introduction

New Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (U.S. Dept.
of Health and Human Services 2018) recognize the importance of physical activity (PA) on health. However, research
shows that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

participate in less PA and more sedentary behavior than
their peers without ASD (Corvey et al. 2016). Similar to
individuals who follow typical development, this lower PA
and higher sedentary behavior in children and adolescents
with ASD has been associated with a negative impact on the
physical domain. However, an association was found with
poor cognitive or social skills in children and adolescents
who exhibit less PA and more sedentary behavior (Memari
et al. 2017).
When they do participate in PA, individuals with ASD
can experience benefits to physiological, cognitive, psychological, and behavioral functioning (Sorensen and Zarrett
2014). PA by individuals with ASD was shown to significantly improve sleep quality and cognition in individuals
(Tse et al. 2019), motor skills and executive function (Pan
et al. 2017), physical fitness (Ana-Maria and Ion-Sebastian
2018), and multiple domains of their health-related quality
of life (Hamm and Yun 2019). Most notably, exercise has
been identified as an evidence-based practice for students
with ASD (Sam et al. 2019). However, implementing PA
interventions can be quite challenging with this population.
Barriers to PA for individuals with ASD may include deficits
in motor skills, sedentary behavior and obesity, social and
behavior deficits associated with ASD, parental concerns,
and lack of appropriate programs (Nichols et al. 2019).
Another barrier to PA for children with ASD may be the
amount of time they spend with TV/video games or using a
portable electronic device, or overall screen time (Mazurek
et al. 2012). Mazurek and Wenstrup (2013) collected data
on the use of electronic devices by 202 children and adolescents with ASD and 179 typically developing siblings. The
children with ASD spent more time watching TV and playing video games than in all non-screen activities combined
and more hours per day playing video games. They also had
higher levels of problematic video game use.
In a systematic review of 35 studies, none of which
included digital tablets but some of which included other
screen usage, Jones et al. (2017) studied the prevalence and
correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in
children with ASD compared to typically developing peers.
Children with ASD spent more time with screens, more
time in sedentary behaviors, and less time in PA than typically developing peers. Age was inversely associated and
sex inconsistently associated with PA, and age and sex were
inconsistently associated with sedentary behavior.
Healy and Garcia (2019) compared psychosocial factors
related to PA and screen-time of children 9 years old with
and without ASD. The children with ASD participated in
less PA than their typically developing peers. A significant
association between ASD and bullying was found for light
PA. Children with ASD who reported having been bullied
were less likely to participate in light PA. No significant
differences were found in participation of lower PA or daily

screen time of two groups of children. Children with ASD
had lower perceptions of their popularity, greater anxiety, more peer challenges, and lower ratings of prosocial
behavior.
Research studies have explored the independent relationship of PA and sedentary behaviors on health outcomes
for typically developing children, but not for children with
ASD. In typically developing children, there appears to be
independent positive impacts on their health and fitness,
particularly those children who are overweight or obese,
when sedentary behaviors, often defined as TV viewing, are
reduced and/or physical activity levels are increased. One
study showed that reducing sedentary behaviors had the
greater positive impact (Epstein et al. 1995). Mitchell et al.
(2012) positively associated sedentary behavior with obesity
in 12-year-olds, and found that low levels of moderate-tovigorous physical activity increased the sedentary 12-yearolds’ odds of being obese. With evidence that excessive use
of screen-based media is linked to overweight and obesity in
children, reducing TV viewing is associated with decreased
health risk factors (Marshall and Ramirez 2011). We do not
have data on whether or not reducing screen-based media
usage by individuals with ASD might improve participation
in PA, as has been shown in typically developing peers. A
better understanding of time spent by children with ASD
in PA, with TV/videos, and with other portable electronic
devices is needed in order to determine if research such as
these studies with typically developing children should be
replicated with children with ASD.
The National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) data
set has been previously analyzed to better understand use of
screens, prevalence of overweight/obesity, and PA by children and adolescents with and without ASD. In an analysis
of the 2011–2012 data, Montes (2016) did not find evidence
that children with ASD differ in their screen time habits from
other children (both groups had high screen usage); however,
ASD data were not analyzed by severity level. Johnson et al.
(2016) used the same data set and found children and adolescents with ASD had higher prevalence of being obese and
overweight than children and adolescents without ASD, with
television time as a predictor for both groups. The analysis
also indicated that children with ASD who used portable
electronic devices for 4 or more hours per day were more
likely to be overweight or obese than those who did not use
devises. Healy et al. (2018) looked at NSCH 2011–2012
data for children 6 years of age and up with and without
ASD. Focusing on their results for children with ASD, the
researchers found no environmental factors were associated
with PA, and the presence of a bedroom TV and the lack
of limits on screen time were associated with screen time.
As reviewed above, children with ASD participate in less
PA and more sedentary behaviors, including more screen
time, than their peers without ASD even though they receive

similar benefits from PA as their peers. Evidence suggests
characteristics of the diagnosis, parental influence, community factors, and screen time may contribute to these findings related to activity levels. National data (Anderson 2015)
indicate that by 2015, 68% of adults had a smartphone and
45% had a tablet computer. These percentages were up from
35% with smartphones and only 3% having a tablet in 2010.
In addition, by 2017, 98% of children age 8 and under live in
a home with a mobile device (Common Sense Media 2017).
Prior research about technology has often focused on watching TV and DVD/Video, using video game equipment, and
using laptop or tower computers. The Common Sense Media
survey found decreases in TV/DVD/Video gaming and computer use for children, with a ninefold (from 4% in 2011 to
35% in 2017) increase in how much time was spent with
mobile devices. The increased availability of smart phones
and electronic tablets at home, in schools, and during intervention means that individuals with ASD likely have more
opportunities for screen time usage.
During a time of more access to screens, do individuals with ASD continue to exhibit low levels of PA? Given
the amount of time that individuals with ASD have been
shown to spend with screens used by a variety of devices
(not including tablets), given the many benefits of PA, and
given the widespread understanding that PA should be individualized in order to have optimal benefit, it is important to
know what the most current data suggest about children with
ASD. It is also important to explore PA and screen time that
includes tablets by age and ASD severity level. Current data
regarding how time is spent by children and adolescents with
and without ASD can inform decisions regarding future individualized behavioral interventions and educational lessons
that aim to increase PA and decrease sedentary behaviors
in children with ASD, including subgroups of children and
adolescents with similar ASD severity levels.
The purpose of this research was to analyze the NSCH
2016–2017 data by comparing PA, TV/video watching/gaming, and usage of portable electronic devices by children
with and without ASD by age and severity level of ASD.
The NSCH 2016–2017 data set identifies the severity level
of the child with ASD. Even though the 2011–2012 data set
included a question about children’s use of TV/video watching/gaming and a question about using portable electronic
devices, usage of these devices has changed considerably
over the past decade (Alkhayat et al. 2020). For example,
one survey found a 50% decrease in TV/video watching
and a 350% increase in mobile device use for young children from 2011 to 2017 (Common Sense Media 2017). We
have not seen current data that compare children with ASD
by age from 0 to 17 years and by severity level to children
without ASD regarding PA, TV/video watching/gaming, and
usage of portable electronic devices. Therefore, our specific
research questions were, are there statistically significant


differences in (1) the weekly amount of exercising, playing
a sport, or participating in PA for at least 60 min differ by
age groups and severity levels for children with ASD compared to typically developing peers, (2) the average time on
a weekday spent in front of a TV watching TV programs,
videos, or playing video games differ by age groups and
severity levels for children with ASD compared to typically
developing peers, and (3) the average time on a weekday
spent with computers, cells phones, handheld video games,
and other electronic devices, doing things other than schoolwork, differ by age groups and severity levels for children
with ASD compared to typically developing peers.

### Methods

The NSCH, funded and directed primarily by the United
States Health Resources and Services Administration’s
Maternal and Child Health Bureau, provided national and
state-level data on the physical and emotional health of
American children 0–17 years old (2016/2017 National
Survey of Children’s Health 2019). The 2016–2017 surveys were conducted by the United States Census Bureau.
Random sampling by mail occurred to identify households
with one or more children under 18 years old. One child per
household was randomly selected to be the subject of the
survey, with an oversampling of children with special health
care needs and children 0–5 years of age. For 2016–2017, a
total of 71,811 surveys were completed (50,212 in 2016 and
21,599 in 2017). An initial screen questionnaire was used
prior to a more detailed, age-specific questionnaire that was
applied to only one child per household. Respondents were a
parent or caregiver with knowledge of the health and healthcare of the child. Households had the option to respond via
a web instrument or a paper instrument, both of which were
available in English and Spanish. The combined data set
for 2016 and 2017 allows for more opportunities to analyze
variables with small sample sizes or low prevalence and to
conduct more complex analysis across variables.
From the completed questionnaires, 1711 respondents
to the 2016–2017 NSCH indicated they currently had a
child with Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger’s
syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder (survey
grouped all 5 into “ASD”). The 1711 families in the sample
represent 2.4% of all participants in the survey. Compared
to the families who did not have children with ASD, there
were slightly more families (15.3% vs. 10.5%) with a child
with ASD that were 0–99% of the federal poverty level, and
fewer families with a child with ASD (35.5% vs. 43.1%) that
earned 400% or more of the federal poverty level (Table 1).
A frequency analysis of the racial make-up of the sample of
families indicated small differences between the two groups.

Chi-squared analyses explored percentage responses
regarding children with and without ASD on the child’s:
(1) weekly amount of exercising, playing a sport, or participating in PA for at least 60 min by age groups and severity
levels (“PA time”), (2) average time on a weekday spent in
front of a TV watching TV programs, videos, or playing


video games (“TV/video watching/gaming”), and (3) average time on a weekday spent with computers, cells phones,
handheld video games, and other electronic devices, doing
things other than schoolwork (“portable electronic devices”).
Respondents for the NSCH were only asked to indicate PA
time for at least 60 min within a day during the last week
if the child was 6 or more years of age. In the combined
2016–2107 data set, a new data variable was created that
aggregated children with ASD if the response was moderate
or severe. However, the authors of this research article chose
to analyze the ASD data using the 2016 and 2017 criteria of
mild, moderate, and severe for exploratory purposes related
to practical implications for the field.

### Results

The first set of analyses examined the weekly amount of
exercising, playing a sport, or participating in PA for at
least 60 min by age groups and severity levels. Chi-square
analyses found significant differences among the percentages of children with and without ASD that engaged in PA
for greater than 60 min at least once a day (see Table 2).
Almost 21% of children with ASD did not have a single
day of 60 min or more PA during the week which contrasts
with only 8% of children without ASD. For children ages
6–11 years old, 11.4% of those with ASD versus 3.6% of

those without ASD reported zero days of 60 min of PA.
With the older age group, 27.3% of the 12–17-year-olds with
ASD and 11.2% of their peers without ASD had zero days
where they engaged in 60 min or more PA. Findings indicated 16.5% of 12–17-year-olds without ASD and 27.9%
of 6–11-year-olds without ASD were engaged in PA every
day compared with 10.6% of 12–17-year-olds with ASD and
20.3% of 6–11-year-olds with ASD.
Children that were 6–11 years old engaged in significantly more PA for 60 min than 12–17-year-old children.
The same percentage (44%) of younger and older children
with ASD engaged in PA for 1–3 days. However, 24.8%
of 6–11-year-old children with ASD and only 18.3% of
12–17-year-old children with ASD met the PA criteria for
4–6 days. The largest difference was 20.3% of younger children with ASD versus 10.6% of older children with ASD met
the PA requirement every day. Results also varied by ASD
severity for engagement in PA (see Fig. 1). For the younger
6–11-year-old children, children with more severe levels of
ASD engaged in less PA of 60 min or more than children
with milder forms of ASD. At the same time, analysis indicated a corresponding decrease in the number of children
from mild to moderate to severe ASD that had 60 min of PA
for 4 or more days. No significant differences across ASD
severity levels were found for the 12–17-year-old children
with ASD (see Table 2).
The second set of analyses examined the average time on
a weekday spent in front of a TV watching TV programs,
videos, or playing video games, with response options of:
Less than 1 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, or 4 or more hours per day.
Results indicated Chi-square statistically significant differences (Table 2) for all of the three age groups by time and
diagnosis of ASD. Children with ASD engaged in substantially more TV/video watching/gaming than children without
ASD. For example, results for watching TV/video watching/
gaming for more than 4 h a day were: 12% of 0–5-yearold children with ASD versus 3.7% of their peers without
ASD; 9.7% of 6–11-year-old children with ASD versus 5.0%
of their peers without ASD; and 21% of 12–17-year-old
children with ASD vs. 10.9% of their peers without ASD.

Three times as many children with ASD (16.2%) vs. 5.4% of
0–5-year-old children without ASD did not watch/participate
in any TV/video watching/gaming. This result for young
children contrasts with the two older groups of children that
had similar percentages for children with ASD and without
ASD who did not engage in TV/video watching/gaming.
Chi squared analyses indicated that the only statistical
difference for TV/video watching/gaming and severity of
ASD was with the 6–11-year-old children (Table 2). Of note
(Fig. 2), 16% of children with severe ASD watched no TV
compared to 4.1% of children with moderate ASD and 3.7%
of children with mild ASD. Results indicated 16.6% of children with mild ASD, 28.9% of children with moderate ASD,
and 24.1% of children with severe ASD spent 3 h or more
with TV/video watching/gaming.
The final set of analyses explored children with and
without ASD and average time on a weekday spent with
computers, cells phones, handheld video games, and other
electronic devices, doing things other than schoolwork. Chisquare analyses indicated significant differences for all three
age groups of children by diagnosis (Table 2). The largest
differences were between 12 and 17-year-old children with
and without ASD. Children with ASD used a portable electronic device for an average of 3+ h/weekday more often
than children without an ASD, with differential effects for
the age of the child. Findings indicate contrasts of 15% of
0–5 years-old children with ASD vs. 4.5% of children without an ASD; 23.3% of 6–11-year-old children with ASD versus 12.3% of children without ASD; and 46% 12–17-yearold children with ASD vs. 41% of children without ASD.

A Chi squared comparison of age by ASD severity for
using portable electronic devices found significant differences for children ages 6–11-years-old and 12–17-years-old,
but not for the 0–5 year-old children (Table 2). For children 6–11-years-old and 12–17-years-old, data indicated an
increasing trend (Fig. 3) of children with a greater degree of
severity of disability not using a portable electronic device.
At the same time, for all three age groups, children with
more severe ASD used portable electronic devices for more
than 4 h to a greater degree than children with mild or moderate levels of ASD.

### Discussion

Results of this study support existing literature that indicates there is a notable difference in PA participation by
children with and without ASD from birth to 17 years old.
Of particular concern is the finding in this study that more
than two and a half times as many children 6–11 years old
and 12–17 years old with ASD failed to engage in 60 min
or more of PA time during the past week compared to
age-matched children without ASD. In many schools and
communities, these age ranges are the ones with schoolbased and community-based opportunities for PA, including physical education, inclusive sports and recreational
opportunities, after-school non-profit services, and various
programs for therapeutic recreation. Additionally, the current national guideline (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services 2018) of participation in PA at least 60 min daily
by children in these age groups has been a recommendation since the original guideline was published in 2008.

Yet, even with the guideline and the likelihood of multiple
PA opportunities, as all children in this study increased
in age, their PA time decreased but the percentage drop
was larger for children with ASD. This begs the question,
“How are children and adolescents with ASD spending
their time?” For the age-related results of our other two
research questions, our analysis indicated that as the ages
of most children in this study increased, children with
ASD spent more time watching TV/video watching/gaming than their peers without ASD and they engaged with
portable electronic devices for longer periods of time than
their peers without ASD, a finding that provides new information given the previous lack of research that included
portable electronic devices.
This study provides initial data on ASD severity levels
related to PA, time spent watching TV/video watching/
gaming, and use of portable electronic devices. As severity
of ASD increased across all age groups, time spent in PA
decreased. However, it is interesting that results for time
spent watching TV/video watching/gaming did not show
trends by severity of ASD across the age ranges. Children
6–11 years old with severe ASD spent the least amount of
time with TV/video watching/gaming, yet children 0–5 years
and 12–17 years with severe ASD spent the most amount
of time with TV/video watching/gaming compared to their
age group peers with mild or moderate ASD. The largest
percentage of children watching more than 4 h of TV/video
watching/gaming were the Birth to age 5 children with
severe ASD. Like time spent in PA, as ASD severity levels increased across all age groups, there was more daily
usage of portable electronic devices doing things other than
schoolwork.
The findings for PA and sedentary behaviors of children
with ASD are largely supported by prior research regarding
American children, as presented in a systematic review by
Jones et al. (2017). In addition, using the 2016 NSCH data
set, Ratcliff et al. (2018) found that children with ASD from
6 to 7 years old had significantly lower participation levels in
_physical, recreational, social, skill, and jobs/chores activi-_
_ties than typically developing children. Older children with_
ASD had greater disparity among the types of leisure activities. The same 2016 NSCH data set was analyzed by McCoy
and Morgan (2020), who found adolescents (10–17 years
old) with ASD were less likely to engage in 60 min of PA
as the severity of their diagnosis increased. Using the same
data set we used, McCoy and Morgan (2020) found that adolescents with ASD (severity was not analyzed) were more
likely than their typically developing peers to watch TV for
more than 2 h/day but were not more likely to use computers/portable electronic devices for more than 2 h/day. Factors
that inhibit or prohibit PA by children with ASD could be
related to symptoms of ASD, the PA environment, family
context that limits or provides related supports or resources,


-----

availability of trained PA professionals, and neighborhood
or home environment (Healy et al. 2018).
Collectively, our results and research reviewed in this
article indicated that children with ASD do not follow the
American Academy of Pediatrics’ most recent policy statement on screen time (AAP Council on Communications and
Media, Media and Young Minds 2016). The policy statement reviews research on the impact of screen time on overall development, sleep, obesity, and parent interaction. The
policy discourages use of screen media other than videochatting for children younger than 18 months, advises only
high-quality programming/apps for children 18–24 months
with shared usage between parent and children and an avoidance of the child using the screen solo, and promotes a limit
of 1 h or less a day of high-quality programming for children
older than 2 years.
Notably, the NSCH data we analyzed did not include
questions about what portable electronic devices are used
for, except noting “other than ‘schoolwork”. It is possible
the time children with ASD spend with portable electronic
devices may be caused by adult-directed interaction with the
devices. Although typically conducted with a low number
of participants, studies employing video games as a form
of intervention have been used to teach children with ASD
skills such as sportsmanship (Ferguson et al. 2013); motor
skills (Taheri and Sotoodeh 2018); functional skills for use
in contexts such as home, school, community, and job (Goo
et al. 2019); daily living and motor skills (Kellems et al.
2018); social interactions (Stone et al. 2019); social skills,
living skills, and academic skills (Withey 2017); social play
(Francis et al. 2019); music education in an environment that
decreased stress, and anxiousness, increased socialization,
and promoted friendships (Hillier et al. 2016); and improved
communication skills (Alzrayer and Banda 2017).
Also important to note is the time with portable electronic
devices may not equate to child being sedentary during that
time. It would be informative for future research to explore
how children with ASD at all severity levels interact with
portable electronic devices, and determine the percentage
of time this interaction represents sedentary behaviors vs.
PA. If a significant amount of time spend with portable electronic devices is in sedentary behaviors, then this time along
with the time spent watching TV/video watching/gaming
and using home gaming system, may be opportunities for
caregivers to encourage the child with ASD to participate
in PA. Using portable electronic devices to increase PA may
also capitalize on the preference visual input of individuals
with ASD (Mazurek et al. 2012).
Capitalizing on their familiarity with videos and portable
electronic devices, exergaming may be one way to improve
the PA time for children with ASD (Dickinson and Place
2014; Golden and Getchell 2017). It may also be a way to
address the results we found regarding ASD severity levels


because exergaming may be more accessible and adaptable
to individual preferences and developmental levels than inperson PA. Stanish et al. (2017) found adolescents with ASD
spent less time in moderate and vigorous PA than typically
developing peers, but the time they did spent was most often
via walking/hiking or active video gaming. Other research
indicated exergaming sessions provided a significant
increase in heart rate (Bittner et al. 2017; Ryuh et al. 2019).
Given the common usage of portable electronic devices by
young children with any ASD severity level, as shown in this
study, and the positive outcomes cited above, exergaming
may be an appropriate form of PA intervention for young
children with ASD, as well as one that could potentially
remain viable as they age, and should be explored in future
research studies.
In order for any form of virtual reality, including exergaming, to have a long-term positive impact on individuals
with ASD, research shows that the space must be tailored
to their individual need, which would include ASD severity
level. A systematic literature review of studies employing
PA-based interventions for adolescents with ASD found that
highly effective intervention mechanisms included prompting, modeling, praise, and structured teaching (Sorensen
and Zarrett 2014). The sensory load in the system must also
be appropriately controlled and adapted to meet the sensory needs of the individual (Boyd et al. 2018). Therapeutic
‘games’ (or exergames) should integrate the expertise of
clinicians, input of children, and experience of designers to
achieve objectives and be enjoyable for children (Malinverni
et al. 2017). Applications that aim to teach basic relational
concepts should employ best practices from early intensive
behavioral intervention (Mykyta and Zhou 2017).
The results of this study should be interpreted in consideration of its limitations. The survey relies on self-report,
which yielded a data set limited to cross-sectional analysis. The authors did not control the questions in the survey
and were unable to explore variables, specifically; (1) we
do not know what the portable electronic devices were used
for “other than schoolwork”, and some of that usage could
have included PA; therefore, we cannot assume that all of
the time reported as device usage time employed sedentary
behaviors; (2) we do not know the children’s gross motor
proficiency levels and can only make somewhat educated
assumptions about such based on ASD severity level; (3)
we do not know the family context, particularly how much
parents or other caregivers do or do not engage in PA and
how influential their behaviors are on their children; and
(4) we do not know the specifics of the PA. In addition, we
did not control for comorbidities, maladaptive behaviors, or
medications. While previous research has not shown strong
associations with these factors and levels of PA by children
with ASD (Corvey et al. 2016; Jones et al. 2017), those studies did not include portable electronic device use. Finally,

demographic information for the families who had a child
with ASD indicated a slightly larger percentage of families
in the 0–99% category of Federal Poverty Level. Although
prior research (Rideout and Katz 2016) has indicated few
differences between household income, other research
(Common Sense Media 2019) has indicated that tweens
from higher-income homes are on social media less than
tweens from lower-income households. The availability and
use of electronic handheld devices, and these relationships
to physical activity remains an area of limited research when
considering children with ASD.
These data, which used a large sample size from a
national study and included a comparison group, can be
used to advocate for individualized PA interventions and
the appropriate supporting services in order to increase the
PA behaviors and decrease the sedentary behaviors of children with ASD. As children spend a large portion of the year
in schools, teachers, and physical educators in particular,
should create positive and supportive opportunities for children to engage in PA, with particular emphasis on teaching
motor skills to young children and helping them implement
them in appropriate environments, establishing healthy habits that could help increase time spent in PA as they age
(Jones et al. 2017). This is especially important for children
with a greater severity of ASD, as this study demonstrated
that these children spend a disproportionate amount of time
TV/video watching/gaming and using portable electronic
devices, while at the same time having the largest percentage
of days without a single 60-min bout of PA.
