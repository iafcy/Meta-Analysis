digital media affect child development, these factors have rarely been studied in association
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms.

**OBJECTIVE To determine the association of experiential factors, including social activities and**
screen viewing in the first 18 months of life, perinatal factors, and demographic factors, with
ASD-like symptoms and risk on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at
2 years.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data for this cohort study were derived from the**
National Children’s Study, a US multicenter epidemiological study of environmental
influences on child health and development. A total of 2152 children were enrolled at birth
from October 1, 2010, to October 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to
December 3, 2019.

**EXPOSURES Caregivers reported whether the child viewed television and/or videos (yes or**
no) at 12 months of age, hours of viewing at 18 months of age, time spent by the caregiver
reading to the child (number of days per week compared with daily) at 12 months of age, and
frequency of playing with the child (daily or less than daily) at 12 months of age. Prematurity,
maternal age at birth, child sex, household income, race/ethnicity, and caregiver
English-language status were included in analysis.

**MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Significant association of exposures with ASD risk by**
M-CHAT and/or ASD-like symptoms assessed by revised M-CHAT (M-CHAT-R) total score in
multiple regression models.

**RESULTS Among the 2152 children included in the analysis (1099 boys [51.1%]), television**
and/or video viewing (yes or no) at 12 months of age was significantly associated with greater
ASD-like symptoms at 2 years of age (change, 4.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-8.3%) but not with ASD
risk (risk prevalence rates, 8.3% vs 4.4%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.40; 95% CI,
0.86-2.29). Similarly, parent-child play daily compared with less than daily was significantly
associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms at 2 years of age (change, −8.9%; 95% CI, −16.5%
to −0.9%) but not with ASD risk (risk prevalence rates, 6.4% vs 14.0%; AOR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.31-1.08). However, high screen viewing at 18 months of age was not significantly associated
with ASD-like symptoms (change, 10.7%; 95% CI, −2.0% to 23.0%) or ASD risk by M-CHAT
(AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.56-2.49) at 2 years of age.

States.[1] Although genetics impart 50% to 80% of risk

in ASD, nongenetic contribution of risk is also significant but
poorly understood.[2] Perinatal and demographic factors have
been associated with ASD risk.[3-5] However, findings are inconsistent regarding the association between socioeconomic
status and ASD prevalence[6,7] and differences in prevalence
among minority and nonminority populations.[1,8]

Early experiential factors, such as screen media viewing
and parental reading to and playing with one’s children, have
rarely been studied prospectively in association with ASD
symptomoutcomes.However,greaterscreenviewinghasbeen
associatedwithASDandnegativedevelopmentaloutcomes.[9-15]

Screensinterferewithparent-childinteractions[16] andofferlittle
opportunityforlearningforinfantsandtoddlerscomparedwith
real-life social interactions.[17-19] In addition, socially engaged
parenting has been associated with positive child developmental outcomes.[20-23] Because of the potential for these modifiable experiential factors to contribute to negative and positive child development, a better understanding of the
association of these experiences with ASD outcomes may provide opportunities to somewhat mitigate genetic predisposition.UsinglongitudinaldatafromtheNationalChildren’sStudy
(NCS), a US multicenter epidemiological study of environmental influences on child health and development,[24] we examined the extent to which early screen exposure and social engagement through play and reading as well as previously
identified perinatal and demographic factors were each associated with later risk of ASD and ASD-like symptoms as measured by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers
(M-CHAT).[25]

### Methods

#### Data Source and Study Sample
Participants in this cohort study were enrolled at birth in the
NCS from October 1, 2010, to October 31, 2012. Data for the present report are from the NCS Archive,[24] a publicly available repository of NCS data and samples in which 5608 children and
their caregivers participated in at least a portion of the study
visits from preconception through 42 months of age. Initially
intended as a large national cohort study of environmental effects on children, the NCS was discontinued prematurely by
the National Institutes of Health. For the present report, only
childreninthesubcohortwhohadanM-CHATscorebeforeNCS
termination were included. This study was deemed exempt
from formal approval by the Drexel University institutional review board and from informed consent because the NCS data
source contained no personally identifying information. This
study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa[tional Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/)
The study cohort was not intended to be nationally representative. Experiential factors were assessed at 12 months
of age, with screen exposure also assessed at 18 months of age.
At the 12-month visit, caregivers answered questions assessing screen viewing frequency (“Does your child watch TV/


DVDs?” [no or yes]), reading frequency (“How often does participant read or look at books with child?” [once a week or less;
2-4 days a week; 5-6 days a week; or every day]), and caregiver play frequency (“How often does participant play with
toys with child?” [less than daily or daily]). At the 18-month
visit, screen exposure was assessed with the question, “Over
the past 30 days, on average, how many hours per day did child
watch TV and/or DVDs?” Responses were none, 1 hour or less,
2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, and 5 or more hours. Given that prior
retrospectiveresearchhasfoundearlyscreenexposureofmore
than 4 hours to be associated with ASD,[10] the 18-month screen
exposure variable was recoded as 3 hours per day or less or 4
hours per day or more.

#### Perinatal and Demographic Factors
Gestational age was coded as very premature (<32 weeks), premature (32-35 weeks), or full term (≥36 weeks). Maternal age
was coded as 34 years or younger, 35 to 39 years, or 40 years
or older. Household income was recorded on a 4-point scale
as less than $30 000, $30 000 to $49 999, $50 000 to $99 999,
or $100 000 or more. English-speaking caregiver was recorded in response to the item, “Was the interview completed in English?” (no or yes). Race/ethnicity, included as a
variable to examine whether outcomes differed across race/
ethnicity, was recorded by parent response on the questionnaire to preset categories determined by the NCS, including
non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, black, Asian, American Indian/
AlaskaNative,NativeHawaiianandotherPacificIslander,multiple ethnicities/races, or other. The race/ethnicity was recoded as Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
or non-Hispanic other owing to a small number of respondents in each of the other race/ethnicity categories.
Outcomes were assessed using the M-CHAT, a validated
screening tool to assess ASD-like symptoms among toddlers
aged 16 to 30 months.[25] Primary caregivers completed the 23item M-CHAT, which uses a yes or no response format, when
their child was 19 to 30 months of age (mean [SD], 26.6 [2.1]
months). The M-CHAT has 2 different modes of scoring that

by the endorsement of 2 or more critical items or 3 or more of
any items.[25] Because the M-CHAT has a low positive predictive performance in the general population,[26] we also assessed ASD-like symptoms based on total score of the revised
M-CHAT (M-CHAT-R), on which higher scores correlate with
greater specificity.[27] Three questions included in the original
M-CHAT were dropped on the M-CHAT-R owing to poor predictive performance.[27] Accordingly, total scores were based on
summing the 20 M-CHAT questions that had content parallel
to the M-CHAT-R items, with total scores ranging from 0 to 20
(higher scores indicate greater ASD-like symptoms).[27]

#### Data Analysis
Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to December 3,
2019. All variables related to characteristics of the study population were categorical. We present the patient characteristics as counts and percentages. We fitted a multiple logistic regression model to estimate the association of demographic,
perinatal, and experiential factors with ASD risk. The covariates included in the logistic regression model were gestational age, maternal age at birth, child sex, family income,
English-speaking status of parents, race/ethnicity, play fre

quency at 12 months, reading frequency at 12 months, screen
exposureat12months,andscreenexposureat18months.Likewise, a linear regression analysis was conducted using the total
M-CHAT-R score as the outcome with the same covariates. In
the linear regression model, the M-CHAT-R score was corrected for positive skew using a natural log transformation. For
ease of interpretation, the results from the linear regression
models are presented in terms of percentage change calculated as (1 −e[β]) × 100, where β indicates coefficients from the
linear regression model. The percentage change can be interpreted as change in the expected M-CHAT-R score of a given
categorycomparedwiththatofthereferencecategoryofavariable in percentage scale. To correct for heteroskedasticity of
the M-CHAT-R score in the linear regression, the robust linear
model macro[28] with the HC3 variance-covariance matrix was
used. For both logistic and linear regression analyses,
E-values were computed for each significant risk factor to provide an estimate of unobserved confounding.[29] E-values estimate the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with the risk factor and
outcome to nullify an observed association. Multiple imputation of 100 data sets was conducted to manage missing data
(12.7% missing) with all study variables included in the imputation model. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software, version 24.0 (IBM Corporation).

### Results

#### Participant Characteristics
A total of 3603 children had 2-year visits in the NCS, and of
these, the parents of 2231 (61.9%) voluntarily completed the
M-CHAT;79potentialparticipantswereineligibleowingtohaving multiple children from the same families. The population
for this analysis included the remaining 2152 children (1099
boys [51.1%] and 1053 girls [48.9%]) (Table 1). Responders included biological parents for 1973 children (91.7%), guardiansfor164(7.6%),grandparentsorotherrelativesfor11(0.5%),
teachers for 2 (0.1%), and child care providers for 2 (0.1%).

risk (AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.56-2.49) at 2 years of age. In addition, reading to one’s child less than daily compared with daily
at 12 months of age was not significantly associated with ASDlike symptoms or ASD risk.

#### Perinatal and Demographic Factors
Gestational age of 32 to 35 weeks (compared with ≥36 weeks)
was associated with greater ASD risk by M-CHAT (AOR, 2.49;
95% CI, 1.38-4.50) and with greater ASD-like symptoms
(change, 12.7%; 95% CI, 1.6%-25.2%) when controlling for the
other factors. Less than 32 weeks’ gestation did not show a significant association with either outcome, likely owing to the
modest sample of very premature infants. Family income of
$30 000 to $49 999 compared with less than $30 000 was associated with lower ASD risk (AOR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74)
but not with ASD-like symptoms, whereas family income of
$50 000 to $99 999 was associated with both lower ASD risk
(AOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19-0.99) and fewer ASD-like symptoms
(change, −9.3%; 95% CI, −13.8% to −4.7%), and family incomeof$100 000ormorewasassociatedonlywithfewerASDlike symptoms (change, −13.8%; 95% CI, −17.7% to −7.8%). Hispanic ethnicity compared with non-Hispanic white ethnicity

### Discussion

#### Experiential Exposures
The present study is unique in assessing association of early
experiential exposures with ASD risk and ASD-like symptoms by M-CHAT scores at 2 years of age. A retrospective
study[10] found that 2-year-old children with ASD had an earlierageofscreenviewing(beginningat6months)andhadmore
than4hoursofdailyscreenviewingonaverageduringtheearly
years.Giventhelimitednatureofthescreeninformation(viewing of television and/or videos [yes or no]) at 12 months in the
present study, the association with increased ASD-like symptoms, although modest, is notable. Others have similarly reported concerns regarding negative social and cognitive outcomes associated with screen viewing in children with ASD.[30]


Higher screen exposure in young children interferes with sociallearning,[16] isassociatedwithalteredbrainprocessing,[15] and
theoretically could promote visual brain hyperconnectivity.[31]

In siblings of children with ASD who go on to develop ASD,
overgrowth of the visually related brain areas at 6 to 12 months
of age is one of the earliest findings.[32] However, children predisposed to ASD may have a preference for screens, or parentsofchildrenalreadydisplayingASDsymptomsmaybemore
reliantonscreenstosootheachildwithself-regulationissues.[33]

Other factors that affect early screen use are mothers’ own
screen time and their beliefs regarding children’s television
time.[34]

We found daily parent-child play, compared with less than
daily, to be associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms. Although this association was also modest, it is important to consider the potential mitigating effect of more parent-child play
onachild’ssocialdevelopment,particularlyasitrelatestoASD.
In typically developing children, parent-child interaction correlates with brain development,[35] and parent-child play–
based intervention in toddlers with ASD is associated with improvement in ASD symptoms.[36] However, the association
between parent-child play and ASD-like symptoms could be
driven by the behavior of children who are beginning to develop ASD symptoms because they may be more difficult to
engage socially. Assessing early social experiences more
broadly and at an earlier age (eg, 6 months) before a child begins to exhibit ASD symptoms or brain manifestations would
help to better establish the directionality of an association between social experiences and ASD symptoms in early childhood.

#### Demographic and Perinatal Factors
The present study found lower family income to be associated with both greater ASD risk on the M-CHAT screen and
greater ASD-like symptoms. Some US studies have reported a
higher prevalence of ASD among families with higher
incomes,[6,37] whereas studies performed in countries with universalhealthcarereportedlowerfamilyincomeassociatedwith
greater ASD prevalence.[7] These differences may reflect a diagnosisbiasorlimitedaccesstospecialistsforthosewithfewer
resources in countries without universal health care.[7]

An association between immigrant status of the mother
and higher rates of ASD in the child has been previously
reported.[5] By using non–English speaking as a proxy for caregivers’ immigrant status, we found a similar association with
ASD-likesymptoms.Inaddition,wefoundgreaterASDriskand
ASD-like symptoms to be present among Hispanic children
compared with non-Hispanic white children. One study found
that minority children have a higher initial rate of positive
screening than white children on the M-CHAT-R and a lower
rate of positive screening at follow-up but a similar rate of ASD
diagnosis.[38] Historically, lower prevalence rates of ASD have
been reported in Hispanic children compared with black children, who have had lower rates than non-Hispanic white children,butthesedifferencesarenarrowing.[1] Nonetheless,higher
rates of ASD in Hispanic and African American or black children compared to non-Hispanic white children have previously been reported.[8]


-----

Preterm birth was associated with ASD risk and ASD-like
symptoms at 2 years of age in line with prior research.[3] The
present study did not show any association of maternal age
with children’s ASD risk or ASD-like symptoms once other risk
factors were covaried. Greater ASD risk in the offspring of both
the oldest and youngest groups of mothers[4,39] and no association of maternal age with ASD risk[40] have been reported.
Differences in age groupings across studies may partially explain these inconsistent findings. We did not find a significant difference between sexes in either outcome. This finding may be partially owing to our outcomes being based on a
symptom questionnaire rather than diagnosis because girls
with a similar level of ASD symptoms as boys are less likely to
receive a diagnosis, and the higher language ability of girls may
partially mask the diagnosis.[41,42]

#### Limitations
The present study has several limitations. First, analyses were
limited by the available data from the NCS. Although ASDlike symptoms as reported primarily by caregivers on the
M-CHAT suggest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis, there are
significant false-positive results on initial screening that can
be differentially affected by factors such as race/ethnicity and
parental educational attainment.[38] In addition, the cohort had
a self-selection bias determined by parent interest in completing the M-CHAT. Future prospective research on experiential
risk factors would benefit from use of an actual ASD diagnosis. Second, the assessments of screen exposure and caregiverchild interactions were based on single items that do not fully
capture the quantity, type, and quality of screen exposure or
parent-child interaction. Assessment of screen exposure at an
even earlier age that includes exposure time to all types of
screens and the content and context of viewing could provide a more accurate estimate of the association between
screen exposure and ASD. Optimally, the reading and play data
would also include more comprehensive assessments across
multiple ages. The current experiential factors data were based
on caregiver self-report. Use of a daily diary or recording de

vice to detect daily activity regarding caregiver-child joint activities and screen exposure may provide more accurate data.
Third, the finding that some exposure factors were associated with ASD-like symptoms but not ASD risk raises the concern that the significant difference in ASD-like symptoms driving this association could potentially be at the lower level of
symptoms, possibly representing a variance in ASD-like symptoms in the typical population. Last, based on our reported
E-values, a relatively small amount of confounding by variables not included in our regression models could affect the
findings.

### Conclusions

This study is unique in prospectively finding that child screen
viewing at 12 months of age was associated with greater ASDlike symptoms, whereas more parent play with the child at 12
months of age was associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms. Although modest in our findings, this outcome is an important area of research because these factors are potentially
modifiable through parental education. We suggest that pediatricians thoroughly educate parents regarding the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations to avoid screen
viewing in children younger than 18 months.[43] We also found
prematurity, minority race/ethnicity, and lower family incometobeassociatedwithgreaterASDriskandASD-likesymptoms on the M-CHAT, adding to the literature regarding perinatal and demographic risk factors. We suggest the need for
future studies that assess experiential factors early in life and
later autism diagnosis to further assess the possible role of
modifiable risk and protective factors among children at risk
for ASD. Earlier assessment of modifiable experiential factors, such as screen viewing, playing with a child, and other
indicatorsofsocialinteraction,aswellasconsiderationofgenefactor interactions and the use of brain imaging studies, would
further assess the extent to which such factors could present
an increased risk or protective role in ASD.
