**Abstract**
Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents playing twice as much as their Typically Developing peers. The aims of this study are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming
Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient can predict time
spent playing video games. 57 participants were recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The
preliminary results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further investigation revealed interactions between autistic traits and several motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and
customisation. This has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.

**Keywords Autism · Video Games · Motivations · Escapism · Autistic Traits**


Video games are a common pastime for autistic people, and
especially for autistic adolescents (Cho et al., 2017). Investigations into video game usage find that up to 97% of autistic adolescents play video games (Durkin, 2010) compared
to 85% of Typically Developing (TD) adolescents (Turner
et al., 2012). These autistic adolescents have been shown
to play significantly more each day than their TD counterparts (2.4 h vs 1.2 h, Kuo et al., 2014). As well as taking
up a greater proportion of their free time (Engelhardt et al.,
2017), autistic adults highlight that they struggle to disengage from video games to complete essential tasks (Mazurek
& Engelhardt, 2013; Sundberg, 2018).
As a result of the strong interest in video games of many
autistic individuals, researchers have attempted to study the
impact of video games from a variety of perspectives. A
prominent framework for examining the motivations of players is from Ryan et al. (2006) who applied self-determination
theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2017) to video games. According to this framework, the intrinsic motivation to play video
games originates from the need to satisfy three basic psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

et al., (2015) found themes consistent with the SDT model
of motivation, particularly across the competence domain.
There has been limited quantitative work into the motivations of autistic gamers. Sundberg (2018) found that autistic
gamers reported a higher desire for escapism, using video
games as a means of escaping the real world, but were similar to TD gamers on all other sub-scales. Escapism has been
linked to problematic gaming behaviour in both autistics and
neurotypicals (Engelhardt et al., 2017), as well as generalised and social anxiety (Pang et al., 2017). That is not to say
that the impact of video games is necessarily negative, with
research from both TD and autistic populations showing that
a healthy engagement can be fulfilling (Mazurek et al., 2015;
Przybylski & Weinstein, 2017).
Autism is characterised by a complex constellation
of features, which is best modelled as a hybridisation of
dimensional and categorical traits (Elton et al., 2016).
Various behavioural outcomes throughout the TD population have been found to vary with autistic traits, including
social anxiety (Kleberg et al., 2017). Given that people with
higher autistic traits are more prone to compulsive internet
use (Finkenauer et al., 2012), it would be expected that a
similar relationship would be found for video games.
The central questions of this paper are how the relationships between autistic traits and motivations for playing games influence playtime. The first prediction is that
scales examining motivations for playing video games and

autistic traits will be significantly predictive of total time
playing video games. Secondly, it is expected that there will
be interactions between autistic traits and the measures of
motivation.

### Methods

#### Measures

Participants reported how much time they spent playing
video games in an average week. They were then asked to
estimate what proportion of their time they spent playing
alone, with strangers online, with friends they made online,
and friends that they knew from real life.
The Gaming Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences
Scales (GAMES; Hilgard et al., 2013) was developed as
an instrument to study the risks of problematic gaming
inspired by the work of Ryan et al., (2006). Participants use
a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree)
to 5 (Strongly Agree). The scale contains 59 items that are
split into nine subscales. These are story, violence catharsis,
violent reward, social interaction, escapism, loss-aversion,
customisation, completionism, and autonomy. This scale
has been found to have high predictive validity and internal
consistency (Hilgard et al., 2013).
The AQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) measures the level of
autistic traits expressed by an individual. The scale contains
50 items with 10 items for each of the five subscales: social
skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination. Each item uses a 4-point agreement
scale: definitely disagree, slightly disagree, slightly agree,
definitely agree. For this analysis, the items were treated as
a 4-point Likert scale.

#### Participants

A power analysis was conducted using the pwr R package
before data collection for a multiple linear regression with
ten predictors, a significance threshold of 0.05, a target
power of 0.8, and an ­R[2] of 0.328 from Hilgard et al., (2013)
which suggested a minimum of 42 participants. Data were
then collected from 62 participants during January and February of 2019. The participants were recruited using Facebook, Reddit, and two autism emailing lists. There were no
incentives offered for participation in the study. Participants
were excluded if they were under the age of 16 or had a
response rate of under 90% on any of the questionnaire sections. After the exclusion criteria had been applied, the sample consisted of 57 participants. Demographic information
for these participants can be found in Table 1. 17 participants indicated that they had received a formal diagnosis
of an autism spectrum disorder. Proof of diagnosis was not

required from the participants. Specific data on socioeconomic status and ethnicity were not recorded. Informed consent was obtained before data collection. Ethical approval
was granted by the University of Glasgow College of Science and Engineering Ethics Committee and the study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Results

All variables representing time spent playing games were
found to be significantly non-normally distributed using Shapiro–Wilk tests. This included total time played (W = 0.78,
p < 0.001), time played alone (W = 0.85, p < 0.001), and
time played socially (W = 0.58, p < 0.001). As such, it was
decided to transform the data using a Tukey ladder of powers
with a lambda of 0.45 (Tukey, 1957). After this transformation, the data were deemed approximately normal. The
Cronbach’s alpha was found to be 0.94 for the AQ and 0.92
for the overall GAMES questionnaire. Alphas for GAMES
subscales can be seen in Table 2.
The first hypothesis of this study was that scores on
the AQ and GAMES subscales would be predictive of the
average total time playing video games. This prediction
was tested using a multiple linear regression, the results of
which can be found in Table 3 (adjusted ­R[2] = 0.384, F(10,
36) = 3.86, p = 0.001). The significant predictors of total
time playing video games were the desires for socialising
and escapism. Autistic traits did not significantly predict
time spent playing games when controlling for motivational
variables.
The second hypothesis was that interactions between AQ
and GAMES scores would be significant. Analysis of the
data revealed that AQ score was correlated with several of
the GAMES measures, as can be seen in Table 4. A backwards stepwise algorithm was used to select the best model
from an initial set of candidate predictors including the AQ,
GAMES subscales, and interaction terms between the AQ
and each of the GAMES subscales. The final model from
this analysis is summarised in Table 5 (adjusted ­R[2] = 0.460,
F(15, 31) = 3.615, p = 0.001). Interactions between AQ and
escapism, customisation, and completionism were found to
significantly contribute to this model.

### Discussion

The overall aim of this report was to investigate how motivations to play video games and autistic traits interact to
predict time spent gaming. The first hypothesis of this study
was that the AQ and GAMES subscales would be predictive of the average time participants spent playing video
games each day. The preliminary results of the multiple

linear regression model found that the social and escapism
motivations were the only significant predictors of daily time
spent playing, though the overall model accounted for 51.8%
of the total variance. In our study, autistic traits were not
found to be predictive of time spent playing games and if
anything trended towards predicting less play. This finding
contrasts with the prior body of research finding that autistic
people play video games more than TD individuals (Kuo
et al., 2014).
The second hypothesis investigated the role of autistic
traits further, predicting that interactions between the AQ
and GAMES subscales would be significant predictors of

video gameplay. The final model found three significant
interactions between AQ and motivation, specifically
escapism, customisation, and completionism. Levels of
autistic traits themselves did not predict total time played.
These results suggest that the relationship between autistic traits and playing games is more complex than a simple linear predictor. The most notable motive is escapism, which was found to be a significant predictor of time

playing games. Escapism has a significant interaction
with autistic traits and was moderately correlated with
AQ scores. This finding complements existing literature
reporting that an increased desire for escapism increases
the risk of problematic gaming (Hilgard et al., 2013) and
that escapism desire is raised in autistic groups (Sundberg,
2018).
These findings have interesting consequences for the
study of intolerance of uncertainty within autism (Lidstone
et al., 2014), a model connecting sensory sensitivities, intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, and Restricted, Repetitive
Behaviours (RRBs). There is a wide body of research connecting escapism with various measures of anxiety, mental
health outcomes, and well-being (Pang et al., 2017). Given
the prominence of video games as an RRB (Cho et al.,
2017), all of the major concepts within the intolerance of
uncertainty model are integrated within video gaming and
its supporting academic literature.
This study is subject to several limitations. Feedback
from autistic participants highlighted how they felt that their
motivations for playing video games were not comprehensively covered by the GAMES questionnaire. Further, as the
scales had been developed on a neurotypical population, several autism-specific characteristics were not included. Future
research into this area should engage with the autistic community to develop more specific measures, in line with the
guidelines developed by Fletcher-Watson et al. (2019).
The results of this exploratory study offer insights into
the motivations of autistic gamers. This pilot study is the
first to take a detailed look at the full battery of motivations
and how these are expressed in specific gaming behaviours.
Firstly, the success of the regression models for predicting

time spent playing video games would suggest that motivational theory can be successfully applied to autistic players. Secondly, rather than autistic traits being independent
of these motivational desires, they instead influence their
strength and expression.
