### Abstract

Social media holds promise as a technology to facilitate social engagement, but may displace
social activities. Adolescents with ASD are well suited capitalize on the unique features of social
media, requires less decoding of complex social information. this cross-sectional study, we
assessed social media anxiety and friendship quality in 44 adolescents with and 56 clinical
comparison controls. Social media use significantly associated with high friendship quality in
adolescents with ASD, which was moderated by the adolescents’ anxiety levels. No associations
were founds between social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in the controls. Social media
may be a way for adolescents with without significant anxiety to improve the quality of
friendships.

### Introduction

Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience difficulties with social
interaction and have friends than their peers without ASD (Rowley et al.2012) Improving the
capacity for social engagement in youths is a critical intervention target (Laugeson and
Ellingsen 2014). The internet and online social media may ways for adolescents with ASD
to significantly expand their opportunities for social engagement, through platforms that
may be better suited to these youths’ unique communicative style—with more structured
rules of engagement, and less reliance on non-verbal information such as interpreting facial

expressions (Burke et al. 2010). However, concerns have been raised about such platforms,
including the potential for cyberbullying (Kowalski and Limber 2007; Smith et al. 2008),
risk of exposure to inappropriate content, and that they offer less meaningful interaction than
face to face engagement (Cummings et al. 2002).

Adolescence is an important developmental period during which to understand the impact of
social media use given its importance in this age group, as well as the significant social
vulnerabilities that characterize this period, particularly for adolescents with ASD (Orsmond
et al. 2004). Research in typically developing youth has examined the impact of the internet
and online social media use on a range of outcomes, including quality of peer relationships
(Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 2008; Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Findings suggest that for
some youth, internet use displaces other types of communication, which may in fact be more
qualitatively rich, leading to a net negative effect on friendship quality—this has been
described as the displacement hypothesis (Cummings et al. 2002). By contrast, other studies
have found the internet serves to supplement offline communication, increasing the overall
time spent in contact with others (Wellman et al. 2001), and facilitates bridging of online
engagement to new offline social experiences (Ellison et al. 2007). This has been described
as the increase hypothesis (Lee 2009).


It has been argued that both of these hypotheses may be applicable, but whether internet and
online social media use is associated with either displacement or increase of social
relationships varies depending on the nature of the platform being used, and aspects of the
user themselves (Caplan 2007; Sheeks and Birchmeier 2007; Valkenburg and Peter 2007,
2009). It has therefore been suggested that research is needed that focuses on which factors
(including features of the platform and user) may be associated with positive outcomes from
internet and social media use (Caplan 2007; Sheeks and Birchmeier 2007; Valkenburg and
Peter 2009). In our study, our focus was on the social media platform of Facebook. We
considered it to be likely that the increase hypothesis would apply in the case of Facebook
use by adolescents with ASD, because of the relatively structured nature of the interactions,
which also contain minimal, or are completely void of, complex information such as facial
expressions and non-verbal cues. For example, posting on the Facebook wall allows the user
to communicate a com plete message without having to assess how it is being perceived by
other individuals (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015). Similarly, chat functions on Facebook rely
almost exclusively on written content. In addition, adolescents with ASD have fewer offline
interactions than their peers, perhaps reducing the likelihood that Facebook usage will
displace richer, offline social interactions. Taken together, it is plausible that Facebook is a
platform which may be well suited to facilitating social engagement in adolescents with
ASD—thus consistent with the increase hypothesis.

Although authors have highlighted the importance of this research area as it applies to
individuals with ASD (Burke et al. 2010), there has been little systematic study. Some initial
work reported patterns of social media use amongst adolescents with ASD participating in
the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, and found significantly lower rates of social
media use compared with other disability groups (Mazurek et al. 2012). Beyond this initial
work, a single cross-sectional study examined the patterns and social-emotional correlates of
social media use in adults with ASD (Mazurek 2013). This study (N = 108, mean age = 32.4

years) found 79.6% of these participants used social media, and these adults were more
likely to have close friends and higher closeness of relationships than adults with autism
who did not use social media (Mazurek 2013). Mazurek et al. also measured the adults’
loneliness in the sample and found no significant associations with social media use. To our
knowledge, no studies have examined correlates of social media use in adolescents with
ASD.

There is also interest in understanding the role of anxiety on the correlates of adolescent
social media use (Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Anxiety is a prominent symptom in ASD,
and prior research shows that high levels of anxiety are correlated with problematic internet
use - a construct which includes behavior such as failing to meet offline obligations because
of online engagement (Caplan 2007). In a qualitative study of adolescents without ASD,
anxiety in the course of social media use was a prominent aspect of their online experience,
and this anxiety took many forms, including concerns about negative peer evaluation, and
missing out on opportunities for engagement when not online (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015).
Anxiety may be framed as a potential moderator of the increase hypothesis—specifically,
some have argued that more socially anxious youth will be less likely to derive benefit from
online social engagement than their more confident peers (Kraut et al. 2002). These findings
highlight the need for further work to advance understanding of the impact of anxiety on the
social media experience.


In this study, we identified patterns of social media use, friendship quality, and level of
anxiety in adolescents with ASD and in a comparison control clinical sample of adolescents
without ASD. We hypothesized (1) that social media use would be positively related to
friendship quality in ASD, consistent with the increase hypothesis. We considered the
increase hypothesis to be more likely than the displacement hypothesis given the ways in
which social networking platforms may capitalize on the communicative strengths of youth
with ASD. We further hypothesized (2) that this relationship would not be present for youth
without ASD, whom we predicted would show a pattern more consistent with the
displacement hypothesis. Finally, we hypothesized (3) that, in the ASD group, the
relationship between social media use and friendship quality would be moderated by anxiety
levels, such that this relationship would be reduced or absent in those with high anxiety.
Whereas prior research has focused on the correlates of time spent on social media, in our
study we also assessed the social media experience in greater detail. Given the absence of
available measures, we developed a set of questions that aim to capture this experience (see
below under “Social Media Experience Scale”).

A more complete understanding of the social correlates of social media use in individuals
with ASD may facilitate advising individuals and families about the impacts of social media
use, how it can be best used for positive gains, what potential risks may social media use
may pose, and how these risks can be mitigated.

### Method

**Participants**


**Procedure**

**Measures**


Participants were 100 youth (ages 12–19 years; Mean age 15 years, SD = 1.9). Of the 100
participants, 44 youth were diagnosed with ASD and were recruited from programs at the
Yale Child Study Center. Recruitment involved approaching individuals currently
participating in studies or receiving clinical treatment at the Yale Child Study Center and
providing them information about the study and an offer to participate. All participants had
normal intellectual function, were currently enrolled in school, and lived with their parents/
guardians who also completed measures for the study. Cognitive ability was measured using
the Differential Ability Scale, 2nd Edition (DAS-II) (Elliot et al. 1990). All participants had
a DAS-II General Conceptual Ability score greater than 70. ASD diagnosis in each case had
been established using the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (Lord et al. 2012) or
Autism Diagnostic Interview—Revised (Lord et al. 1994) and multidisciplinary clinical
evaluation. The remaining 56 participants were youth without ASD recruited from clinical
settings at the Yale Child Study Center (See Table 1 for further demographic information).
These youth had diverse psychiatric symptoms, but were established to not have symptoms
of ASD through psychiatric interview. Anxiety symptoms in the control sample were
assessed dimensionally in the study and our aim was to recruit individuals with a broad
range of anxiety symptom severity.

The study was approved by the university’s Human Subjects Committee. Prior to
participation, parents of the adolescents under the age of 18 provided signed informed
consent, and the adolescent provided informed assent. Participants over the age of 18
provided signed informed consent. Within a cross-sectional design, the study involved
administration of rating scales to the adolescents in both groups as well as their parents.
Data on time spent using social media also were obtained from the adolescent and
demographic information from the parent.


Data were collected at one time point using adolescent and parent completed rating scales,
with a subsample (n = 24) also providing data on their social media use 1 week later. All
participants completed the assessment in the presence of either the primary investigator or a
research assistant and received $25 compensation.

**The Friendship Questionnaire—Friendship quality was assessed using both parent and**
child versions of The Friendship Questionnaire (Bierman and McCauley 1987). Each
version includes a subscale for positive interactions and a subscale for negative interactions,
and consists of 36 items. The positive interactions subscale (FQ+) was used in the analysis
for the current study and includes items like “Is there someone you sit with at lunch? How
often?”, with participants asked to rate how often this occurs on a Likert scale from 1 (never)
to 5 (always).

**Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 2nd edition—Levels of anxiety**
symptoms were measures using the 50 item parent and child version of the
Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 2nd ed. (March et al. 1997), a measure also
previously employed in studies of individuals with ASD (Wood et al. 2009). This scale
includes items like “My child feels tense or uptight” on the parent version, and “I worry
about other people laughing at me” on the child version; in each case, participants are asked
to rate how often the statement is true on a Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (often).

**Social Media Experience Scale—Social media experience was assessed using a**
measure we developed for this study, the Social Media Experience Scale (SMES). This 11item scale was designed to have two subscales, one which assessed anxiety in the course of
social media anxiety (SMES-Anxiety) and a second which asses social media utility (SMESUtility). Items were derived from a prior qualitative study of the social media experience in a
clinical population (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015). The items are listed in Table 2. The SMESUtility subscale was chosen to measure active engagement on social media, rather than
measurement of time spent which could also represent passive observation of social media
platforms.


**Data Analysis**

A preliminary analysis of the primary hypothesis was addressed by assessing for outliers,
normality, and missing data, and computing means, standard deviations and correlation
coefficients. To examine the moderating role of youth anxiety on the relation between social
media use and friendship quality, a multiple regression analysis using product terms was
conducted (Jaccard and Turrisi 2003). The first analysis used the parent report of the FQ+ to
assess friendship quality, parent rated MASC-2 (total score) to assess youth anxiety, and
youth rated social media using the SMES-Utility subscale. A second set of analysis was
repeated using child measures of friendship quality and anxiety and total time spent using
social media. Of interest was whether the relation between social media use and friendship
quality differed as a function of youth anxiety. All predictors were mean centered for ease of
interpretation of regression coefficients (Jaccard et al. 2006). A product term was calculated
by multiplying youth anxiety by social media use, and the three predictors (youth anxiety,
social media use, anxiety by social media use) were entered into the regression equation
simultaneously. Both the ASD and non-ASD sample were initially mean centered, then
recentered with the mean anxiety at one standard deviation above and one standard deviation
below the initial mean. This allowed us to generate scatter plots to compare the slope of the
curve for the relation between social media use and friendship quality when anxiety was
high, low and moderate.


### Results

**Preliminary Analysis**


Model-based analyses revealed one outlier. The outlier proved to be inconsequential for the
analysis (i.e., all major conclusions remained intact when it was omitted from the analysis).
Therefore, results are reported including the outlier. All the variables in the model were
checked for non-normality, examining the univariate indices of skewness and kurtosis for

absolute values greater than 2.0. All variables in the model were normally distributed.
Missing data were minimal, being less than 5% for any given variable of interest. Table 2
depicts the means and standard deviations of the study variables for the ASD and non-ASD
groups. There were significant differences in sex and IEP status between the two samples;
these were included in analysis to assess for possible confounding, but were found to be
non-significant and thus excluded from the final analysis.


**Descriptive Statistics**

Characteristics for both samples are described in Table 3. Participants in the ASD sample
were significantly less likely to use Facebook. Anxiety scores according to both parent and
child ratings were significantly higher in the non-ASD sample (which included youth
recruited from an anxiety program) than the ASD sample. Scores for friendship quality
according to both parent and child ratings were higher in the non-ASD sample than the ASD
sample.


**Analysis of Social Media Experience Scale**

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA), revealed two factors with eigenvalue greater than 1.
This was confirmed visually by scree plot. A two-factor solution was identified using a
rotated component matrix, with one factor containing items related to social media anxiety
and accounting for 43.8% of the variance, and a second factor containing items related to
social media utility accounting for 12.2% of the variance. These factors were consistent with
our initial hypothesis of the scale, with the exception of the item “I worry about my replies
to people” which was more highly correlated with items in the utility factor. This item was
excluded in subsequent analysis. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was
0.849, above the recommended threshold of 0.6, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was
significant at < 0.01. Total score for the SMES-Anxiety factor was highly correlated with
total score on the MASC-2 child in both the ASD (r = .45, p <.01) and non-ASD sample (r =
44, p < 01). There was a high correlation between the total scores at the initial and
subsequent assessment (r = 83; p < 01), as well as for the social media utility (r = . 78, p = .
00) and social media anxiety (r = .71, p < .01) factors.


**Correlation Between Social Media Use and Friendship Quality**

Correlation matrices were generated for key variables in both the ASD (Table 4) and nonASD samples (Table 5). In the ASD sample, parent ratings of their child’s friendship quality
was correlated with both their child’s social media utility (r = .35, p < .01) and time spent on
social media (r = .36, p < .05). Adolescent ratings of friendship quality was significantly
correlated with social media utility only (r = . 36, p < .05). These findings were consistent
with our primary hypothesis. There were no significant correlations between social media
utility and time spent on social media with either parent or child measures of friendship
quality in the non-ASD sample.


**Regression Analysis**

An initial analysis produced a model explaining 24% of the variance on friendship quality (F
= 3.7, df = 3, p < .05) in the ASD sample. Table 6 presents the relevant regression

coefficients and associated statistics. The interaction term (social media utility x anxiety)
was statistically significant (β = −0.35, p < .05), suggesting that the relation between social
media use and friendship quality was moderated by anxiety. To gain insight into the nature
of the interaction, we conducted the regression analysis again when the moderator variable
was one standard deviation below the mean and again when one standard deviation above
the mean. For adolescents with average anxiety scores, the relation between social media
utility and friendship quality was not statistically significant (β = 0.24, p = .13); when
adolescent anxiety was one SD below the mean, the relation between social media use and
friendship quality was statistically significant (β = 0.61, p < .05), and when adolescent
anxiety was one SD above the mean, the relation between social media utility and friendship
quality was not statistically significant (β = −0.13, p = .61). Thus, the relation between
friendship quality and social media utility was more prominent and achieved statistical
significance only in those adolescents with lower anxiety scores (See Fig. 1). Analysis using
adolescents self-ratings of anxiety and friendship quality yielded similar findings with a
standardized coefficient of 0.32 for social media utility (t = 2.12, p = < 0.05), although the
interaction term was non-significant in this case indicating there was not sufficient evidence
for the moderating role of adolescent anxiety in this relation.

In the non-ASD sample, regression analysis yielded an overall model that was insignificant
and there was no evidence for a relationship between social media use and friendship
quality.


### Discussion

The results of our study suggest that social media use is associated with better friendship
quality in adolescents with ASD (hypothesis 1, and consistent with the increase hypothesis),
an association that is not seen in adolescents without ASD (hypothesis 2), and that this
association is moderated by anxiety (hypothesis 3). The findings in support of hypothesis 1
were demonstrated using both parent and child reports of friendship quality and including
two distinct measures of social media use—total time spent on social media and the total
score on the SMES-Utility subscale. Findings as to the moderating role of anxiety were only
robustly demonstrated using parent measures of anxiety and friendship quality and when
assessing social media use with the broader SMES-Utility subscale. These discrepancies are
unsurprising; prior work has indicated poor correlation between parent and child report on
the MASC (Baldwin and Dadds 2007), with parent report showing greater stability over 12
months, and youth with ASD in particular may be hypothesized to have distinct perceptions
of their anxiety and peer relationships. Although both measures of social media use (time
spent and social media utility) were correlated with better friendship quality in youth with
ASD, it is unclear why only the relationship between social media utility and friendship
quality was significantly moderated by anxiety. One hypothesis is that the measure of social
media utility in our study assessed both passive and active forms of engagement on social
media— a style of utilization that may be particularly rewarding, but may also expose users
to greater risk for negative evaluation by peers. Prior work has highlighted the prevalence
and utility of online ‘lurking’ amongst youth with ASD - a phenomenon of largely passive
engagement on social media (Nottingham and User 2008), which may not cause the same
type of anxieties which occur in the context of more active forms of engagement.

Our study found no evidence for the increase hypothesis (the relation between social media
use and friendship quality) in the non-ASD sample. This is consistent with our initial
hypothesis that adolescents with ASD may be a unique subgroup with regards to their
capacity to benefit from social media and follow the predictions of the increase hypothesis.
In the context of existing theory, our findings suggest that adolescents with ASD may be
relatively insulated from the ‘displacement’ hypothesis (Cummings et al. 2002). Friendship
quality in our study was significantly lower for the ASD group than the non-ASD group, and
prior literature has highlighted increased loneliness and poorer friendship quality in
adolescents with ASD (Bauminger and Kasari 2000).

Our study provides a further perspective on a prominent theoretical debate regarding the
validity of two further hypotheses—the ‘social compensation’ versus ‘rich-get-richer’
hypotheses (Valkenburg and Peter 2009). The former argues that socially anxious individuals
may benefit most from online communication owing to it being in some ways a less stressful
platform; the latter hypothesis suggests that socially competent individuals may gain the
most by being able to further capitalize on their already well developed offline social
networks. In our study, anxiety undermined the utility of social media to be helpful to the
ASD group, and yet the unique vulnerabilities of this group allowed them to benefit from the
platform. Adolescents with ASD therefore appear to be able to ‘socially compensate’
through online interaction, but they are compensating for a unique communicative style
rather than for being socially anxious.


It is critical that a technology as pervasive as social media be subject to extensive empirical
research. The Social Media Experience Scale which we introduce in this paper may be a
valuable tool in assessing two key dimensions of social media use—namely, the anxiety
which adolescents may experience in the course of using or contemplating social media, and
the ways in which it may be considered useful.

We found the scale to have robust psychometric properties, to be acceptable and feasible for
use in both an ASD and non-ASD adolescents, and to include a valid measure of social
media anxiety which is highly correlated with total scores on the MASC-2. Future research
may aim to confirm the proposed factor structure of this scale, and apply it to answering
additional key questions regarding social media use in adolescents.


Our study is limited by its cross-sectional nature, which allows us to show only an
association between social media use and friendship quality. Longitudinal, prospective or
experimental research could verify these findings. Further, despite our efforts at quantifying
social media use both in terms of time and experience, these platforms remain
heterogeneous, and it is unclear what aspect of social media use may be most related to
higher friendship quality.

In conclusion, whatever its overall impact on society, social media platforms have now
become pervasive and likely possess significant utility for many adolescents. The
prominence of the distinction between the ASD and non-ASD group in our study suggests
that an opportunity exists to broaden the opportunities for social engagement for adolescents
with ASD through effective use of with social media. Future work may seek to develop

interventions which help adolescents not only spend time on these platforms, but find ways
to be effectively and actively engaged. Further, clinicians working with youth who have
ASD should carefully for both baseline anxiety, and anxiety in the course of social media
use, given the demonstrated capacity for high anxiety to undermine the prosocial utility of
social media use [as demonstrated by our findings and in previous work (Caplan 2007)]. The
SMES is a promising instrument for assessing social media anxiety in clinical settings, and
identifying targets for possible intervention.
