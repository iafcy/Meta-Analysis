Abstract 
Background:  Screen media use in early childhood has largely increased in recent years, even more so during the 
COVID-19 epidemic, and there is much discussion regarding its influence on neurodevelopment, including Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Methods:  We examined the relationship between use of TV, computer, tablet and smartphone at age 2 years and risk 
of ASD assessed in telephone-based questionnaires among 12,950 children participating in the nationally representa‑
tive ELFE (‘Etude Longitudinale Française sur les Enfants’) birth cohort study in France.
Results:  In inverse-probability weighted (IPW) multinomial regression analyses, children’s weekly or daily screen 
media use was associated with an increased likelihood of an intermediate risk of ASD (IPW-controlled OR for weekly 
use:1.07, 95% CI 1.02—1.12; IPW-controlled OR for daily use:1.05, 95% CI 1.02—1.08) but inversely associated with 
a high risk (IPW-controlled OR for weekly use: 0.60, 95% CI 0.50—0.73; IPW-controlled OR for daily use: 0.75, 95% CI 
0.62—0.91), as ascertained by the M-CHAT. This was confirmed when studying TV as well as computer/tablet expo‑
sure separately.
Conclusions:  Overall, our nationally-representative study conducted among a large sample of 2-year-old children, 
indicates a complex relationship between screen exposure and ASD risk.

Background
While children’s use of screen-based media is ubiq-
uitous across high-income countries, and seems to 
have increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 
pandemic [1], growing evidence suggests that expo-
sure in infancy and early childhood is associated with 
unfavourable developmental outcomes over the short 
and mid-term [2–5]. In particular, there has been 
suggestion that high levels of screen-based media 
viewing are related to a higher level of risk of autism-
spectrum disorder (ASD) [2, 6].
Although genetics play an important role with regard 
to the risk of ASD and symptoms of neurodevelopmental 
delay, evidence suggests that certain environmental expo-
sures could also be involved [7]. Media screen exposure 
is a candidate, as children who early on in life spend a lot 
of time watching screens – particularly if their content is 
poor and/or if they are unsupervised—are less likely to 
play, be physically active, and engage in interactions with 
other children and adults, all of which could be related 
to worse neurodevelopmental outcomes [3, 5]. However,

while it has been documented that children and adoles-
cents diagnosed with ASD are more exposed to screens 
[2], research examining whether early screen exposure 
precedes later ASD diagnosis has been limited. A recent 
study based on 2,100 US-based children participating in 
the nationally representative National Children’s Study 
(NCS), found no association between exposure to TV/
DVD watching at 12 and 18 months and a high risk of 
ASD at age 2 years, although the authors did report a lin-
ear association with the number of ASD symptoms [8]. 
To our knowledge, associations between the use of other 
forms of screen media, including computers/tablets and 
smartphones and children’s risk of ASD, have not yet 
been evaluated.
Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between use 
of TV, computer/tablet and smartphone in relation to 
neurodevelopmental difficulties and particularly ASD 
risk in early childhood, in a general population setting.
Methods
Data for this study come from the ELFE (“Étude Longi-
tudinale Française depuis l’Enfance”) study, a nation-
ally representative birth cohort of 18,329 children born 
in France in 2011 in 320 maternity wards selected using 
random sampling methods, with the aims of studying 
children’s developmental and health trajectories through 
adulthood [9]. Inclusion criteria were: singleton or twin 
birth at ≥ 33  weeks of gestation, mother of ≥ 18  years 
of age and not planning to move outside of Metropoli-
tan France in the three years following study inclusion. 
Mothers had to be able to give consent either in French, 
English, Arabic or Turkish. Briefly, participating moth-
ers were invited to take part in the study and completed 
a research questionnaire after delivery during their 
maternity stay, then mothers and fathers were contacted 
again for a telephone interview when the child was aged 
2 months, 1 year and 2 years.
In the 2-year ELFE study telephone interview, parents 
reported on their child’s TV watching, use of a computer/
tablet and smartphone. If the child watched television or 
used a computer/tablet, parents were additionally asked 
the number of hours during weekdays and weekends, 
based on which we estimated average exposure. Fre-
quency of use of television and computers/tablets being 
very distinct, we estimated the level of exposure in hours 
per day and per week, respectively.
Risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties at 2 years was 
assessed using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Tod-
dlers (M-CHAT), a validated 23-item screening instru-
ment [10, 11]. We used the recommended cut-offs to 
define risk of ASD: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), and 
high (7–23) risk.
Because children who use screens and those who do 
not are likely to different with regard to many different 
characteristics, covariates were controlled for using pro-
pensity scores, which were calculated based on the vari-
ables listed below [12]:
1.	 Family socio-demographic characteristics reported 
by the mother after delivery: maternal age (< 30 
vs. ≥ 30 years – the average age at first childbirth for 
women), paternal age (< 30 vs. ≥ 30 years), maternal 
and paternal birth place (France vs. Other), mother’s 
educational level, number of children living in the 
household (1, 2–3, ≥ 4), maternal and paternal resi-
dential area (Greater Paris Region; Paris and suburbs, 
North-West, East, West, South-West, Centre-East, 
and South-East) and household income per capita 
assessed when the child was 2 years (divided into 3 
categories based on the minimum wage, average 
wage and above average wage in 2013, https://​www.​
insee.​fr/​fr/​stati​stiqu​es/​13751​88) 
(< 1,423; 
1,423–
1,996; > 1,996 euros/month).
2.	 Maternal mental health reported by the mother 
when the child was 2 months old (Edinburgh Postna-
tal Depression Scale (EPDS) – a score of ≥ 12 being 
considered as indicative of possible depression, yes 
vs. no [13]).
3.	 Pregnancy and child characteristics collected from 
the child’s medical records: child sex (male vs. 
female), age at the time of assessment (< = 24, 25, 
26, or > 26 months), season of birth (winter; spring; 
summer; autumn), prematurity (< 36 vs ≥ 37 weeks of 
gestation), if the child was a twin (yes vs. no), weight 
for gestational age (based on a z-score and catego-
rized as small (< ­10th percentile), average (10-90the 
percentile), or large (> 90 percentile)), and Apgar 
score at 5 min (alarming/fair vs. good).
4.	 Postnatal characteristics reported by the mother 
at age 2  years: childcare arrangements (parents or 
family member, centre-based childcare, nanny or 
childcare professional) and the number of early 
stimulation and development activities (ex. painting/
drawing, storytelling, singing, reading, doing puzzles) 
the child completed with his/her parents in the pre-
ceding month (≤ 4, 5–6, 7–9, >  = 9 activities).
Statistical analyses
Using survey-weighted data, which takes into account 
the initial sampling plan and baseline participation as 
well as longitudinal attrition rates to produce nation-
ally representative estimates for children born in 2011

we assessed associations between screen media use and 
children’s neurodevelopmental risk (high, intermedi-
ate vs. low as reference) at age 2 years. Missing covari-
ate data (maximum 3.1%) were imputed 10 times using 
fully conditional specification (MI-FCS). To balance dif-
ferences between screen exposure groups, propensity 
score weights were estimated with a generalized boost-
ing model (GBM) using Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) 
means. Then, multinomial logistic regression models 
weighted on the product of Inverse Probability Weights 
(IPW) and survey weights, yielded Odds Ratios (ORs) 
with the associated 95% Confidence interval (95% CI) 
and a P < 0.05 examining statistical significance [14]. 
Missing covariate data (maximum 3.1%) were imputed 
10 times with fully conditional specification (MI-FCS). 
All data were analysed using R 4.0.3 and SAS V9.4.
Results
A total of 12,950 children were included in the pre-
sent analysis (Table 1), with 12,012 children with avail-
able information on weekly TV, computer or tablet 
use, and respectively 11,609 and 12,498 children with 
available information on the frequency of TV and com-
puter/tablet use. Respectively 29.9 and 1.1% of chil-
dren were classified as having an intermediate and high 
risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties. 66.4% of chil-
dren used screen media daily, mostly TV (63.3%, 9.8% 
being exposed > 2  h/day); 30.5% used a computer/tab-
let weekly and 26.7% used a smartphone. As shown in 
Table 1, all studied covariates were associated with chil-
dren’s screen media use.
In IPW-controlled analyses (Table  2), compared to 
never or seldom-users, children who used screen media 
weekly or daily had an increased likelihood of being at 
intermediate risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties 
(ORs between 1.05–1.07), but a decreased likelihood 
of being at high risk (ORs between 0.60–0.75). Com-
pared to children who never watched TV daily, had 
an increased likelihood of intermediate level risk (OR 
associated with > 2 h per day 1.11, 95% CI 1.06–1.17), 
but a decreased likelihood of a high risk of neurode-
velopmental difficulties (ORs associated with 30  mn 
to > 2 h between 0.33–0.60). Compared to never or sel-
dom-users, children who used a computer/tablet ≤ 1 h/
day had a decreased likelihood of being at intermedi-
ate risk or high risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties 
(ORs: 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.96 and 0.24, 95% CI 0.22–
0.26, respectively); children who used a Tables 1 and 2 
hours per week also had a low likelihood of being at 
high risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties (OR 0.83, 
95% CI 0.70–0.98).
Discussion
In a nationally-representative study of 2-year old chil-
dren, a majority were exposed to screen media daily. In 
IPW-controlled analyses, screen media use, mainly TV, 
was associated with an increased likelihood of interme-
diate level risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties, but 
a reduced likelihood of a high risk. Our study adds to 
a growing literature showing elevated levels of screen-
based media use among young children and possible 
associations with development. However, several stud-
ies showed elevated levels of screen use among children 
at risk of autism spectrum disorder [6, 8] and our data 
temper the results of prior investigations. Our data 
suggest a complex relationship between screen-based 
activities and risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties, 
including autism risk.
We need to acknowledge several limitations. First, 
ELFE is based on parents’ voluntary participation and 
may have left out children vulnerable to neurodevel-
opmental difficulties [9]. Nevertheless, the sample is 
heterogeneous-enough to study environmental risk 
factors of neurodevelopment [12, 15] and our data 
were weighted to be nationally representative. Second, 
ELFE is a longitudinal cohort study, but the data we 
used are cross-sectional and we cannot rule out that 
children’s neurodevelopmental difficulties could influ-
ence their screen use. This may in part explain lower 
levels of exposure among children at high risk of neu-
rodevelopmental difficulties. To address this issue, our 
statistical analyses controlled for a range of covariates 
which precede and predict children’s screen use as 
well as ASD symptoms, which is a way of taking into 
account common sources of variation. Future stud-
ies with prospective designs are warranted to assess 
the role of early screen use on children’s risk of neu-
rodevelopmental difficulties, particularly those that 
are within the range of ASD. Third, we used a single 
M-CHAT measure, which is probably less specific than 
repeated assessments and it is unlikely that all children 
identified as having an intermediate or high risk will 
actually be diagnosed with ASD [10]. This results in 
the possibility of misclassification, particularly in the 
intermediate risk group, and calls for close monitor-
ing of children’s later neurodevelopmental outcomes 
[11]. Fourth, ELFE study participants were born in 
2011, and children’s levels of screen use have since 
increased, particularly during the COVID-19 pan-
demic [1]. This implies that prevalence levels of screen 
exposure at 2  years are probably currently be higher 
than we report. However, the associations we observe 
between children’s media screen use and risk of neu-
rodevelopmental difficulties are likely to be valid in 
current circumstance or may have increased.

Our study also has strengths which we would like to 
highlight. First, ours is one of few studies to examine the 
early risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties in a com-
munity-based nationally representative sample of young 
children. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first study 
in a general population setting to include a measure of 
computer/tablet and smartphone use in early childhood 
and study the relationship with neurodevelopment. 
One of the hypotheses explaining this association is the 
effect of electromagnetic field exposure on children’s 
brain development [6]. Third, we used propensity scores 
and inverse-probability weights to control for selection 
biases and for a large number of child and family char-
acteristics predating measures of screen media use that 
could confound the association of interest, ruling out a 
number of alternative explanations.
Overall, young children exposed to screen media may 
experience some neurodevelopmental delays, captured 
by the intermediate risk category on the M-CHAT. Our 
data suggest that TV use seems more strongly associ-
ated with children’s ASD risk than other types of screen 
media. This may reflect children’s greater passivity in 
front of a TV screen, which should be confirmed by 
other research, using quantitative as well as qualitative 
designs. This association may reflect reduced play time 
and physical activity, as well as more limited interactions 
with other children and adults [5]. Low levels of screen 
use among children at high risk of neurodevelopmental 
difficulties suggest limited interest or specific parental 
behaviours in some – rather highly educated – families 
which restrict children’s exposure [16]. There is sugges-
tion that early environmental exposures such as screen 
media exposure could increase the experience of symp-
toms evocative of ASD risk, however this should be fur-
ther investigated in studies which follow longitudinally 
large samples of children potentially at risk of ASD.

related to children’s neurodevelopmental difficulties, but 
these associations appear to be complex.
