Introduction
The prevalence of obesity among youth is a public health 
issue of global importance (Han et al. 2010). Lifestyle fac-
tors such as physical inactivity and excessive screen time 
usage have been identified as modifiable causal factors 
(Jimenez-Pavon et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2010). Regular 
engagement in physical activity (PA) has been demonstrated 
to help youth control their weight while decreasing the 
chances of developing additional health-related issues, such 
as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, anxiety, 
and depression (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion [CDC], 2014). Independent of physical activity par-
ticipation, sedentary behaviors (e.g., screen time) can have 
potentially deleterious health consequences and have been 
identified as a risk factor for several health-related issues 
including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Star-
koff et al. 2014). Recent research, utilizing a representa-
tive sample of youth aged 12–15 years in the United States 
(U.S.) suggests that about one quarter engaged in the rec-
ommended daily 60  min of moderate to vigorous physi-
cal activity (Fakhouri et al. 2014). Similarly, in Europe, 
research shows that only one-in-five children, aged 11–15, 
report that they undertake moderate-to-vigorous exercise 
regularly, according to results from the 2009–2010 HBSC 
survey (Curie et al. 2012). Ireland consistently stands out as 
a strong performer; with 31 % of girls and 43 % of boys at 
age 11 meeting the guidelines (Curie et al. 2012).
For all youth, physical activity and screen time habits are 
important elements to promote and maintain health, fitness, 
and well-being (Laurson et al. 2014). For children with 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), research has identified a 
number of additional benefits to being physically active, 
such as improvements in social skills, sleep quality, and 
feelings of enjoyment (Ayvazoglu et al. 2015; Wachob and 
Abstract  The primary purposes of this study were to 
compare (a) physical activity participation, screen-time 
habits, obesity, and (b) reported reasons for lack of partici-
pation in sport, between a nationally representative sample 
of Irish children with and without autism spectrum disor-
der (ASD). Participation in moderate to vigorous activity, 
light activity, and sports was significantly lower among the 
group with ASD. On examination of screen time variables, 
no significant differences were seen between groups. How-
ever, time spent watching TV was higher among children 
with ASD. Overweight or obese status was more prevalent 
among the group with ASD (34.4 vs. 24.7 %). The findings 
are discussed in relation to international statistics on youth 
physical activity, screen-time, and weight status, and rec-
ommendations are provided for future research.

children with ASD, based on gender, age of diagnosis, and 
comorbidities.
Method
Participants
Data were obtained from wave two of the nationally rep-
resentative data set; Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) which 
included a range of physical, behavioral, psychological, envi-
ronmental, and cognitive outcomes for 13 year olds living in 
Ireland. A systematic stratified sampling procedure was uti-
lized to recruit participants (n = 8570) from 910 schools (of 
the national total of 3200 Primary schools) across Ireland. 
Parents and children completed questionnaires on a range of 
outcomes related to the child’s characteristics, experiences, 
and development. In addition, the child’s teacher and school 
principal provided information relating to the child’s social, 
emotional, and cognitive development, as well as school 
characteristics. The data were collected between September 
2007 and June 2008, under ethical approval from the Health 
Research Boards’ Research Ethics Committee. Response 
rates were 82 and 57 % at the school and family levels, 
respectively. For more detailed information on the data set, 
including the conceptual framework and methodology, see 
Murray et al. (2011).
The present study included 141 children; 67 children 
with ASD, and a randomly extracted sample of 74 TD 
children for comparison. Adolescents were included in the 
‘ASD group’ if their primary caregiver reported that the 
child had ASD diagnosed by a medical professional. In Ire-
land, professionals who may provide a diagnosis include 
psychologists, psychiatrists and/or community paediatri-
cians, in conjunction with other disciplines such as speech 
and language therapist, clinical nurse specialist, and social 
workers (Health Service Executive 2012).
Measures
Physical Activity and Sport Participation
Multiple self-report measures of physical activity and sport 
participation were included in the analysis. First, the ado-
lescents’ physical activity was measured though self-report, 
using questions adapted from the Leisure Time Exercise 
Questionnaire (Godin and Shepard 1985). To assess partici-
pation in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 
the respondents answered the question “How many times, 
in the past 14 days, have you done at least 20 min of hard 
exercise to make you breathe fast and make your heart beat 
faster?”; examples of activities were provided including 
Lorenzi 2015). Unfortunately, however, research suggests 
that youth with ASD may be at especially high risk of not 
engaging in PA during leisure time (Tyler et al. 2014) and 
the school day compared to their TD peers (Memari et al. 
2013; Pan et al. 2015). Research findings point to several 
reasons for why youth with ASD refrain from PA, such as 
limitations in social-communication, lack of motor domain 
skills, and social exclusion from activities. (Srinivasan et al. 
2014) (Must et al. 2015).
Rather than engaging in physical activities, youth with 
ASD tend to spend more time engaging in screen time 
activities (e.g., watching television, playing video games) 
than their typically developing (TD) peers (Mazurek and 
Wenstrup 2013; Memari et al. 2013; Must et al. 2014; Sandt 
and Frey 2005). This may be partially attributed to parents, 
who use screen time activities to occupy youth with ASD 
during household chores (Sandt and Frey 2005). Because 
children with ASD tend to be less physically active and 
engage in more screen time activities than peers without 
disabilities, they are at greater risk for experiencing health-
related issues. As such, research suggests that youth with 
ASD may have higher rates of obesity and lower fitness 
levels than their TD peers (Curtin et al. 2010; Srinivasan 
et al. 2014; Tyler et al. 2014). According to Curtin et al. 
(2010), the prevalence of obesity in children with ASD in 
the U.S. is approximately 30.4 %, in comparison to 23.6 % 
among their TD peers. There is somewhat conflicting 
evidence regarding the obesity of youth with ASD in the 
United States, though, as more recent nationally represen-
tative data suggest ASD status is not independently related 
to obesity once secondary conditions (e.g., learning disabil-
ities) and medication use are taken into account (Corvey et 
al. 2016).
Currently, research examining physical activity partici-
pation, screen time habits, and obesity in youth with ASD 
is limited by geographic location and small samples (Cor-
vey et al. 2016). Although a few population-based studies 
have been conducted in North America pertaining to ASD 
(Corvey et al. 2016; Curtin et al. 2010) and other disabili-
ties (Kim et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2016), research of this 
magnitude is currently absent in a number of European 
countries, including Ireland. It is reasonable to suggest that 
barriers to physical activity participation are contextually 
influenced, and those experienced by youth with ASD in 
Ireland will likely vary from those experienced by children 
in other countries. Therefore, the primary purposes of this 
investigation were to compare (a) physical activity partici-
pation, screen-time habits, and obesity, and (b) reported rea-
sons for lack of participation in sport, between a nationally 
representative sample of Irish children with and without 
ASD. Furthermore, a secondary purpose was to examine 
physical activity, screen-time habits and obesity among the

Reasons for Lack of Team Sport Participation
In addition to exploring numerical values for duration of 
physical activity, the GUI also sought to explain reasons 
why participants did not participate Participants were asked 
the question,. “Outside of your physical education classes, 
how many team or individual sports or activities did you 
participate in during the past 12 months?,”If respondents 
selected “none”, they were prompted to select reasons as 
to why they “choose not to participation in sporting activi-
ties?.” Possible reasons that the respondent could choose 
from included: (1) I do not like team games; (2) I prefer to 
watch sports on TV; (3) I am no good at games; (4) I do not 
fit in with the sporty crowd; (5) I have no opportunities to 
play; (6) I do not like to get dirty or sweaty; (7) I feel people 
laugh at me because of my size; (8) I am not competitive; 
(9) I have a disability or health problem which prevents me 
from playing; (10) I prefer to play computer games; and 
finally, (11) respondents could select ‘other’ and to specify 
their reason.
Body Mass Index
Body mass index is the most widely used method for mea-
suring the degree of body fat in children and has shown to 
correlate strongly with measures of body fat derived from 
direct physiological assessment (Lindsay et al. 2001). To 
derive a body mass index score for each child, in each 
household the interviewer took the weight and height of 
each study child. A Leicester portable height measure was 
used to record height to the nearest millimeter. For weight, 
a Class IV, medically approved scales (SECA 761) were 
used to record the child’s weight to the nearest kilogram. 
Body mass index was then calculated by dividing weight 
in kilograms by height in meters squared. Body mass index 
cut-offs, standardized by age and sex, as provided by the 
International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) (Cole et al. 2000), 
were used to classify children as non-overweight, over-
weight, or obese.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics for participants’ demographic data 
were reported. Pearson correlations were conducted to 
examine the relationship between the physical activity, 
screen time variables, comorbidities, and age of diagnosis 
(before 6, 6–10, and 10+). Mann–Whitney tests and Fisher 
exact tests were used to compare continuous and cate-
gorical physical activity, screen time, and BMI variables 
between children with ASD and TD children. When ordi-
nal or continuous dependent variables were not normally 
distributed, Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to determine 
if there were significant differences between two or more 
playing soccer, jogging and fast cycling. To assess partici-
pation in light physical activity, the participants were asked 
“How many times in the past 14 days have you done at least 
20 min of light exercise that was not hard enough for you 
to breathe heavily and make your heart beat fast?” Exam-
ples provided included walking or slow cycling. For both 
questions participants were instructed to include time spent 
in physical education. Participants responded using a five-
point scale, ranging from 1 (none) to 5 (9 or more days). 
These measures were used in previous research (Cadogen et 
al. 2014), have demonstrated concurrent validity with mea-
sures of maximum oxygen intake (VO2 max) and muscular 
endurance (Godin et al. 1986), and acceptable test–retest 
reliability (Sallis et al. 1993).
A series of questions were also asked regarding the 
child’s participation in sport. The number of team or indi-
vidual sports in which the child participates was assessed 
with the question “Outside of your physical education 
classes, how many team or individual sports or activities 
did you participate in during the past 12 months?” Exam-
ples provided included a school or local soccer/netball 
team, athletics, or tennis club. Respondents choose from 
none, one, two, three, or four or more activities. Respon-
dents were also asked if they “play sports or undertake 
physical activities without a coach or instructors (e.g. bik-
ing, skate-boarding, etc.)?” and if they “play sports with 
a coach or instructor, or as part of an organized team, 
other than in Physical Education class (swimming, soc-
cer, hockey, etc.)?”. Answer options for both questions 
included: (1) never; (2) less than once a week; (3) 1–3 
times a week; or, (4) 4 or more times a week.
Screen Time Variables
Children answered three questions that measured screen 
time behavior of the sample with and without ASD. Ques-
tions included: (1) “on a normal weekday during term-time, 
about how many hours do you spend watching television, 
videos or DVDs? Please remember to include time before 
school as well as time after school?” (2) “On a normal week-
day, during term-time, about how much time do you spend 
using the computer? Please include time before school as 
well as time after school. Do not include time spent using 
computers in school”; and (3), “On a normal weekday, dur-
ing term-time, about how much time do you spend playing 
video games such as Playstation, X-box, Nintendo, etc.?” In 
response to these questions respondents selected one of 13 
categories, representing 30 min increments (e.g., 1–30 min). 
A total screen time scale variable was also created which 
combined the three screen time variables (television, com-
puter, and video games), thus resulting in a 39 point scale. A 
higher score on all variables reflects higher levels of screen 
time.

ASD are presented in Table  2, including the number of 
comorbidities experienced by the child, comorbidity type, 
medication use, and age of ASD diagnosis.
Physical Activity and Sport Participation
The most commonly reported number of days that children 
with ASD reported at least 20 min of MVPA over the past 14 
days was “1–2 days”, with 32.85 % (n = 22) of the sample 
selecting this response (Table 3). In contrast, only 10.8 % 
of TD children selected the “1–2 days” response, with the 
most commonly reported response for TD children (36.5 %) 
being “9 or more days” during the 2 week period. Com-
paring MVPA participation on 5 or fewer days versus 6 or 
more days per 2 week period, Fishers Exact test demon-
strated the children with ASD participated in significantly 
less MVPA (p < .001). Results showed that 70.1 % (n = 47) 
of the children with ASD participated in less than 5 days 
of MVPA compared to only 23.9 % (n = 16) of the TD chil-
dren. Regarding number of days with at least 20 min of par-
ticipation in light physical activity, there were no significant 
differences between the children with ASD and the TD chil-
dren (Table 3).
On the measure of participation in team or individual 
sports outside of physical education, the children with ASD 
reported to participate in a mean of 2.2 sports, in compari-
son to the mean of 3.07 sports participated in by the TD 
group (U = 1513, p < .001) (Table  3). More specifically, 
the group with ASD undertook significantly fewer activi-
ties that involved a coach or instructor per week (U = 1516, 
p < .001). Results showed that 24 children with ASD 
(37.5 %) reported never playing sports with a coach in com-
parison to 18 TD children (25 %). Conversely, 25 TD chil-
dren (34.7 %) reported to participate in sports with a coach 
four or more times a week, in comparison to only three chil-
dren with ASD (4.7 %). Regarding participation in sports 
or physical activity without a coach, no significant differ-
ences were revealed between TD children and children with 
ASD (U = 1980, p = .106). However, 18 TD children (25 %) 
participated in sports without a coach four or more times a 
week in comparison to 9 children with ASD (14.1 %). For 
children with ASD, Pearson correlations revealed a posi-
tive significant correlation between levels of MVPA and 
participation in team or individual sports outside of physi-
cal education (r = .471, n = 63, p < .001), participation in 
sports with a coach or instructor (r = .597, n = 63, p < .001), 
and participation in sports without a coach or instructor 
(r = .696, n = 63, p < .001).
Physical Activity and Gender
For TD children, males participated in more MVPA, with 
the majority (51.3 %, n = 20) participating in 9 or more days 
groups. Moreover, exploratory analyses were completed, 
with data stratified by gender, age of diagnosis, presence of 
comorbidities, and weight status (IOTF BMI categories). 
All analysis were conducted using SPSS 23, with an alpha 
level set at 0.05.
Results
A comparison of the TD children with the members of the 
full dataset, showed there to be no significant differences on 
physical activity, screen time behaviors, or BMI (p < .05). 
Descriptive characteristics of the children are provided in 
Table 1, presented as TD children and children with ASD. 
Chi square tests were used to compare groups on gender 
and mothers’ education level (college or not); Mann Whit-
ney was used for comparison of the continuous variable, 
equivalized-household income (weighted to account for dif-
ferences in size and composition of households in terms of 
the number of adults and children in the home). Fifty-three 
members of the group who had ASD (57.6 %) were male, in 
comparison to 39 males in the TD group (42.4 %) (p = .002).

levels of participation in MVPA, among the children with 
ASD, did not differ depending upon age of diagnosis, num-
ber of comorbidities, or comorbidity type (p > .05).
Screen Time
For time spent watching television, children with ASD 
reported spending, on average, between 121 and 150 min 
per day in comparison to TD children who spent a mean 
of 91–120  min a day. Time spent using the computer 
per day was less, with both groups reporting spending 
a mean of 61–90 min per day. Time spent playing video 
games was also similar for both groups, with a mean of 
31–60 min a day spent in this activity. Finally, although 
not quite statistically significant, comparing groups on 
the total screen time scale variable, children with ASD 
engaged in more screen time (m = 11.8) than TD children 
(m = 10.02),(U = 1901, p = .105). For the group with ASD, 
Pearson’s correlation showed total screen time score to 
be negatively correlated with both participation in light 
physical activity (r = −.33, n = 62, p = .009), and number 
of sports participated in outside of physical education 
(r =− .34, n = 62, p = .−026).
Screen Time, Comorbidities and Age of Diagnosis
No significant correlations existed between number of 
comorbidities and screen time variables, however, the age 
of diagnosis was correlated with time spent watching televi-
sion (r = −.26). Children diagnosed with ASD before the age 
of five (n = 18), or between 5 and 10 years (n = 27), spent, 
on average, 121–151 min watching television. Conversely, 
the children who were diagnosed after age 10 spent an aver-
age of 61–91 min watching television. Kruskal–Wallis Tests 
determined mean levels of total screen time, among the chil-
dren with ASD, did not significantly differ depending upon 
age of diagnosis, number of comorbidities, or comorbidity 
type (p > .05).
Reasons for Lack of Team Sport Participation
Twenty-three children with ASD and 11 TD children 
answered the question relating to reasons not to participate 
in sport. The most prevalent response provided by both 
groups for lack of participation in sports outside of physical 
education, was “I prefer to play computer games” includ-
ing 13 children with ASD (56.5 %) and four TD children 
(36.4 %). The reasons “I do not like team games” and "I 
am not competitive” were each chosen twice by children 
with ASD. The other reasons for lack of participation were 
each chosen once. Two children from each group provided 
reasons identified as ‘other’ which were not available for 
viewing in the data set available to the researchers.
that included at least 20 min of MVPA, than females. Only 
30 % (n = 7) of the females participated in this amount of 
MVPA. When comparing reported MVPA participation as 
being 5 or fewer days versus 6 or more days per 2 week 
period, significant difference between males and females 
was revealed (p = .001). Males also participated in signifi-
cantly more sports without a coach (M = 2.87 vs. M = 2.18, 
U = 422, p = .009), and with a coach (M = 3.08 vs. 2.5, 
U = 478.5, p = .46). No significant differences were revealed 
between males and females in the sample of children with 
ASD on MVPA, LPA, or sports participation variables.
Physical Activity, Comorbidities and Age of Diagnosis
Pearson correlation did not indicate the number of comor-
bidities or age of diagnosis to be significantly correlated 
with the physical activity variables of interest, for the chil-
dren with ASD. Kruskal–Wallis Tests determined mean

parent reports did reveal the children with ASD to partici-
pated in significantly fewer types of activities than the TD 
children. (6.9 vs. 9.9 per year, respectively). The tendency for 
youth with ASD to participate in fewer activities and sports 
is reflected in the 2003 National Survey of Children’s Health 
finding that children with ASD were less likely to participate 
in sports (41 vs. 27 %, p < .005) or extracurricular activities 
(45 vs. 34 %, p < .05) than children with other developmen-
tal disabilities. The finding in our study support this trend, 
whereby the children with ASD reported to engage in fewer 
sports outside of physical education compared to their TD 
counterparts (2.2 vs. 3.07). More specifically, the majority 
(n = 24, 35.7 %) of the group with ASD reported to never par-
ticipate in sports or physical activities involving a coach, in 
comparison the majority (n = 22, 29.7 %) of the TD children 
who participated one to three times per week. This may be 
due to the tendency for sport with a coach to typically be of 
a more competitive nature, which may make it less appeal-
ing to children with ASD whom have been reported to have 
movement impairments (Blanchard et al. 2006). In addition, 
in Ireland sports that involve a coach would most commonly 
be team sports such as football (soccer), and Gaelic games 
(Gaelic football and Hurling). The social nature of these 
sports may be demanding for a child with difficulties in the 
social domain, such as those with ASD.
Research on barriers to physical activity for children 
with ASD is sparse and predominantly focuses on parental 
report. Common barriers cited by parents include time and 
financial constraints, and lack of opportunities (Memari et 
al. 2015; Lee et al. 2008). Albeit infrequent, the perspective 
of children with ASD has been elicited also. Obrusnikova 
and Cavalier (2011), utilized Photovoice to enable 14 chil-
dren with ASD to recall barriers to physical activity. Among 
their responses, intrapersonal barriers and a preference for 
screen-based activities were the most commonly noted. 
These finding reflect the results of our study. The preference 
for screen-based activities as a barrier to physical activity 
participation was the most commonly reported barrier in our 
study as well (reported by 56.5 % of the sample). However, 
depending on the view that is elicited, research on barri-
ers to physical activity for children with disabilities differ. 
For example, a systematic review on the topic demonstrates 
children to commonly cite personal reasons, while parents 
tend to focus on familial, social, and policy factors (Shields 
et al. 2012). Future research may want to utilize a qualita-
tive approach in order to better understand the barriers chil-
dren with ASD face that prevent them from engaging in PA. 
This may provide in depth information for researchers then 
to develop more effective strategies for families and schools 
that may help children with ASD to become more active.
In regards to screen time, this study revealed no signifi-
cant difference between the children with ASD and the TD

Height and weight measures were missing for three children 
with ASD, and one TD child. The mean BMI for the chil-
dren with ASD was 21.21, in comparison to 20.42 for the 
TD children. Distributions were not significantly different 
(U = 2122, p = .438). On comparing groups by weight sta-
tus, overweight/obese status was more prevalent among the 
group with ASD, with 22 children being overweight/obese 
(34.9 %), in comparison to 18 children (24.7 %) in the TD 
group. A Chi Square test demonstrated this difference to 
not be significant (p = .190). See Table 4 for an overview of 
weight status among children with ASD and TD children. 
Kruskal–Wallis Tests determined mean BMI among the chil-
dren with ASD did not differ depending upon age of diagno-
sis, number of comorbidities, or comorbidity type (p > .05).
Discussion
A primary purpose of this article was to compare PA partici-
pation between a nationally representative sample of Irish 
children with ASD and TD peers. In this study, over 70 % of 
the children with ASD participated in <5 days of MVPA over 
a two-week period, in comparison to only 23.9 % of the TD 
children. Children with ASD most frequently reported to 
participate in at least 20 min of MVPA on 1–2 days over a 
two-week period. Conversely, TD children most frequently 
reported to participate in MVPA on 9 or more days. Overall, 
the findings of our study reflect the inactivity of youth with 
ASD in other research. For example, Memari et al. (2015) 
utilized parent-reported data on children with ASD, aged 
6–15, (n = 83) finding that only 12 % (n = 10) of children with 
ASD were active and 88 % (n = 73) were inactive based upon 
activity guidelines and activity score measured by the Godin-
Shephard Leisure Time Questionnaire (GLTEQ). This result 
is in contrast to research by Corvey et al. (2016) who found 
no significant differences in physical activity rates between 
the sample with ASD and the TD control. In addition, Bandini 
et al. (2013) demonstrated children with and without ASD, 
with a mean age of 6.6, participated in similar amounts of 
light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity as measured 
by accelerometry, when adjusted for age and sex. However,

overweight or obese (34.9 %), compared to 18 children 
(24.7 %) in the TD group. This difference did not reach sta-
tistical significance. Various factors are proposed for the 
difference in overweight prevalence among individuals 
with ASD, including restricted food preferences (Schreck 
et al. 2004), lower physical activity levels (Pan 2008; 
Rimmer et al. 2010), and medication use associated with 
weight gain (Esbensen et al. 2009). Research by Corvey 
et al. (2016), using data from the 2011–2012 National Sur-
vey of Children’s Health indicate that ASD was not inde-
pendently related to obesity when medication use and the 
presence of secondary conditions were taken into account. 
In the current study, overweight and obesity rates did not 
significantly differ between the sample with and without 
comorbidities. Future research should examine the factors 
associated with weight status among children with ASD in 
Ireland, examining individual (including ASD severity lev-
els), social and environmental factors.
Limitations and Recommendations
This study overcomes a number of limitations of past 
research (Corvey et al. 2016) on this topic including a rel-
atively large sample size, use of a comparison group, and 
involvement of children from an unresearched geographical 
area. However, several limitations should be stated. First, 
this study utilized a variety of self-report measures. Self-
report may be prone to recall error and bias, and research 
has demonstrated social desirability to compromise the 
validity of self-report use in measuring physical activity 
(Dishman et al. 2005). However, due to the large number 
of questionnaires used in the data collection, the effect of 
social-desirability for the questions of interest for this study 
will be minimized. The use of self-report measures presents 
another challenge for the measurement of physical activity 
for children with ASD. Past research (Bandini et al. 2013), 
has demonstrated that physical activity participation as mea-
sured by accelerometery was not associated with parental 
reports of the child’s activity. The authors proposed that this 
may be due to the failure for the parent to report activities 
such as pacing, spinning, or other motor movements com-
monly observed in children with ASD. It is possible that the 
children with ASD in this study engaged in similar move-
ments that went unidentified due to the self-report nature of 
the data. Future research should seek to extend this research 
by using objective data collection methods. In addition, 
because of the nature of the nationally representative data 
collection procedure, it was not possible to confirm the ASD 
diagnosis, or establish severity levels of the children in this 
study. Future research should seek to examine PA and screen 
time levels by the severity of ASD, which will help to better 
tailor future interventions for this population.
both groups reported spending the most time watching tele-
vision, with children with ASD reporting to spend a mean of 
121 and 150 min per day in comparison to the TD children 
who spent a mean of 91–120 min. Previous research has 
revealed screen-time behavior to be significantly higher for 
children with ASD in comparison to TD children. For exam-
ple, Must et al. (2014), utilizing parental report, showed 
mean daily screen-time to be 2.5 hours for children with 
ASD, in comparison to 1.6  hours for TD children. Simi-
larly, Mazurek and Wenstrup (2013) compared screen-time 
between siblings with and without ASD revealing that chil-
dren with ASD spent more time in screen-based activities 
per day than TD children.
Several factors are proposed as contributors to the 
increased likelihood of children with ASD to engage in 
screen time activities. Nally et al. (2000) found that tele-
vision and video games served as a means to calm the 
child with ASD, as reported by parents. In addition, chil-
dren with ASD are visually orientated. This characteristic 
might make screen viewing particularly appealing. Finally, 
the social deficits experienced by children with ASD may 
result in a reluctance to engage in play and sports that are 
often socially demanding. This aversion to group games, 
may lead to a preference for individual activities such as 
television viewing and video games, and in particular, non-
social screen-based activities of which children with ASD 
choose to participate in (Mazurek et al. 2012). It has been 
showed (Graf et al. 2009) that TD children can increase 
energy expenditure using exergames. Exergaming has also 
shown to provide fitness games for children with intel-
lectual and developmental disabilities (Lotan et al. 2009). 
Future research must continue to assess how parents can 
use screen-based media to motivate their children with ASD 
to engage in increased amounts of MVPA. The behavioral, 
cognitive, and social benefits of exergaming must also be 
explored for this population.
In the US, the rates of overweight and obesity among 
children with ASD is higher than those of TD children 
(Curtin et al. 2010). For example, among a large clinical 
sample, Broder-Fingert et al. (2014) found higher rates of 
obesity among children with ASD (23.2 %) and Aspergers 
syndrome (25.3 %) compared to a TD control (6.3 %). To 
date, research outside of the US is limited to data repre-
senting a few countries: rates range from 31.5 % in China 
(Xia et al. 2010) to 52 % in the United Kingdom (White-
ley et al. 2004). To the knowledge of the authors, the cur-
rent study is the first to examine overweight and obesity 
rates for children with ASD in Ireland. Our Chi square 
analyses showed there was no relationship between being 
overweight and having an ASD diagnosis, however rates 
of overweight and obesity among the sample with ASD 
were higher than the TD control, with 22 children being

Conclusion
There is a growing body of research on physical activ-
ity, screen-time and overweight status of individuals with 
ASD; results remain ambiguous, and are limited by a lack 
of comparison groups, constrained geographical areas, 
small samples sizes, and reliance on self or parent report 
data. The current study contributes to the literature on this 
topic, revealing lower levels of physical activity among 
children with ASD, and higher levels of TV watching, com-
pared to a TD control. Future interventions to increase PA 
and decrease screen time in children with ASD should be 
tailored to this population, as results demonstrated differ-
ences in activity behaviors among children with ASD and 
TD children.
