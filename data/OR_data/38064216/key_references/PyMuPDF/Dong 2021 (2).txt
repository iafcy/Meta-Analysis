Objective: To investigate the current status of screen time in children with ASD, its
correlation with autistic symptoms and developmental quotient (DQ), and the factors
affecting screen time.
Method:
One hundred ninety-three Chinese children with ASD were recruited. We
collected the demographic and screen time data using a questionnaire. The ASD core
symptoms and developmental quotient (DQ) were measured by the Autism Behavior
Checklist (ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2), Grifﬁths Development Scales-Chinese Language
Edition (GDS-C), and Chinese Children’s Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire
(CPCIS). Then, we analyzed the correlations between the screen time of children with
ASD and the ABC, CARS, ADOS, GDS-C DQs, and CPCIS scores. Linear regression
was used to analyze the risk factors that affect screen time.
Results:
The children’s average daily screen time was 2.64 ± 2.24 h. Forty eight
percent children were exposed to two or more types of electronic devices. Their favorite
activity of screen time was watching cartoons. Only 34% children spent screen time
accompanied by parents and with communication. 50.26% children had no screen time
before sleeping. The screen time of children with ASD had a negative correlation with the
GDS-C CQ (r = −0.234, P = 0.001) and the CPCIS score (r = −0.180, P = 0.012) and a
positive correlation with the CARS score (r = 0.192, P = 0.009). A low father’s education
level (P = 0.010), less restriction of the child’s screen time by the guardian (P = 0.001),
greater caregiver screen time (P < 0.001), the use of the screen as a tool for child rearing
(P = 0.001), and the child’s ownership of independent electronic equipment (P = 0.027)
are risk factors for long screen time in children with ASD.
Conclusion:
The screen time of children with ASD in China is higher than the
recommended standard, and the current situation is serious. The screen time of ASD
children is related to their autism symptoms, DQ and parent-child interaction. Low
paternal education levels, less restriction of children’s screen time by guardians, greater
guardian screen time, the use of screens in child rearing, and children’s ownership of

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental
disorder
characterized
by
persistent
deﬁcits
in
social
communication and interaction and stereotyped or repetitive
patterns of behavior, interests or activities. In recent years, its
prevalence has been increasing. The latest report has revealed
a prevalence rate as high as 1 in 54 (1), making it a common
disorder that seriously endangers children’s social adaptability.
Currently, it is generally believed that genetic and environmental
factors and their interactions lead to the phenotypes of autism;
however, the exact causal mechanism remains uncertain (2).
The reported increase in prevalence in ASD is partly due to
changes in diagnostic criteria, reductions in the misdiagnosis
rate, and increases in the consultation rate, but the reasons for
the increase are not limited to these factors. Environmental
factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD
(3) and may include socioeconomic factors, nutritional factors,
heavy metal exposure, and air pollution. In ASD patients, a
potential environmental factor is electronic screen time (4).
Screen time has adverse eﬀects on both children with ASD and
children with typical development. These adverse eﬀects include
poor academic performance (5), sleep problems (6), attention
problems (7), social behavior deﬁcits (8), obesity (9), adverse
cardiovascular events (10), language delay (11), mood disorder
(12), and even autistic-like symptoms (13).
The
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
(AAP)
has
recommended that for children younger than 2 years old,
exposure to digital devices should be avoided; moreover, screen
time should be limited to 1 h per day for 2–5-year-olds (14).
However, according to reports in the literature, the screen
exposure time of many children, including children with typical
development (15, 16) exceeds the AAP recommended standard.
In the population of children with ASD, this phenomenon may
be more serious. A systematic literature review conducted in
2019 (17) showed that children with ASD spent more time
watching television than the typical control group. A Thai
study on the screen time of young ASD children (average age
2.56 years) (18) showed that their average screen time was
4.60 h.
Studies have found that early exposure to electronic screens
can cause neurochemical and anatomical changes in the brain,
and neurotransmitter changes may cause behavioral problems
in children (19). Research on the relationship between screen
time and behavior in ASD children (13) shows that children
who are exposed to electronic screens for more than 3 h a day
have language delay, attention deﬁcit and hyperactivity problems.
Krupa’s research has indicated that the screen time of ASD
children and of their family members could aﬀect the interaction
between mother and child (20). These poor social interactions
(mainly games) can further exacerbate children’s autism-like
symptoms and aﬀect their development.
At present, studies on the factors aﬀecting the screen time
of children with ASD are not rare (15, 21), but the screen
time of children is very closely related to region and social
systems, and there is no relevant research from China. Therefore,
research on the screen time of children with ASD is of great
signiﬁcance for understanding the current situation of children
with ASD and identifying the risk factors for long screen time in
these children. Such research could provide further evidence for
limiting the screen time of children with ASD, thereby helping
to provide clinical strategies for the families of children with
ASD to improve ASD symptoms, language development and
parent-child interaction.
Our team’s preliminary small-sample cross-sectional study
on this issue (22) showed that the screen time of children
with ASD is signiﬁcantly longer than that of children with
typical development and is signiﬁcantly correlated with children’s
performance on developmental tests (especially of language
ability). This correlation is more pronounced in children with
ASD who are younger and are exposed to longer screen times.
We conducted this study to further explore the current status
of the screen time of children with ASD in China; verify the
relationship between their screen time and their developmental
quotient, parent-child interactions and autistic symptoms; and
identify the risk factors that aﬀect their screen time.
METHODS
Participants
A total of 193 children with ASD (157 boys and 36 girls, 81.34
vs. 18.66%) diagnosed for the ﬁrst time in the Department of
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics of the First Hospital
of Jilin University between April 2020 and September 2020 were
recruited for this study. Their ages ranged from 17 to 76.5
months (37.39 ± 10.96 months). The DSM-5 and ADOS-2 (The
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule–Second Edition) were
utilized for the diagnosis of ASD without systemic intervention.
Children with severe physical disability, cardiopulmonary disease
or uncontrolled epilepsy and other serious physical conditions
were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of our hospital, and informed consent was provided
by the parents or caregivers of the children who participated.
Procedure
We investigated the children’s socioeconomic and demographic
proﬁle; their current screen time experience, using the self-made
Children’s Screen Time Questionnaire; and their parent–child
interaction, using the CPCIS (Chinese Parent–Child Interaction
Scale). The children’s ASD symptoms and developmental level

were also examined using the Autism Behavior Checklist
(ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and Griﬃths
Development Scales-Chinese Language Edition (GDS-C).
Screen time data were calculated. The correlations between
screen time and the scores on the ASD-related scales, CPCIS and
GDS-C were analyzed. The children were divided into subgroups
according to screen time and age, and correlation studies of
each subgroup were performed separately. Finally, the risk factors
aﬀecting the screen time of children with ASD were identiﬁed.
The socioeconomic and demographic information that was
collected included name, gender (male or female), age, birth date
(year, month and day), place of residence (urban or rural area),
caregivers (parents or others), siblings, parents’ education levels,
household income, maternal post-partum depression (yes or no)
and outdoor activity time (hours).
The content of the self-made Children’s Screen Time
Questionnaire
is
as
follows:
screen
time
on
weekdays
and weekends, the type of electronic screen (TV, smart
phone, computer, etc.), the main activity during screen time
(cartoons, video games, Chinese poems, learning, etc.), parental
accompaniment during screen time (accompaniment with
communication, accompaniment without communication and
no accompaniment), frequency of electronic screen use before
going to bed, changes in screen time exposure in the past month
(increased, decreased, or unchanged), restrictions on screen time
(restricted, partially restricted, or not restricted), screen time of
caregivers, age at ﬁrst screen exposure, use of electronic screens
as a tool to raise children (always, sometimes, or barely), use
of screen time as a reward or punishment (always, sometimes,
or barely), and independent ownership of electronic equipment
(yes or no). The evaluator calculated and recorded the average
daily screen time of the children using the following formula:
average daily screen time (h) = [screen time per day on weekdays
(h)×5+screen time per day on weekends (h)×2]/7.
The CPCIS was designed based on the literature and clinical
observations in the Chinese context. It is an easily administered,
valid, and reliable tool for the assessment of parent–child
interactions in Chinese families (23). It includes eight items
that have good validity and reliability. These items related
to reading, drawing, singing, storytelling, discussing news and
aﬀairs, arithmetic and mathematics, English letters, and Chinese
characters. Every item is divided into 0–5 points according to the
frequency of interaction between children and parents per week
(representing 0 to 5 times per week).
The ADOS-2 was utilized in this study as a diagnostic tool for
ASD. The ADOS-2 is a semistructured, standardized assessment
tool for individuals with suspected ASDs and measures autism
symptoms in the domains of social relatedness, communication,
play, and repetitive behaviors; it is deemed to be a gold standard
for ASD diagnostic evaluation (24). The ADOS-2 modules 1 and
2 have calibrated severity scores: scores of 3 and 4 indicate low-
level evidence, scores of 5–7 indicate moderate-level evidence
and scores of 8–10 indicate high-level evidence. The ADOS-2
Toddler Module, which is used for children younger than 31
months, has no calibrated severity scores.
The symptom evaluation scales included the ABC and
the CARS. The ABC is a 57-item screening checklist for
autism containing 5 subscales (body behavior, sensory, self-
care, language and social interaction). It is designed for parent
interviews. The CARS was developed by Schopler and Reichler
et al. and is used as a diagnostic scale. It consists of 15
subscales, each of which is scored on a continuum from normal
to severely abnormal. The CARS requires observation of the
behavior of ASD children in a consulting room. The reliability
and validity of the ABC and CARS in the Chinese context are
adequate, reﬂecting the scales’ utility for the clinical diagnosis and
evaluation of ASD symptoms.
The GDS-C is a popular tool in the Chinese social context and
has good reliability and validity (25). It uses ﬁve independent
subscales to assess the development level of children aged 0–2
years: physical mobility (A scale), personal social skills (B scale),
hearing-speech (C scale), eye-hand coordination (D scale) and
performance (E scale). Children aged 3–8 are also tested to assess
their practical reasoning (F scale). The test scores are converted
to a developmental age (DA) according to the Chinese norm
for the GDS-C; the chronological age (CA) is calculated as the
date of assessment minus the date of birth; and the development
quotients (DQs) = DA × 100/CA (26). The DQs of each scale are
called the AQ, BQ, CQ, DQ, EQ, and FQ.
Statistical Methods
SPSS 23.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis.
Continuous variables with normal distributions are represented
as the means ± standard deviations (SDs), and continuous
variables with abnormal distributions are represented as the
medians (P25–P75). Categorical variables are represented as
frequencies (percentages).
The current screen time situation was analyzed using
the Descriptive Statistics function in SPSS. Spearman’s rank
correlation was used for the two non-normally distributed
variables in the correlation study. A linear regression model was
used to analyze the risk factors for screen time. The results were
considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Current Situation of Screen Time Among
Children With ASD
The average screen time of children with ASD on weekdays was
2.68 ± 2.33 h, and that on weekends was 2.57 ± 2.29 h. Children
with ASD seemed to have longer screen time on weekdays than
weekends, but the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.674). The
average daily screen time of children across the entire week was
2.64 ± 2.24 h: n = 83 (43.0%) children had 0–1 h, n = 31 (16.1%)
children 1–2 h, and n = 79 (40.9%) children more than 2 h of
screen time (Figure 1).
The results for the type of electronic screen were as follows:
n = 93 (48%) of children were exposed to 2 or more types of
electronic screens daily. N = 61 (32%) of children’s screen time
was occupied by TV watching, n = 20 (10%) by smartphone use,
and another 10% by the use of tablets or iPads, computers or
other devices (see details in Figure 2).
The results showed the following regarding the main activity
during screen time: n = 160 (83%) children with ASD watched

cartoons, n = 102 (53%) watched nursery rhymes, and n = 37
(19%) watched short videos on social platforms (TikTok, etc.).
Other screen time activities included reading ancient Chinese
poems (n = 25), reading stories (n = 23), learning English (n
= 21), playing video games (n = 18), making voice or video
calls (n = 14), reading news or advertisements (n = 7), taking
online classes (n = 5), and watching movies or TV series (n = 3)
(Figure 3).
We investigated parents’ involvement in children’s screen
time: n = 65 (34%) children spent screen time accompanied
by parents and with communication, n = 52 (28%) were
accompanied by their parents but without communication and
n = 72 (38%) were not accompanied by parents.
Regarding the frequency of the use of electronic screens
before going to bed, n = 97 (50.26%) children had no screen
time before sleeping, n = 41 (21.24%) had screen time before
bed 1 to 3 times a week, n = 16 (8.29%) 3 to 5 times
a week, and n = 39 (20.21%) more than 5 times a week.
In the past month, n = 15 (7.78%) children’s exposure to
screen time increased, n = 77 (39.90%) children’s screen time
remained unchanged, and n = 101 (52.32%) children’s screen
time decreased.
The Correlations of Screen Time With ASD
Symptoms, Development Quotients and
Parent–Child Interactions in Children With
ASD
The results of the Spearman rank correlation test showed that
the screen time of children with ASD had a negative correlation
with the GDS-C CQ (r = −0.234, P = 0.001) and CPCIS score (r
= −0.180, P = 0.012) and a positive correlation with the CARS
score (r = 0.192, P = 0.009) (see Table 1).
We divided the children with ASD into a longer screen time
subgroup and a shorter screen time subgroup based on the cutoﬀ
recommended by the AAP (27) (2.0 h/d). The longer screen time
subgroup had 83 children with ASD, and the average screen time
was 4.89 ± 1.61 h/d. The shorter screen time subgroup had 110
children with ASD, and the average screen time was 0.98 ± 0.65
h/d. We conducted the aforementioned correlation study. The
results showed that among children with ASD with a screen time
longer than 2.0 h per day, screen time had a positive correlation
with the CARS score (r = 0.317, P = 0.004) and had a negative
correlation with the CQ of the GDS-C (r = −0.220, P = 0.050)
and the CPCIS score (r = −0.289, P = 0.008). However, we did

not ﬁnd any correlation between screen time and the ASD-related
scale scores or the DQs in the shorter screen time subgroup (see
details in Table 2).
In addition, we divided the ASD group into an older group
and a younger group according to the average age (36.5 months).
The screen time of the younger subgroup (N = 110, average age =
29.70 ± 3.90 m) was 2.69 ± 2.32 h, and that of the older subgroup
was 2.59 ± 2.20 h (N = 83, average age = 47.59 ± 8.73 m). There
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in screen time between the two
subgroups (t = 0.331, P = 0.741). The results of the correlation
study showed that in the younger subgroup, screen time had a
positive correlation with the CARS score (r = 0.488, P < 0.001).
In addition, screen time in the younger subgroup had a negative
correlation with the CQ of the GDS-C (r = −0.330, P = 0.001)
and the CPCIS score (r = −0.217, P = 0.024). However, we did
not ﬁnd any correlation between screen time and the ASD-related
scale scores or the DQs in the older subgroup (see details in
Table 3).
Risk Factors of Screen Time in Children
With Autism
Univariate Analysis Results of Factors Related to
Screen Time
The Spearman rank correlation results for continuous variables
showed that the screen time of children with ASD was negatively
correlated with the CQ of the GDS-C and the CPCIS score
(Table 1), and there was no correlation between screen time and
age (r = 0.025, P = 0.730).
For categorical variables, the Mann-Whitney U test is used for
two independent samples, and the K independent samples K-W
non-parametric test is used for multiple independent samples.
The results showed that degree of education of the mother (χ2
= −2.113, P = 0.035) and father (χ2 = −3.139, P = 0.002),
outdoor activity time (χ2 = −2.283, P = 0.022), whether screen
time was restricted (Z = 33.328, P < 0.001), caregiver screen time
(Z = 40.771, P < 0.001), the use of electronic screens as a tool to
raise children (Z = 51.285, P < 0.001), the use of screen time as
a reward or punishment (Z = 11.357, P = 0.003) and ownership
of independent electronic equipment (χ2 = −3.261, P = 0.001)
were closely related to the screen time of children with ASD (see
details in Table 4).
Linear Regression Results for the Risk Factors for
Screen Time in Children With ASD
The statistically signiﬁcant factors in the univariate analysis were
incorporated into the linear regression model. The continuous
variables were the CQ of the GDS-C and the CPCIS score.
The categorical variables were coded as follows: Maternal and
paternal education (senior high school or below = 1, junior
college or above = 2), outdoor activities (<1 h = 1, ≥1 h = 2),
screen time restrictions (no restrictions = 1, partial restriction
= 2, restriction = 3), screen time of caregivers (0–1 h = 1, 1–
2 h = 2, 2–4 h = 3, >4 h = 4), use as a tool to raise children
(almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, always = 3), use as a reward
or punishment (almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, always = 3),
ownership of independent electronic equipment (no = 1, yes =

Children under 31 months of age use the M-T version of the ADOS, and there is no severity score. Therefore, in the younger subgroup, more than half of the children had no severity
score data, so no statistical analysis was performed. In the GDS-C, FQ scores are not available until the F ﬁeld ability exceeds 24 months. Therefore, most children in the younger
subgroup had no scores in the F ﬁeld of the GDS-C; therefore, statistical analysis was not performed.

2). A low paternal education level and no restriction of children’s
screen time are risk factors for long screen time in children with
ASD. Low caregiver screen time, not using electronic equipment
as a tool to raise children and not owning independent electronic
equipment are protective factors for long screen time in children
with ASD (see details in Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Current Situation of Screen Time Among
Children With ASD
Screen Time
Our results suggest that the current situation of autistic children
with a long screen time is serious. A total of 40.9% of children
with ASD have an average daily screen time of more than 2 h
a day. This result is consistent with previous studies. Mazurek
and Wenstrup (28) investigated the screen time of children with
ASD (8–18 years old) and found that the average screen time was
2.4 h per day for boys and 1.8 h per day for girls. Healy et al. (29)
also found that 13-year-old children with ASD spend an average
of 121–150 min a day watching TV. MacMullin (30) found that
individuals with ASD were reported to spend an average of 5.67 h
per day using electronic devices from the ages of 6 to 21 years old.
However, there are relatively few studies on younger ASD groups.
According to a study in Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle
East (31), the average screen time of children with ASD before the
age of 3 was 4.7 h a day in Qatar. This is longer than the average
screen time of 2.64 h per day for ASD children in China. Our
results also show that the screen time on weekdays has a tendency
to be longer than that on weekends (although the diﬀerent is not
statistically signiﬁcant), which may be related to the increase in
parent-child interaction when parents are at home on weekends.
However, Must’s research (32) suggests the opposite, reporting
that children with ASD’s screen time on weekends is longer
than that on weekdays. The reason for this diﬀerence may be

that Must’s sample covered a larger age range (3–11 years vs.
17 months to 76.5 months) and had a higher average age (6.6
years vs. 37.39 months) than the sample in this study. However,
older children often receive special education or schooling on
weekdays, and weekends are used as rest time, giving them more
opportunity to for electronic screen time. Therefore, we will
continue to follow up with children with ASD to determine the
status of electronic screen use in these children at school age
in China.
Types of Electronic Devices
Our research found that 48% of children with ASD are exposed to
more than two types of electronic screens. This is also consistent
with existing reports. MacMullin (30) reported that children
with ASD are exposed to more than three electronic devices
on average. Children with ASD engage in a variety of screen
activities, which reﬂects their preference for such activities. In
2014, Kuo (33) identiﬁed TVs and computers as the favorite
electronic devices of teenagers with ASD, while the preferred
electronic devices of children with ASD in our study were
TVs and smartphones. Almost all studies report that TV is the
most-used electronic device among children. This may be due
to the wide availability of and larger audience for TV. With
the development of network technology and advancements in
electronic technology, smartphones play an important role in the
screen time of children with ASD.
Main Screen Activities
Games and social media were the main screen activities of
children with ASD in MacMullin’s study (30) while the main
screen activities of children with ASD in our study were cartoons
(n = 160, 83%), nursery rhymes (n = 102, 53%) and short videos
on social platforms (n = 37, 19%). This may be related to the
younger age of the children in this study. Older adolescents with
ASD have certain learning, language and social abilities, all of
which change with age. There are no reports on the screen time of
Chinese teenagers and young adults with ASD. This issue needs
further follow-up and investigation in the Chinese context.
We also found that some screen activities were related
to children’s learning behaviors and involved reading ancient
Chinese poems (n = 25, 13%), learning English (n = 21, 11%)
and taking online classes (n = 5, 2.6%). Therefore, we must also
pay attention to whether there is a potential positive eﬀect of

screen activity. Shane (34) reported that the use of electronic
screens can provide a more attractive learning environment for
children with ASD. Electronic screen media may be an eﬀective
tool for teaching or improving the social, language, and cognitive
skills of children with ASD. However, we have reservations
about this possible positive eﬀect. As children develop, they
continuously gain a variety of new knowledge and apply it to
diﬀerent situations, which is called the transfer of learning (35).
Studies have shown that children under the age of 3 experience
diﬃculty transferring information from 2D contexts to 3D real
contexts. Even if the 2D learning context includes touchscreen
puzzle interaction, which is better than video games, it may still
cause interference with learning, and the transfer deﬁcit may still
exist (36). This may be due to children’s immature perceptual
encoding and inability to comprehend symbolic representation
(36). Therefore, young children learn less from television,
touchscreen computers and books than they do from face-
to-face communication and contact. Early childhood learning,
including language learning, depends to a large extent on the
direct inﬂuence of the language context in social interaction
rather than on the input of electronic products (13).
Parents’ Attitudes
Our research found that only n = 65 (34%) of parents
are present with their children and communicate with them
during the children’s screen time. This statistic is consistent
with Hermawati’s report (13), which found that more than
half of children (66.6%) were exposed to electronic screens

Dong et al.
Screen Time and Autism
without parent-child interaction. The results of a large sample
study published in China on pre-school children with normal
development in Shanghai showed that only 26% of parents
were able to accompany their children during screen time and
talk about the content. Although many parents are aware of
the hazards of screen exposure, quite a few parents tend to
use electronic screens as temporary “electronic babysitters” so
that they can complete housework, leaving children to spend
their screen time alone. Parents of children with ASD report
that television and videos are often used to distract, prevent
tantrums, and control behaviors. In discussions of children with
disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs), parents tended to regard
screen time as an opportunity for “peace and quiet” (21). Our
research also found that only n = 40 (21%) parents did not use
electronic screens as a tool for raising children, and only n = 64
(33%) parents strictly limited children’s screen time. Therefore,
in response to this problem, the AAP recommendations should
be followed; these advocate watching high-quality programs and
suggest that parents watch TV with their children and help them
understand the content on the screen and apply it in the real
world (14).
Sleep
In our research, electronic screens were frequently used before
going to bed, and ∼50% of children had screen time before
sleeping. Currently, there are reports suggesting that screen
time before going to bed is associated with sleep reduction
in children with autism (37) and aﬀects sleep quality (6, 38).
The possible reasons for the mechanism by which screen time
aﬀects sleep are as follows: delayed sleep time (39), psychological,
emotional, and/or physiological arousal (40), inhibition of the
level of melatonin by screen illumination (41), and sleep rhythm
disruption. Sleep has an impact on mood, behavior, learning and
memory (38). Therefore, controlling screen time may be helpful
in children with ASD who have sleep problems. This study
investigated only the use of electronic screens before going to bed,
and the impact on sleep needs further research and discussion.
Screen Time Is Related to ASD Symptoms,
the Development Quotient and
Parent–Child Interaction
Our study showed that screen time is related to autistic
symptoms, the hearing-speech development quotient (CQ) and
parent–child interaction in children with ASD. The correlation
may be more pronounced in children with ASD who have longer
screen time and in younger children with ASD. This result is
consistent with our previous small-sample research results and
other existing studies.
Screen Time Is Related to Autistic Symptoms
Adverse environmental factors have an important eﬀect on the
clinical symptoms of children with ASD. Excessive screen time
has adverse eﬀects on children’s social participation and behavior
regulation (30). Yousef’s study found that screen time > 2
h/d among school-age children was positively correlated with
children’s autism-like symptoms (42). Subgroup analysis showed
that the correlation between screen time and symptoms is more
obvious in the younger subgroup and the subgroup with longer
screen time, which is in line with our expectations. ASD is closely
related to brain development. Studies have shown that in the
early post-natal period or even before birth, the brains of children
with ASD have multiple neurological defects. The brain develops
rapidly in the early stages after birth and is inﬂuenced by the
developmental environment (43). Therefore, we speculate that
the longer that children with autism are exposed to unfavorable
environmental factors and the less mature their brains are, the
more obvious their developmental delay and autistic symptoms
will be. From what has been discussed above, we conclude that
long-term screen time can aﬀect symptoms of autism as an
adverse environmental factor.
Screen Time Is Related to the Hearing-Speech
Development Quotient
Screen time was proven to be related to the development of
language in children with ASD in this study. The younger the
age and the longer the screen exposure time, the more serious
the impact on language development is. Hermawati reported that
exposure to electronic media in early life (<2 years old) had a
negative impact on language (13). Chonchaiya et al. found that
children who started watching TV as early as 12 months and who
watch for more than 2 h a day are six times more likely to have
language delays. The latest meta-analysis published by Madigan
in 2020 (44) shows that screen use is related to children’s language
skills. The ﬁndings support pediatric recommendations to limit
children’s duration of screen exposure, to select high-quality
programming, and to co-view when possible. These ﬁndings are
all in line with our research results. It is important to provide
family health guidance to parents of children with ASD. We
remind parents of the importance of children’s media ecology for
children’s language development, especially that of children with
social communication problems. Recommendations regarding
the frequency and duration of screen time may be conducive
to optimizing children’s development. Importantly, society and
the relevant professionals have a responsibility to continue to
promote and advocate children’s screen time initiatives and
supervise media platforms.
Screen Time Is Related to Parent-Child Interaction
We also found a negative correlation between the screen time
of ASD children and the parent-child relationship. The longer
the screen time is, the worse the parent-child interaction level.
Krupa’s study (20) also reported the same results. In addition
to children’s personal screen time, family screen time also has a
negative impact on the parent-child relationship. Therefore, we
should limit not only the screen time of children with ASD but
also the screen time of their families (20). Some studies indicate
that parent-child interaction is an intermediary factor. Prolonged
screen time in children with ASD reduces the level of parent-
child interaction, which aﬀects the development of children’s
communication and social skills. If this factor is changed, the
harmful eﬀects of excessive screen time may be partially oﬀset by
improved parent-child interaction (45). This ﬁnding can be used
to inform guidance for parents.

Screen Time and Autism
Risk Factors for Screen Time in Children
With ASD
Our results suggest that low paternal education levels, no
restrictions on screen time, longer caregiver screen time, the use
of media devices as a tool to raise children, and independent
ownership of electronic equipment are risk factors for screen time
in children with ASD. This result suggests that family factors
are the main factors aﬀecting the screen time of children with
ASD. A survey (46) of primary and middle school students in
12 provinces and cities in China showed that sex, urban or
rural residence, living in the west or east province of China,
self-rated academic performance, parents’ education levels and
physical activity could aﬀect children’s screen time. This is
slightly diﬀerent from the results of our research. The daily life
of typically developing primary and middle school students is
greatly inﬂuenced by the school environment, but the children
in our study were young and had ASD. Many children with
ASD cannot receive education in a normal school setting,
and the family environment has a greater impact than other
environmental factors; this may explain the diﬀerences between
the above-mentioned survey and our study.
A study of 18-month-old children in Sydney (15) showed that
screen time >2 h is related to the following factors: mother has
no partner, fewer than three siblings, father has a job, no outdoor
equipment, and outdoor activity <5 times a week. Similar to
the Sydney study, some studies (47) found that the presence of
siblings may have an impact on children’s screen time, but our
research did not ﬁnd this result. The reason may be that it was
aﬀected by the “family planning” policy implemented several
years ago. Although China has gradually opened the two-child
policy in 2015, there are still few Chinese children with siblings.
Only 61of the 193 children with ASD in this study had siblings.
Healy’s study (48) reported a relationship between lifestyle
and screen time in children with ASD and found that screen
time was related to less physical activity. Must’s study (49) also
emphasized that there is a negative correlation between physical
activity time and the screen time of children with ASD. Our
study did not investigate the physical activity time of children
with ASD. This is a limitation of our research. We speculate
that physical activity may be similar to parent-child interaction,
which is also an intermediary factor of screen time eﬀect on the
development of children with ASD. A longer period of physical
activity may oﬀset the impact of screen time on children. This
speculation needs to be further explored in follow-up research.
Healy (48) also found that screen time is correlated with
parents’ attitude toward not restricting screen time and toward
the presence of a TV in their child’s room. Similar results were
found in our research: not restricting screen time was a risk factor
for screen time in children with ASD. However, the children in
our study were younger and often did not have their own rooms.
The ﬁndings of this study indicate that children with independent
electronic devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, are at risk
of longer screen time.
Previous studies (21, 47, 50) have shown that screen time is
negatively correlated with family income and parental education
levels. Our research also indicated that as family income
increased, the screen time of children with ASD tended to
decrease. Although this trend was not statistically signiﬁcant,
there may be some hints for clinical work. Parents with better
economic conditions tend to have a higher social class and may
more consciously engage in parent-child interaction with their
ASD children as a form of continuous family intervention rather
than using electronic screens as a nanny. In addition, this study
also identiﬁed the father’s education level as a factor inﬂuencing
the screen time of children with ASD, consistent with the results
of previous studies.
According
to
our
research,
we
will
provide
relevant
psychological education to the parents of ASD children,
and help them to make family intervention plans, which may
have greater signiﬁcance for the management of ASD children.
Limitation
The age range of this study is small. Screen activities of children of
diﬀerent ages will change with their cognitive ability and school
activities, and the inﬂuencing factors may also be diﬀerent, which
needs further discussion.
The relationship between sleep and electronic devices has
not been discussed in detail, and this may be the direction of
future research.
Studies have shown that outdoor activity time may be related
to children’s screen time. Our study did not investigate the
physical activity time of children with ASD.
CONCLUSION
The screen time of children with ASD in China is above
the recommended standard, and the current screen exposure
situation is serious. The screen time of children with ASD
is related to their autism symptoms, DQ and parent-child
interaction. This correlation is more pronounced in younger
children with ASD and those with longer screen time. A low
father’s education level, less restriction of the child’s screen time
by the guardian, greater caregiver screen time, the application of
the screen as a tool for child rearing, and the child’s ownership
of independent electronic equipment can lead to an increase in a
child’s screen time.
Identifying the risk factors for longer screen time in children
with ASD can provide a basis for limiting the screen time of
children with ASD, which is beneﬁcial for the improvement
of ASD symptoms, language development and parent-child
interaction in ASD children. It is of great signiﬁcance to clinical
decision making.
