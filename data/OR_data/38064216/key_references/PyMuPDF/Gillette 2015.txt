ABSTRACT:
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be at increased risk for overweight and
obesity, but little information is known about correlates of overweight and obesity in this population. This
study compared prevalence rates of parent-reported overweight and obesity and specific health behaviors
(i.e., parent report of child sleep, family meal patterns, child screen time, and child physical activity) among
children with ASD (N 5 more than 900 [weighted to represent 690,000; age 10–17]) compared with children
without ASD using data from a nationally representative sample. Additionally, the relationship between
specific health behaviors (i.e., child sleep, family meals, screen time, and physical activity) and weight status
was examined in the ASD population. Data were from the National Survey of Children’s Health 2011–2012.
Results indicate that children with ASD were more likely to be obese but not more likely to be overweight
than non-ASD youth. Children with ASD engaged in physical activity less than children without ASD, but no
differences were found on sleep, most measures of screen time, and mealtimes. However, parent perceived
poorer sleep was associated with increased weight status, and fewer family meals were associated with
normal weight status among children with ASD.
(J Dev Behav Pediatr 36:489–496, 2015) Index terms: obesity, autism spectrum disorder, health correlates.
According to an emerging body of literature, youth
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be at in-
creased risk for overweight (body mass index [BMI]
$85th percentile for age and gender) and obesity (BMI
$95th percentile for age and gender),1 a national
health epidemic with significant physical and psycho-
social consequences affecting one third of the US
children and adolescents.2 However, prevalence esti-
mates vary substantially with some evidence to suggest
that rates of obesity in children with ASD are compa-
rable with national estimates (17%),3 and other re-
search that finds prevalence estimates up to 3 times as
large (42%).4 Although methodological limitations such
as small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups
likely contribute to these discrepancies,1 the incon-
sistencies in the literature to date suggest that further
research is needed.
Two recent studies with modest sample sizes yielded
consistent estimates of both obesity and overweight
prevalence rates. Sharp et al5 found obesity rates of
14.9% and overweight rates of 23.1%; similarly, Zucker-
man et al6 found obesity and overweight rates of 17%
and 18.1%, respectively. Neither study included a com-
parison group, but these estimates do appear to exceed
rates of combined overweight and obesity in typically
developing children.
Studies with large samples that do include compari-
son
groups
have
also
yielded
discrepant
findings,
perhaps because most studies have relied on parent-
reported BMI data. In a nationally representative survey
sample, Curtin et al7 found that youth with ASD had
a risk of obesity that was 40% greater than those without
ASD based on parent-reported BMI. Interestingly, the
difference in rates of obesity between ASD and non-ASD
youth only approached significance. In another national
survey sample, Phillips et al8 found that 31.8% of youth
with ASD were obese based on parent-reported BMI,
significantly higher than typically developing children;
however, differences in prevalence for overweight were
not significant. Broder-Fingert et al conducted the first
study of obesity in children with ASD that included
a large sample size, comparison group, and direct
measures of height and weight. For children diagnosed
with autism and Asperger syndrome, respectively, rates
of overweight (14.8% and 11.1%) and obesity (23.2% and
25.3%) were all significantly higher than rates found for
typically developing peers.9

HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND OVERWEIGHT/
OBESITY IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM
DISORDER
For typically developing children, modifiable health
behaviors that relate to overweight/obesity status have
been a common target for intervention researchers.
However, the relationships between health behaviors
and overweight/obesity have not been well established
in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Physical Activity
Children with ASD seem to be at a heightened risk for
low levels of physical activity.10 Impairments in social
functioning may affect participation in group-based sports
and other socially mediated physical activities for youth
with ASD.11 In addition, children with ASD are more likely
to experience impairments in motor skills (e.g., balance,
postural stability, and gait), which further decrease their
likelihood of being physically active.12 However, findings
regarding physical activity in children between the ages of
5 and 12 years with ASD in comparison with typically
developing children have been mixed.13,14 Beyond child-
hood, few investigations include physical activity levels of
adolescents with ASD, which is unfortunate given that
adolescence marks a critical time when physical activity
levels significantly decline.15 The inconsistent findings of
physical activity levels among children and the lack of
data for adolescents with ASD suggest that additional re-
search in this area is needed.
Screen Time
Children with ASD surpass their typically developing
peers in use of “screen time” (e.g., watching television,
playing video games, and using computers).16–19 Never-
theless, studies that compare rates of screen time use rarely
investigate the nature of the association between screen
time use and obesity risk in children with ASD. Must et al17
found a significant correlation between BMI and weekend
(but not weekday) TV time in a sample of 53 children ages
3 to 11 years with ASD. However, this association has not
been replicated in larger samples, leaving no clear evidence
that the associations between screen time and obesity in
the general population are similar for children with ASD.
Mealtime Behaviors
Compared with typically developing peers, children
ages 3 to 6 years with ASD show more problematic
behaviors at mealtimes, including resisting sitting at the
dinner table and mealtime tantrums.20 Additionally,
parents report that their children with ASD (ages 3–12
yr) require greater supervision and assistance at meal-
times compared with typically developing peers.21 In
this same sample, approximately half of children with
ASD required a different meal than their family members,
and parents considered mealtimes with children with
ASD to be more stressful than with typically developing
siblings.21 However, research has yet to evaluate the
impact of ASD on the frequency of family meals eaten
together, which is a known protective factor for healthy
weight in the general population.22
Sleep
Between 50% and 80% of parents of children with
ASD indicate that their child experiences sleep prob-
lems,23–25 a rate that significantly surpasses problems
reported for typically developing children.25 Children
ages 2 to 12 years with ASD most commonly face irreg-
ular wake patterns, insomnia, and behavioral difficulties
at bedtime.23,26 Broder-Fingert et al found that sleep
disorders increased risk for obesity in children ages 2 to
20 years with ASD, which is particularly concerning as
childhood sleep problems often continue into adoles-
cence in this population.9,24 Despite the high prevalence
of sleep problems among children with ASD, descriptive
sleep research has been hindered by restricted re-
cruitment strategies, small sample sizes, and limited age
ranges.26
SUMMARY
Numerous independent studies using multiple meth-
odologies have identified children with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) as being at high risk for obesity, although
additional
prevalence estimates
are needed
to de-
finitively establish the extent of this apparently increased
risk. Additionally, previous prevalence studies have not
thoroughly investigated the risk factors for obesity in
children with ASD. Health behaviors such as sleep,
physical activity, and mealtime behaviors are well-
established predictors of obesity in typically developing
children,22,27,28 but these associations have not been
investigated concurrently in ASD populations. Therefore,
this study builds upon previous research by examining
the prevalence of overweight and obesity among chil-
dren with ASD in a nationally representative sample and
by examining how specific health behaviors (i.e., child
sleep, family meals, screen time, and physical activity)
relate to weight status in this population. Additionally,
weight status and health behaviors among children with
ASD are compared with health behaviors of typically
developing children.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Sample
Data were obtained from the National Survey of
Children’s Health (NSCH) 2011–2012. For this study,
a data use agreement was in place with the Data Re-
source Center and the Child and Adolescent Health
Measurement Initiative (DRC; CAHMI). A version of the
NSCH database with demographic information, height
and weight information, and all health behaviors was
delivered to the primary author from the DRC. The
authors were not involved in any data collection but
rather analyzed the NSCH database from the DRC and
CAHMI. To conduct the current analyses, the project was

reviewed by the primary author’s institutional review
board and approved for exemption.
The NSCH is a national telephone-based survey that
was conducted between February 2011 and June 2012,
funded by the US Department of Health and Human
Services, Health Resources and Services Administration,
and Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The 2011–2012
survey resulted in 95,677 interviews, with approximately
1850 interviews collected in each of the 50 states. The
majority (68.6%) of the respondents were mothers (bi-
ological, step, foster, or adoptive), while 24.2% were
fathers (biological, step, foster, or adoptive), and 7.2%
were other relatives or guardians.
In the NSCH, approximately 45,000 responses were
collected to represent the population of youth aged 10 to
17, including more than 900 responses for children with
an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The exact number of
responses
varied
by
question
examined,
but
the
responses were weighted to represent approximately 3.3
million children, including 690,000 children with an
ASD. Please see Table 1 for demographics information.
All children in this age range were used for the current
analyses. The sample of children with ASD was pre-
dominantly male (84.0%) and white (62.4%) followed by
Hispanic (21.3%) and black (10.2%). The remaining 6.1%
were categorized as multiracial or other. The mean age
for children with ASD was 13.1 years (SD 5 0.175).
Measures
As part of the NSCH, all data are parent report. Al-
though the entire survey contains several hundred
questions, data from the following NSCH questions were
used in the current data analysis:
1. ASD: Please tell me if a doctor or other health care
provider ever told you that (child) had autism,
Asperger’s disorder, pervasive development disor-
der, or other autism spectrum disorder, even if
he/she does not have the condition now. If yes,
does (child) currently have the condition?
2. Weight (used for BMI): How much does (child)
weigh now?
3. Height (used for BMI): How tall is (child) now?
4. Sleep: During the past week, on how many nights
did (child) get enough sleep for a child (his/her)
age? (“none”; “1–3 nights”; “4–6 nights”; “ev-
ery night”).
5. Vigorous Physical Activity: During the past week,
on how many days did (child) exercise, play a sport,
or participate in physical activity for at least
20 minutes that made (him/her) sweat and breathe
hard? (“0 d”; “1–3 d”; “4–6 d”; “everyday”).
6. Family Meals: During the past week, on how many
days did all family members who live in the house-
hold eat a meal together? (“none”; “1–3 d”; “4–6 d”;
“everyday”).
7. Time spent watching TV, videos, or playing games:
On an average weekday, how much time does
(child) spend in front of a TV watching TV pro-
grams, videos, or playing video games? (“none”; “1
hr or less”; “more than 1 hr but less than 4 hr”; “4 hr
or more”).
8. Time spent with computers, cell phones, handheld
video games, and other electronic devices: On an
average weekday, how much time does (child)
spend with computers, cell phones, handheld video
games, and other electronic devices, doing things
other than schoolwork? (“does not use electronic
devices”; “uses devices 1 hr a day or less”; “uses
devices more than 1 hr but less than 4 per day”;
“uses
devices
more
than
4
hr
per
average
weekday”).
9. Screen in bedroom: Does (child) have a TV, com-
puter, or access to electronic devices in (his/her)
bedroom? (“yes” or “no”).
Procedures
For the NSCH, participants were recruited using
a cross-sectional list-assisted random digit dial (RDD)

sample of landline telephone numbers, supplemented
with an independent RDD sample of cell phone num-
bers, from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the
US Virgin Islands. Households with at least 1 child be-
tween 0 and 17 years met study inclusion criteria. Data
collection was completed through phone interviews in
English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, and
Korean. Families unable to complete the survey in one of
these languages were excluded. Interviewers gathered
ages of all children in the home, and 1 child was ran-
domly selected to be the subject of the interview. The
adult in the household with the most knowledge of the
child’s health and health care was asked to complete the
interview. Participants were incentivized with a prepaid
incentive of $1 with a promised incentive of up to an
additional $10 to $11 for landline households and up to
$15 for cell phone households for interview completion.
The NSCH interview completion rate was 54.1% for the
landline sample and 41.2% for the cell phone sample
(Average interview length: 33–34 min).
Data Analyses
For this study, children ages 10 to 17 were selected
for the analyses because BMI data were only available for
this age range and it is a primary outcome variable.
Analyses were conducted comparing children with an
ASD diagnosis to those whose parents did not endorse an
ASD diagnosis (comparison group) on rates of weight
status and health behaviors. The children from the NSCH
sample were (by design) nationally representative of the
population of youth in the country. Thus, the non-ASD
comparison group closely matches the demographics of
children aged 10 to 17 in the United States. The sample
of youth with ASD is smaller but is also fairly represen-
tative of youth aged 10 to 17 in the United States who
have ASD (in that there are more boys represented).
Given the nationally representative nature of the data and
the fact that a primary outcome was BMI percentile
(which controls for age and gender), we did not control
for demographic variables. Additional analyses were con-
ducted among the children ages 10 to 17 years with an
ASD diagnosis to health behaviors between normal
weight, overweight, and obese weight status in children
with ASD. Because the survey used a complex sampling
technique to collect data representative of the population
of interest, many traditional statistics programs were in-
appropriate due to their inability to incorporate the
complex sample design and weights. Weighted data were
used for all analyses, using weights determined by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that
the results are representative of the population of children
in the United States at the time of the survey. To preserve
this characteristic of the data, all analyses were conducted
using AM Statistical Software (Beta Version 0.06.04; The
American Institutes for Research and Jon Cohen, 2011).
The AM Statistical Software was chosen because it is the
only freely available software program that appropriately
handles complex samples. The AM Statistical Software
does not provide odds ratios but instead provides adjusted
Wald tests as the method for determining significance.
To address the relationship between ASD and weight
status, prevalence rates of weight categories and hy-
pothesis testing between children with ASD and children
without ASD were presented first. Specifically, rates of
normal weight, overweight, and obesity were presented
for children with ASD and children without ASD; hy-
pothesis testing between these 2 groups was conducted
by bivariate logistic regression, and the Wald test was
used to determine statistical significance. To address the
relationship of ASD to health behaviors, prevalence rates
of health behaviors (physical activity, sleep, screen time,
and family meals) among children with and without ASD
were presented next. These rates are followed by the
Wald test results from bivariate logistic regressions be-
tween children with ASD and children without ASD.
Rates of weight category, health behaviors, and test sta-
tistics were presented in Table 1. The final set of analyses
was limited to the sample of children with ASD. For
these analyses, weight category (normal, overweight, or
obese) was set as the independent variable and the
specific health behaviors were set as dependent varia-
bles. Bivariate logistic regressions were conducted for
these analyses, with membership in the specific weight
group being the independent variable. Results including
the Wald test statistics are presented in Table 2. Because
the Wald tests indicated a significant relationship be-
tween weight group and the dependent variable but did
not specify which relationship was significant, post hoc
analyses using each categorical weight group as the in-
dependent variable were also conducted (Table 3).
RESULTS
Prevalence of Overweight/Obesity
Seventeen percent of children with a current autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis were considered
overweight compared with 15.6% of children not cur-
rently diagnosed with ASD; this difference was not sig-
nificant (Wald 5 0.48, p 5 .49). However, children with
ASD were significantly more likely to be obese than
children without ASD (Wald 5 8.00, p , .01). For chil-
dren with ASD, 23.9% were considered obese compared
with 15.5% of children without ASD. Additionally, chil-
dren with ASD (53.3%) were less likely to be of normal
weight (between the fifth and 85th percentile) than
children without ASD (63.1%; Wald 5 7.86, p , .01).
Physical Activity
Children with ASD were more likely than typically
developing children to have zero days a week during
which they engaged in at least 20 minutes of vigorous
activity (Wald 5 10.85, p 5 .001). Vigorous activity was
defined as having exercised, played a sport, or partici-
pated in physical activity to the level of sweating and
breathing hard. Children with ASD were also less likely
than typically developing peers to get 4 to 6 days of

vigorous activity in a given week (Wald 5 8.08, p 5
.005). However, children with and without ASD did not
differ on the likelihood of engaging in vigorous activity 1
to 3 days a week (Wald 5 0.99, p 5 .32) or everyday
(Wald 5 0.75, p 5 .39). Among children with ASD, those
reported to be overweight or obese did not differ from
normal weight peers with ASD on days of engaging in
vigorous activity.
Sleep
Children with ASD did not differ from typically de-
veloping peers in their sleep using the number of nights
of adequate sleep as the independent variables. Among
children with ASD, those who were reported to be
overweight did not differ from those reported to be
normal weight on the likelihood of getting adequate
sleep. However, children who were obese differed from
children of normal weight on likelihood of getting ade-
quate sleep 1 to 3 nights per week (Wald 5 3.21, p ,
.01). No other differences were seen in number of nights
of sleep per week across BMI groups.
Screen Time
Children with ASD only differed from children with-
out ASD on the likelihood of never using electronic
devices. No differences were seen in hours of television
viewing or other categories of screen time, electronic
device usage, or the likelihood of having a television in
their rooms.
For children with ASD, no differences on television
viewing were found between children who were
reported to be normal weight, overweight, and obese.
Differences were observed in electronics usage. Children
who were reported to be overweight were less likely to
never use electronic devices (Wald 5 22.32, p 5 .02),
and more likely to use electronic devices 4 hours or
more per day (Wald 5 2.30, p 5 .02) than their normal
weight peers. However, these differences were not
found for children who were reported to be obese.
Children who were reported to be overweight or obese
did not differ from those of normal weight on having
a television in their room (Wald 5 0.26, p 5 .80; Wald 5
0.67, p 5 .50, respectively).
Family Meals
Children with ASD did not differ from children with-
out ASD on the likelihood of eating a meal with all family
members in terms of nights per week. Few differences
on family meal eating were found between children with
ASD who were normal weight, overweight, or obese.
Children with ASD did not differ on the likelihood of
eating a meal with all family members 0 nights per week,
4 to 6 nights per week, or every night of the week re-
gardless of whether they were normal weight, over-
weight, or obese. Children with ASD who were obese
were less likely than those of normal weight to eat meals
with their entire family 1 to 3 days per week (Wald 5
14.92, p , .01) although children with ASD who were
overweight were not (Wald 5 0.87, p 5 .35).
DISCUSSION
Consistent with other recent estimates, approxi-
mately 40% of children with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) were either overweight or obese in this nationally
representative sample of children.5,6,8,9 Notably, chil-
dren with ASD in this sample were significantly more

likely to be obese than their typically developing peers,
which has not previously been well established in other
large survey-based studies. Curtin et al7 used data from
the 2003–2004 National Survey of Children’s Health
(NSCH) and did not find this significant difference, sug-
gesting that our findings in the comparable 2011–2012
survey represent a worrisome increase in obesity prev-
alence for children with ASD that is over and above the
increasing prevalence for typical children. These rates
further underscore the need for better understanding of
what health behaviors contribute to obesity in children
with ASD. To that end, children with ASD were more
likely to engage in no vigorous physical activity than
their typically developing peers and less likely to engage
in vigorous activity 4 to 6 days per week, but the weekly
rates of vigorous physical activity were not universally
lower for children with ASD. Interestingly, among
children with ASD, there was no difference in physical
activity across weight statuses. These findings suggest
that additional study is needed to better understand the
relationship between vigorous physical activity and
weight status in children with ASD.
Children with ASD in this sample did not differ from
typically developing children regarding number of nights
per week with parent-reported perception of adequate
sleep, which seemingly contradicts the evidence for in-
creased sleep problems in this population.25 This finding
may reflect the nonspecific category of adequate sleep
used in this study, which may not have been sensitive
enough to capture the bedtime and sleep problems often
characteristic of children with ASD. Additionally, it may
reflect the fact that parents often underestimate how
much sleep children need. However, among children
with ASD in this sample, those who were obese were

significantly more likely to receive only 1 to 3 nights per
week of adequate sleep. Additional investigation is
critical to determine the nature of this relationship and
whether interventions for children with ASD and sleep
problems yield secondary effects on obesity. Similarly,
interventions addressing obesity in children with ASD
may well have positive effects on sleep problems, given
known associations between obesity and problems like
sleep apnea.29
We did not find differences in television habits be-
tween children with ASD and typically developing
children, which is in contrast with previous studies.16,19
This may reflect the combined category (TV, video, and
video games) used in the NSCH study. Among children
with ASD, those who were overweight or obese had no
differences in screen time use as compared with chil-
dren of normal weight, failing to replicate the partial
finding from Must et al.17 Electronics were equally likely
to be in the bedrooms of children with and without
ASD, and there were no differences associated with
weight status for children with ASD. The only signifi-
cant difference found regarding screen time use sug-
gests that children with ASD are significantly more
likely to never use computers, cell phones, and other
electronics; this may reflect the more narrow prefer-
ences characteristic of ASD, as well as the language and
cognitive demands associated with these screen time
activities.
Finally, there were minimal differences in the number
of evenings that families ate meals together. There were
no differences between children with ASD and typically
developing children in frequency of family meals. Chil-
dren with ASD and obesity were less likely to eat meals
with their families 1 to 3 nights per week compared with
children with ASD and normal weight status. Although
mealtime behavior problems have been frequently noted
in the literature,20,21 the examination of frequency of
family meals is a novel contribution. It is possible that
these are 2 very different constructs, and even when
eating together, significant behavior problems may lead
to stress and shorter mealtimes.
A number of factors qualify the interpretation of these
results. Although the nationally representative nature of
this sample is a notable strength, there are clear limi-
tations to data derived solely from parent report rather
than through multiple sources and direct measurement
strategies as well as data obtained through an existing
data set. Specifically, there are known limitations asso-
ciated with parent-reported heights and weights in that
they often end up underestimating child BMI in older
children and adolescents.30 Severity of ASD was not
available within this data set, which may be an important
covariate in many of the analyses that were conducted.
The categorical nature of the NSCH survey makes data
analysis (consisting solely of logistic regression) some-
what cumbersome, and the categories themselves limit
the interpretability of our findings. Also, the 2011–2012
NSCH sample only included BMI data for children aged
10 to 17 years, so these findings should be interpreted
cautiously for children outside this age range. The
questions themselves (e.g., sleep being defined as do
parents perceive their child as getting sufficient sleep)
limit generalizations that can be made from the analyses.
Finally, use of psychotropic medication was not available
in the NSCH survey. Psychotropic medication is associ-
ated with weight gain among adolescents with ASD17
and may interact with the associations between health
behaviors (e.g., sleep, eating, physical activity, and
screen time) and obesity.
CONCLUSIONS
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are
significantly more likely to be obese than their typically
developing peers; however, we do not have a clear un-
derstanding of the contributing factors. Screen time,
frequency of family meals, and sleep patterns as assessed
in this survey were not reliably different between chil-
dren with and without ASD and did not differentiate
between weight statuses among children with ASD.
Children with ASD were more likely to be sedentary (i.e.,
have reported zero days of vigorous physical activity per
week) and less likely to have 4 to 6 days per week of
vigorous activity than their typically developing peers,
suggesting overall less physical activity. Although the
physical, social, motivational, and logistical barriers for
increasing
physical
activity
in
children
with
de-
velopmental disabilities are substantial,1 these results
suggest that physical activity among children with ASD
should be prioritized as a potential intervention strategy.
More research on factors contributing to obesity in
children with ASD is needed, and empirical inves-
tigations informed by this research must test the impact
of
targeted
health
behavior
interventions
in
this
population.
