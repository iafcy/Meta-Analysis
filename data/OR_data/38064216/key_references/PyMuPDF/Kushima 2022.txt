IMPORTANCE It is unclear to what extent the duration of screen time in infancy is associated
with the subsequent diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between screen time in infancy and the development
of autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed data from mother-child
dyads in a large birth cohort in Japan. This study included children born to women recruited
between January 2011 and March 2014, and data were analyzed in December 2020. The
study was conducted by the Japan Environment and Children’s Study Group in collaboration
with 15 regional centers across Japan.
EXPOSURES Screen time at 1 year of age.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome variable, children diagnosed with autism
spectrum disorder at 3 years of age, was assessed using a questionnaire administered to
mothers of the participating children.
RESULTS A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. The prevalence of children
with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age was 392 per 100 000 (0.4%), and boys were
3 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than were girls.
Logistic regression analysis showed that among boys, when “no screen” was the reference,
the adjusted odds ratios were as follows: less than 1 hour, odds ratio, 1.38 (95 % CI, 0.71-2.69;
P = .35), 1 hour to less than 2 hours, odds ratio, 2.16 (95 % CI, 1.13-4.14; P = .02), 2 hours to
less than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.48 (95% CI, 1.83-6.65; P < .001), and more than 4 hours, odds
ratio, 3.02 (95% CI, 1.44-6.34; P = .04). Among girls, however, there was no association
between autism spectrum disorder and screen time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among boys, longer screen time at 1 year of age was
significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age. With the rapid
increase in device usage, it is necessary to review the health effects of screen time on infants
and to control excessive screen time.

A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested to
be associated with congenital factors, such as ge-
nomic mutations1-4 and prenatal, perinatal, and neo-
natal risk factors.5-7 In addition, abnormalities in brain mor-
phologyandfunctionhavebeenobservedinchildrenwithASD
since early childhood.8,9 In studies conducted in 2019 and
2020, it has been reported that as a postnatal environmental
factor, duration of screen time may be associated with ASD
characteristics10,11 and brain morphology specific to ASD.12
Thus, screen time during infancy, a period of rapid develop-
ment, may be one of the acquired factors that may be associ-
ated with ASD.
In 2019, the World Health Organization published guide-
linesonhealthyphysicalactivity,sedentarybehavior,andsleep
in children younger than 5 years of age, stating that children
should not be exposed to screens at 1 year of age or younger.13
The American Academy of Pediatrics has also recommended
that children should not be exposed to screens until they are
18 months of age; warnings about the adverse effects of screen
exposure on the health of children have been issued.
In Japan, the most frequent age at diagnosis for ASD is 3.0
years.14 However, there are few large cohort studies that have
focusedonprolongedscreenexposureandASDininfancy.Fur-
thermore, amid the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, there has been a rapid change in lifestyles, with
electronic devices being used as the main channels of com-
munication and social interactions; thus, screen time among
children has increased worldwide.15-17 Amid this social cli-
mate, examining the associations of screen exposure with a
child’s health is an important public health issue.
Therefore, this study aimed to examine the association of
screen exposure (an environmental factor) with the develop-
ment of ASD during early childhood. To achieve this objec-
tive,weexaminedtheassociationbetweenscreentimeat1year
of age and the presence or absence of ASD diagnosis at 3 years
of age based on parental responses using data derived from a
large Japanese birth cohort study (the Japan Environment and
Children’s Study).
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a large birth cohort study in Japan. The Japan
Environment and Children’s Study Group operated in collabo-
ration with 15 regional centers across Japan. Its protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Ministry of the Environment’s
InstitutionalReviewBoardonEpidemiologicalStudiesandthe
ethics committees of all the participating institutions. Ap-
proximately 100 000 pregnant women were recruited to par-
ticipate in the study, and all of the participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.18 The research was conducted in
accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health
Research Involving Human Subjects established by the Min-
istry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The recruit-
mentperiodwasfromJanuary2011toMarch2014,andthedata
were analyzed during December 2020. The data used were de-
rived from the strictly controlled jecs-ta-20190930-qsn data
set, which was released in October 2019. The target popula-
tion was selected as follows: first, the study included 100 304
live births of the 104 062 fetal records. Consequently, 382 still-
births and 1254 miscarriages were excluded. We also ex-
cluded 2122 individuals with missing data once we calcu-
latedlivebirths,stillbirths,andmiscarriages.Next,weexcluded
6449 children with cerebral palsy, a congenital condition, at 1
year of age, which may have influenced screen time. We also
excluded 9825 children with missing data once we calculated
congenital diseases or cerebral palsy. Finally, 84 030 mother-
child dyads were included in the analysis (Figure).
Variables
The main exposure variable was screen time at 1 year of age,
which was assessed using a questionnaire. When their child
turned 1 year of age, the mothers were asked about the num-
ber of hours spent per day they let the child watch TV or DVDs.
The responses were collected as variables and categorized as,
“none (no screen time),” “less than 1 hour,” “1 hour or more
but less than 2 hours,” “2 hours or more but less than 4 hours,”
and “4 hours or more.” When the participating child turned 3
years of age, we asked mothers the same question. The out-
comevariable,ASDat3yearsofage,wasassessedusingaques-
tionnaire. Specifically, mothers were asked the following ques-
tion when their child turned 3 years of age: “Have they ever

Key Points
Question Is screen-time duration in children at 1 year of age
associated with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age?
Findings A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed
using data derived from a large birth cohort study conducted in
Japan. Among boys, but not girls, longer screen time at 1 year of
age was significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder
diagnosis at 3 years of age.
Meaning Guidance on appropriate screen time in infancy is
recommended.

pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger’s syndrome) by
a doctor from the age of 2 years until now?” An option of 2 re-
sponses was provided, namely, with and without ASD, which
were labeled as “yes (ASD)” or “no (no ASD),” respectively.

when examining the association between ASD at 3 years of age
and screen time at 1 year of age, we considered that predisposi-

study, and all of its 5 items were used as adjustment variables.
Each adjustment variable is described below. The Japa-
nese version of the K6 scale was used to assess depressive
tendencies,24 and the cutoff value was set at 5 points or more
(Japanese version).25 A score above the cutoff value of K6 (≥5
points) indicated poor mental health. The Japanese version of
the Bonding Scale was used to assess mother-child attach-
ment. The scale consists of 10 questions and can yield a maxi-
mum score of 30 points; higher scores indicate more negative
feelings toward one’s baby.26 However, no clear cutoff value
was assigned for this scale; therefore, it was treated as a con-
tinuousvariable.Asyoungermothersareatriskofabuse,acut-
offvalueof19yearsoryoungeratthetimeofdeliverywasused.
Because poverty is also a risk factor for abuse, the poverty line
reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (an-
nual household income ≤¥ 1.27 million [$11 060.41 USD) was
used as the standard,27 and the lowest income item (<¥ 2 mil-
lion [$17 417.96 USD]) was used as the cutoff value for re-
sponses related to annual household income. The calculation
of the poverty line reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare is based on the standards of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development standards. For the
5 ASQ-3 items, we used the cutoff values specified for the Japa-
nese version.28Additionally, because there are sex differ-
ences in ASD,1,29 sex was used as a stratification variable to ex-
amine sex differences in the results.
Statistical Analysis
First, we aggregated the key variables by screen time at 1 year
of age and at 3 years of age, and examined their attributes.
Thereafter, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated to
examine the association between screen time and ASD. In ad-
dition,becausesexdifferenceshavebeenreportedinthepreva-
lenceofASD,weexaminedtheinteractionbysexandthencon-

model, the categorical variable (screen time) was statistically
examined as an ordinal variable (continuous variable). Jonck-
heere-Terpstra tests were conducted to examine the associa-
tion between screen time at 1 year of age and 3 years of age.
The statistical significance level was set at .05 and 2-tailed.
SPSS, version 27 (IBM), was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Aggregate Proportions of ASD at 3 Years of Age
to Screen Time at 1 Year
A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. In 330
(0.4%) of the 84 030 children included in the analysis, ASD had
been diagnosed at 3 years of age (Table 1). Of these, 251 were
boys (76.0%) and 79 were girls (24.0%) (eTable 4 in Supple-
ment 1). There were 83 237 responses for screen time at 1 year
of age and 74 554 responses for screen time at 3 years of
age (Table 1). Irrespective of whether the child had ASD at 3
years of age, at the age 1 year, less than 1 hour was the most
commonly provided response for daily screen time (Table 1).
The proportion of children with ASD increased as screen time
increased (Table 1). The attributes of children and
mothers by screen time are shown in Table 1 and eTable 3 in
Supplement 1.
Association Between Screen Time at 1 Year
and ASD at 3 Years of Age
Logistic regression analysis of the association between screen
time at 1 year and ASD at 3 years of age is shown in Table 2.
Longer screen time at 1 year of age was associated with the sta-
tistically significantly higher odds of ASD at 3 years of age. Fur-
thermore, the longer screen time at 1 year of age was associ-
ated with the statistically significantly higher odds of ASD at
3 years of age in boys. The distribution of screen time was simi-
lar across the sexes (Table 1). However, among girls, no asso-
ciation between screen time and ASD was found.
Association Between Screen Time at 3 Years
and ASD at 3 Years of Age
The results of the trend test between screen time at 1 year of
age and at 3 years of age showed that screen time at 1 year of
age was statistically significantly associated with screen time
at 3 years of age (Table 3). Namely, as the screen time in-
creased, the proportion of children with ASD at 3 years of age
also increased (Table 2). Moreover, logistic regression analy-
sis reported that screen time at 3 years of age was not associ-
ated with ASD at 3 years of age (Table 3).

time at 1 year of age and ASD at 3 years of age, irrespective of
potential maternal maltreatment or predisposition to ASD at
1yearofage.Inthisstudy,theprevalenceofASDamong3-year-
old children was 0.4%, which is slightly lower than the preva-
lence of ASD among children younger than 5 years in Asia
(0.70%).30,31 However, given that the prevalence of ASD in-
creases with age, this study’s finding is comparable with those
of previous studies. In addition, the sex ratio of children with
ASD in this study is consistent with what has been observed
in previous studies conducted in Japan and abroad.14,32,33 In
Japan, parents who are concerned about their child having a
developmental disability often visit medical institutions di-
rectly to receive a diagnosis. They could also receive a diag-
nosis after being advised to visit a medical institution for a pos-
sible developmental disability by an infant health checkup
(conducted at 4 months, 1 ½ years, and 3 years of age), nurs-
ery school, kindergarten, or elementary school. Medical insti-
tutions make a diagnosis of ASD based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition).
Despite the World Health Organization and the American
Academy of Pediatrics recommendations,13 90% of the chil-
dren in this study had been exposed to screens at 1 year of age.
Few studies on screen time at 1 year of age have been re-
ported in other countries. According to a survey conducted by
the Cabinet Office in Japan, 85.7% of children younger than 1
year and 75.7% of 1-year-old children were using mobile
phones, and many of them shared mobile phones with their
parents.34 Thus, at 1 year of age, child-rearing environments
may be associated with the development of ASD.
Multivariable analysis of the association between ASD and
screen time was conducted to account for the influence of ma-
ternal maltreatment and children’s predisposition on the re-
sult. Among boys, irrespective of their predisposition to ASD
at 1 year of age and maternal maltreatment factors, a longer
screen time at 1 year of age was associated with ASD at 3 years
of age.
In this study, we used the ASQ-3, which has a reported ASD
diagnostic accuracy of more than 80%, to adjust for the pre-
disposition of ASD at 1 year of age. However, the diagnostic cri-
teria for ASD include, “Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory in-
put or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment”
and a strong response to visual information such as lights or
movement.35 This screening is limited because it does not fully
reflect the characteristics of ASD. Therefore, we cannot deny
the possibility of reverse causality. However, even in that case,
screen time can be an effective indicator of ASD during early
screening. In addition, this study examined the association be-
tween screen time at 1 year of age and ASD by excluding chil-
dren who received a red flag on any of the 5 ASQ-3 items at 1
year of age (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), thereby helping the ar-
gument that screen time is a risk factor for the development
of ASD.
The results of previous studies that have investigated the
association between screen time and ASD in cross-sectional
studies are not consistent.32,36-38 In this study, we examined
the association between ASD at 3 years of age, at a single point
in time, and screen time at the same age. The results showed
no association between screen time and ASD at 3 years of age.

Thismayhavebeenduetothesmallsizeofthereferencegroup;
therefore, we set the reference group as less than 1 hour and
conducted an additional analysis (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).
Consequently, we found that there is a statistically signifi-
cant difference between boys reported to have 2 to less than
4 hours of screen time. However, the results of the estimates
were close to the reference values before they were changed.
This indicates that the association of screen time at 1 year of
age with ASD diagnosis is still greater than at 3 years of age.
This may be because the association with environmental fac-
tors on brain development varies with age.
In addition to genetic factors, the role of environmental
factorshasbeennotedinASD.Electromagneticfieldshavebeen
cited as an environmental factor associated with health and
screen exposure.39 Experiments using mice have demon-
stratedthatexposuretohigh-frequencyelectromagneticfields
affects neurotransmitters40 and behavior (hyperactivity and
memory impairment)41 in mice during the developmental pe-
riod. Additionally, several molecular networks as genetic fac-
tors have been associated with the development of ASD, and
the core of these molecular networks include α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA

1 (RAP1), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), extracellular signal-
regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), methyl-CpG-binding protein 2
(MECP2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), activa-
tor protein 1 (AP-1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
and ras protein/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/
MAPK).Previousstudieshavereportedthatlow-frequencyand
high-frequency electrical stimulation, microwave irradia-
tion, and light stimulation of AMPA receptors,42 Rfn2,43
GABA,44 MECP2,45 and BDNF1,46-48 are associated with au-
tismlike symptoms. In particular, in infancy when neurode-
velopment is active, environmental factors such as electrical
stimulation through screens and light stimulation from vi-
sion may affect neurodevelopment and de novo sequence al-
terations.
In this study, we examined the interaction by sex and then
conducted a sex-differentiated analysis. The results sug-
gested an association between screen time and ASD only in
boys, even if boys and girls have similar screen times (eTable 4
in Supplement 1). This result could be due to the higher preva-
lence of the disorder in boys. Previous studies on the genetic
factors that contribute to the development of ASD have not yet
explained the male predominance in ASD.1 However, among
the factors listed as the core genes responsible for the devel-
opment of ASD, sex differences have been reported for brain-
derived neurotrophic factor49,50 and MECP2.51 Thus, genetic
factors may be involved in the observed sex differences in the
association between ASD and screen time.
Strengths and Limitations
The strength of this study is that it provides new insights into
the association of screen time with the onset of ASD in early
childhood, which had not yet been examined. Furthermore,
the results of this study are reliable because the analysis was
conducted using a large birth cohort data set representative of
the Japanese population.52
A limitation of this study is that ASD (outcome) and screen
time(exposure)wereassessedbasedonparentalreports,which
may have led to reporting bias. Data on the exact amount of
time children are gazing at the screen are not available, and it
may differ from what parents report. Medical institutions di-
agnose ASD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) but only when ASD can be di-
agnosed with certainty because it is still in a developmental
stage when children are 3 years of age. Therefore, mild cases
may not be diagnosed as ASD at 3 years of age, when the child
is at a developmental stage, and may be observed in subse-
quent years. As a result, the study may be biased toward chil-
dren with severe ASD. To account for potential risks, we con-
ducted a multivariable analysis with ASD predisposition
(ASQ-3) at 1 year of age. Additionally, external (eg, prenatal, liv-
ing, and childcare environment) and internal factors (eg, ge-
netic factors, diseases, and disabilities) other than screen time,
which were examined as exposure factors in this study, were
not adequately considered. Therefore, this study conducted
a sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding as an addi-
tional analysis (the E-value),53-57 and it was found that the ef-
fect of residual confounding remained (eTable 5 in Supple-
ment 1). Further research is needed to examine other factors
involved in the association between ASD and screen time, and
the combination of factors at a given time of the year associ-
ated with increased risk of ASD.
Conclusions
In this cohort study, even after accounting for predisposition
to ASD at 1 year of age and maternal maltreatment factors, lon-
ger screen time at 1 year of age was associated with ASD at 3
years of age in boys. With the rapid increase in the use of de-
vices, it is necessary to review its health effects on infants and
control excessive screen time.
