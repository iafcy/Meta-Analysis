Background: High prevalence of sleep problems have been founded in
children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with rates ranging from 50 to
80%. We aimed to study the sleep status and the occurrence of sleep problems
in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 1–3 years, and to provide
reference for guiding early comprehensive intervention for ASD children from
the perspective of sleep.
Methods: From January 1 to December 31, 2021, 74 ASD children who met the
diagnostic criteria of “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5
(DSM-V)” served as case group while 84 typically-developing children of the
same sex and age served as control group. An original Children’s Sleep Habit
Questionnaire was adopted to compare the sleep status of children in the two
groups and to conduct statistical analysis on related factors.
Results:
The incidence of sleep problems in the case group (78.4%) was
signiﬁcantly higher than that in the control group (34.5%) (P < 0.001).
Compared with the children in the control group, children in the case group
had later bedtime (P < 0.05) and less sleep duration (P < 0.05), and required
longer time to fall asleep (P < 0.001) The incidence of sleep problems
in children who could fall asleep autonomously in the case group was
signiﬁcantly lower than that in children who needed parental help (P < 0.05). In
the case group, the longer the screen exposure time, the higher the incidence
of sleep problems (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: The incidence of sleep problems in ASD children aged 1–3 years
is also high, mainly manifested in late bedtime, diﬃculty falling asleep, frequent
night awakenings and less sleep duration. Both sleep patterns and screen
exposure can impact their sleep. In the early comprehensive intervention of
ASD children, it is necessary to pay full heed to their sleep status and take
timely intervention measures in order to improve the quality of life for the ASD
children and their families.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic, lifelong
neurodevelopmental disability characterized by impairments
in social communication, restricted interests or activities, and
repetitive behaviors (1). In the last decade, the prevalence rate of
ASD has showed a sharp rise (2). The prevalence rate announced
in the United States in 2006 was 0.9%, and the reported
prevalence rate in 2020 has reached 1.8% (3). In China, the
prevalence rate has rose from 0.35% in 2018 (4) to 0.7% in 2020
(5). This may be due to the advances in our understanding of
the etiology of autism and the improved diagnostic techniques.
ASD is a life-long disorder that has major implications for
the quality of life of the individual with ASD as well as the
families, resulting in a tremendous responsibility on the part
of the public health and education systems. The comorbidity
of ASD, such as sleep problems, gastrointestinal problems,
and attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, has attracted more
and more attention (6, 7). Studies have reported that the
incidence of sleep problems in ASD children is 50–80% (8–
10), much higher than the 29–50% reported in typically-
developing children with normal development (11, 12). Sleep
as an important physiological function impacts many aspects
of early childhood development (13). For ASD children, sleep
problems not only exacerbate certain core symptoms, such as
restricted and repetitive behaviors and problematic behaviors,
but may also aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of rehabilitation training
(14–16). Previous studies have found that the sleep problems in
ASD children are age-speciﬁc (12). But these research reports
both at home and abroad aim at all preschool children and
school-age children (17, 18). At present, the sleep status of ASD
children aged 1–3 years has not been reported at home and
abroad, and the impact of sleep problems on infants is far greater
than that of children or adults. During the infant period, sleep
occupies most of the time in their life. Good sleep not only
contributes to the maturation of the central nervous system and
the formation of the overall function of the infant, but also has
an important inﬂuence on the formation of physical, cognitive,
neuromotor and temperament development (19). Therefore,
this study ﬁnds out the sleep characteristics of ASD children aged
1–3 years by analyzing the occurrence of sleep problems and
sleep status, and provides a reference for early comprehensive
intervention and improvement of their quality of life.

sample size required for each group was 57 in each centers
through calculation.
Original children’s sleep habit
questionnaire
As Children’s Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) is mainly
used to assess the sleep status of children aged 4–10 (23,
24), its factor structure is not applicable for young children.
Therefore, an original Children’s Sleep Habit Questionnaire was
used in this research based on to the sleep characteristics of
children aged 1–3 years, which mainly included: children’s basic
information, general family information, children’s bedtime,

sleep latency, sleep duration at night, sleep duration in the day
time, sleep patterns, diﬃculty falling asleep, night awakening,
parasomnia (such as sleepwalking, teeth grinding), sleep-
disordered breathing (such as snoring, dyspnea during sleep)
and sleep behavior, etc. This original Children’s Sleep Habit
Questionnaire was reviewed and validated by several rounds of
focus group interviews of experts in the relevant ﬁeld of child
health care. It was done in Mandarin Chinese. The language
validation was checked, reviewed and revised by the experts
during the focus group interviews in terms of its readability
and understandability. This questionnaire should be ﬁlled in
by parents based on their children’s sleep status in the last
month. The sleep problems is deﬁned as children with diﬃculties
in falling asleep, frequent night awakening (more than once a
night), sleep-disordered breathing, parasomnia at least 3 times
a week for at least one month according to the common
sleep problems of ASD children and the sleep characteristics of
healthy children aged 1–3 years.
Quality control
The questionnaire and informed consent are issued by
professionals who have undergone uniﬁed training, and the
content and precautions of the scales are explained by use
of uniﬁed guidelines. The questionnaire should be ﬁlled out
by the primary caregiver of the child. After the completion
of the ﬁlling, it is reviewed by professionals for on-site
supplement or correction of any omission, unclear information,
and incorrect ﬁlling.
Statistical analysis
The SPSS26.0 statistical software was used to analyze the
data. The experimental data of this study were qualitative,
expressed as percentages (%). Comparison between groups
was performed by sample Chi-square test. Trend comparison
of bedtime was performed by The Mann—Whitney test. The
diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant with P < 0.05.
Results
Overview of the research subjects
A total of 74 children (62 males, 12 females; mean age 30.62
± 4.43 months) with a diagnosis of ASD and 84 healthy controls
(65 males, 18 females; mean age of 30.90 ± 4.49 months) of the
same age and sex were enrolled. No statistical signiﬁcance in age
and sex ratio existed between the two groups of children (P >
0.05), indicating comparability (Table 1).

Comparison of the incidence of sleep
problems between the case group and
the control group
The incidence of sleep problems in the case group was 78.4%,
signiﬁcantly higher than that in the control group (34.5%) (P
< 0.001). The incidence of diﬃculty falling asleep (48.6%) was
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the control group (22.6%) (P =
0.001), and the incidence of frequent night awakenings (24.2%)
was also obviously higher than that of the control group (9.5%)
(P < 0.05). No statistical signiﬁcance in the incidence of sleep-
disordered breathing and parasomnia existed between the two
groups (P > 0.05) (Table 2).
Comparison of sleep status between case
group and control group
Statistical signiﬁcance in the distribution of bedtime existed
between the two groups, and the trend of bedtime was also
statistically diﬀerent (P < 0.001), indicating that the time for
children to go to bed at night in the case group was obviously
later than that in the control group. Compared with the control
group, the children in the case group took signiﬁcantly longer
time to fall asleep (P < 0.001), and the sleep duration at night
was less than that in the control group (P < 0.05). No statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in awakening time in the morning and
sleep duration in the daytime existed between the two groups
(P > 0.05) (Table 3).

Comparison of the incidence of sleep
problems between the two groups of
children under diﬀerent sleep behaviors
and screen exposure
For the sleep pattern, the proportion of children who could
fall asleep autonomously in the case group was signiﬁcantly
lower than that of the children in the control group, and the
diﬀerence between the two groups had statistical signiﬁcance (P
= 0.001). In the control group, the incidence of sleep problems
in children who could fall asleep autonomously was signiﬁcantly
lower than that in children who needed parental help (such as
breastfeeding, hugging) (P < 0.05). The inﬂuence of whether the
patient could fall asleep autonomously on the sleep problem was
more signiﬁcant in the case group than in the control group, and
the diﬀerence had statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.001) (Tables 4,
5).
There was no statistical diﬀerence in the duration of screen
exposure time existed between the case and the control groups
(P > 0.05). In the case group, the longer the screen exposure
time, the higher the incidence of sleep problems (P < 0.05), while
the children in the control group had no statistical diﬀerence
in the duration of screen exposure and the occurrence of sleep
problems (P > 0.05) (Tables 4, 5).
There was no statistical diﬀerence in the duration of parent-
child interaction between the case group and the control group,
also no statistical in the duration of parent-child interaction
and the occurrence of sleep problems in each group (P > 0.05)
(Tables 4, 5).
Discussion
Children with ASD are extremely vulnerable to sleep
problems due to underlying biological and behavioral rhythms

that predispose them to extrinsic and intrinsic stressors that
aﬀect sleep (25). Sleep disorders may adversely aﬀect children’s
daily function, thus aﬀecting behavior, learning, memory
regulation and cognition (26), and may also cause emotional
problems such as aggression, irritability, over-reactivity and
depression (27). Other studies have found that core symptoms
also aﬀect sleep, such as communication diﬃculties may
exacerbate sleep disorders (28). All these problems not only
reduce the quality of life, but also inﬂuence the eﬀect of
intervention. These connections all illustrate the severity of
sleep problems in ASD. There is growing evidence that ASD
is associated with arousal dysregulation and sensory hyper-
reactivity, and calming strategies may be helpful in improving
sleep (29).
Occurrence of sleep problems in ASD
children aged 1–3 years
Researches
have
shown
that
children
with
neurodevelopmental
disorders
are
more
susceptible
to
sleep problems (30, 31), and ASD children have the highest
incidence of 50–80% (8, 9). In this research, the incidence of
sleep problems in the ASD children was 78.4%, signiﬁcantly
higher than that in the control group (34.5%), which was
consistent with the conclusion given by Inthikoot N, et al.
who found that the incidence of sleep problems in school-aged
children with ASD was higher than that in typically-developing
children (32). It was also higher than the incidence (67.4%) of
sleep problems in ASD children aged 2–7 who underwent a
large-scale multi-center study from 2018 to 2019 (33), showing
that ASD children before the age of 3 also had sleep problems,
and the incidence may be higher.
ASD children often suﬀer from comorbid sleep disorders
mainly manifested as frequent night awakenings, diﬃculty
falling asleep, late sleep habits, night terrors, excessive early
awakening, short sleep duration, circadian rhythm disturbance,
daytime sleepiness, sleep-disordered breathing, etc., (27). The
etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear, but may be related
to the inﬂuence of social environment, neurodevelopmental
function, comorbidities, intestinal diseases, and respiratory
diseases. It is generally believed that the interaction of biological
and social or environmental factors lead to neurosecretory
dysfunction and changes in sleep habits (34). A multi-center
study by Hongyu Chen et al. found that the four dimensions
with the highest prevalence of sleep problems in ASD children
aged 2–7 were bedtime resistance (25.6%), sleep anxiety (22.7%),
sleep delay (17.9%) and daytime somnolence (14.7%) (33).
This study showed that diﬃculty falling asleep and frequent
night awakenings were the most common sleep problems in
ASD children aged 1–3 years with the incidence of 48.6 and
24.2%, respectively, which was obviously higher than that of
the control group. Sleep-disordered breathing accounted for
a small percentage of sleep problems, supporting previous
ﬁndings of negligible relationship between breathing diﬃculties
and ASD (35, 36). No statistical diﬀerence in sleep-disordered
breathing and parasomnia existed between the case group and
the control group. It can be seen that the manifestations of sleep
problems vary in diﬀerent age groups, which is determined by
the sleep characteristics of diﬀerent age groups. ASD children
are usually excited before going to bed and cannot calm down
quickly after going to bed, so they are diﬃcult to fall asleep.
These sleep problems make it even harder to foster an ASD
child. For this reason, ASD children should be helped to
establish good sleeping habits from an early age and create a
quiet and comfortable sleeping environment. Before going to
bed, they shall be provided with regular preparatory activities,
and improved sleep procedures, and shall be prevented from
strenuous exercise, overeating, watching cartoons so as to
improve sleep.

Description of sleep status of ASD
children aged 1–3 years
A growing number of researches have shown that sleep
problems have a negative impact on the daily lives of
ASD children (37), and will exacerbate social communication
problems and repetitive behaviors (38). Sikora et al. found
that sleep problems were negatively correlated with daytime
behaviors in 1,193 ASD children, and ASD children had
more internalized behavior problems and poorer adaptability.
Children with moderate or severe sleep problems had more
behavioral problems than children with mild sleep problems
(39). The guidelines issued by the WHO in 2019 deﬁne
sleep duration <10 h a day is insuﬃcient sleep duration for
preschoolers (40). This study showed that ASD children had
later bedtime and less sleep duration, and longer time to
fall asleep autonomously than that in the control group. No
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in awakening time in the
morning and sleep duration in the daytime existed between the
two groups. This is consistent with the results of a study by
Miano S et al. that 22.6% of children with ASDs slept for fewer
than 8 h a night compared with only 9.6% of typically developing
children (41). It is of great signiﬁcance to timely master the sleep
status of ASD children and provide targeted interventions.
Eﬀects of diﬀerent sleep patterns and
parenting styles on sleep quality in ASD
children aged 1–3 years
Previous studies have shown that the sleep pattern aﬀects
the occurrence of sleep problems (42, 43). This study has shown
that a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in sleep patterns exists between the
case group and the control group, and children in the case
group are more diﬃcult to sleep autonomously. Nevertheless,
the incidence of sleep problems in children who could fall asleep
autonomously in both groups was lower than that in children
who need parental help. Whether, ASD children could fall asleep
autonomously in the case group had a more obvious impact
on sleep problems than that in the control group. It can be
seen that children who need help to fall asleep, such as family
members’ hugging, cuddling, nursing, rely on other people’s
support. They have a high incidence of sleep problems due to
poor transition ability from mild awakening to sleep (44), and
ASD children are more vulnerable. Therefore, we need to begin
from the cultivation of autonomous sleep from childhood in
order to improve the sleep quality of ASD children.
Screen exposure usually refers to the contact and use of
electronic products such as mobile phones, computers, and TVs.
With further development of scientiﬁc research, the adverse
eﬀects of screen exposure on children’s sleep have also attracted
the attention of scholars worldwide (45, 46). The guidelines
issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 pointed
out that electronic products should not be used by children
under the age of 1.5 years, and screen exposure time for children
aged 2–5 years should not be exceed 1 h a day (47). This study
found that screen exposure of both the case group and the
control group was long, but no statistical diﬀerence existed
between the two groups. More than half of children aged 1–3
years have more than an hour of screen time a day, which also
reﬂected a bad current situation in China. Yet, with the same
screen exposure, the longer the screen exposure time, the higher
the incidence of sleep problems in the case group, while there is
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between screen exposure time and sleep
problems in the control group. It can be seen that ASD children
aged 1–3 years with more screen exposure are more susceptible
to sleep problems, while the exposure factor has little impact
on sleep quality for typically-developing children. This will also
provide a new guideline for sleep problems in ASD children aged
1–3 years. Reduced screen exposure needs to be incorporated
into sleep guidelines for children with autism.
Conclusion
Our study described and discussed the sleep problems and
related factors of ASD children aged 1–3 years in detail, so as
to provide information for the comprehensive diagnosis and
intervention of ASD children in the younger age group. The
sleep status of ASD children is closely related to the pathography
of autism. Moreover, ASD children aged 1–3 years have later
bedtime, less sleep duration at night, diﬃculty falling asleep,
and frequent night awakenings, which made it even harder to
foster an ASD child for the guardians. We must pay suﬃcient
attention to the sleep status of ASD children aged 1–3 years.
At the same time, cultivating autonomous sleep and reducing
screen exposure time can improve sleep quality of ASD children
to some extent, and are also worthy of our attention when
behavioral intervention improves sleep quality. In summary,
sleep is an important guarantee for children’s neurodevelopment
and maturation. Parents and medical staﬀare called upon
to detect sleep problems in ASD children early and conduct
behavioral interventions timely in order to improve the quality
of lives for ASD children and their families (48).
Limitations
The sample age of this study is limited to ASD children aged
1–3 years, so the results of this study cannot be extended to
ASD patient over 3 years old. Meanwhile, this study did not
analyze the intelligence level and comorbidities of the subjects.
So further research is needed in this aspect. In addition, This
study is essentialy based on subjective reports from parents.
Objective assessment (i.e., with actigraphy or polisomnography)
can be carried out in the future for in-depth research on the sleep
problems of ASD children.
