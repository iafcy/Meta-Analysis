ABSTRACT
Aim:
To examine the pattern and extent of television viewing in children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with typically developing controls and those with
delayed language development (DLD).
Methods:
Fifty-four individuals with ASD (mean age 2.56 ± 0.66 years) and 84
controls (mean age 2.43 ± 0.81 years) were enrolled. Fifty-six individuals with DLD, who
had language developmental levels similar to those with ASD, were enrolled in our previous
study. Main outcome measures included onset and frequency of television viewing, in
addition to the type of programme and whether a caregiver cowatched television.
Results:
Those with ASD began to watch television signiﬁcantly earlier than controls
(6.44 ± 6.35 vs. 12.41 ± 6.00 months of age, p £ 0.0001*) and spent more time watch-
ing television than those with DLD (4.60 ± 1.91 vs. 3.05 ± 1.90 h ⁄ day, p £ 0.0001*)
and controls (4.60 ± 1.91 vs. 2.06 ± 1.21 h ⁄ day, p £ 0.0001*). Those with ASD
appeared to watch more adult programmes than normal controls, and they were less likely
to watch television with caregivers than both control groups.
Conclusion:
There is an earlier onset and higher frequency of television viewing in
autistic children compared with children with typical development.
INTRODUCTION
Media has become an important environmental factor in
the household that can have an impact on the daily lives of
young children because they have often begun to watch
television very early, by 3 months of age. In addition, more
time is spent in front of the screen, with an average of
approximately 3–4 h ⁄ day, more than any other leisure
activity besides sleeping (1,2). This early exposure and
increased amount of television viewing exceeds the recom-
mendations by The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),
which suggests that children ‡2 years of age should have
<2 h of watching television per day. In addition, parents
should watch television together with their child and dis-
cuss the content and children <2 years of age should avoid
watching television (3). Thus far, there are several studies
demonstrating harmful effects of media on young children,
including violence (4), obesity (5,6), sleep problems (7),
delayed language development (DLD) (8–10), adverse
effects on cognition (11) and attention problems (12,13).
Therefore, this evidence should no longer be disregarded by
parents, paediatricians, teachers, entertainment industries
and policy makers (1,14).
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex group of
heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders with signiﬁ-
cant impairments in social and communication domains in
addition to restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours
(15). It is an urgent public health concern in many coun-
tries. Estimates reported by the Autism and Developmental
Disabilities Monitoring Network in the US show that
approximately up to 110 in 10 000 children, 3–17 years of
age have ASD (16). Early detection by a multidisciplinary
team can lead to a better outcome for those children with
ASD from comprehensive developmental and behavioural
interventions (17,18). In some preschool-age children with
autism, they can have unusual responses to sensory stimuli
and relative strength in visual-spatial perception (19,20).
Therefore, various learning interventions including the Pic-
ture Exchange Communication System and videotape mod-
elling were developed to help those with ASD acquire
functional communication spontaneously (21,22). Accord-
ing to parent reports, some of those with ASD demonstrated
a high interest in television, videotapes and computer
programmes, but the pattern and extent of media use specif-
ically in young individuals with ASD or other neurodevel-
opmental disorders have rarely been studied. Additionally,
little is known about how to appropriately recommend
media use for caregivers of those with ASD or other neuro-
developmental disorders. We focused solely on television in
this current study as its use was more widely reported when
compared with music ⁄ audio, computers and video (14).
Moreover, television is easily accessed by young children
and widely used in the household in Thailand. To better

provide appropriate recommendations on television use for
parents of children with ASD, we therefore compared tele-
vision viewing habits in those with ASD with typically
developing controls and those with DLD from our previous
study (9).
METHODS
Study subjects
Study subjects included 54 children with ASD with a mean
age of 2.56 years (SD 0.66, age range 1.5–3.83 years) and 56
children with DLD with a mean age of 2.11 years (SD 0.47,
age range 1.33–3.67 years), who were seen at the develop-
mental clinic, Division of Growth and Development,
Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial
Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during September 2005 to
August 2006. Eighty-four typically developing children with
a mean age of 2.43 years (SD 0.81, age range 1.5–4 years),
who came to the well baby clinic at King Chulalongkorn
Memorial Hospital, Bangkok during the same period, were
enrolled as normal controls. Those with DLD and normal
controls were recruited in our previous study (9). The enrol-
ment of typically developing controls was based on age and
gender matched to those with ASD. The diagnosis of ASD
was conﬁrmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revised criteria
(15), followed by a developmental and behavioural paediat-
ric team consensus discussion including all authors in addi-
tion to a psychologist, developmental and behavioural
paediatric fellows, a speech and language pathologist, a
physical therapist and a behavioural specialist. DLD was
diagnosed based on a clinical evaluation by the multidisci-
plinary team mentioned above. Those with known causes of
DLD including ASD, genetic syndromes, hearing loss, neu-
rological disorders and global developmental delay were
not included in the DLD group (9). The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of King Chulalongkorn
Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn
University, Bangkok.
Study protocol
After informed consent was obtained, all subjects under-
went a full medical history, physical examination, and a full
developmental assessment by either author (WC or CP),
who are both developmental and behavioural paediatricians
with expertise in ASD. The medical history covered an
extensive review of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal his-
tory, developmental milestones, developmental delay or
regression, and behavioural problems, in addition to a
review of systems, and medication use. Table 1 lists charac-
teristics of those with ASD, DLD and controls. Socioeco-
nomic
background
included
parental
age,
income,
education, primary caregiver, number of family members
and family support (the involvement of other family mem-
bers to help take care of the child). Table 2 lists parental
and family characteristics of those with ASD, DLD and con-
trols. The television viewing habits mainly focused on how
early (onset) and on average how much television the sub-
jects watched (frequency), what programmes they preferred
to watch (content), and how they watched television (con-
text) to document whether they were allowed to watch tele-
vision alone or whether caregivers cowatched with them.
The average time of interactive activities where caregivers
jointly spent with their children each day, including helping
them to brush their teeth, take a bath, get dressed, helping
with toileting, listening to them about daily activities, eating
with them, teaching and encouraging them to talk, playing
with them, etc., and the average time caregivers talked with
their children during the day, including telling stories and
reading to them, were also thoroughly assessed by an in-
depth interview. Table 3 illustrated comparisons of televi-
sion viewing habits and time characteristics, including the
average time of interactive activities and the average time
caregivers talked with their children during the day,

between individuals with ASD with typically developing
controls, and those with DLD.
Developmental assessment included hearing screening,
evaluation of joint attention and sociability, observation of
play, expressive and receptive language, hyperactive, repeti-
tive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviours in the session.
Furthermore, developmental screening was performed by
using Denver-II (23), which is a validated developmental
screening tool widely used in Thailand. Language develop-
mental level was determined by the age where subjects can
pass those items at the 75th percentile on language develop-
mental domain in the Denver-II.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were compared between subjects
with ASD and the typically developing control group,
and also between those with ASD, and those with DLD
using either one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or
nonparametric
comparison,
Mann–Whitney
U-test,
depending
upon
the
assumption
of
normality
and
equality of variance in each group. Categorical variables
were compared by Fisher’s exact test. Analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA) was conducted if background variables
were
signiﬁcantly
different
between
the
groups
and
potentially associated with the main outcome measures
by using those variables as covariates. All statistical anal-
yses were performed with SPSS version 18.0 (IBM, Inc,
Somers,
NY,
USA)
for
Windows
and
all
p-values
reported are two-sided and the signiﬁcance level is 0.05.
RESULTS
Characteristics of study subjects
There were no signiﬁcant differences in background vari-
ables including chronological age, gender, birth order, pre-
term birth, birth weight and past medical illness between
individuals with ASD and typically developing controls
(Table 1). Nor were there signiﬁcant differences in parental
and family characteristics between both groups of subjects
(Table 2). However, mothers of individuals with ASD were

slightly older than controls’ mothers. As expected, those with
ASD had language developmental delay documented by
developmental history and the Denver-II. Although those
with DLD were signiﬁcantly younger than those with ASD,
the language developmental age was not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent from those with ASD. In addition, an average of father’s
income in those with DLD was signiﬁcantly lower than those
with ASD, but the comparison of combined parental income
between these two groups did not reach a signiﬁcant level.
Comparison of television viewing habits between those
with ASD and typically developing controls
Individuals with ASD began to watch television prior to the
development of their receptive and expressive language.
Interestingly, an approximately 6-month earlier onset of tele-
vision viewing was observed in those with ASD compared
with typically developing controls. Most controls began to
watch television after they started to speak meaningful
words. Prior to 12 months of age, more individuals with ASD
began to watch television compared with controls. However,
before 24 months of age, both groups began to watch televi-
sion earlier than the AAP recommendations. Regarding the
frequency of television viewing, those with ASD appeared to
spend signiﬁcantly more time watching television than con-
trols and the AAP recommendations. Those with ASD were
more likely to watch adult programmes including advertise-
ments, TV series, news, games, entertainment shows and
music videos than controls. Furthermore, individuals with
ASD were more likely to be allowed to watch television on
their own compared with controls.
Comparison of television viewing habits between those
with ASD and those with DLD
Interestingly, higher frequency of television viewing was
demonstrated in those with ASD compared with those with
DLD. There were signiﬁcantly higher rates of watching tele-
vision ‡2 h ⁄ day and no joint interaction during television
viewing in individuals with ASD compared with those with
DLD (Table 3). After adjusting for chronological age, gen-
der, father’s and mother’s income, and whether the mother
was a primary caregiver of the child, those with ASD
appeared to spend more time watching television than those
with
DLD
(estimated
means ± SE,
4.37 ± 0.27
vs.
3.32 ± 0.26 h ⁄ day, F1,102 = 6.862, p = 0.01). There was an
interesting trend towards an earlier onset of television view-
ing in those with ASD compared with those with DLD after
adjusting for the variables mentioned earlier (estimated
means ± SE, 5.72 ± 0.84 vs. 7.90 ± 0.84 months of age,
F1,102 = 3.01, p = 0.086).
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study demonstrating the pattern and extent
of television viewing in individuals with ASD compared
with typically developing children and those with DLD
from the perspective of a developing country, where young
children can be inﬂuenced by the media (9). However, our
ﬁndings
should
be
cautiously
interpreted
as
they
demonstrated an association, not a cause-and-effect ﬁnding.
Although an increased frequency of television use in those
with ASD in this current study was in agreement with a
study by Shane and Albert and May et al. (24,25), none of
those previous studies surveyed television use in younger
individuals with ASD, nor mentioned the onset of television
viewing in those with ASD. There may be a combination of
social and language deﬁcits in addition to restricted and
repetitive behaviours in those with ASD, risks for attention
problems and abnormal regulation to arousal stimuli. Fur-
thermore, caregivers may not successfully engage their chil-
dren, so that children with ASD may occupy themselves
with nonsocial activities including television viewing. An
adult moderator and enriched parent–child interaction can
be very critical for brain development in young children
with and without ASD (26). Behavioural symptoms of ASD
were more likely to emerge over time, beginning in the sec-
ond half of the ﬁrst year by prospectively demonstrating the
slow decline in social communication behaviours, and loss
of skills in those who were later diagnosed with ASD (27).
Therefore, ASD symptoms may emerge at approximately
6 months of age in those with ASD in our study where
social and communication deﬁcits became problematic,
reﬂecting why those with ASD appeared to watch television
earlier than their typically developing peers. The onset of
television use at approximately 6 months of age may be an
indirect clue for social and ⁄ or language deﬁcits in those
who are at risk of ASD. Furthermore, potentially detrimen-
tal effects of the media mentioned in the Introduction sec-
tion, which can co-occur in those with ASD should be
taken into consideration. Increased attention to the screen,
imitation of words and developing procedural knowledge
about television’s devices were observed in those with ASD
(24), but how this knowledge can be pragmatically general-
ized in a way of social communication in the daily lives of
those with ASD needs to be elucidated.
The signiﬁcant weaknesses of our study included small
sample sizes, the lack of standardized ASD assessments and
using just an interview without another objective assess-
ment of television viewing habits (e.g. behavioural observa-
tion in the household). However, we tried to compensate
for this weakness by interviewing strictly to the protocol
regardless of the groups of the subjects. Population-based
studies with long-term follow-up in those with ASD and
typically developing controls are needed. Moreover, short
and long-term consequences of media use in those with
ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders should be fur-
ther studied to better provide appropriate anticipatory guid-
ance for parents of those with ASD, particularly the topics
in terms of how to optimize beneﬁts and potential risks
from the media for their children. Future studies should also
consider how beneﬁcial effects of television viewing includ-
ing imitation and prosocial behaviours can lead to develop-
ing interactive educational interventions through media,
which should be more developmentally appropriate for
those with ASD and ultimately modify or shape on abnor-
mal neuronal networks in developing brains of those with
ASD (28).
