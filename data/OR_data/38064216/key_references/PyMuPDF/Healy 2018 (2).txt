Abstract
The correlates of physical activity and screen-time among children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), and how these differ from typically developing (TD)
children, remains largely unknown. Method: This study compared psychosocial
factors associated with physical activity and screen-time between nine-year old
children with ASD (n = 55) and TD children (n = 55). Variables of interest included
self-concept, peer relationship problems, prosocial behaviors, and number of, and
time spent, with friends. It was hypothesized that psychosocial correlates of health
behaviors differ between children with and without ASD. Parents completed
questionnaires assessing the child’s physical activity, screen-time, and psychoso-
cial characteristics. Regression analyses indicated that for measures of physical
activity – hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), daily physical
activity, and sports participation – males (TD and ASD) and TD children were
more likely to participate, compared to females (TD and ASD) and children with
ASD. There was a significant interaction between ASD diagnosis and bullying for
light physical activity (LPA), with TD children who experienced bullying signif-
icantly more likely to engage in LPA compared to children with ASD who
experienced bullying. For screen-time, a greater number of close friends and a
lower parent rating of the child’s level of prosocial behavior were significantly
associated with greater hours of screen-time. Interventions aiming to increase
physical activity among children with ASD need to take into account the associ-
ated psychosocial factors, and how they may differ from TD children.

Introduction
Regular engagement in physical activity can help children maintain a healthy
weight and decrease one’s chances of developing chronic diseases (e.g., coronary
heart disease, diabetes) throughout the lifespan (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) 2014). Participation in physical activity may offer additional
benefits to children with social, emotional, and behavioral disorders, such as
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Srinivasan et al. 2014). For example, among
children with ASD, increased exercise can provide gains in social skills (Chu and
Pan 2012), and decreases in stereotypical behaviors, hyperactivity, aggression, and
self-injury (Oriel et al. 2011). Unfortunately, despite the benefits of physical
activity, the majority of children with ASD do not participate in regular physical
activity (Srinivasan et al. 2014). Although some research comparing physical
activity levels between children with and without ASD reports similar levels of
participation during childhood (e.g. among children aged 3 to 11 years; Bandini
et al. 2013), differences are apparent at older ages, with children with ASD being
less physically active (e.g. 13 to 21 years; Stanish et al. 2015; and, 13-year-olds:
Healy et al. 2013). Barriers preventing increased physical activity are plentiful,
including a lack of adults with the skills needed to include children with ASD, a
lack of exercise partners, and exclusion from other children (Must et al. 2015).
The barriers – listed above – that correlate negatively with physical activity,
unsurprisingly, correlate positively with increased screen-time. Research suggests
individuals with ASD engage in more sedentary behavior – particularly screen-
time – than their typically developing (TD) counterparts (Must et al. 2014;
Chonchaiya et al. 2011). For example, Must et al. (2014) demonstrated children
(aged 3 to 11 years) with ASD participated in an hour more of sedentary behaviors
on weekdays compared to their TD counterparts, and the majority of this time was
spent on screen-time activities. Similarly, in research by Chonchaiya et al. (2011)
young children (aged 1.5 to 5 years) with ASD spent more time watching televi-
sion than TD participants. In addition to being associated with higher rates of
obesity (Kenney and Gortmaker 2017), screen-time may also contribute to sleep
problems (Cain and Gradisar 2010), delayed language development (Christakis
et al. 2009), and attention problems (Christakis et al. 2004). One hypothesis for
this increase in screen-time behavior, among children with ASD, is the inclination
for parents to utilize television and video games as a method of behavior manage-
ment for the child with ASD (Matheson and Douglas 2017; Nally et al. 2000). This
coincides with parents reports that children with ASD need too much supervision
for physical activity participation (Must et al. 2015). It is also proposed that
children with ASD may view screen-time as a less intimidating interaction plat-
form, compared to physical activities (Matheson and Douglas 2017).
Due to the tremendous amount of physical and psychological benefits of
participation in physical activity (CDC 2014), and the detrimental effects of
sedentary behavior, particularly screen-time sedentariness (Tremblay et al. 2011),
research examining the correlates associated with physical activity and screen-time
engagement among children is of the utmost importance. The Youth Physical
Activity Promotion (YPAP) model, which has a social-ecological perspective,
provides a useful framework for understanding correlates of PA in children
Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities

(Welk 1999). Accordingly, correlates of PA in the model include psychological
attributes, social influences, and environmental influences. Among TD children,
the psychosocial characteristics of the YPAP model have received a lot of attention
(Seabra et al. 2012; Strauss et al. 2001). Several psychosocial factors have been
found to be associated with physical activity, including self-efficacy, perception of
physical or sport competence (Dishman et al. 2005; Sallis et al. 2000; Trost et al.
1997; Van der Horst et al. 2007), the presence of peers (Beets et al. 2006; Salvy
et al. 2012; Voorhees et al. 2005), perceived support from peers (Sawka et al. 2013;
Voorhees et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2012), and peer activity levels (Garcia et al.
2016a, b; Sirard et al. 2013). Research on the correlates of sedentary behavior for
TD children – often represented by screen-time – is amassing also, but less
conclusive. Reviews of the literature (e.g. Stierlin et al. 2015) identify several
psychosocial factors associated with increased sedentary behavior, including scor-
ing high on depressive symptoms, absence of social support, and TV-related
parenting risk factors.
The psychosocial correlates of health behaviors among children with ASD are
less understood. This was highlighted in a systematic review, by Jones et al.
(2017), on the correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in children
with ASD. Jones and colleagues concluded that correlates of physical activity and
sedentary behavior among children with ASD, and how these differ from TD
children, remain largely unknown. Only age (negatively associated with physical
activity) and sex (null association) were reported sufficiently across studies. Sev-
eral child-related ‘ASD specific’ correlates were also examined for physical activ-
ity and sedentary behavior, including symptom severity, maladaptive behaviors,
and medication use. Although not strongly associated with physical activity or
sedentary behavior, it was concluded that they may be important correlates for
intervention development. Family variables have also been examined, for both
physical activity and sedentary behavior, including parental education, income,
marital status, and family size, yet results are inconsistent (Jones et al. 2017). A
range of psychosocial variables, deemed to be associated with physical activity and
sedentary behavior among TD children, remain unexplored for children with ASD.
Yet, due to the unique characteristics of ASD, the correlates for their health
behaviors may differ. The relationship between psychosocial factors and health
behavior preferences, choices, and opportunities may be moderated by the unique
social, behavioral, or sensory characteristics associated with having a diagnosis of
ASD. As an understanding of correlates of health behaviors may impact on
intervention development, further investigation of additional correlates of physical
activity among individuals with ASD is required (Jones et al. 2017).
Despite the information available on the correlates of physical activity and
screen-time for children, little is known about the correlates of these behaviors
for children with ASD. Additionally, research that compares health behaviors and
psychosocial correlates of physical activity participation between TD children and
children with ASD is sparse. The purpose of this research was to compare both
health behaviors, and psychosocial correlates of health behaviors, between nine-
year old children with and without ASD. It is hypothesized that psychosocial
correlates of health behaviors – physical activity and screen-time – differ between
children with and without ASD.

Methods
Participants and Data Collection
Data from the “Growing up in Ireland” (GUI) study, a nationally representative
cohort study of children living in the Republic of Ireland, were used for this
study. The GUI study aimed to examine the factors which contribute to or
undermine the wellbeing of children in twenty-first Century Ireland (Murray
et al. 2012).Wave 1 includes information on nine-year old children (n = 8570),
collected in 2007/2008, from the children, their parents, and teachers. Data
collection occurred during the school year (i.e Spring or Fall). Children were
recruited through the national primary school system; 910 schools participated
in the study, a response rate of 82%, with 52% of families agreeing to
participate. Information on a broad range of factors effecting children’s social,
emotional, cognitive, and physical development was collected. A GUI inter-
viewer was assigned to each child’s home. A letter of introduction, and a phone
call, were made prior to the interviewer’s home visit. Interviews were recorded
on a CAMPE (Computer Assisted Personal Device). Regarding data collection
involving the child, the interviewer received training emphasizing the impor-
tance of establishing a good rapport, the power imbalance that may exist, and
strategies to put the child at ease (for example asking them about their favorite
activities) (Murray et al. 2012). The interviewer was instructed to explain a
question when not understood by the respondent, but not to prompt an answer.
For child-report questions, prompt cards were available with the available
possible answers (Murray et al. 2012). Data collection was approved by the
Health and Research Boards’ research committee. For the technical report on the
data set, including the conceptual framework and methodology, see Murray
et al. (2012).
Measures
Demographic Measures
Participants were separated into two groups, depending on having a current
ASD diagnosis or not. All children were 9 years old. To obtain an understand-
ing of socioeconomic status (SES), parents/caregivers were asked to report their
highest education level; a dichotomous variable was created based on whether
the parent or caregiver received a college education or higher. In addition, the
interviewer measured the weight and height of each child in the household. A
Leicester portable height measure was used to record height to the nearest
millimeters. A Class III medically approved scale – the SECA 761 flat me-
chanical scales – was used for recording weight to the nearest kilogram. These
measurements allowed investigators to calculate body mass index (BMI) for
each child. Children were classified as normal weight or overweight (BMI ≥
19.46 for boys, BMI ≥19.45 for girls), according to the guidelines set by the
International Obesity Taskforce (IOTF) cut-off points for boys and girls (Cole
et al. 2000).

Health Behavior Measures
Physical activity was measured through parental report. The child’s parent (mother, or
lone father) was asked questions adapted from the leisure time exercise questionnaire
(Godin and Shephard 1997). To assess moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
participation, they were asked how many times, in the past 14 days, their child had
done at least 20 min of hard exercise. Hard exercise was defined as exercise that made
the child breathe heavily and their heart beat faster. Examples of playing football,
jogging, and fast cycling were provided. A five-point scale consisted of: none, one to 2
days, three to 5 days, six to 8 days and nine or more days. To assess participation in
LPA the parents were asked “How many times in the past 14 days has the Study Child
done at least 20 minutes of light exercise that was not hard enough to make him/her
breathe heavily and make his/her heart beat fast?” Examples provided included walking
or slow cycling. For both questions participants were instructed to include time spent
by the child in physical education. Parents responded using a five-point scale, ranging
from 1 (none) to 5 (9 or more days). These measures were used in previous research
(Cadogan et al. 2014), have demonstrated concurrent validity with measures of max-
imum oxygen intake (VO2 max) and muscular endurance (Godin et al. 1986), and have
acceptable test-retest reliability (0.69 to 0.96) (Sallis et al. 1993). Finally, the teachers
were asked about the “number of hours per week of physical education?” that the study
child received, with response options of 1 h, 2 h, or 3 or more hours.
The children were also asked about their own physical activity participation over a
one-week period: ‘Over the past 7 days on how many days were you physically active
for a total of at least 60 minutes per day?’ The child responded on a scale of 0 (No days)
to 7 (7 days). Finally, a question regarding sport participation, asked to the study child,
was also included; the question asked ‘How often do you play sport?’ The child
responded on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (Almost every day).
Three variables relating to screen-time – television, computers, and videos games –
were examined. It should be noted that ‘term time’ in the following questions refers to
during the school year. The parents were asked (1) ‘on a normal weekday during term
time, how many hours does the Study Child spend watching television, videos or
DVDs?’ (2) ‘on a normal weekday, during term-time, about how much time does the
Study Child spend using the computer?’ and (3) ‘on a normal weekday, during term-
time, about how much time does the Study Child spend playing video games such as,
Playstation, X-box, Nintendo etc?’. Parents were reminded to include time spent
engaged in screen-time before and after school, but not during school hours. Parents
responded on a scale of 1 (none) to 6 (7 h or more). To create a total screen-time scale
variable, the three screen-time variables (television, computer, and video games) were
combined, resulting in a 18-point scale. A higher score on all variables reflects higher
levels of screen time.
Psychosocial Factors
Multiple psychosocial factors were examined as potential correlates of physical activity
and screen-time. First, three subscales, from the Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept
Scale, 2nd Edition (Piers and Herzberg 2002) were examined: (1) Freedom From
Anxiety (a subscale of 14 items exploring a variety of feelings including fear,
Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities

unhappiness, nervousness, shyness and feeling left out of things) (; (2) Popularity (a
subscale of 12 items exploring the Study Child’s evaluation of his or her social
functioning); and (3) Happiness and Satisfaction (a subscale of 10 items reflecting
feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life). Each subscale demonstrates good
internal consistency with cronbach’s alpha levels of the above mentioned subscales
equaling .81, .74, and .77 respectively, and moderate to high construct validity. The
questionnaire was administered to the children, in their school, by a GUI interviewer.
Scales are scored so that a higher score indicates a more positive self-evaluation in the
domain being measured.
Two subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman
1997) were included: (1) Peer relationship problems and (2) Prosocial behavior. Each
subscale comprises five items. Respondents, the parents, were required to indicate their
level of agreement with each item on a three-point scale of ‘Certainly true’, ‘Somewhat
true’ or ‘Not true’. Item scores vary from 0 to 2 depending on the type of endorsement.
The SDQ demonstrates moderate to strong internal consistency reliability (0.59 to 0.82)
for the parent report version of the instrument (Goodman 2001) and correlates highly
with both the Rutter scales (Goodman 1997) and Child Behavior Checklist (Goodman
and Scott 1999).
Additional factors were also included: The number of days per week in which the
child did something with friends was transformed into a five-point scale variable,
ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (6–7 days per week). The number of close friends that
the child had was also included; this scale ranged from 1(zero) to 5 (6 or more friends).
Both questions were parent reported, and based on questions asked in the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth and Children (Collins 2001). To assess negative social
experiences, a parent-reported ‘victim of bullying’ variable was included as a dummy
variable (1 = yes; 0 = no). The question was developed by the GUI study team.
Statistical Analysis
Independent t-tests were used to compare the differences in health behaviors
(physical activity and screen-time) and psychosocial factors between children with
ASD and TD children. Separate multiple linear regression analyses were first
conducted for all five dependent variables (MVPA, LPA, days of 60 min of physical
activity, sports participation, and screen time). In order to reduce the number of
independent variables in the model, Stepwise regression was conducted to deter-
mine which independent variables should be entered into the final model or
removed from the analysis. Variables with α < 1.5, a standard default value used
in statistical analysis software (Minitab 2010), remained in the model. The initial
model contained only demographic variables, including gender, parent education,
BMI category, and ASD status. Next, psychological factors were entered, with
removal of any non-significant factors that did not meet the criteria of α < than
1.5. Finally, the social factors were entered into the regression model. The final
models consisted of only the significant demographic, psychological, and social
factors in order to present the strongest model for each dependent variable. Addi-
tionally, interactions were tested between ASD diagnosis and other significant
factors to further explore how observed associations differed by ASD diagnosis.
All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. 2013).

Results
The current study includes 55 children who were reported, by their primary caregiver,
as having ASD diagnosed by a medical professional, and 55 randomly selected TD
children for comparison purposes. They were matched by gender, with females com-
prising 15% (n = 8) of both groups. No differences existed in parent education status
with 16 (29%) parents of children with ASD and 12 (22%) parents of TD children
attaining a college degree or greater (p = 0.38). There were no differences in weight
status with 13 (22%) of the TD children classified as overweight and 15 (31%) of the
children with ASD classified as overweight (p = 0.31), although it should be noted that
six of the 55 children with ASD had missing BMI. Additionally, hours per week of
physical education classes were compared between the two groups with results indi-
cating that there was no significant difference (p = .35) between time spent in PE
classes for TD children and children with ASD (1.1 ± .3 h vs. 1.17 ± .38 h).
Table 1 displays the comparison of health behaviors between the TD children and
the children with ASD. The children with ASD had significantly fewer days of MVPA
(3.8 ± 1.31 vs. 4.52 ± 1.03; p = .007), less participation in sports (10% of sample with
ASD did not play sports; p = .005), and less days where they participated in the
recommended 60 min or more of physical activity (3.96 ± 2.25 vs. 5.87 ± 2.07;
p < .0001). No differences existed in hours of daily screen-time between the children
with ASD (2.69 h/day) and TD children (2.83 h/day, p = 0.34). Table 2 displays the
comparison of psychosocial factors between the TD children and the children with
ASD. Children with ASD had significantly lower perceptions of popularity (p < .0001),
greater feelings of anxiety (p = .0006), more problems with peers (p < .0001), and lower
ratings of prosocial behavior (p < .0001) compared to TD children.
Results from the final multiple regression models for MVPA, LPA, number of days
per week of 60 min of physical activity, number of sports, and hours of screen time are
displayed in Table 3. Only the demographic and psychosocial variables that met the
inclusion criteria of p < .15. from the stepwise regression analysis were included in

bullied in the past year (p = 0.05), were more likely to engage in greater amounts of
LPA compared to females, children with ASD, and children who reported being bullied
by their peers in the past year. Only gender and ASD diagnosis were included in the
final models for number of days per week participants engaged in 60 min of physical
activity or played sports. Males (p = 0.01) and TD children (p < 0.0001) were more
likely to engage in 60 min of physical activity on more days per week, and similarly,
males (p = 0.02) and TD children (p = 0.03) were more likely to play sports on a greater
number of days per week than females or children with ASD.
For screen-time, the final model consisted of only two psychosocial factors, number
of close friends and prosocial behavior, with a greater number of close friends (p =
0.01) and a lower parent rating of their child’s level of prosocial behavior (p = 0.1)
associated with greater hours of screen time.
Since ASD diagnosis was a significant predictor in all but one of the regression
models (screen-time), interaction terms were tested to determine whether interactions
existed between ASD status and gender on the dependent physical activity factors
(MVPA, LPA, 60 min of PA, and sports participation), as well as ASD status and
bullying. No significant interactions existed between ASD diagnosis and gender,
however, there was a significant interaction between ASD diagnosis and bullying for
LPA, with TD children who have experienced bullying (β = 0.43, SE = 0.16, p = .01)
significantly more likely to engage in LPA compared to children with ASD who have
reported bullying in the past year.
Discussion
The purpose of this research was to compare both health behaviors, and psychosocial
correlates of health behaviors, between nine-year old children with and without ASD.
Similar to previous work, children with ASD had lower levels of MVPA and spent
fewer days participating in at least 60 min of physical activity compared to children
with ASD (Table 1). These findings reflect previous research highlighting the inactivity
of children with ASD (e.g. MacDonald et al. 2011; Pan et al. 2011). Interestingly, there
were no significant difference in participation in LPA or screen-time engagement
between the two groups. This indifference has been demonstrated in previous work:
for example, research has revealed similarities in physical activity levels (e.g. Bandini
et al. 2013; Corvey et al. 2016) and screen-time (Montes 2016). Although evidence on
disparities in physical activity and screen-time participation between children with and
without ASD is inconsistent, the call for efforts to increase physical activity, and reduce
screen-time, is echoed throughout the research base (e.g. Jones et al. 2017; Healy et al.
2017).
A broad range of correlates of physical activity, across all domains of the ecological
model, have been documented for TD children (Van der Horst et al. 2007) and
influence intervention development to maximize efficacious outcomes. Understanding
differences in correlates of physical activity and sedentariness between children with
and without ASD, if they in fact exist, will assist practitioners in the individualization of
interventions for individuals with ASD. Several factors were shown to be associated
with physical activity for both groups, with and without ASD. First, gender was
significantly associated with all forms of physical activity. Previous findings on gender
Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities

and physical activity have been inconsistent for children with ASD (Jones et al. 2017),
yet the association for TD children (favoring males) is well established (Sterdt et al.
2014). Due to the higher representation of males among the population with ASD –
odds of having ASD are four times as large for males than females (Kogan et al. 2009)
– research on correlates of health behavior among individuals with ASD has particu-
larly focused on males (Jones et al. 2017). As health behaviors (Fakhouri et al. 2013)
and their associated factors (Garcia et al. 2016a, b) differ between males and females,
future researchers should seek to include more females with ASD in research. The
number of days per week in which the child did something with friends also emerged as
a significant factor for MVPA for children with and without ASD. The importance of
having a peer group has been identified for TD children (Maturo and Cunningham
2013) and, conversely, a lack of exercise partners and exclusion from other children has
been revealed as being a barrier for physical activity among children with ASD (Must
et al. 2015). This significant associate of physical activity must be further explored in
future research, and considered in physical activity intervention design. An unexpected
finding was the association of screen-time with number of close friends, which was not
affected by ASD diagnosis. A previous study by Garcia et al. (2016b) found that male
adolescents preferred playing video games with groups of friends rather than alone or
with a single friend. Unfortunately, the specific type of screen-time activity is unknown
in the current study, however, given that the majority of the study sample is male, it is
plausible to suggest that this finding may be due to video game playing with groups of
friends. Future studies should further investigate social correlates of specific screen-
time activities, such as video game playing.
Interaction terms were calculated to examine differences in psychosocial factors
associated with physical activity and screen-time between TD children and children
with ASD. There was a significant interaction between ASD diagnosis and bullying for
LPA. Victimization appears to be more of a barrier to LPA for children with ASD,
compared to their TD counterparts. The influence of peers is reflected in previous
research on the barriers to physical activity among children with ASD. For example,
research by Must et al. (2015) revealed that children with ASD whose parents reported
that other children excluded their child participated in significantly less physical
activity then those who did not experience exclusion. Similarly, a lack of peer exercise
partners was reported by parents as being a barrier to physical activity participation
among their children with ASD (Obrusnikova and Miccinello 2012). Interventions to
increase physical activity among children with ASD should not neglect the importance
of the peers; efforts to increase understanding and inclusivity among peers may
significantly aid the child with ASD to increase participation in school-time physical
activity opportunities. Indeed, peer-mediated interventions have proved successful in
previous research; for example, Rodríguez-Medina et al. (2016) involved TD peers in
an intervention to increase social interaction in a recess setting among children with
ASD. After training of the peer – including in strategies such as using direct instruction,
modelling, and social reinforcement – improvements in the recess setting were ob-
served in the rates of imitating and responding to interaction, and time spent alone.
Such interactions should be expanded to promote inclusion in physical activities, in
settings including recess, physical education, and community-based activity programs.
The differences in psychosocial factors (Table 2) between both groups is also worthy
of discussion, particularly in light of how these factors may correlate with health

behaviors. In the current study children with ASD reported lower levels of perceived
popularity and prosocial behavior, and greater levels of anxiety and problems with
peers than their TD counterparts. Additionally, a greater percentage of parents of
children with ASD reported their child being bullied over the past several months,
and a lower percentage of parents with children with ASD reported their child having at
least one close friend. These findings are supported by previous research stating that
children with ASD tend to report more difficulties with social interactions with peers
and are at an increased risk of victimization when compared to TD peers and peers with
other disabilities (e.g. Kloosterman et al. 2013). Research by Healy et al. (2013)
suggests that children with ASD in physical activity settings may not be exempt from
this. Children participating in the research reported experiencing bullying – verbal and
physical – in physical education. Various potential reasons for this increased vulnera-
bility are posited, including (1) the social deficits characterizing ASD making navigat-
ing the social world difficult, (2) ASD is a hidden disability, thus less understood by
peers, and (3) support received in school (i.e. in-class adult support) may reduce
opportunities for social interaction (Hebron and Humphrey 2014; Symes and
Humphrey 2012). Research by Stanish et al. (2015) may add to the argument that
physical activity does not provide equal opportunities for positive social experiences
for children with ASD; significantly fewer of the participants with ASD (67.7%)
reported that sports and exercise is a way to make friends, in comparison to the TD
group (96.7%), and 35.5% of the participants with ASD indicated that they dislike team
sports, as opposed to 5% of their TD counterparts. Future research, seeking to increase
the inclusivity of physical activity settings for children with ASD, should promote
positive interactions between all participants, and provide opportunities for participa-
tion in less socially demanding activities. In addition, purposeful instruction of social
skills for use in physical activity settings should be considered.
Several strengths and limitations of this study should be noted. Compared to
previous studies that have examined health behaviors among children with ASD, this
is a relatively large sample (Stanish et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2016). Additionally, unlike
many previous studies involving children with ASD, the current study was able to
utilize a matched sample of TD children for comparison purposes. Another strength
was the availability of several psychosocial factors that allowed investigators to
examine different dimensions of social interaction, that were both positive (i.e.
prosocial behavior) and negative (i.e. bullying).
Several limitations related to the data utilized should be acknowledged. First, all
measures were subjective (primarily reported by parents/caregivers), which are
prone to bias; furthermore, some questions used (for example the number of ‘close
friends’ of the study child) are up for significant interpretation from the parent.
Second, although the self-report measure of self-concept using the Piers-Harris
Children’s Self-Concept Scale, 2nd Edition (Piers and Herzberg 2002) has been
validated for TD children (Alexopoulos and Foudoulaki 2002), this has yet to be
completed for children with ASD; this is strongly suggested for future researchers.
Third, although ASD diagnosis was assessed in the parent study, there was no
indication of ASD severity. Given the variability of symptoms identified in this
disorder, presence and severity of specific symptoms (e.g. non-verbal vs verbal),
may affect the association of psychosocial factors with physical activity and screen-
time. Additionally, the concern with prematurely eliminating variables that are not
Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities

related to the dependent variable with Stepwise regression is a limitation of this
analysis (Olusegun et al. Dikko & Gulumbe 2015). Finally, the authors were unable
to examine specific individual-level psychosocial factors, such as self-efficacy, that
have been shown to be associated with physical activity in TD children (Sallis et al.
2000). Although the present study was able to examine several individual-level
factors such as perceived happiness and anxiety, there were no measures that
specifically assessed self-efficacy or enjoyment of physical activity. Future research
should seek to understand how these variables may correlate with health behaviors
among children with ASD.
The possible implications of the time of data collection (2007/2008) also deserves
discussion. The data set, although ten years old, was deemed appropriate for the current
study as it included several variables previously unexamined related to physical activity
and screen-time among children with ASD. In addition, research on TD children over
the past decade has shown some consistent findings (for example the significance of
social factors; Salvy et al. 2012, Voorhees et al. 2005), thus we believe the current
findings are relevant and meaningful. The time of data-collection is particularly
relevant when examining a sample with ASD as the diagnostic criteria for ASD –
outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) – has
evolved overtime. Children of the current study, being 9 years old – thus diagnosed
between the years 1998/1999 and 2007 – were diagnosed with the DSM IV. Since
2013, a new version of the DSM was released; the DSM 5 (American Psychiatric
Association 2013). Most notably, changes included (1) the elimination of Pervasive
Developmental Disorder and the reduction of the five subtypes to a new singular
diagnostic category of ASD; (2) a collapse of three-domain criteria to two (social
communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive behavior, and (3) changing the age
of onset from ‘age 3’ to early childhood. In addition, a new diagnostic category was
defined, titled social communication disorder (SCD). Research comparing ASD prev-
alence using DSM-IV and DSM-5 concluded that almost all individuals with DSM IV
Autistic Disorder (98%) and Asperger Disorder (92%) met the new DSM 5 ASD
diagnostic criteria (Kim et al. 2014). With these results in mind, we propose that
research on children with ASD diagnosed prior to 2013 is still generalizable to children
with ASD diagnosed post 2013. Nevertheless, we recommend that future researchers
seek to collect and explore more recent data to continue to understand the correlates of
health behaviors among this population, extending findings to children with a diagnosis
of SCD.
Finally, although the technical report on study procedures (Murray et al. 2012)
states that every effort was made to maximize participation of the involvement of
children with learning disabilities or other special needs, little information is
provided on specific strategies, and it is not known how many children with
ASD were excluded from participation or for whom participation was impacted
due to the characteristics of ASD (e.g. communication deficits) or comorbidities
(e.g. intellectual disability). Future research should seek to clearly define the
participating sample with ASD. If the responses of the sample with ASD cannot
be deemed valid, researchers should rely solely on the parent or teacher report data.
Furthermore, national data collection efforts should ensure interviewers are trained
to interact and elicit accurate responses from individuals with ASD so their
perspective is reflected in nationally representative data-sets.
Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities

The results of this study have several implications. First, the present study confirms
previous research that suggests that children with ASD engage in less MVPA, are less
likely to meet physical activity guidelines, and participate in fewer sports than their TD
counterparts. Differences are apparent relating to the effect of bullying on PA partic-
ipation: children with ASD who were bullied were significantly less likely to participate
in LPA compared to TD children who were bullied. Studies should examine the
association between negative social interactions and lower levels of physical activity
in children with ASD, and develop interventions that focus on improving social
interactions between children with ASD and their peers in physical activity settings.
Finally, it is important to note that a large amount of variance in physical activity levels
was unexplained by the examined psychosocial correlates in this study. Future studies
should include additional correlates that have been linked with physical activity in TD
children such as self-efficacy and enjoyment, activity preferences, and environmental
correlates (e.g. the presence of facilities nearby), and correlates that may be unique or more
influential in children with ASD (e.g. ASD severity, sensory issues, social and behavioral
attributes, caregiver attitudes and support). Research is needed to gain a better understanding
the multi-level correlates of physical activity for children with ASD.
