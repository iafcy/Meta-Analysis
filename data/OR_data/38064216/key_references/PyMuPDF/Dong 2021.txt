Background: Electronic screen media play an increasingly vital role in children’s
entertainment;
however,
excessive

time
may

inﬂuence
child
development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the
screen time of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their autistic symptoms
and development quotients (DQs).
Methods: We compared the screen time of 101 children with ASD and 57 typically
developing (TD) children. Then, we performed a correlation analysis to determine
the correlations between the screen time and the ASD-related scale scores and
developmental quotients of the Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS) of ASD children.
We further divided the ASD group into subgroups according to the screen time and age
and then separately conducted the above correlation analyses by subgroup.
Result: The results showed that the screen time of the children with ASD was longer than
that of the TD children (3.34 ± 2.64 h vs. 0.91 ± 0.93 h). The screen time of the children
with ASD was positively correlated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score
(r = 0.242, P = 0.021) and “taste, smell and touch” item of CARS(r = 0.304, P = 0.005),
and negatively correlated with the language DQ of the GDS (r = −0.236, P = 0.047).
The subgroup analysis showed that in the longer screen time subgroup of ASD children,
the screen time was positively correlated with the CARS score (r = 0.355, P = 0.026)
and negatively correlated with the DQs of all domains of the GDS (P < 0.05). In addition,
in the younger age group of ASD children, the screen time was positively correlated with
the CARS score (r = 0.314, P = 0.021) and negatively correlated with the DQs of all
domains of the GDS, except for the personal-social behavior domain (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Compared with TD children, children with ASD have a longer screen time.
The screen time is related to autism-like symptoms and the DQs of children with ASD.
The longer the screen time, the more severe the symptoms of ASD (especially sensory
symptoms), and the more obvious the developmental delay, especially in ASD children
with a longer screen time and younger age, particularly in the language domain.

Screen Time and Autism
INTRODUCTION
Autism
spectrum
disorder
(ASD)
is
a
type
of
neurodevelopmental
disorder
characterized
by
persistent
deﬁcits in social communication and interaction and stereotyped
or repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities.
The prevalence of autism is increasing yearly, and the
latest report indicates that the prevalence of autism is 1/54
individuals (1). Autism is a serious disease that aﬀects children’s
social adaptability.
The level of early childhood development is related to many
factors, including prenatal and postnatal factors. The postnatal
factors include biological factors and social-economic factors. In
recent years, the widespread use of electronic screens seems to
have played a signiﬁcant role in early childhood development
and, may be considered a social-economic factor. Electronic
screen media play an increasingly vital role in the entertainment
of not only typically developing (TD) children but also children
with neurodevelopmental disabilities. So-called screen time
mainly consists of time spent watching television or using a
computer, tablet computer, or smart mobile phone (2). Children
usually spend their screen time watching cartoons and movies,
playing video games, using social media and, occasionally,
learning (3).
The current situation of children’s screen time from the
toddler years to adolescence is extremely severe. Studies have
shown that a large proportion of very young children living in
Australia were exposed to screens for >2 h per day and that
40% of infants aged under 18 months used screens for longer
than the time speciﬁed in the current recommended guidelines
(4). The average daily screen time of preschool children in the
United States was found to be as high as 4.1 h, and more than
half of children had a daily video time >2 h (5). The Active
Healthy Kids Global Alliance surveyed children and youth in 42
countries across 6 continents (representing 60% of the world’s
population) (6). These ﬁndings of children and youth revealed
that 62% of 13-year-olds and 63% of 15-year-olds watched over
2 h of television per day on weekdays and weekends (6). The
US and European countries as well as Asian countries face this
problem. A study in Japan reported that 29.4% of children aged
under 18 months and 24.5% of children aged under 30 months
watched TV for more than 4 h a day (7). In China, a study
involving 27,200 children aged 3–6 years showed that the average
daily screen time of preschool children was 1.81 h and that the
percentage of children who had >1 h/d of screen time was 62.4%
(8). A survey of 20,324 kindergarten children aged 3–4 years
in 2018 showed that the average screen time of preschoolers in
Shanghai was 170.2 min/day and that 78.6% of children had an
average screen time of more than 1 h per day (9). The latest
study in Shandong Province in China in 2019 found that the
average daily screen time of 2,131 children aged 4–6 years was
over 1.5 h. Research has also explored the age of children’s ﬁrst
exposure to electronic devices. The average age is 2.25 years,
and the youngest age at ﬁrst exposure to electronic devices is 3
months (0.25 years). Studies have also analyzed the screen time
of children in diﬀerent age groups. The average daily electronic
screen time of children aged 4–5 years is 1.52 ± 1.24 h. The two
results above both exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) recommendations (10).
Excessive screen time has several negative eﬀects in the early
development of children. Extended screen time does much more
harm than good with negative physiological, cognitive, social,
emotional, and legal consequences (11, 12). A long screen time
may be linked to negative outcomes in child development,
such as poor academic performance (13, 14), obesity (16), and
sleep problems (17, 18). Studies have reported that excessive
screen time may also lead to social behavior deﬁcits (7) or
attention problems (19, 20), especially during critical periods
of development. Based on the above reasons, the AAP also
recommends that parents avoid exposing children younger than 2
years to digital devices and limit the screen time of children aged
2–5 years to 1 h per day (10). In addition, a longer screen time
is associated with poorer performance on developmental tests;
a 2019 study of 2,441 children in Canada showed that higher
levels of screen time at 24 and 36 months were signiﬁcantly
associated with poorer performance on developmental screening
tests at 36 and 60 months. The study provided strong evidence
of the correlation between screen time and child development
(21). The problem of screen exposure plays an important role in
child development.
Studies investigating screen time in children with ASD have
also been reported in the literature. Healy et al. found that
children with ASD had a longer screen time and less physical
activity than TD children (22). In addition, because of their
lower activity rate and longer screen time, children with ASD
were more commonly overweight or obese than TD children
(23). Must et al. reported that children with ASD spent more
time in sedentary pursuits than TD children and that the
major component driving sedentary behavior was screen time
(2). Nevertheless, not all studies reached the same conclusions.
Montes conducted a large sample study involving 1,393 children
with ASD and 64,163 TD children and concluded that half of
US children aged 6–17 years exceeded the AAP-recommended
screen time and that children with ASD had amounts of total
screen time similar to those of children without ASD. However,
children with ASD constituted a higher proportion of children
who were high screen users (>2 h/day) (24).
Wu X demonstrated that screen time might be correlated with
some autistic-like symptoms (25), but few studies focused on the
correlation between screen time and the developmental levels of
children with ASD. Therefore, our study compares the screen
time of TD children with that of children with ASD to determine
whether children with autism have a longer screen time. Then,
we explored the correlation between the screen time and the
autistic symptoms and development quotients (DQs) of children
with ASD.

Screen Time and Autism
November 2019 and August 2020 were selected as the ASD group.
The age of the ASD children was 39.33 ± 17.4 months. During
the same period, 57 neurotypical children who underwent
regular physical examinations in our outpatient department were
recruited as the TD group. The age of the TD children was 40.64
± 20.0 months. The inclusion criterion for the children with ASD
was that the ADOS-2 was used to diagnose the children for the
ﬁrst time without systemic intervention. The inclusion criteria for
the children with typical development were as follows: children
undergoing routine physical examinations in outpatient clinics;
children with height and weight development within the normal
range; children with a DQ above 85 in all domains of the Gesell
Development Schedule (GDS); and children whose outpatient
doctors’ mental examination clearly indicated that they do not
meet the ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders’ diagnostic
criteria in the DSM-5. Children with severe physical disability,
cardiopulmonary disease or uncontrolled epilepsy were excluded.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of our
hospital, and informed consent was provided by the parents or
caregivers of the children who participated.
Procedure
We collected information regarding the average daily screen
time and general information, including sex, age, height, and
weight, from the two groups of children. The children in the
ASD group were assessed using the Autism Behavior Checklist
(ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and GDS. The
children with typical development were assessed using only the
GDS. We compared the general information and screen time of
the ASD group with those of the TD group. Then, we analyzed
the correlation between the screen time and the ASD-related scale
scores and DQs of the GDS in the ASD group. We further divided
the ASD group into subgroups according to the screen time and
age. Then, we separately analyzed the correlations between the
screen time and the ASD-related scale scores and DQs of the GDS
by subgroup.
All scale assessments, background information investigations,
and developmental tests were performed by systematically
trained assessors with good consistency. All clinical data are
uniformly managed by a physician in our research group.
Screen Time Survey
After the children completed the Gesell Developmental Schedule,
the evaluator investigated the children’s screen time. In our study,
screen time measures the total amount of time that the children
were exposed to various electronic screens, such as watching
TV, using computers, playing games, and using mobile phones,
during the week before the survey. We investigated the screen
time on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekends (Saturday
and Sunday). The evaluator calculated and recorded the average
daily screen time of the children using the following formula:
average daily screen time (h) = [screen time per day on weekdays
(h) × 5 + screen time per day on weekends (h) × 2]/7.
The GDS is currently a very widely used neurodevelopmental
scale with good reliability and validity (26, 27). The GDS
divides children’s neurodevelopment into ﬁve domains, namely,

adaptability, gross motor, ﬁne motor, language and personal-
social. The developmental quotient of the ﬁve domains is used to
evaluate the level of neurodevelopment. The developmental age
(DA) was derived from the tests, and the chronological age (CA)
was calculated as the date of assessment minus the date of birth
as follows: DQs = DA × 100/CA (28). The higher the DQ, the
better the neurodevelopment.
The symptom evaluation scales included the ABC and the
CARS. The ABC is a 57-item screening checklist for autism
containing 5 subscales (i.e., body behavior, sensory, self-care,
language and social interaction). The ABC is designed for parent
interviews. The CARS was developed by Schopler and Reichler et
al. and used as a diagnostic scale. The CARS consists of 15 scales,
and each scale is scored on a continuum from normal to severely
abnormal. The CARS requires observation of the performance of
ASD children in a consulting room. The reliability and validity of
the ABC and CARS are suﬃciently good in China (29), reﬂecting
the scales’ usefulness for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of
ASD symptoms.
Statistical Methods
SPSS 23.0 statistical software was used for the statistical analysis.
The means ± standard deviations of the two groups’ basic
data were normally distributed. Two independent-sample t-
tests were used for the comparisons between the groups. The
enumeration data are presented as N (%), and the diﬀerences
between the two groups were measured by chi-square tests.
A Pearson linear correlation analysis was used to analyze
the two normally distributed variables, and a Spearman rank
correlation analysis was used to analyze the two nonnormally
distributed variables.
RESULTS
Demographic Data and Screen Time in the
ASD Group and TD Group
There were no diﬀerences in sex, age or body mass index (BMI)
between the ASD group and the TD group (P = 0.617, 0.669,
and 0.113, respectively). The screen time in the ASD group was
signiﬁcantly longer than that in the TD group (3.34 ± 2.64
h/day vs. 0.91 ± 0.93 h/day, P = 0.001). The details are shown
in Table 1.

Correlations Between Screen Time and
ASD Symptoms and DQs in Children With
ASD
The results of the Pearson rank correlation test showed that the
screen time of the children with ASD was positively correlated
with the total score of CARS (r = 0.242, P = 0.021) and
“taste, smell and touch” item of CARS(r = 0.304, P = 0.005),
and negatively correlated with the language DQ (r = −0.236,
P = 0.047). The screen time of the children with ASD was
not correlated with the ABC score (r = 0.107, P = 0.316)
and other domains (adaptive behavior, gross motor, ﬁne motor
and personal-social behavior) (r = −0.051, 0.022, −0.190,
and −0.057, respectively, P = 0.672, 0.856, 0.113, and 0.642,
respectively) of GDS. The details are shown in Table 2.
We divided the ASD group into a longer screen time subgroup
and a shorter screen time subgroup based on the mean screen
time (3.34 h/d) of the children with ASD. The longer screen
time subgroup was deﬁned as ST ≥3.34 h/day, and the shorter
screen time subgroup was deﬁned as ST < 3.34 h/day. The
longer screen time subgroup included 44 ASD children, and the
average screen time was 5.81 ± 1.93 h/d. The shorter screen time
subgroup included 57 ASD children, and the average screen time
was 1.43 ± 1.02 h/d. We calculated the correlations between the
screen time and the ASD-related scale scores and DQs in the
two subgroups of children with ASD. The results showed that
among the children with ASD with a screen time longer than
3.34 h per day, the screen time was positively correlated with the
CARS score (r = 0.355, P = 0.026) and negatively correlated
with the DQs of all domains of the GDS (see details in Table 3).
However, we did not ﬁnd any correlation between the screen time
and the ASD-related scale scores or the DQs in the shorter screen
time subgroup.
In addition, we divided the ASD group into an older group
and a younger group according to the average age (39 months) to
determine whether the screen time was correlated with the ASD
symptoms and DQs in these two subgroups. The older subgroup
was deﬁned as an age ≥39 m, and the younger subgroup was
deﬁned as an age <39 m. The older subgroup included 48 ASD
children, and the average age was 56.46 ± 16.45 m. The younger
subgroup included 53 ASD children, and the average age was
29.00 ± 6.07 m. The results showed that in the younger subgroup,
screen time was positively correlated with the CARS score (r =
0.314, P = 0.021) and negatively correlated with the adaptive
behavior (r = −0.301, P = 0.040), gross motor (r = −0.307,
P = 0.036), ﬁne motor (r = −0.335, P = 0.021) and language
(r = −0.386, P = 0.007) DQs of the GDS (see details in Table 4).
However, we did not ﬁnd any correlation between the screen time
and the ASD-related scale scores or DQs in the older subgroup.

DISCUSSION
The main ﬁndings of this study are as follows: 1. the screen time
of children with ASD was longer than that of TD children, and 2.
The screen time was related to the autistic symptoms and DQs of
the children with ASD.
The Screen Time of the Children With ASD
Was Longer Than That of the TD Children
A study conducted by Chonchaiya et al. in Thailand in 2011
showed that children with autism watched TV earlier and more
frequently than TD children (30). The average age when children
start watching TV was 6.44 months, and the average screen
time was 4.60 h/d. Mazurek et al. studied the screen time of
children with ASD aged 8–18 years and compared with that of
their TD siblings and found that the average screen time of the
ASD children was 4.5 h/d, which was signiﬁcantly longer than
that of their siblings (15). Other studies have reached similar
conclusions. As previously mentioned, the problem of excessive
screen time among ASD children is very serious.
In our study, we found that the screen time in the ASD
group was signiﬁcantly longer than that in the TD group. The
mean screen time of the children with ASD was approximately
3.34 ± 2.64 h/day; nevertheless, the screen time of the TD
children was only 0.91 ± 0.93 h/day, which is consistent with
the results of most previous studies. Although many studies have
reported that a longer screen time is associated with children
with ASD being overweight compared to TD children (31), we
did not observe that the children with ASD had a greater BMI
than the children with TD. The screen time of ASD children is
excessive, causing them to spend less time engaging in outdoor
activities than normal children, which may be a reason for the
high BMI of ASD children. However, our study did not observe
diﬀerences in BMI between the children with TD and children
with ASD. The reasons may be as follows. First, we did not
investigate the children’s outdoor activities. Second, all children
in this region have limited access to outdoor activities, which
may lead to greater homogeneity in BMI. The study province
is located in northeastern China, which has high latitudes, short
winter sunshine hours, cold weather, and low temperatures and
is not suitable for children’s outdoor activities. Thus, the lack of
a diﬀerence in outdoor activity time may explain the lack of a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in BMI between the children with ASD and
the TD children. Therefore, such investigations should be carried
out in further studies with expanded sample sizes.
Screen Time Was Related to Autistic
Symptoms
Adverse environmental factors constitute an important factor
aﬀecting the clinical symptoms of children with ASD. Excessive
screen time has adverse eﬀects on children’s social participation
and behavior regulation (32, 33). Yousef’s study found that a
screen time > 2 h/d among school-age children was positively
correlated with children’s autism-like symptoms (34). Our results
showed that the screen time was positively correlated with the
CARS score. The CARS is a standardized diagnostic scale that, to
some extent, reﬂects the severity of autism-like symptoms. Our
results demonstrate that the longer the screen time, the more
obvious the autistic symptoms. We did not observe a correlation
between the screen time and the ABC scale score, which may be
due to the bias of the ABC as a parent-reported scale. All patients
included in our study were newly diagnosed. Parents usually visit
a doctor due to their child’s language impairment and are often
unwilling to admit social and autism-related issues. In addition,
many families have elderly family members and nannies as the
main caregivers of children. Sometimes, parents’ knowledge of
their children’s performance is limited, resulting in bias in the
ABC scale. As a result, the ABC scale score might be low and not
completely and accurately reﬂect autism symptoms. The CARS
scale is completed by professionals based on observations and can
avoid this problem.
In addition, we conducted correlation study on the screen
time of children with ASD and the 15 items of the CARS
scale, in order to further observe which aspect of the symptoms
of children with ASD is aﬀected by the screen exposure. The
results showed that there is a positive correlation between the
screen time of children with ASD and the score of “taste, smell
and touch” item. Till now, no research has been done on this
subject. It is speculated that the reasons may be as follows: First,
this phenomenon is related to abnormal sensory development
in children with autism, and children with obvious sensory
abnormalities are more likely to be fond of the visual stimulation
brought by screen exposure. Second, it may be due to the
long exposure time of the screen, which caused the abnormal

Screen Time and Autism
development of its sensory pathways and neurodevelopment.
However, this is a cross-sectional study, and causality cannot be
inferred. In the future, we look forward to a related cohort study
to clarify it.
The subgroup analysis showed that the correlation between
the screen time and the CARS score was statistically signiﬁcant
in the subgroups with a longer screen time and subgroups with
a younger age, while no statistical correlation was observed in
the subgroups with a shorter screen time and an older age.
This result is consistent with our expectations. ASD is closely
related to brain development. Studies have shown that during
the early postnatal period or even before birth, the brain of ASD
children has multiple neurological defects. The brain undergoes
rapid development early after birth and is inﬂuenced by the
developmental environment (35–37). Therefore, we speculate
that the longer children with autism are exposed to unfavorable
environmental factors, the lower their brain maturity, and the
more obvious their developmental delay and autistic symptoms.
Obviously, a longer screen time is a type of unfavorable
environment factor. Thus, we speculate that a longer screen time
resulted in shorter play time, shorter companionship time with
caregivers and shorter interaction time, resulting in worse social
behavior and more obvious autism symptoms. However, this
interaction requires further exploration.
Screen Time Was Related to the DQs of the
Children With ASD
The screen time was related to the development of language
in the children with ASD in this study. The younger the age
and the longer the screen exposure time, the more serious the
impact on language development. Hermawati reported that early
exposure to electronic media in early life (an age < 2 years)
had a negative impact on language (38). Chonchaiya et al. found
that children who started watching TV as early as 12 months
and watched TV for more than 2 h a day were six times more
likely to have language delays. This ﬁnding is consistent with our
research results. Our Spearman rank correlation results showed
that the screen time was negatively correlated with the language
DQ in the children with ASD; the longer the screen time, the
lower the language DQ. This result was also observed in the ASD
subgroup with a longer screen time and the subgroup with a
younger age, indicating that the screen time was strongly related
to the language DQ.
The screen time was related to not only the language DQ
but also the other DQs. A longer screen time restricts the
development of physical activities and gross motor ability and
limits the development of toy operation ability, which is related
to ﬁne motor ability, adaptive behaviors and cognitive levels.
Dadson reported that the screen time aﬀected ﬁne motor
ability and visual-motor integration. Playing with toys and
using object substitution in play can oﬀset these eﬀects to
some degree (39). The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology
recommended that for the development of motor skills and
cognitive skills, young infants and toddlers should minimize
the time spent sitting for a long time (40). One of the most
important aspects of sedentary behavior is screen time. It is
recommended that children aged under 2 years avoid contact
with electronic products to limit this contact as much as possible
(40). A longer screen time also limits the development of
social skills, further aﬀecting cognitive ability as feedback since
the development of children’s cognition is derived more from
social interaction, family education and parent-child games than
from electronic screens and video animation. Previous studies
concluded that screen time was unfavorably associated with
social skills throughout early childhood (41), which is a ﬁnding
further emphasized in our study. We found that the screen
time was negatively correlated with the other DQs in the longer
screen time subgroup and younger age subgroup. Obviously,
the younger the age, the more the development level is aﬀected
by external factors. We conducted only a simple preliminary
investigation of the correlation between the screen time and DQs,
and this result needs to be replicated in further studies with larger
sample sizes.
LIMITATIONS
Studies have reported that living in a lower-income household,
being a minority, living with parents who have lower education
levels and being a male are associated with more screen time
in the US (24). However, our study did not match the ASD
and TD children based on these factors and instead used only
randomly surveyed outpatients to observe these phenomena.
Further research should consider the impact of these factors.
We did not categorize the type of screen exposure, such as
exposure to cartoons, video games or educational nursery rhymes
or programs, in detail; thus, the potential beneﬁts of electronic
screens may have been ignored, and these beneﬁts may play a
role in future ASD interventions. These interventions may help
children limit their screen time to a reasonable duration, but the
ability to do so is diﬃcult to ensure.
CONCLUSION
The screen time of children with ASD is longer than that of
neurotypical children. The screen time is related to autistic
symptoms and the DQs of children with ASD. The correlation
between the screen time and DQs may be more pronounced
in children with ASD who have a longer screen time and
younger children with ASD. Whether reducing the screen time
has positive eﬀects on autism-like symptoms and DQs in children
with ASD requires further investigation.
