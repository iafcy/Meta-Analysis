Abstract
We used parent report data to investigate video game playing, aggression, and social impairment in adolescents with autism 
spectrum disorder. Parents of autistic adolescents were more likely to report that their child plays video games as a hobby 
compared to parents of adolescents with typical development and also reported that their children spent more time playing 
video games. For autistic participants, we found no differences in aggression levels or social impairment when comparing 
players versus non-players. However, playing video games “more than average,” as compared to “average” was associated 
with greater aggression and greater social impairment on “awareness” and “mannerisms” subscales. Future studies should 
focus on how type of video game(s) played is associated with these clinically important variables.

In the twenty-first century, and especially in the United 
States (US), video games are ubiquitous. There are nearly 
227 million total video game players in the US, with 51% 
playing over 7 h per week (2021 Essential Facts About the 
Video Game Industry, 2021). Seventy-six percent of Ameri-
can kids under 18 are classified as video game players (2021 
Essential Facts About the Video Game Industry, 2021) and 
90% of teens age 13–17 report that they play some type of 
video game (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Eighty-three percent 
of teen girls report playing video games while 97% of teen 
boys report playing video games (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). 
A study of typically developing (TD) 6–12-year-olds showed 
that time spent playing video games averaged 1.3 h per day 
(Swing et al., 2010), and boys play for a significantly longer 
amount of time compared to girls (Gentile, 2009; Marshall 
et al., 2006).
Extensive research endeavors have investigated the posi-
tives and negatives of video game playing on youth. The 
negatives are heavily publicized and consist of warnings 
of addiction (Griffiths & Meredith, 2009), decreased social 
interaction (Anderson et al., 2010), and potential complex 
internal psychological processes that can produce increases 
in violence and aggression in players (Granic et al., 2014). 
On the other hand, video games can provide benefits in 
the social, emotional, motivational, and cognitive domains 
(Granic et al., 2014).
One of the most controversial topics in video game 
research is the heavily debated link between video games 
(specifically violent video games) and aggression and vio-
lence. An early study (Anderson & Dill, 2000) and a large 
meta-analysis (Anderson et al., 2010) concluded that “the 
evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video 
games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive 
behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and 
for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior” (Anderson 
et al., 2010). However, several studies and meta-analyses 
have countered the claims in Anderson and Dill (2000) and 
Anderson et al. (2010) (e.g., Ferguson, 2011, 2015; Fergu-
son et al., 2008). In addition, a recently published 10-year 
longitudinal study confirms no link between playing violent 
video games as early as 10 years old and aggressive behavior 
later in life (Coyne & Stockdale, 2021), and an American 
Psychiatric Association [APA] meta-analysis (2015) found

no link between violent video games and aggression (Fer-
guson et al., 2020).
In recent years, there has been an increase in the empiri-
cal study of video game play in autistic youth. As a whole, 
studies have shown that children with autism spectrum dis-
order (ASD) spend a large amount of time playing video 
games (Mazurek et al., 2011; Orsmond & Kuo, 2011; 
Shane & Albert, 2008), have difficulty stopping video 
game sessions (Nally et al., 2000), and are more likely to 
exhibit video game addiction or preoccupation than their 
TD peers (Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2012). Mazurek and Wen-
strup (2012) reported that children with ASD played video 
games an average of 2.0 h per weekday (2.4 h for males; 
1.8 h for females) compared to the 1.3 h for TD (1.6 h for 
males; 0.8 h for females). Similarly, 41.4% of autistic ado-
lescents chose to spend most of their free time playing video 
games, as compared to 18% of their TD peers (Mazurek 
et al., 2011). Increased playing time for children with either 
ASD or TD can lead to problems, including an umbrella of 
issues referred to as problematic video game behavior (Grif-
fiths & Davies, 2005). Problematic video game behavior is 
of high clinical relevance due to its association with symp-
toms such as depression, anxiety, social isolation, fatigue, 
poor academic performance, and even video game addiction 
(Craig et al., 2021). Importantly, studies have shown that 
problematic video game behavior is common in individuals 
with neurodevelopmental disorders (Andreassen et al., 2016; 
González-Bueso et al., 2018). Core characteristics of ASD, 
such as impairment in social and communication skills and 
engagement in restricted and repetitive behaviors, can be 
associated with problematic video game playing (Engelhardt 
et al., 2013; Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013). Lastly, it has 
been well documented that children with ASD are often tar-
gets of bullying behaviors, with almost 50% of autistic chil-
dren reporting being bullied (Maïano et al., 2015). Although 
it is not as well-documented, children with ASD may also 
act as bullying perpetrators. In Maïano et al., 2015’s meta-
analysis, (17 studies, 5000 + participants with ASD) they 
revealed that general school bullying perpetration (physical, 
verbal, and/or relational) is estimated to occur in 10% of 
school-aged autistic youth, which is similar to the percent-
age of TD peers who exhibit bullying behaviors. With an 
ever-increasing population of children playing video games, 
there is concern that cyber-bullying, which already occurs 
fairly frequently via video games (Patchin, 2018), will also 
affect an already vulnerable population of children as either 
victims, perpetrators, or victim-perpetrators. To date there 
is a lack of research on the rates of cyberbullying in video 
games specifically for autistic youth.
There are also benefits of playing video games, both 
for players with autism and with TD (Granic et al., 2014; 
Wiederhold, 2021). For children with TD, video games 
lead to positive interactions such as making new friends, 
competitive fun, or having an instant icebreaker (Kutner 
& Olson, 2011). For youth with ASD, video games (as an 
extension of online, asynchronous communication) may 
increase social functioning by offering opportunities for 
social interaction with decreased requirements for reading 
nonverbal cues and facial expressions, and for interpreting 
gestures (Walther, 2007). Additional research is needed to 
investigate whether the specific benefits of video game play-
ing found in TD extend to ASD, and vice-versa.
Aggression and social impairment are two areas of 
research that are pertinent to core characteristics of ASD 
and the overall body of video game research. Aggression is a 
broad term that can incorporate many feelings and behaviors, 
such as arguing, screaming, destroying property, threatening, 
fighting, or attacking others (Mazurek et al., 2013). In addi-
tion to behaviors typically associated with aggression, chil-
dren with ASD can present with other maladaptive behaviors 
such as self-injury, tantrums, and irritability (Erickson et al., 
2016). Dominick et al. (2007) reported that 32.8% of school-
age children with ASD display aggressive behaviors. On the 
other hand, a large-scale study of 1380 children and adoles-
cents with ASD found that 56% were engaging in some form 
of aggressive action(s) at the time of assessment (Kanne & 
Mazurek, 2010). While research into aggression, and more 
specifically violence, associated with video gaming in TD 
samples is extensive, historically this has not been investi-
gated as extensively ASD samples (Mazurek & Engelhardt, 
2013). However, a recent study has shown that video game 
use is not related to negative behaviors in ASD (Alkhayat 
& Ibrahim, 2020). In Alkhayat and Ibrahim (2020), there 
was no correlation between duration of video game playing 
and negative behaviors associated with video game playing 
(such as isolation, poor school performance, playing games 
past bedtime, and agitation) for autistic children. While this 
study assessed negative behaviors more generally, the ques-
tionnaire assessing negative behaviors did query “Does your 
child beat, scream, or get angry if someone interrupts him/
her while playing electronic games?”
Impairments in social interaction and communication are 
among the core diagnostic criteria for ASD according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
Edition (DSM-5; APA, 2013). A common misconception in 
the world of video games, especially those created decades 
ago when online communication was not as ubiquitous, is 
that players are socially isolated and spend most of their time 
alone when gaming, thereby impairing their social function-
ing (Lenhart et al., 2008). This idea that video games can 
exacerbate impairments in social functioning is common 
when considering youth with ASD. However, there is a 
growing body of research that supports the social benefits 
of gaming in TD, in terms of playing games with friends, 
playing competitively or cooperatively, and engaging in 
massive online communities for popular games that require

teamwork and (virtual) communication (Granic et al., 2014). 
Ultimately, there is considerable evidence for both pros and 
cons of video games in respect to social aspects in TD, but 
there has been little research looking at the specific effects of 
video game playing on social impairment in ASD. However, 
Alkhayat and Ibrahim (2020) recently showed that families 
playing video games with their children, using video games 
to calm children, and having parental rules about which 
video games can be played, were factors associated with 
positive behaviors in relation to video game playing, such 
as improved communication and social skills and appropri-
ate behaviors.
The objective of the current study was threefold: First, we 
compared video game playing status (whether participants 
played or not) and video game playing amount in adolescent 
participants with ASD and a non-autistic control group (TD) 
matched on FSIQ and sex. We also investigated video game 
playing status and amount in our ASD and TD groups while 
accounting for sex. Second, we examined the association 
between video game play and aggression within individuals 
with ASD. Finally, we investigated the association between 
video game playing and social impairment in adolescents 
with ASD. Based on previous research, we expected our 
cohort of autistic participants to spend more time playing 
video games than their TD peers. We anticipated that aggres-
sion would not be elevated in adolescents with ASD who are 
avid video game players due to recent research showing that 
aggression is not associated with video game playing in TD. 
Lastly, in light of research suggesting that video games can 
have a positive social benefit in those without ASD (Granic 
et al., 2014), we hypothesized that video game playing 
would be associated with lower scores on a measure of social 
impairment in our already impacted autistic adolescents.
Methods
Participants
Participants were enrolled in either of two longitudinal 
studies: the Cognitive Control in Autism (CoCoA) study or 
the Autism Phenome Project (APP) study conducted at the 
University of California (UC) Davis MIND Institute. Both 
studies had protocols that included the same assessments for 
hobbies, aggressive symptoms, and social functioning (see 
below for a detailed description of measures). To qualify 
for either study, autistic participants had to have a clinical 
best estimate diagnosis of autism which included presenting 
with a community diagnosis of ASD, and meeting criteria 
for autism on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Sched-
ule—Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2000, 2012), 
which was administered by a research-reliable licensed clini-
cal psychologist at the UC Davis MIND Institute, as well as 
meet other study-specific criteria detailed below. Both stud-
ies also included a typically developing, non-autistic, control 
group that was screened for autism before enrollment.
For the CoCoA study, autistic participants also needed 
to meet criteria on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
(DSM-5) Checklist (APA, 2013) for ASD. The Social Com-
munication Questionnaire—Lifetime Edition (SCQ; Rutter 
et al., 2003) was used as a screen for ASD in the potential 
TD participants. Given that a total score of ≥ 15 on the SCQ 
is consistent with a diagnosis of ASD, all participants in the 
TD group were required to have an SCQ total score of ≤ 11, 
which is consistent with not having ASD (Berument et al., 
1999; Rutter et al., 2003). In addition, TDs in the CoCoA 
study exhibited no social communication disorders on a 
DSM-5 based symptom checklist and had no first-degree 
relatives with ASD. Lastly, in the CoCoA study, both autis-
tic and TD individuals were required to have a Wechsler 
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence—Second Edition (WASI-
II; Wechsler, 1999, 2011) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient 
(FSIQ) ≥ 70, no other reported neurodevelopmental disor-
ders (except for ADHD in ASD participants), and no history 
of seizure disorders. TD participants had no parent-reported 
Axis 1 psychopathology. Because the CoCoA study included 
MRI scanning, TD and ASD participants could only be 
enrolled if they were not taking psychotropic medications 
(with the exception of ADHD medications in ASD partici-
pants). ASD participants could enroll if they had comor-
bid psychiatric disorders (such as anxiety or depression), 
provided they were not taking psychotropic medications. 
Data from CoCoA Timepoint 1 (T1) for participants aged 
12–17 years have been included in the presented analyses 
because data on video game playing were collected through 
a questionnaire designed for those ≤ 17 years of age.
For the APP study, inclusion criteria were estab-
lished when participants initially enrolled in the study at 
2–3.5 years of age (T1) and were based on the National 
Institutes of Health Collaborative Programs of Excellence 
in Autism diagnostic standards. They were then reassessed 
approximately one year after T1 (T2), two years after T2 
(T3), and at ages 9–12 (T4). The current analyses use data 
from T4. Autistic participants were re-assessed with the 
ADOS-2 and SCQ (Rutter et al., 2003) at T4 to ensure that 
they continued to meet diagnostic criteria for ASD. Control 
participants are non-autistic children who were screened 
using the SCQ (for scores ≤ 11) at each timepoint and did 
not have a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, Pervasive 
Developmental Disorder, or Specific Language Impairment. 
Both ASD and TD children had English as their primary 
language, resided with at least one biological parent, and 
were not diagnosed with any motor, vision, hearing, or other 
chronic health issue that would limit study participation. Full 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for APP are detailed in Kerns 
et al. (2021). All diagnoses (ASD/TD) were reaffirmed via

testing at T4. The APP sample includes a wide range of 
developmental and cognitive profiles. Due to this being a 
case-matched study sample (see below), many of the indi-
viduals in the APP study with lower IQs, including some 
with intellectual disability, were not included in the main 
analyses.
Both the CoCoA and APP studies were approved by the 
UC Davis Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was 
obtained from the parent or guardian of each participant, and 
each participant provided assent if capable.
A total of 151 ASD (109 APP, 42 CoCoA) and 114 (70 
APP, 44 CoCoA) TD participants met inclusion criteria. Two 
additional participants (ASD) were removed because their 
data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which 
could affect video gaming habits. Data from all remaining 
participants was collected prior to the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic. These participants were submitted to an auto-
mated greedy matching algorithm (http://​bioin​forma​ticst​
ools.​mayo.​edu/​resea​rch/​gmatch/) to identify a 1:1 matched 
sample. The algorithm allowed us to set a maximum differ-
ence on FSIQ (7 points) and require an exact match on sex 
and study when selecting a match. The final sample included 
76 ASD-TD matched pairs. Participant characteristics are 
provided in Table 1.
One hundred and eleven participants (73 ASD; 38 TD) 
were removed from the sample after case matching. Half of 
the removed TD participants had an FSIQ above 120, while 
the majority of the ASD participants removed had FSIQs 
below 90. About half of the ASD participants removed 
(n = 36) had an FSIQ < 70, and FSIQ could not be com-
puted for an additional two participants; one due to a lack 
of comprehension during the IQ assessment, and another 
due to behavioral difficulties during the testing session. Chil-
dren with intellectual disability, which is diagnosed when 
there are deficits in intellectual functioning (FSIQ < 70) and 
adaptive behavior (APA, 2013), play video games less com-
pared to ASD and TD children without intellectual disability 
(Mazurek et al., 2011; Rodríguez Jiménez et al., 2015). In a 
separate analysis we compared our ASD participants with 
FSIQ < 70 to our ASD participants with FSIQ ≥ 70 (for par-
ticipant characteristics see Supplemental Table 1).
Measures
ADOS‑2 & SCQ (Autism Screening)
ASD symptoms and severity were evaluated using two 
gold-standard diagnostic assessments/interviews. First, 
the semi-structured standardized observation, the ADOS-2 
(Lord et al., 2000, 2012), was administered by licensed clini-
cians at the UC Davis MIND Institute, yielding a total score 
and a Calibrated Severity Score (CSS; Gotham et al., 2009) 
which was used to compare scores across modules (with a 
CSS ≥ 4 necessary for ASD). The SCQ (Rutter et al., 2003), 
which is a 40 question, dichotomous, behavioral checklist 
that can be used as a proxy for autism characteristics (Adams 
et al., 2019; Westerveld et al., 2017) was administered to all 
participants.
WASI‑II & DAS‑II
The CoCoA study used the WASI-II to measure intellectual 
ability (Weschler, 2011). After completing the four subtests, 
FSIQ, verbal comprehension (verbal IQ), and perceptual 
reasoning (nonverbal IQ) scores were produced. The APP 
study used the Differential Ability Scales – Second Edition 
(DAS-II; Elliot, 2007) as their standard assessment for meas-
uring intelligence. The General Conceptual Ability (GCA)

CBCL
The Child Behavior Checklist/6–18 years (CBCL; Achen-
bach & Rescorla, 2001), is a commonly used parent report 
questionnaire including a range of problematic behaviors and 
emotions that map to eight syndrome scales and six DSM-
oriented scales. The CBCL Aggressive Behavior Syndrome 
Scale is a compilation of 18 individual item scores/responses 
and was used to assess aggression. Examples include physi-
cal aggression, teasing, threatening, noncompliance, and 
destruction of items. The CBCL provides an age and gender 
adjusted T-Score, percentile, and a qualitative description 
(normal, borderline clinical, clinical). T-Scores ≥ 70 indicate 
clinical significance. Due to very low levels of aggression 
in the TD group (61% with an average or below average 
T-score; 3% with a borderline clinical T-score, and 0% with 
a clinical range T-score), aggression analyses were restricted 
to the ASD group, which had a broader range of Aggres-
sion T-scores (only 27% with an average or below average 
T-score; 13% with a borderline clinical T-score and 3% 
with a clinical range T-score). Table 2 includes the CBCL 
Aggression mean T-Score for each diagnostic group.
The front page of the CBCL provides parents with a 
“hobbies” section that includes blank lines in which par-
ents can write in up to three of their child’s hobbies (e.g., 
video games, dolls, reading, piano, etc.), or select none, 
based on an open-ended question as a prompt (“Please list 
your child’s favorite hobbies, activities, and games, other 
than sports.”). Participants were divided into “Player” and 
“Non-player” groups based on the written responses to the 
“hobbies” prompt. Our accepted responses that indicate 
video game players include simple phrases such as “video 
games” and “computer games,” or more specific indicators 
such as “Xbox” or “Fortnite.” More general responses such 
as “computer” or “iPad” were also accepted. However, if 
further details provided indicated that video games were not 
being played on the electronic device (such as “watching 
movies on the iPad”) then the participant was categorized 
as a “Non-player.” To evaluate whether including the players 
with more general responses had an impact on our findings, 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis by rerunning the match-
ing algorithm and the main analyses after removing those 
participants.
Once a hobby is written in, there are four options to select 
from to answer the question: “Compared to others of the 
same age, about how much time does he/she spend in each?” 
The options are Less Than Average, Average, More Than 
Average, and Don’t Know. From these data we created four 
video game playing categories that reflect the amount of 
time spent playing video games: Video game not listed as 
a hobby (“don’t play”), play video games less than aver-
age (“less than average”), play video games an average 
amount of time (“average”), and play video games more 
than an average amount of time (“more than average”). Due 
to the limited information gained from the “don’t know” 
category, individuals whose parents made this response (1

TD, 3 ASD) were excluded from analyses that investigated 
amount of video game playing, although they were included 
in analyses investigating players versus non-players.
SRS‑2
Social functioning was assessed using the Social Respon-
siveness Scale—Second Edition (SRS-2; Constantino & 
Gruber, 2012). The SRS-2 is a 65-item parent report ques-
tionnaire to detect and quantify the severity of social impair-
ment across the autism spectrum. Responses on the SRS-2 
are used to calculate a total score and five treatment sub-
scale scores (M = 50, SD = 10): Social Awareness, Social 
Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and 
Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior (also referred to 
as “Mannerisms”). Elevated T-Scores (T-Scores ≥ 60) indi-
cate more clinically significant social difficulties (e.g., more 
ASD symptoms endorsed) within the chosen domain. Out of 
69 autistic participants with SRS-2 Total T-scores available 
(from our case matched sample), 55 had clinically significant 
social impairment (80%). Social impairment within the TD 
group was not analyzed due to the lack of the presence of 
this core symptom of ASD in most TD youth. Table 2 sum-
marizes the SRS-2 subscale T-Scores based on diagnostic 
group.
Statistical Methods
Differences in video game playing status between ASD 
and TD groups were assessed using chi-square tests. Man-
tel–Haenszel chi-square tests were used for amount of play-
ing categories, to account for the ordinality in the data. 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests were used to examine dif-
ferences in playing status and the amount of playing between 
ASD and TD groups while accounting for sex. Normality 
testing confirmed that aggression and social impairment 
data were not normally distributed, thus non-parametric tests 
(Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal–Wallis) were employed to 
test differences in these scores. Analyses of aggression and 
social impairment scores across playing status and amount 
of playing categories were restricted to ASD participants, 
given the limited range of these variables in TD. For each 
aggression and social impairment outcome, significant over-
all differences among amount of playing categories were 
followed up with the Dwass, Steel, Critchlow-Fligner post-
hoc procedure, which corrects for multiple comparisons, to 
determine which pairs of playing categories differed. All 
analyses were implemented using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All tests were two-sided, and p-val-
ues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Video Game Playing
There was a significant difference in video game playing 
status (Player/Non-player) between diagnostic groups [χ2 
(1, n = 152) = 6.80, p = 0.009], with parents of the autistic 
adolescents reporting video games as a hobby more fre-
quently than those of TD adolescents. Similarly, significant 
diagnostic group (ASD/TD) differences in the amount of 
playing (don’t play, play less than average, play average, 
play more than average) were found [Mantel–Haenszel χ2 
(1, n = 148) = 10.09, p = 0.002] (Fig. 1). These findings 
remained significant even when participants with more gen-
eral electronic-device related hobbies (such as “iPad”) were 
excluded from the analyses.
To control for the potential difference in video game 
playing behavior between females and males, we redid our 
main analyses adjusting for sex. The results of the adjusted 
analyses confirmed the main results. After adjusting for sex,

we found significant differences between ASD and TD in 
playing status (Player/Non-Player) [Cochran-Mantel–Haen-
szel χ2 (1, n = 152) = 8.17, p = 0.004] and amount of play-
ing (don’t play, play less than average, play average, play

playing category, broken down by diagnostic group and sex, 
are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1.
Lastly, we found a significant difference between our 
FSIQ-matched ASD participants and the ASD participants 
with FSIQ < 70 (removed from the FSIQ-matched sample) 
and video game playing status group (Player/Non-player) 
[χ2 (1, n = 147) = 18.03, p < 0.001]. Parents of autistic 
individuals with FSIQ < 70 reported video games as a 
hobby less frequently than the parents of ASD participants 
with FSIQ of 70 or greater. There were also significant dif-
ferences between the groups based on amount of playing 
(don’t play, play less than average, play average, play more 
than average), [Mantel–Haenszel χ2 (1, n = 141) = 15.68, 
p < 0.001] (Supplemental Fig. 2).

Aggressive Behavior
No significant differences were found in CBCL Aggres-
sion T-scores based on video game playing status (see 
Table 3). When using the amount of playing categories, 
CBCL Aggression T-scores were found to be significantly 
different [χ2 (3, n = 72) = 14.06, p = 0.003] (Table 4). Fol-
low-up post-hoc non-parametric pairwise comparisons 
were used to confirm that the significant difference was 
between the “more than average” (M = 59.0) and “average” 
group (M = 53.3) (z = 3.79, p < 0.001). No other compari-
sons were significant (Fig. 2a).

Social Impairment
No significant differences were found in SRS-2 Total 
T-Score for video game playing status. As presented in 
Table 3, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for each of the five SRS-2 
subscales comparative to video game playing status, were not 
significant. When considering the four categories for amount 
of playing, three of the five SRS-2 subscales were not sig-
nificant (Cognition, Communication, Motivation) (Table 4). 
The SRS-2 Total T-Score was significantly different across 
groups [χ2 (3, n = 66) = 7.87, p = 0.05], as were the SRS-2 
Awareness [χ2 (3, n = 68) = 8.57, p = 0.04] and Mannerisms 
[χ2 (3, n = 69) = 10.43, p = 0.02] subscales (Table 4). Post-
hoc non-parametric pairwise comparisons confirmed that 
the significant difference for the Awareness subscale was 
between the “play more than average” (M = 73.7) and “play 
average” group (M = 62.8) (z = 2.64, p = 0.04) (Fig. 2c). For 
the Mannerisms subscale the difference was also significant 
between the “play more than average” (M = 75.7) and “play 
average” group (M = 64.5) (z = 3.01, p = 0.01) (Fig. 2d). For 
SRS-2 Total, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were not sig-
nificant, although the difference between “play more than 
average” (M = 74.4) and “average” (M = 65.2) had a trend-
level p-value (z = 2.45, p = 0.07) (Fig. 2b).
Discussion
The current study investigated video game playing status 
(player vs. non-player) and amount of time spent playing 
video games (don’t play, less than average, average, more 
than average) in adolescents with ASD and TD, and also 
examined the association between video game playing and 
aggression and social impairment in adolescents with ASD. 
Parents of autistic participants reported their children as 
having video games as a hobby more often than parents of 
TD children. The analysis looking at amount of time spent 
playing video games also showed that ASD and TD differed 
significantly, with autistic adolescents more often falling 
into the “play more than average” category compared to TD 
(Fig. 1). Both of these findings remained significant when 
controlling for sex. Our data show that video game playing 
status is not associated with aggression in ASD. However, 
when considering the four playing amount categories, there 
was a significant difference driven by autistic adolescents 
whose parents report that they are playing more than average 
(versus an average amount of time) having greater aggres-
sion scores (Fig. 2a). There were no significant differences in 
SRS-2 Total T-Scores, or in any of the five SRS-2 subscales, 
when comparing ASD players versus non-players. When 
investigating the amount of playing categories for the SRS-
2, significant differences were found for the Total T-score as 
well as two of the five SRS-2 subscales (Social Awareness, 
Mannerisms). For both subscales, the “play more than aver-
age” group showed greater social deficits than the “play 
average” group, and the same was found at a trend-level for 
the Total T-score (Fig. 2b–d).
Due to low numbers of female participants (n = 16 per 
group) interpretation of our data on video game playing in 
girls is limited. However, it was surprising to see that ASD 
vs. TD differences in video game playing status appeared to 
be even more pronounced in girls than boys (Supplemental 
Fig. 1). This was driven by our finding that a large portion 
of our TD girls (75%) were not classified as video game 
players, which differs from recent reports showing that video 
game playing, while lower in girls than boys, is still highly 
prevalent in girls (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). This could be 
due to the nature of our measure. Many of these girls clas-
sified as “non-players” may play video games, but perhaps 
not frequently enough for the parent to list it as a hobby. This 
interesting finding does warrant future investigations into 
video game playing habits in autistic and TD girls, to see 
whether differences in video game play are more prevalent 
in females.
The finding that a greater than average amount of play-
ing time is associated with increased aggression is in dis-
cordance with Alkhayat and Ibrahim’s (2020) finding that 
duration of video game play is not associated with negative 
behaviors in autistic children. However, in Alkhayat and 
Ibrahim’s study, autistic and TD children did not differ in 
amount of time spent playing video games, which also dif-
fers from our findings, as well as other studies that have 
shown greater video game playing time in autistic popula-
tions (Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2012; Mazurek et al., 2011). 
Additionally, their negative behaviors variable encompassed 
many negative behaviors, and not aggression exclusively. 
Thus, there is a need for further research into aggression 
and video game playing in autism (Mazurek & Engelhardt, 
2013). Future research could be supplemented with a video 
game specific questionnaire that asks parents to delineate 
not only the exact amount of time played, but what genres 
of games are being played and the content within the spe-
cific game. In much of the TD research, the genre of the 
video game is a contributing factor in the various published 
aggression findings (Anderson & Dill, 2000; Anderson et al., 
2010), and it remains to be seen whether the same holds true 
for ASD.
The SRS-2 Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior 
(“Mannerisms”) subscale examines to what extent restricted, 
repetitive behaviors and interests are present. Video games 
often become a restricted interest in adolescents with ASD, 
as playing these games can morph from a leisurely hobby 
to an intense preoccupation. Thus, these findings agree with 
previous research showing that core symptoms of ASD, 
namely that the tendency to develop intense interests or 
encompassing preoccupations, plays a role in the extent of 

3576

video game playing (Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013). In short, 
restricted interests are “highly restricted, fixated interests 
that are abnormal in intensity or focus” (APA, 2013) *this 
needs a link to the reference whereas gaming addiction (also 
known as Gaming Disorder) requires at least 12 months of 
impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to 
gaming over other activities, and continuation or escala-
tion of gaming despite negative consequences (most often 
clinically significant distress/impairment in various areas of 
functioning) (Coutelle et al., 2021). Restricted interests are a 
core symptom of ASD while gaming addiction follows other 
addictions in utilizing a five-component model of behavioral 
addiction. Furthermore, Coutelle et al. (2021) suggest that 
high levels of video gaming in ASD can be explained by 
gaming addiction, but that the influence of restricted inter-
ests cannot be excluded. There is considerable evidence on 
either side of this debate (video gaming in ASD presenting 
as an addiction or a restricted interest) such that differen-
tiating between the two is difficult and an ongoing clinical 
dilemma in which there has been a continuing evolution 
of perspectives about diagnosis and treatment. Regardless 
of whether higher scores on the Restricted Interested and 
Repetitive Behavior (Mannerisms) subscale in autistic chil-
dren who play video games “more than average” represents 
a manifestation of the core symptoms of ASD or gaming 
addiction (or both), associations between video game play 
and this particular subscale are perhaps least surprising, 
and in isolation should not be interpreted as a more general 
association of video game playing and global social deficits.
The SRS-2 Awareness subscale refers to sensory aspects 
of reciprocal interactions and detection of social cues. Exam-
ples include awareness of what others are thinking/feeling 
and knowing when they are talking too loudly, to name a 
few. Social awareness and reciprocity are often impaired in 
children with ASD and this can be compounded by those 
who play a greater amount of video games. Those who play 
a greater amount of video games may be at risk for social 
isolation (Anderson et al., 2010; Griffiths & Davies, 2005) 
possibly due to decreased opportunities to have reciprocal 
social interactions because more time is devoted to gaming 
as compared to other activities that would stimulate recip-
rocal interactions. Thus, these findings agree with previous 
research. On the other hand, those who gravitate toward 
video games may do so because they are less inclined to 
engage in activities with higher social demands that may be 
challenging for them. As with the Mannerisms subscale find-
ing, this finding also requires further research into the likely 
complex interaction between video game play and social 
functioning in autistic individuals. However, it is important 
to note that video gaming could have a positive effect on this 
subscale, under certain conditions. For example, one could 
imagine those who play more video games, specifically 
games in-person or online games requiring conversation, 
would have increased exposure to reciprocal interactions due 
to the nature of the games they are playing (Walther, 2007).
Our significant findings for amount of play categories 
were driven by significantly higher scores in the “play 
more than average” compared to the “play average” group, 
both for our measures of aggression and social impairment 
(Social Awareness and Mannerisms subscales). However, 
when considering all four video game playing categories, 
the means for “play more than average” are not particularly 
high, but rather the means for “play average” appear low 
(Fig. 2; Table 4). Thus, it may be that, overall, average video 
game play is associated with less aggression and less social 
deficits, as opposed to the reverse interpretation, that more 
than average amount of time spent playing video games is 
associated with high levels of aggression and greater social 
impairment. However, a firm conclusion is not possible 
given the lack of significance between the other post-hoc 
comparisons, as well as the low numbers of participants in 
the “don’t play” and “play less than average” categories.
It is important to note that our sample includes autistic 
children who also may have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD), thus the relationship between ADHD, 
video game play, aggression, and social functioning should 
also be considered in light of our results. While some stud-
ies show that children with ADHD do not play video games 
more or less in comparison to either TD or autistic children 
(Bioulac et al., 2008; Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013), a recent 
study of children aged 4–12 years showed that children with 
ADHD spend significantly more time playing video games 
than TD peers on both weekdays and weekends (Masi et al., 
2021). Despite debate over playing amounts, children with 
ADHD exhibit more addictive/compulsive behaviors in 
relation to video games (Kietglaiwansiri & Chonchaiya, 
2018; Masi et al., 2021). In regards to aggression, children 
with ADHD do show higher rates of proactive and reac-
tive aggression (Slaughter et al., 2019). In Bioulac et al. 
(2008), a subgroup of ADHD participants who met crite-
ria for problematic video game usage also had significantly 
higher aggression scores than ADHD participants without 
problematic video game usage or TD controls. It is pos-
sible that comorbid ADHD in our autistic participants may 
have contributed to our aggression findings. Lastly, like chil-
dren with ASD, social problems are a prominent feature for 
children with ADHD (Kofler et al., 2011). However, there 
has been little research looking at the relationship between 
video game playing and social impairment in ADHD, thus 
ADHD-specific studies are needed to investigate possible 
associations.
One limitation to our study is that the CBCL is not a 
video game-specific questionnaire. It asks parents to list 
up to three hobbies that are not sports, and based on this 
open-ended question we classified participants as video-
game players or non-players. However, it is uncertain how 

3577
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:3567–3580	
1 3
the format of this question impacted our classification. For 
example, for children with many hobbies, parents might not 
write in “video games” if other hobbies are more favored. 
These children would be classified as a non-players, when 
perhaps they were actually video-game players in the “less 
than average” category. A question specifically asking about 
video-game playing would have been ideal for accurate clas-
sification. As discussed above, the CBCL does not assess 
what type of video games are being played. Another limita-
tion of the CBCL is that it does not assess quantitative play-
ing time. Furthermore, the question used to assess amount 
of time spent playing asks parents to compare their child to 
others of the same age. When parents of autistic children 
answered that question, it is unknown whether they were 
comparing their child to other autistic children or TD chil-
dren. Next, for the CoCoA sample, there were significant 
constraints imposed on initial study enrollment because use 
of psychotropic medications (other than ADHD medica-
tions) was an exclusion. This created a group of participants 
where baseline levels of certain comorbid conditions (anxi-
ety, depression, aggression) were less prevalent than would 
be expected in a population type sample. Should levels of 
these conditions in our sample have matched a population 
type sample, there may have been further/larger group dif-
ferences, specifically when looking at aggression. Lastly, it 
is important to note that this study used an FSIQ-matched 
sample. While this eliminated the confounding effects of IQ 
differences, it also means conclusions from our main analy-
ses cannot be extended across the entire range of autistic 
individuals. Supplemental analyses showed that parents of 
autistic adolescents with lower (< 70) FSIQ were less likely 
to report video games as a hobby in comparison to parents of 
autistic adolescents with higher IQs (Supplemental Fig. 2). 
If they did play video games, adolescents with lower IQs 
typically played on a tablet or phone as opposed to tradi-
tional video games played using a gaming console.
In the future, further research using dedicated video game 
questionnaires is highly recommended. These questionnaires 
allow collection of in-depth information about when (week-
day vs. weekend) and how often (typically in a quantitative 
fashion such as number of hours) games are being played. 
Secondly, these questionnaires also help in regard to deter-
mining what genres of games are being played, and with 
that information, more detailed conclusions about associa-
tions with aggression and social functioning can be made. 
Fortunately, a few popular video game questionnaires exist 
such as the Problem Video Game Playing Test (King et al., 
2009) and the General Media Habits Questionnaire (Craig 
Alan Anderson et al., 2007; Gentile et al., 2004).
Video game specific questionnaires can also be enhanced 
by including general questions regarding aggression and 
how the adolescent feels when playing certain genres, espe-
cially for self-report questionnaires. For example, Gentile 
et al. (2004) adapted Anderson and Dill’s (2000) question-
naire to include questions about violence in the video games 
played. Different methods to specifically assess aggression 
in ASD may also be helpful, such as the Aberrant Behavior 
Checklist Irritability subscale (Aman & Singh, 1994), as 
well as computer tasks or games that measure responses 
to aggressive stimuli (Erickson et al., 2016), or having an 
evaluator observe aggressive behavior during experimental 
sessions (Erickson et al., 2016).
Lastly, while the bulk of current research has investigated 
negative aspects of video games (including social isolation), 
future research is needed to focus more on possible benefits 
of video gaming in ASD. What qualifies as a video game 
is largely open ended, and many games have a significant 
social component built into them (e.g., competitive play 
requires intense communication and teamwork in order to 
succeed). With the advent of the Internet and more sophisti-
cated platforms to play video games that incorporate text or 
voice chat, it has never been easier to log on and play with 
others. One may assume that a child who is engaged in more 
communicative based video games is actively engaging in 
social skills through periods of increased communication 
with other peers in order to play the game, thus relationships 
between video game playing and social functioning may be 
highly dependent upon the type of game being played.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, video games have 
become a key outlet to avoid social isolation during long-
haul stretches of lockdowns and quarantines. In a 2020 sur-
vey conducted by Google, 35% of American respondents 
said their decision to spend more time playing video games 
now than before the pandemic was to connect with friends 
and family (Google/Savatana, 2020). Furthermore, 59% of 
parents report using some form of educational video game 
for their children during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 63% 
of those parents report that the educational games were very 
or extremely effective (2021 Essential Facts About the Video 
Game Industry, 2021). While all data reported here was 
collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, future studies 
investigating time spent playing video games, as well as the 
amount of time spent playing video games for social com-
munication or educational purposes, should consider possi-
ble associations with the COVID-19 pandemic and restric-
tions in place during the time these behaviors were assessed.
