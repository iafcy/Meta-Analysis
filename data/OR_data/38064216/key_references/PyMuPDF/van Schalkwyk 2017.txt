Abstract
Social media holds promise as a technology to facilitate social engagement, but may displace 
social activities. Adolescents with ASD are well suited capitalize on the unique features of social 
media, requires less decoding of complex social information. this cross-sectional study, we 
assessed social media anxiety and friendship quality in 44 adolescents with and 56 clinical 
comparison controls. Social media use significantly associated with high friendship quality in 
adolescents with ASD, which was moderated by the adolescents’ anxiety levels. No associations 
were founds between social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in the controls. Social media 
may be a way for adolescents with without significant anxiety to improve the quality of 
friendships.

Introduction
Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience difficulties with social 
interaction and have friends than their peers without ASD (Rowley et al.2012) Improving the 
capacity for social engagement in youths is a critical intervention target (Laugeson and 
Ellingsen 2014). The internet and online social media may ways for adolescents with ASD 
to significantly expand their opportunities for social engagement, through platforms that 
may be better suited to these youths’ unique communicative style—with more structured 
rules of engagement, and less reliance on non-verbal information such as interpreting facial

expressions (Burke et al. 2010). However, concerns have been raised about such platforms, 
including the potential for cyberbullying (Kowalski and Limber 2007; Smith et al. 2008), 
risk of exposure to inappropriate content, and that they offer less meaningful interaction than 
face to face engagement (Cummings et al. 2002).
Adolescence is an important developmental period during which to understand the impact of 
social media use given its importance in this age group, as well as the significant social 
vulnerabilities that characterize this period, particularly for adolescents with ASD (Orsmond 
et al. 2004). Research in typically developing youth has examined the impact of the internet 
and online social media use on a range of outcomes, including quality of peer relationships 
(Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 2008; Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Findings suggest that for 
some youth, internet use displaces other types of communication, which may in fact be more 
qualitatively rich, leading to a net negative effect on friendship quality—this has been 
described as the displacement hypothesis (Cummings et al. 2002). By contrast, other studies 
have found the internet serves to supplement offline communication, increasing the overall 
time spent in contact with others (Wellman et al. 2001), and facilitates bridging of online 
engagement to new offline social experiences (Ellison et al. 2007). This has been described 
as the increase hypothesis (Lee 2009).
It has been argued that both of these hypotheses may be applicable, but whether internet and 
online social media use is associated with either displacement or increase of social 
relationships varies depending on the nature of the platform being used, and aspects of the 
user themselves (Caplan 2007; Sheeks and Birchmeier 2007; Valkenburg and Peter 2007, 
2009). It has therefore been suggested that research is needed that focuses on which factors 
(including features of the platform and user) may be associated with positive outcomes from 
internet and social media use (Caplan 2007; Sheeks and Birchmeier 2007; Valkenburg and 
Peter 2009). In our study, our focus was on the social media platform of Facebook. We 
considered it to be likely that the increase hypothesis would apply in the case of Facebook 
use by adolescents with ASD, because of the relatively structured nature of the interactions, 
which also contain minimal, or are completely void of, complex information such as facial 
expressions and non-verbal cues. For example, posting on the Facebook wall allows the user 
to communicate a com plete message without having to assess how it is being perceived by 
other individuals (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015). Similarly, chat functions on Facebook rely 
almost exclusively on written content. In addition, adolescents with ASD have fewer offline 
interactions than their peers, perhaps reducing the likelihood that Facebook usage will 
displace richer, offline social interactions. Taken together, it is plausible that Facebook is a 
platform which may be well suited to facilitating social engagement in adolescents with 
ASD—thus consistent with the increase hypothesis.
Although authors have highlighted the importance of this research area as it applies to 
individuals with ASD (Burke et al. 2010), there has been little systematic study. Some initial 
work reported patterns of social media use amongst adolescents with ASD participating in 
the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, and found significantly lower rates of social 
media use compared with other disability groups (Mazurek et al. 2012). Beyond this initial 
work, a single cross-sectional study examined the patterns and social-emotional correlates of 
social media use in adults with ASD (Mazurek 2013). This study (N = 108, mean age = 32.4

years) found 79.6% of these participants used social media, and these adults were more 
likely to have close friends and higher closeness of relationships than adults with autism 
who did not use social media (Mazurek 2013). Mazurek et al. also measured the adults’ 
loneliness in the sample and found no significant associations with social media use. To our 
knowledge, no studies have examined correlates of social media use in adolescents with 
ASD.
There is also interest in understanding the role of anxiety on the correlates of adolescent 
social media use (Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Anxiety is a prominent symptom in ASD, 
and prior research shows that high levels of anxiety are correlated with problematic internet 
use - a construct which includes behavior such as failing to meet offline obligations because 
of online engagement (Caplan 2007). In a qualitative study of adolescents without ASD, 
anxiety in the course of social media use was a prominent aspect of their online experience, 
and this anxiety took many forms, including concerns about negative peer evaluation, and 
missing out on opportunities for engagement when not online (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015). 
Anxiety may be framed as a potential moderator of the increase hypothesis—specifically, 
some have argued that more socially anxious youth will be less likely to derive benefit from 
online social engagement than their more confident peers (Kraut et al. 2002). These findings 
highlight the need for further work to advance understanding of the impact of anxiety on the 
social media experience.
In this study, we identified patterns of social media use, friendship quality, and level of 
anxiety in adolescents with ASD and in a comparison control clinical sample of adolescents 
without ASD. We hypothesized (1) that social media use would be positively related to 
friendship quality in ASD, consistent with the increase hypothesis. We considered the 
increase hypothesis to be more likely than the displacement hypothesis given the ways in 
which social networking platforms may capitalize on the communicative strengths of youth 
with ASD. We further hypothesized (2) that this relationship would not be present for youth 
without ASD, whom we predicted would show a pattern more consistent with the 
displacement hypothesis. Finally, we hypothesized (3) that, in the ASD group, the 
relationship between social media use and friendship quality would be moderated by anxiety 
levels, such that this relationship would be reduced or absent in those with high anxiety. 
Whereas prior research has focused on the correlates of time spent on social media, in our 
study we also assessed the social media experience in greater detail. Given the absence of 
available measures, we developed a set of questions that aim to capture this experience (see 
below under “Social Media Experience Scale”).
A more complete understanding of the social correlates of social media use in individuals 
with ASD may facilitate advising individuals and families about the impacts of social media 
use, how it can be best used for positive gains, what potential risks may social media use 
may pose, and how these risks can be mitigated.

Method
Participants
Participants were 100 youth (ages 12–19 years; Mean age 15 years, SD = 1.9). Of the 100 
participants, 44 youth were diagnosed with ASD and were recruited from programs at the 
Yale Child Study Center. Recruitment involved approaching individuals currently 
participating in studies or receiving clinical treatment at the Yale Child Study Center and 
providing them information about the study and an offer to participate. All participants had 
normal intellectual function, were currently enrolled in school, and lived with their parents/
guardians who also completed measures for the study. Cognitive ability was measured using 
the Differential Ability Scale, 2nd Edition (DAS-II) (Elliot et al. 1990). All participants had 
a DAS-II General Conceptual Ability score greater than 70. ASD diagnosis in each case had 
been established using the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (Lord et al. 2012) or 
Autism Diagnostic Interview—Revised (Lord et al. 1994) and multidisciplinary clinical 
evaluation. The remaining 56 participants were youth without ASD recruited from clinical 
settings at the Yale Child Study Center (See Table 1 for further demographic information). 
These youth had diverse psychiatric symptoms, but were established to not have symptoms 
of ASD through psychiatric interview. Anxiety symptoms in the control sample were 
assessed dimensionally in the study and our aim was to recruit individuals with a broad 
range of anxiety symptom severity.
Procedure
The study was approved by the university’s Human Subjects Committee. Prior to 
participation, parents of the adolescents under the age of 18 provided signed informed 
consent, and the adolescent provided informed assent. Participants over the age of 18 
provided signed informed consent. Within a cross-sectional design, the study involved 
administration of rating scales to the adolescents in both groups as well as their parents. 
Data on time spent using social media also were obtained from the adolescent and 
demographic information from the parent.
Data were collected at one time point using adolescent and parent completed rating scales, 
with a subsample (n = 24) also providing data on their social media use 1 week later. All 
participants completed the assessment in the presence of either the primary investigator or a 
research assistant and received $25 compensation.
Measures
The Friendship Questionnaire—Friendship quality was assessed using both parent and 
child versions of The Friendship Questionnaire (Bierman and McCauley 1987). Each 
version includes a subscale for positive interactions and a subscale for negative interactions, 
and consists of 36 items. The positive interactions subscale (FQ+) was used in the analysis 
for the current study and includes items like “Is there someone you sit with at lunch? How 
often?”, with participants asked to rate how often this occurs on a Likert scale from 1 (never) 
to 5 (always).

Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 2nd edition—Levels of anxiety 
symptoms were measures using the 50 item parent and child version of the 
Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 2nd ed. (March et al. 1997), a measure also 
previously employed in studies of individuals with ASD (Wood et al. 2009). This scale 
includes items like “My child feels tense or uptight” on the parent version, and “I worry 
about other people laughing at me” on the child version; in each case, participants are asked 
to rate how often the statement is true on a Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (often).
Social Media Experience Scale—Social media experience was assessed using a 
measure we developed for this study, the Social Media Experience Scale (SMES). This 11-
item scale was designed to have two subscales, one which assessed anxiety in the course of 
social media anxiety (SMES-Anxiety) and a second which asses social media utility (SMES-
Utility). Items were derived from a prior qualitative study of the social media experience in a 
clinical population (Van Schalkwyk et al. 2015). The items are listed in Table 2. The SMES-
Utility subscale was chosen to measure active engagement on social media, rather than 
measurement of time spent which could also represent passive observation of social media 
platforms.
Data Analysis
A preliminary analysis of the primary hypothesis was addressed by assessing for outliers, 
normality, and missing data, and computing means, standard deviations and correlation 
coefficients. To examine the moderating role of youth anxiety on the relation between social 
media use and friendship quality, a multiple regression analysis using product terms was 
conducted (Jaccard and Turrisi 2003). The first analysis used the parent report of the FQ+ to 
assess friendship quality, parent rated MASC-2 (total score) to assess youth anxiety, and 
youth rated social media using the SMES-Utility subscale. A second set of analysis was 
repeated using child measures of friendship quality and anxiety and total time spent using 
social media. Of interest was whether the relation between social media use and friendship 
quality differed as a function of youth anxiety. All predictors were mean centered for ease of 
interpretation of regression coefficients (Jaccard et al. 2006). A product term was calculated 
by multiplying youth anxiety by social media use, and the three predictors (youth anxiety, 
social media use, anxiety by social media use) were entered into the regression equation 
simultaneously. Both the ASD and non-ASD sample were initially mean centered, then 
recentered with the mean anxiety at one standard deviation above and one standard deviation 
below the initial mean. This allowed us to generate scatter plots to compare the slope of the 
curve for the relation between social media use and friendship quality when anxiety was 
high, low and moderate.
Results
Preliminary Analysis
Model-based analyses revealed one outlier. The outlier proved to be inconsequential for the 
analysis (i.e., all major conclusions remained intact when it was omitted from the analysis). 
Therefore, results are reported including the outlier. All the variables in the model were 
checked for non-normality, examining the univariate indices of skewness and kurtosis for

absolute values greater than 2.0. All variables in the model were normally distributed. 
Missing data were minimal, being less than 5% for any given variable of interest. Table 2 
depicts the means and standard deviations of the study variables for the ASD and non-ASD 
groups. There were significant differences in sex and IEP status between the two samples; 
these were included in analysis to assess for possible confounding, but were found to be 
non-significant and thus excluded from the final analysis.
Descriptive Statistics
Characteristics for both samples are described in Table 3. Participants in the ASD sample 
were significantly less likely to use Facebook. Anxiety scores according to both parent and 
child ratings were significantly higher in the non-ASD sample (which included youth 
recruited from an anxiety program) than the ASD sample. Scores for friendship quality 
according to both parent and child ratings were higher in the non-ASD sample than the ASD 
sample.
Analysis of Social Media Experience Scale
An exploratory factor analysis (EFA), revealed two factors with eigenvalue greater than 1. 
This was confirmed visually by scree plot. A two-factor solution was identified using a 
rotated component matrix, with one factor containing items related to social media anxiety 
and accounting for 43.8% of the variance, and a second factor containing items related to 
social media utility accounting for 12.2% of the variance. These factors were consistent with 
our initial hypothesis of the scale, with the exception of the item “I worry about my replies 
to people” which was more highly correlated with items in the utility factor. This item was 
excluded in subsequent analysis. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 
0.849, above the recommended threshold of 0.6, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was 
significant at < 0.01. Total score for the SMES-Anxiety factor was highly correlated with 
total score on the MASC-2 child in both the ASD (r = .45, p <.01) and non-ASD sample (r = 
44, p < 01). There was a high correlation between the total scores at the initial and 
subsequent assessment (r = 83; p < 01), as well as for the social media utility (r = . 78, p = .
00) and social media anxiety (r = .71, p < .01) factors.
Correlation Between Social Media Use and Friendship Quality
Correlation matrices were generated for key variables in both the ASD (Table 4) and non-
ASD samples (Table 5). In the ASD sample, parent ratings of their child’s friendship quality 
was correlated with both their child’s social media utility (r = .35, p < .01) and time spent on 
social media (r = .36, p < .05). Adolescent ratings of friendship quality was significantly 
correlated with social media utility only (r = . 36, p < .05). These findings were consistent 
with our primary hypothesis. There were no significant correlations between social media 
utility and time spent on social media with either parent or child measures of friendship 
quality in the non-ASD sample.
Regression Analysis
An initial analysis produced a model explaining 24% of the variance on friendship quality (F 
= 3.7, df = 3, p < .05) in the ASD sample. Table 6 presents the relevant regression

coefficients and associated statistics. The interaction term (social media utility x anxiety) 
was statistically significant (β = −0.35, p < .05), suggesting that the relation between social 
media use and friendship quality was moderated by anxiety. To gain insight into the nature 
of the interaction, we conducted the regression analysis again when the moderator variable 
was one standard deviation below the mean and again when one standard deviation above 
the mean. For adolescents with average anxiety scores, the relation between social media 
utility and friendship quality was not statistically significant (β = 0.24, p = .13); when 
adolescent anxiety was one SD below the mean, the relation between social media use and 
friendship quality was statistically significant (β = 0.61, p < .05), and when adolescent 
anxiety was one SD above the mean, the relation between social media utility and friendship 
quality was not statistically significant (β = −0.13, p = .61). Thus, the relation between 
friendship quality and social media utility was more prominent and achieved statistical 
significance only in those adolescents with lower anxiety scores (See Fig. 1). Analysis using 
adolescents self-ratings of anxiety and friendship quality yielded similar findings with a 
standardized coefficient of 0.32 for social media utility (t = 2.12, p = < 0.05), although the 
interaction term was non-significant in this case indicating there was not sufficient evidence 
for the moderating role of adolescent anxiety in this relation.
In the non-ASD sample, regression analysis yielded an overall model that was insignificant 
and there was no evidence for a relationship between social media use and friendship 
quality.
Discussion
The results of our study suggest that social media use is associated with better friendship 
quality in adolescents with ASD (hypothesis 1, and consistent with the increase hypothesis), 
an association that is not seen in adolescents without ASD (hypothesis 2), and that this 
association is moderated by anxiety (hypothesis 3). The findings in support of hypothesis 1 
were demonstrated using both parent and child reports of friendship quality and including 
two distinct measures of social media use—total time spent on social media and the total 
score on the SMES-Utility subscale. Findings as to the moderating role of anxiety were only 
robustly demonstrated using parent measures of anxiety and friendship quality and when 
assessing social media use with the broader SMES-Utility subscale. These discrepancies are 
unsurprising; prior work has indicated poor correlation between parent and child report on 
the MASC (Baldwin and Dadds 2007), with parent report showing greater stability over 12 
months, and youth with ASD in particular may be hypothesized to have distinct perceptions 
of their anxiety and peer relationships. Although both measures of social media use (time 
spent and social media utility) were correlated with better friendship quality in youth with 
ASD, it is unclear why only the relationship between social media utility and friendship 
quality was significantly moderated by anxiety. One hypothesis is that the measure of social 
media utility in our study assessed both passive and active forms of engagement on social 
media— a style of utilization that may be particularly rewarding, but may also expose users 
to greater risk for negative evaluation by peers. Prior work has highlighted the prevalence 
and utility of online ‘lurking’ amongst youth with ASD - a phenomenon of largely passive 
engagement on social media (Nottingham and User 2008), which may not cause the same 
type of anxieties which occur in the context of more active forms of engagement.

Our study found no evidence for the increase hypothesis (the relation between social media 
use and friendship quality) in the non-ASD sample. This is consistent with our initial 
hypothesis that adolescents with ASD may be a unique subgroup with regards to their 
capacity to benefit from social media and follow the predictions of the increase hypothesis. 
In the context of existing theory, our findings suggest that adolescents with ASD may be 
relatively insulated from the ‘displacement’ hypothesis (Cummings et al. 2002). Friendship 
quality in our study was significantly lower for the ASD group than the non-ASD group, and 
prior literature has highlighted increased loneliness and poorer friendship quality in 
adolescents with ASD (Bauminger and Kasari 2000).
Our study provides a further perspective on a prominent theoretical debate regarding the 
validity of two further hypotheses—the ‘social compensation’ versus ‘rich-get-richer’ 
hypotheses (Valkenburg and Peter 2009). The former argues that socially anxious individuals 
may benefit most from online communication owing to it being in some ways a less stressful 
platform; the latter hypothesis suggests that socially competent individuals may gain the 
most by being able to further capitalize on their already well developed offline social 
networks. In our study, anxiety undermined the utility of social media to be helpful to the 
ASD group, and yet the unique vulnerabilities of this group allowed them to benefit from the 
platform. Adolescents with ASD therefore appear to be able to ‘socially compensate’ 
through online interaction, but they are compensating for a unique communicative style 
rather than for being socially anxious.
It is critical that a technology as pervasive as social media be subject to extensive empirical 
research. The Social Media Experience Scale which we introduce in this paper may be a 
valuable tool in assessing two key dimensions of social media use—namely, the anxiety 
which adolescents may experience in the course of using or contemplating social media, and 
the ways in which it may be considered useful.
We found the scale to have robust psychometric properties, to be acceptable and feasible for 
use in both an ASD and non-ASD adolescents, and to include a valid measure of social 
media anxiety which is highly correlated with total scores on the MASC-2. Future research 
may aim to confirm the proposed factor structure of this scale, and apply it to answering 
additional key questions regarding social media use in adolescents.
Our study is limited by its cross-sectional nature, which allows us to show only an 
association between social media use and friendship quality. Longitudinal, prospective or 
experimental research could verify these findings. Further, despite our efforts at quantifying 
social media use both in terms of time and experience, these platforms remain 
heterogeneous, and it is unclear what aspect of social media use may be most related to 
higher friendship quality.
In conclusion, whatever its overall impact on society, social media platforms have now 
become pervasive and likely possess significant utility for many adolescents. The 
prominence of the distinction between the ASD and non-ASD group in our study suggests 
that an opportunity exists to broaden the opportunities for social engagement for adolescents 
with ASD through effective use of with social media. Future work may seek to develop

interventions which help adolescents not only spend time on these platforms, but find ways 
to be effectively and actively engaged. Further, clinicians working with youth who have 
ASD should carefully for both baseline anxiety, and anxiety in the course of social media 
use, given the demonstrated capacity for high anxiety to undermine the prosocial utility of 
social media use [as demonstrated by our findings and in previous work (Caplan 2007)]. The 
SMES is a promising instrument for assessing social media anxiety in clinical settings, and 
identifying targets for possible intervention.

Items on the Social Media Experience Scale
Social media utility
Social media lets me reach lots of different people for support
Posting messages is a way to let everyone know how I’m feeling
Posting is a way to avoid having to ask a specific person I know for help
I get support by looking over saved chats
Social media lets me open up about things that are hard to talk about face-to-face
Having time to think about how I reply to messages or chats is helpful
Social media anxiety
I worry about my replies to people
It is important for me to be active on social media
It is important that people like the things I post
I worry that people will post mean or hurtful things about me
It bothers me when I see on social media how good others’ lives are
