Abstract
Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents playing twice as much as their Typically Devel-
oping peers. The aims of this study are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming 
Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient can predict time 
spent playing video games. 57 participants were recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The 
preliminary results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further investiga-
tion revealed interactions between autistic traits and several motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and 
customisation. This has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.
Keywords  Autism · Video Games · Motivations · Escapism · Autistic Traits
Video games are a common pastime for autistic people, and 
especially for autistic adolescents (Cho et al., 2017). Inves-
tigations into video game usage find that up to 97% of autis-
tic adolescents play video games (Durkin, 2010) compared 
to 85% of Typically Developing (TD) adolescents (Turner 
et al., 2012). These autistic adolescents have been shown 
to play significantly more each day than their TD counter-
parts (2.4 h vs 1.2 h, Kuo et al., 2014). As well as taking 
up a greater proportion of their free time (Engelhardt et al., 
2017), autistic adults highlight that they struggle to disen-
gage from video games to complete essential tasks (Mazurek 
& Engelhardt, 2013; Sundberg, 2018).
As a result of the strong interest in video games of many 
autistic individuals, researchers have attempted to study the 
impact of video games from a variety of perspectives. A 
prominent framework for examining the motivations of play-
ers is from Ryan et al. (2006) who applied self-determination 
theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2017) to video games. Accord-
ing to this framework, the intrinsic motivation to play video 
games originates from the need to satisfy three basic psy-
chological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. 
A qualitative analysis of autistic adult gamers by Mazurek 
et al., (2015) found themes consistent with the SDT model 
of motivation, particularly across the competence domain. 
There has been limited quantitative work into the motiva-
tions of autistic gamers. Sundberg (2018) found that autistic 
gamers reported a higher desire for escapism, using video 
games as a means of escaping the real world, but were simi-
lar to TD gamers on all other sub-scales. Escapism has been 
linked to problematic gaming behaviour in both autistics and 
neurotypicals (Engelhardt et al., 2017), as well as general-
ised and social anxiety (Pang et al., 2017). That is not to say 
that the impact of video games is necessarily negative, with 
research from both TD and autistic populations showing that 
a healthy engagement can be fulfilling (Mazurek et al., 2015; 
Przybylski & Weinstein, 2017).
Autism is characterised by a complex constellation 
of features, which is best modelled as a hybridisation of 
dimensional and categorical traits (Elton et al., 2016). 
Various behavioural outcomes throughout the TD popula-
tion have been found to vary with autistic traits, including 
social anxiety (Kleberg et al., 2017). Given that people with 
higher autistic traits are more prone to compulsive internet 
use (Finkenauer et al., 2012), it would be expected that a 
similar relationship would be found for video games.
The central questions of this paper are how the rela-
tionships between autistic traits and motivations for play-
ing games influence playtime. The first prediction is that 
scales examining motivations for playing video games and

autistic traits will be significantly predictive of total time 
playing video games. Secondly, it is expected that there will 
be interactions between autistic traits and the measures of 
motivation.
Methods
Measures
Participants reported how much time they spent playing 
video games in an average week. They were then asked to 
estimate what proportion of their time they spent playing 
alone, with strangers online, with friends they made online, 
and friends that they knew from real life.
The Gaming Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences 
Scales (GAMES; Hilgard et al., 2013) was developed as 
an instrument to study the risks of problematic gaming 
inspired by the work of Ryan et al., (2006). Participants use 
a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) 
to 5 (Strongly Agree). The scale contains 59 items that are 
split into nine subscales. These are story, violence catharsis, 
violent reward, social interaction, escapism, loss-aversion, 
customisation, completionism, and autonomy. This scale 
has been found to have high predictive validity and internal 
consistency (Hilgard et al., 2013).
The AQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) measures the level of 
autistic traits expressed by an individual. The scale contains 
50 items with 10 items for each of the five subscales: social 
skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communica-
tion, and imagination. Each item uses a 4-point agreement 
scale: definitely disagree, slightly disagree, slightly agree, 
definitely agree. For this analysis, the items were treated as 
a 4-point Likert scale.
Participants
A power analysis was conducted using the pwr R package 
before data collection for a multiple linear regression with 
ten predictors, a significance threshold of 0.05, a target 
power of 0.8, and an ­R2 of 0.328 from Hilgard et al., (2013) 
which suggested a minimum of 42 participants. Data were 
then collected from 62 participants during January and Feb-
ruary of 2019. The participants were recruited using Face-
book, Reddit, and two autism emailing lists. There were no 
incentives offered for participation in the study. Participants 
were excluded if they were under the age of 16 or had a 
response rate of under 90% on any of the questionnaire sec-
tions. After the exclusion criteria had been applied, the sam-
ple consisted of 57 participants. Demographic information 
for these participants can be found in Table 1. 17 partici-
pants indicated that they had received a formal diagnosis 
of an autism spectrum disorder. Proof of diagnosis was not 
required from the participants. Specific data on socioeco-
nomic status and ethnicity were not recorded. Informed con-
sent was obtained before data collection. Ethical approval 
was granted by the University of Glasgow College of Sci-
ence and Engineering Ethics Committee and the study was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
All variables representing time spent playing games were 
found to be significantly non-normally distributed using Sha-
piro–Wilk tests. This included total time played (W = 0.78, 
p < 0.001), time played alone (W = 0.85, p < 0.001), and 
time played socially (W = 0.58, p < 0.001). As such, it was 
decided to transform the data using a Tukey ladder of powers 
with a lambda of 0.45 (Tukey, 1957). After this transfor-
mation, the data were deemed approximately normal. The 
Cronbach’s alpha was found to be 0.94 for the AQ and 0.92 
for the overall GAMES questionnaire. Alphas for GAMES 
subscales can be seen in Table 2.
The first hypothesis of this study was that scores on 
the AQ and GAMES subscales would be predictive of the 
average total time playing video games. This prediction 
was tested using a multiple linear regression, the results of 
which can be found in Table 3 (adjusted ­R2 = 0.384, F(10, 
36) = 3.86, p = 0.001). The significant predictors of total 
time playing video games were the desires for socialising 
and escapism. Autistic traits did not significantly predict 
time spent playing games when controlling for motivational 
variables.
The second hypothesis was that interactions between AQ 
and GAMES scores would be significant. Analysis of the 
data revealed that AQ score was correlated with several of 
the GAMES measures, as can be seen in Table 4. A back-
wards stepwise algorithm was used to select the best model 
from an initial set of candidate predictors including the AQ, 
GAMES subscales, and interaction terms between the AQ 
and each of the GAMES subscales. The final model from 
this analysis is summarised in Table 5 (adjusted ­R2 = 0.460, 
F(15, 31) = 3.615, p = 0.001). Interactions between AQ and 
escapism, customisation, and completionism were found to 
significantly contribute to this model. 
Discussion
The overall aim of this report was to investigate how moti-
vations to play video games and autistic traits interact to 
predict time spent gaming. The first hypothesis of this study 
was that the AQ and GAMES subscales would be predic-
tive of the average time participants spent playing video 
games each day. The preliminary results of the multiple

linear regression model found that the social and escapism 
motivations were the only significant predictors of daily time 
spent playing, though the overall model accounted for 51.8% 
of the total variance. In our study, autistic traits were not 
found to be predictive of time spent playing games and if 
anything trended towards predicting less play. This finding 
contrasts with the prior body of research finding that autistic 
people play video games more than TD individuals (Kuo 
et al., 2014).
The second hypothesis investigated the role of autistic 
traits further, predicting that interactions between the AQ 
and GAMES subscales would be significant predictors of

video gameplay. The final model found three significant 
interactions between AQ and motivation, specifically 
escapism, customisation, and completionism. Levels of 
autistic traits themselves did not predict total time played. 
These results suggest that the relationship between autis-
tic traits and playing games is more complex than a sim-
ple linear predictor. The most notable motive is escap-
ism, which was found to be a significant predictor of time 
playing games. Escapism has a significant interaction 
with autistic traits and was moderately correlated with 
AQ scores. This finding complements existing literature 
reporting that an increased desire for escapism increases 
the risk of problematic gaming (Hilgard et al., 2013) and 
that escapism desire is raised in autistic groups (Sundberg, 
2018).
These findings have interesting consequences for the 
study of intolerance of uncertainty within autism (Lidstone 
et al., 2014), a model connecting sensory sensitivities, intol-
erance of uncertainty, anxiety, and Restricted, Repetitive 
Behaviours (RRBs). There is a wide body of research con-
necting escapism with various measures of anxiety, mental 
health outcomes, and well-being (Pang et al., 2017). Given 
the prominence of video games as an RRB (Cho et al., 
2017), all of the major concepts within the intolerance of 
uncertainty model are integrated within video gaming and 
its supporting academic literature.
This study is subject to several limitations. Feedback 
from autistic participants highlighted how they felt that their 
motivations for playing video games were not comprehen-
sively covered by the GAMES questionnaire. Further, as the 
scales had been developed on a neurotypical population, sev-
eral autism-specific characteristics were not included. Future 
research into this area should engage with the autistic com-
munity to develop more specific measures, in line with the 
guidelines developed by Fletcher-Watson et al. (2019).
The results of this exploratory study offer insights into 
the motivations of autistic gamers. This pilot study is the 
first to take a detailed look at the full battery of motivations 
and how these are expressed in specific gaming behaviours. 
Firstly, the success of the regression models for predicting

time spent playing video games would suggest that motiva-
tional theory can be successfully applied to autistic play-
ers. Secondly, rather than autistic traits being independent 
of these motivational desires, they instead influence their 
strength and expression.
