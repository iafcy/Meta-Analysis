Abstract
This study aimed to examine how environmental factors are associated with physical activity (PA) and screen-time (ST) 
among children with and without ASD (n = 1380 and 1411, respectively). For TD children, the absence of a bedroom televi-
sion and neighborhood support were associated with PA. For children with ASD, no environmental factors were associated 
with PA. Regarding ST, the presence of a bedroom television, absence of limits on ST, lack of neighborhood amenities and 
support, and adverse neighborhood factors were all associated with ST among TD children. For children with ASD, the 
presence of a bedroom television and the absence of limits on ST were associated with ST. Potential explanations for this 
dichotomy and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Introduction
Children, with and without ASD, who regularly engage in 
physical (PA) enjoy a plethora of physical, psychological, 
and social benefits (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC), 2014; Healy et al. 2018). Conversely, sedentary 
activities, such as screen-time (ST) activities (e.g. TV, com-
puter, video games, etc) have been associated with a host of 
negative outcomes, including adiposity (Bener et al. 2010; 
Falbe et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2016) and poor sleep (Bey-
ens and Nathanson 2018; Mazurek et al. 2016). There has 
been growing interest in the importance of the environment 
in explaining the health behaviors of children, including 
physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior, particularly 
screen-time (ST) (Ding and Gebel 2012). Reviews of lit-
erature have identified several environmental features that 
may encourage or discourage youth PA: for example, access 
to infrastructure that promotes active transport is positively 
associated with PA, while infrastructure that discourages 
active transport (e.g. number of roads to cross and traffic 
density/speed) and adverse neighborhood conditions (e.g., 
crime, area deprivation) are negatively associated with chil-
dren’s PA (e.g. Ding et al. 2011; Davison and Lawson 2006). 
For adolescents, supportive correlates of PA are land-use 
mix (where residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or 
industrial uses are integrated) and residential density (Ding 
et al. 2011). Environmental factors within the home may also 
affect PA and ST behavior (Maitland et al. 2013). A review 
of 49 studies on the influence of the home environment on 
children’s PA and ST concluded that media equipment in the 
home, and specifically the bedroom, is associated with ST 
(Maitland et al. 2013). Interestingly, evidence of the influ-
ence of other factors within the home environment and PA 
an ST have been inconclusive, suggesting the need for fur-
ther exploration into the link between home environment and 
PA/ST. There is limited evidence of the influence of home 
environment (i.e., PA equipment, presence of a yard) on PA, 
however, inverse correlations have been found between the 
availability of PA equipment and ST (Maitland et al. 2013). 
The limited evidence demonstrates the need to further inves-
tigate the environment-PA/ST relationship, and to determine 
whether certain demographic factors may moderate this rela-
tionship (Ding & Geleb, 2012). For intervention develop-
ment and individualization, an understanding of how the 
environment-PA/ST relationship differs for sub-groups of

the population is required. Thus far, research on this phe-
nomenon is limited to examination by specific age (Burdette 
and Whitaker 2005; Adkins et al. 2004; Dunton et al. 2003), 
gender (Bocarro et al. 2015; Hume et al. 2004), and ethnicity 
groups (Adkins et al. 2004; McKenzie et al. 2008). However, 
no studies have examined whether the environmental-PA/ST 
relationship differs among individuals with a disability, such 
as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given the increasing 
prevalence of ASD, it is imperative to understand how the 
presence of this disorder may alter the relationship between 
the environment and PA/ST.
In addition to the core characteristics of deficits in social 
communication and social interaction, and restricted, repeti-
tive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (American 
Psychiatric Association 2013), children with ASD often 
experience a range of co-morbidities such as anxiety, atten-
tion-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, devel-
opmental coordination disorder, and intellectual disability 
(Treating Autism and Autism Treatment Trust 2013). For 
some individuals with ASD, these symptoms and co-morbid-
ities may pose significant challenges regarding participation 
in PA. Despite all of the benefits of PA participation, youth 
with ASD may view PA experiences as socially demand-
ing, unpredictable, sensory-stimulating, and uncomfortable, 
which may elicit an increased stress response (Healy et al. 
2013) resulting in many children with ASD opting for more 
sedentary pursuits. As such, researchers have demonstrated 
that the PA levels of children with ASD tend to be below that 
of their TD peers (Scharoun et al. 2017), especially during 
adolescence (Healy et al. 2017; MacDonald et al. 2011). 
Similarly, research has demonstrated that children with ASD 
(aged 3 to 11) are more likely to exceed the recommended 
two hours of ST on weekdays and at weekends than their 
TD peers (63% vs 40%, and 90% vs 62% respectively) (Must 
et al. 2014).
To aid intervention development for this population, 
researchers have examined factors associated with partici-
pation in PA and ST. For example, Memari et al. (2015) 
sought to identify the individual and social factors that con-
tributed to participation in leisure physical activities among 
83 children with ASD (aged 6–15 years), and gender, family 
income, and household structure were found to be associated 
with activity levels. More recently, a review (Jones et al. 
2017) of correlates of PA among children with ASD reported 
a consistent negative association between age and PA and an 
inconsistent association between sex and PA, which differs 
from the majority of findings in TD youth that show males 
as having greater levels of PA compared to females. While 
Jones and colleagues (2017) reported the correlates of PA 
in youth with ASD, the authors acknowledged that there is 
a need for studies investigating the comparison of corre-
lates of PA/ST between children with ASD and TD children. 
Further, they asserted that correlates of PA and ST among 
children with ASD and how they differ from TD children 
remains largely unknown (Jones et al. 2017).
It is logical to suggest that the interaction with the envi-
ronment, and its effect on health behavior choices, may differ 
among children with ASD and their families in comparison 
to TD peers. Different social, sensory, and behavioral char-
acteristics may result in the environment influencing PA and 
ST differently. Indeed, in research examining barriers to PA 
participation among this population, environmental barri-
ers were reported and children with ASD rated community 
barriers (such as a lack of transportation to PA programs) 
and physical barriers (such as a lack of or unsafe equip-
ment) among the most frequent barriers they faced (Obrus-
nikova and Miccinello 2012). Thus, there is a clear need 
for understanding how environmental factors influence PA 
and ST among children with ASD. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study was to examine how neighborhood and home 
environmental factors are associated with PA and ST among 
children with and without ASD.
Method
Data from the 2011–2012 cross-sectional National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH) was used was in this study. The 
NSCH assesses the health and well-being of children aged 0 
to 17 years, including several psychosocial and environmen-
tal factors. Data from the current study included children 
who were at least 6 years in age. Data were collected from 
parents or guardians by telephone, from February 2011 to 
June 2012. List-assisted random-digit dialing was used to 
identify households with children aged 0–17 years. After 
screening for the presence of children in the home, one child 
per household was randomly selected for the study. Addi-
tional information about the 2011–2012 NSCH can be found 
in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013) 
frequently asked questions document.
Sample
The current study included youth whose parents reported 
a current diagnosis of ASD, and a comparative sample of 
TD youth matched by age level (6–11; 12–17) and gender. 
Therefore, the current sample involved 2791 participants 
(1380 with ASD and 1411 TD children). Children were 
included in the ‘ASD group’ if the respondent answered 
‘yes’ to the following two questions: (1) ‘please tell me if 
a doctor or other health care provider ever told you that 
(child) had autism, Asperger’s disorder, pervasive devel-
opmental disorder, or other autism spectrum disorder, 
even if he/she does not have the condition now?’; and 
(2) ‘If yes, does (child) currently have the condition?’ In 
order to select a matching group of TD counterparts, all

participants who had no reports of a diagnosed mental 
or physical disorder were extracted into a new dataset. 
Participants were further categorized by gender (males, 
females) and age group (children 6–11; adolescents 12–17) 
in order to ensure a comparable TD sample of age group- 
and gender-matched participants. Then, participants from 
each of the four categories were randomly selected for the 
TD comparison sample, with oversampling occurring in 
order to account for missing data.
Measures
Demographics
Demographic variables included as covariates included 
gender, age, race, and body mass index (BMI). Since the 
majority of participants were of Caucasian descent, race 
was collapsed into a dichotomous variable with partici-
pants classified as “Caucasian” or “Not-Caucasian”. BMI 
was calculated based on height and weight information 
derived from the parent-report, as well as participant age 
and gender. For the purposes of this paper, we created two 
dichotomous categories of overweight and obese (greater 
than 85th percentile) and not overweight or obese (less 
than 85th percentile). Although typically the child’s age in 
months is used to calculate BMI for age, the NSCH reports 
age in full years. Thus, all participants were assumed to 
be at the midpoint of their age-year for this calculation.
Physical Activity and Screen‑time
Respondents reported on their child’s PA participation, 
answering the question ‘during the past week, on how 
many days did (child) exercise, play a sport, or participate 
in PA for at least 20 min that made (him/her) sweat or 
breathe hard?’ If needed, examples were provided includ-
ing ‘active sports such as baseball, softball, basketball, 
swimming, soccer, tennis, or football; riding a bike or 
roller-skating; walking or jogging; jumping rope; gym-
nastics; and active dance such as ballet.’ Responses ranged 
from 0 to 7 days. This measure has been used in previ-
ous research using the NSCH to examine PA behaviors 
of children with ASD (McCoy et al. 2016). To assess ST 
levels, parents responded to the question; ‘on an aver-
age weekday, about how much time (hours and minutes) 
does (child) usually spend in front of a TV watching TV 
programs, videos, or playing video games?’ Two addi-
tional factors related to household ST environment include 
the following: (1) Does your child have a TV in his/her 
room; and (2) Do you place limits on the amount of TV. 
Response options were dichotomous (yes/no).
Environmental Factors
Due to the exploratory nature of the current study, all envi-
ronmental variables in the NSCH were included in the analy-
sis. Neighborhood amenities were assessed by questioning 
the parents on whether ‘the following places and things are 
available to children in your neighborhood, even if the study 
child does not actually use them.’ Respondents answered yes 
or no on the presence of (1) sidewalks or walking paths, (2) a 
park or playground area, (3) a recreation center, community 
center, or boys’ or girls’ club, and (4) a library or bookmo-
bile? A summary variable, “overall neighborhood ameni-
ties” was then calculated by adding the number of reported 
amenities in the neighborhood indicating that a higher value 
was indicative of a greater number of neighborhood features. 
The condition of the child’s neighborhood was assessed with 
the questions: ‘In your neighborhood; (1) is there litter or 
garbage on the street or sidewalk?’; (2) ‘How about poorly 
kept or rundown housing?’; and (3) ‘How about vandalism 
such as broken windows or graffiti?’ A summary variable 
“overall adverse neighborhood conditions” was then calcu-
lated by summing the total number of adverse neighborhood 
features reported by parents/caregivers. A higher value indi-
cated a greater number of adverse neighborhood features 
existed in the neighborhood. To assess neighborhood social 
capital, respondents were asked how much they agreed on 
a 4-point Likert scare ranging from 0 (definitely agree) to 4 
(definitely disagree) with each of the following statements 
about their neighborhood or community: (1) ‘people in this 
neighborhood help each other out’; (2) ‘we watch out for 
each other’s children in this neighborhood’; (3) ‘there are 
people I can count on in this neighborhood’; and (4) ‘if my 
child were outside playing and got hurt or scared, there are 
adults nearby who I trust to help my child.’ A summary 
variable was calculated to indicate the perception of neigh-
borhood support, with a high number indicative of lower 
perceived neighborhood support. Finally, the parents per-
ceived safety of the neighborhood was assessed with the 
question ‘How often do you feel the study child is safe in 
your community or neighborhood?’ Responses ranged from 
0 (never) to 3 (always).
Analysis
Independent t-tests were conducted to compare the differ-
ences in demographic (gender, race, BMI, age) and lifestyle 
factors (days per week of physical activity, hours of daily 
screen time) between TD children and children diagnosed 
with ASD. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to 
examine the association of standard demographic variables 
(gender, race, BMI, age), environmental factors, and diagno-
sis of ASD with both days per week of exercise and hours of 
daily ST. Based on prior findings that health behaviors may

differ according to ASD diagnosis (Srinivasan et al. 2014), 
if a significant association existed between either outcome 
variable and ASD diagnosis, additional multiple regression 
analyses, stratified by ASD diagnosis, would be conducted to 
examine differences in the association of environmental fac-
tors and health behaviors according to diagnosis of ASD and 
the number of days children reported exercising per week as 
well as daily hours of ST. Standard demographic variables 
(age, gender, BMI percentile, race) were also included in the 
analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 with a 
significance level set at 0.05.
Results
A significantly greater percentage of children diagnosed 
with ASD (40%) were classified as overweight or obese 
compared to TD children (31%; p < 0.0001). There were 
no other significant differences in demographic variables 
between the two groups. The comparison of lifestyle fac-
tors revealed that children diagnosed with ASD engaged 
in significantly fewer days per week of exercise (3.96 vs 
4.7 days per week; p < 0.0001) and watched more hours of 
daily ST (2 h vs 1.83; p < 0.01),) compared to TD children. 
Table 1 compares means, standard deviations (SD) and fre-
quencies (%) between the two groups. A greater proportion 
of TD children (32%) reported engaging in exercise all 7 
days of the week compared to only 25% of children with 
ASD (p < 0.0001), and significantly fewer TD children (7%) 
reported engaging in 0 days of exercise compared to 13% of 
children with ASD (p < 0.0001).
For the entire sample, number of days of exercise was 
positively associated with being male (p < 0.0001), younger 
in age (p < 0.0001), no diagnosis of ASD (p < 0.0001), 
being of normal weight (p = 0.004), and less hours of ST 
(p = 0.0005), with 10% of the variance explained by the 
model. For hours of ST less days of exercise (p = 0.0005), 
older age (p = 0.0002), being overweight (p < 0.0001), 
having no limits on ST (p < 0.0001), and having a televi-
sion in the child’s room (p < 0.0001) are associated with 
greater hours of ST, with 11% of the variance explained 
by the model. Since ASD diagnosis was a significant factor 
in the model examining child exercise, regression models, 
stratified by ASD diagnosis were then conducted. It is also 
important to note that severity of ASD symptoms was also 
examined (data not shown), however, results did not differ 
according to severity levels, and therefore, it was sufficient 
to stratify by ASD diagnosis.
Stratified by ASD diagnosis
PA and Environmental Factors
For TD children, gender (p < 0.0001), age (p < 0.0001), 
normal weight status (p = 0.02), the absence of a television 
in the child’s room (p = 0.01), and increased perceptions 
of neighborhood support (p = 0.03) were associated with 
greater number of days of exercise. In contrast, for children 
with ASD, only normal weight status (p = 0.05) and younger 
age (p < 0.0001) were associated with a greater number of 
reported exercise days. Both regression models were sig-
nificantly associated with exercise frequency with 11% and 
7% of the variance for exercise frequency explained in TD 
children and children with ASD, respectively (see Table 2).
ST and Environmental Factors
For both TD children (p = 0.0001) and children with ASD 
(p = 0.0007), a greater BMI (those considered “overweight”) 
was associated with greater ST. For environmental factors 
in TD children, presence of a television in the child’s room 
(p = 0.002), absence of limits placed on television viewing 
(p = 0.0006), lack of neighborhood amenities (p = 0.02), per-
ceived lack of neighborhood support (p = 0.02), and the pres-
ence of adverse neighborhood factors that detract from the 
environment (p = 0.05) were all associated with increased 
ST. For children with ASD, however, only the presence of a 
television in the child’s room (p < 0.0001) and the absence of 
limits placed on television viewing (p = 0.005) were associ-
ated with increased ST. The overall models for both TD chil-
dren and children with ASD were significant (p < 0.0001),

Discussion
Ecological models have long been used to explain health 
behaviors and guide interventions, with the central tenet 
being that levels of influence are important in understand-
ing and modifying behavior (Sallis et al. 2015). Within eco-
logical models, the influence of the environment is receiv-
ing increased attention (Ding and Gebel 2012). Many of 
the findings in previous research on the association between 
the environment and health behaviors is consistent with the 
findings on the TD children involved in the current study. 
For example, similar to previous research examining PA 
participation among TD children and adolescents (Sirard 
et al. 2010; Franzini et al. 2009), in the current study, the 
absence of a television in the child’s bedroom and increased 
perceptions of neighborhood support were linked with 
increased PA participation. Conversely, though, environ-
mental factors were not significantly associated with PA for 
children with ASD. The lack of significant findings may be 
due to the importance of psychological and social factors 
that have been reported to affect PA and ST in children with 
ASD (Jones et al. 2017; Memari et al. 2015). For example, 
parents have reported barriers to PA for children with ASD 
to include fear of getting hurt during sports and exercise, 
stakeholders lacking skills needed to include their child, a 
lack of friends to be active with, and other children exclud-
ing their child (Must et al. 2014; Stanish et al. 2015). The 
relative influence of the levels of the ecological model may 
differ between children with and without ASD. Furthermore, 
the environmental factors that need to be present in order 
for a child with ASD to be active may be different from that 
for the TD child. For example, in the current study, while 
neighborhood support was associated with increased PA 
among the TD children, it was not the case for the children

with ASD. The support required for a child with ASD to be 
independently active in their neighborhood may, depending 
on their social and behavioral needs, be more substantial 
than that for a TD child. Also, due to the limited research on 
environmental characteristics and health behaviors among 
children with ASD, several environmental factors, such 
as the presence of trained practitioners or modified sports 
programs, have been relatively unexplored. Future research 
should seek to examine, in depth, the possible unique envi-
ronmental factors that can inhibit or encourage activity for 
children with ASD.
This study also demonstrated some differences relating 
to the environmental factors that were associated with ST 
between children with and without ASD. A lack of neigh-
borhood amenities, a lack of neighborhood support, and the 
presence of adverse neighborhood factors were associated 
with increased ST for the TD children, but not children with 
ASD. This may support the suggestion that other factors 
further down the hierarchical ecological model may be more 
influential for children with ASD. At the home level, two 
environmental factors were significant for both groups; hav-
ing no limits on television time and the presence of a televi-
sion in the child’s room. Due to the higher levels of seden-
tary behavior among children with ASD (Must et al. 2014), 
this finding is particularly noteworthy. Previous research 
examining factors associated with ST among this popula-
tion is scarce. Research involving parents of children with 
ASD (Nally et al. 2000) offers some insight into why ST 
levels may be higher among this population. For example, 
parents have discussed the importance of television and ST 
as mechanisms for managing undesirable behaviors (Nally 
et al. 2000). Moreover, it has been proposed that the appeal 
of screen-based activities may be greater among individu-
als with ASD due to the visually-orientated nature of ASD 
(Must et al. 2014). Such factors may result in the imple-
mentation of ST rules—including the enforcement of rules 
regarding the presence of a television in the bedroom—more 
difficult for the families with a child with ASD. The effect of 
the home environment, including the presence of screens in 
the bedroom and rules regarding ST, should be further exam-
ined for children with ASD. The feasibility of interventions 
focused on altering screen-based activity use should also be 
assessed, including the possible replacement of sedentary 
ST with active ST activities, such as exergaming. Previous 
research has revealed exergaming to be an effective means of 
reducing repetitive behaviors in children with ASD (Ander-
son-Hanley et al. 2011).
The current study benefited from having a relatively 
large sample size, a comparison group, and the examination 
of a range of environmental factors and their association 
with PA and ST previously unexplored for this population. 
However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, 
due to the nature of the NSCH questionnaires, there were 
limited questions, and detail, available on the variables of 
interest. For example, a range of environmental barriers 
previously demonstrated to be influential for TD children 
were not available for the current study, including transport 
infrastructure and residential density (Davison and Law-
son 2006; Ding et al. 2011). Future research should seek to 
conduct a more comprehensive examination of influential 
environmental factors among children with ASD. Third, this 
study did not allow for the examination of how the hetero-
geneity of ASD (e.g. cognitive, sensory, motor profile) may 
moderate the relationship between the environment and PA 
and ST. Fourth, information was gathered via parent-report, 
which may be prone to recall error or bias. Some questions 
used are particularly subject to interpretation, for example 
the question regarding the parents’ perception of neighbor-
hood safety. Future research should seek to use more objec-
tive measures, of both health behaviors and environmental 
factors. Finally, the current study utilized the 2011/2012 
NCSH; the newly released 2016 NSCH data may provide 
a more updated account of the environmental correlates 
associated with PA and ST among children with ASD. For 
the purpose of this study, however, the 2011/2012 data set 
was considered preferable due to the discrete nature of the 
physical activity measure (a categorical variable was used 
in the 2016 data set).
Conclusions
Two main findings emerged from the current study. First, the 
environmental factors associated with PA appear to differ 
between children with and without ASD; whereas absence of 
a television in the child’s room and increased neighborhood 
support were associated with PA among the TD children, no 
significant environmental factors were identified for the chil-
dren with ASD. This finding prompts further investigation 
into the influence of the environment on PA participation of 
children with ASD. Second, some commonalities in environ-
mental factors associated with ST appear to exist between 
groups; for both groups having no limits on television time, 
and the presence of a television in the child’s bedroom were 
associated with increased levels of ST. A large proportion of 
unexplained variance exists in both PA and ST levels among 
children with ASD, suggesting that the contribution of the 
physical and social environment requires further exploration.
