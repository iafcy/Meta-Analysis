Excessive digital media use has become the common phenomenon among children’s lifestyle, and its influences 
on the plausible accompanying psychological and behavioral problems are gradually investigated. This study 
aimed to examine the association between screen time and developmental and behavioral problems of children 
in the United States (US). A secondary analysis based on the data from the 2018 to 2020 National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH) was conducted. Seven types of developmental and behavioral problems and screen 
time on weekdays of children were collected through parents/caregivers’ recall. Logistic regression models were 
constructed to determine the associations. Overall, 101,350 children aged between 0 and 17 years old were 
included in this study and 70.3% of preschoolers aged 0–5 years old and 80.2% of children and adolescents aged 
6–17 years old had excessive screen time. Excessive screen time was positively associated with behavioral and 
conduct problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, learning disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and there were significant dose-response relationships. The 
association between excessive screen time and developmental and behavioral problems was stronger among 
preschoolers than among children and adolescents. Boys with excessive screen time showed high odds of most 
types of developmental and behavioral problems. It can be concluded that children with excessive screen time 
are at high odds of developmental and behavioral problems, especially for preschoolers and boys. Early inter­
vention of digital media use is urgent and essential for children in the US.   
1. Introduction 
Along with the advance in science and technology and popularity of 
electronic products, digital media and screens are pervading every 
aspect in the lives of children. It has been reported that approximately 
91% of children aged 0–8 years in the United States (US) have a home 
computer, and 98% have a mobile device at home (Common Sense 
Media, 2018). Consequently, in recent decades, the average screen time 
of children aged 8–18 years had increased from 6.21 h per day to 7.38 h 
per day (Magee et al., 2014). In addition, children aged 0–8 years in the 
US are also reported to spend two-and-a-quarter hours a day on screens 
(Common Sense Media, 2018), which extensively exceeds guidelines of 
World Health Organization (WHO) on physical activity and sedentary 
behavior that infants aged 1 years old should not have digital screen 
exposure, no more than 1 h per day of digital media is recommended for 
infants aged 2–4 years old (World Health Organization, 2019), and 
children and adolescents aged 5–17 years old should not have exceed 2 h 
per day of recreational screen time (World Health Organization, 2020).

Early screens exposure is not always beneficial. Although there are ev­
idences that moderate or high-quality and interactive screen time is 
benefit for learning and cognitive (Radesky et al., 2015; Kirkorian et al., 
2016), a range of psychological and physical problems of children have 
been increasingly identified which are caused by excessive exposure to 
screen media in early childhood development (Domingues-Montanari, 
2017; Kushima et al., 2022; Varadarajan et al., 2021). Accordingly, 
comprehensive exploration of potential consequences of excessive 
screen use are instructive for pediatricians and other health care 
practitioners. 
Health development and behavior of children are always the hot 
topic of pediatrics. During childhood, individual psychology and 
behavior develop rapidly and gradually stabilize, but developmental 
delay and behavioral problems are easily induced under the impact of 
various external risk factors (Miguel et al., 2019). It has been identified 
that development delay and behavioral problems are common among 
US children that 7.4% of children aged 3–17 years in the US had current 
behavioral/conduct problems (Ghandour et al., 2019), the overall 
prevalence of any developmental disability among children aged 3–17 
years in the US was 16.93% and there was an increasing trend 
(Zablotsky et al., 2019). Therefore, early detection of risk and protective 
components associated with developmental and behavioral problems is 
essential and urgent for the intervention and prevention. 
With the increasing attention to digital screens in recent years, evi­
dence of the effects of digital screen use on the developmental and 
behavioral problems has gradually emerged but is mixed. A few longi­
tudinal and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated the positive as­
sociation between excessive digital media exposure and developmental 
and behavioral problems in younger children (Vohr et al., 2021; Zhao 
et al., 2022; Varadarajan et al., 2021; McArthur et al., 2022; Hill et al., 
2020; Kushima et al., 2022; Madigan et al., 2019). However, no signif­
icant association between screen time and behavioral problems is also 
supported by some longitudinal studies (Levelink et al., 2021). This 
discrepancy in findings of the association between screen time and 
developmental and behavioral problems may be partially accounted for 
methodological variations that the measurement of screen time differed 
between studies and the influence of mediators (Twenge et al., 2020), 
which implies that it is necessary to further extensively examine accu­
rate associations. Moreover, most previous studies have examined as­
sociation between digital media use and single or several types of 
developmental and behavioral problems of children, and few had 
determined its association with a broader spectrum of developmental 
and behavioral problems. Therefore, examination of the association 
between digital media use and extensively spectrum of developmental 
and behavioral problems of children is deserved and necessary. 
It should be noted that there is the sensitive or critical period for 
children’s health development (Alberga et al., 2012; Meredith, 2015), 
and the effect of digital media exposure on the health of children may be 
varied by the exposure periods. For example, a cross-sectional study has 
indicated that the first three years following birth might be a sensitive 
period for children when screen exposure increases the risk of experi­
encing autistic-like behaviors (Chen et al., 2021). Previous studies have 
also highlighted that infants and toddlers with excessive media use are 
more likely to show abnormal in health (Reid Chassiakos et al., 2016). It 
has been demonstrated that associations between screen time and lower 
psychological well-being were larger among adolescents than younger 
children (Twenge and Campbell, 2018). Therefore, it can be speculated 
that the strength of the association between digital media exposure and 
children’s developmental and behavioral problems may differ across the 
childhood. However, most of studies explored the association between 
early digital media exposure and developmental and behavioral delays 
mainly focus on early or middle childhood, but less is explored the as­
sociations expand all childhood periods. It is well-known that early 
childhood is an important period and rapid stage for brain development 
and healthy development, and cognitive and behavior patterns are 
gradually stable in later childhood and adulthood. We therefore 
speculate that excessive screen time may be more harmful to younger 
children than older adolescents. Apart from that, importantly, sex dif­
ference of the effect of digital media use on mental or behavioral health 
of children has also been identified (Twenge and Martin, 2020; Kushima 
et al., 2022). Summarily, some study have indicated that the effect of 
digital media use was stronger for girls than boys (Twenge and Martin, 
2020), but no significant effect of digital media use on girls has also been 
observed (Kushima et al., 2022). Similarly, whether the associations 
between digital media use and various developmental and behavioral 
problems exist sex difference needs further explored. 
A better understanding of the association of screen time with 
developmental and behavioral problems may be helpful to earlier and 
more effective interventions as well as the promotion of healthy child 
development. Therefore, to expand the knowledge on the effect of dig­
ital media use on the development of children, the current study utilized 
the data of 2018–2020 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) in 
order to examine the following questions: (1) how excessive screen time 
of children relate to developmental and behavioral problems; (2) 
whether the associations between screen time and developmental and 
behavioral problems exist age difference; (3) whether girls with exces­
sive screen time are at greater risk for developmental and behavioral 
problems compared with boys. The findings of this study will provide 
additional evidences on the association between digital media use and 
developmental and behavioral problems of children and help to develop 
and implement policies and programs for policy makers, health practi­
tioners, educators, and social support workers. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Data source and study design 
NSCH is a representative national cross-sectional survey in the US. It 
is conducted annually in order to collect a broad range of information 
about health and well-beings among children between 0 and 17 years 
old, which is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and 
Child Health Bureau (National Survey of Children’s Health (2016 - 
present). https://www.childhealthdata.org/browse/survey). NSCH uti­
lized a stratified random sampling design that the survey first identified 
families with children from a national sample (50 states across the 
United States) of addresses, then randomly selected one child from each 
of the eligible families, who then took a more detailed thematic ques­
tionnaire. For more information, detailed sampling methodology can be 
seen in Methodology Report and Sampling and Administration Diagram 
on the Data Resource Center (DRC) website (www.childhealthdata.org). 
In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis by using 2018 to 2020 
survey data with the full sample sizes ranged from 21,599 to 50,212, and 
the weighted overall response rate was ranged from 37.4% to 43.1%. A 
total of 102,740 samples aged 0–17 years were initially included in our 
study. Samples with missing data on screen time were deleted, and 101, 
350 children were finally included for data analysis. The flowchart is 
presented in Fig. 1. 
2.2. Measurements 
2.2.1. Assessment of screen time 
In NSCH, screen time of children was assessed by asking the family 
caregivers about the media device use on weekdays that “On most 
weekdays, about how much time does this child usually spend in front of 
a TV, computer, cellphone or other electronic device watching pro­
grams, playing games, accessing the internet or using social media, not 
including schoolwork?”. The response was selected with five categories 
(Less than 1 h per day; 1 h per day; 2 h per day; 3 h per day; and 4 or 
more hours per day). According to the guidelines on screen time (World 
Health Organization, 2019; World Health Organization, 2020), exces­
sive screen time of preschoolers (0–5years old) was defined with ≥1

142
h/day of screen time, and excessive screen time of children and ado­
lescents (6–17 years old) was defined with ≥2 h/day of screen time. 
2.2.2. Assessment of developmental and behavioral problems 
The information about children’s health conditions is based on 
caregivers recollection that 10 conditions of mental, emotional, devel­
opmental or behavioral (MEDB) problems of children were asked, 
including Tourette Syndrome, anxiety problems, depression, behavioral 
and conduct problem, developmental delay, intellectual disability, 
speech or other language disorder, learning disability (also known as 
mental retardation), Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), 
Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) that “has a doctor, other health care provider, or educator ever 
told you that this child has these problems”. The parents were separately 
answered what is the condition of each MEDB problem of the child. In 
this study, the behavioral and conduct problem, developmental delay, 
intellectual disability, speech or other language disorder, learning 
disability, ASD, and ADHD were selected as the outcomes to reflect 
developmental and behavioral problems of children. Each outcome was 
respectively coded as no or yes based on the response of parents/ 
caregivers. 
2.2.3. Potential confounding variables 
To eliminate the influence of confounding factors as much as possible 
and examine the accurate relationships, potential available confounding 
variables in NSCH related to the children, family and caregivers/parents 
were adjusted. Specially, characteristics of children including age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, premature, low birth weight, participation in organized 
activities after school or on weekends and physical activity were 
considered, characteristics of family and caregivers/parents including 
type of primary caregivers, highest education of caregivers, household 
income, family structure, and number of child in family were consid­
ered. In addition, parenting is also closely associated with children’s 
behavior and development (Crowell et al., 2019), parental aggravation 
from parenting was adjusted. It has been demonstrated that parent-child 
interaction is also an important factor which can affect the digital media 
use and development of children (Wong et al., 2020). Therefore, parent 
participation in children’s activities was selected and adjusted in the 
multivariate models. 
Details about the assessment of selected confounding variables can 
be seen in the handbook of NSCH survey. Briefly, the age, sex and race/ 
ethnicity, premature, low birth weight of children, type of primary 
caregivers, highest education of caregivers, household income, family 
structure and number of child in family were collected in the section of 
Child and Family Demographics through the response of caregivers. 
Parental aggravation from parenting was survey by the question: “Does 
this child have parents who felt aggravated by parenting during the past 
month?”. The information of parent-child interaction was collected 
through the question: “During the past 12 months, how often did you 
attend events or activities that this child participated in? (applied for 
children aged 6–17 years old)”. Children participation in organized ac­
tivities were survey by the question: “During the past 12 months, did this 
child participate in any organized activities or lessons, after school or on 
weekends? (applied for children aged 6–17 years old)”. Physical activity 
of children were surveyed by the question: “During the past week, on 
how many days did this child exercise, play a sport, or participate in 
physical activity for at least 60 min? (applied for children aged 6–17 
years old)”. 
2.3. Statistical analysis 
The number and percentage was used to described the category of 
screen time, the positive of each type of developmental and behavioral 
problems, and other characteristics of children, family, parents/care­
givers. Chi-square tests were used to compare the prevalence of each 
type of developmental and behavioral problems among different cate­
gories of screen time. Logistic regression analysis was performed to 
assess the association between screen time and developmental and 
behavioral problems of children and represented as odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We constructed three logistic 
regression models to stepwise examine the accurate associations. Model 
1 was the crude model without any covariate, model 2 was adjusted

demographic characteristics of children and families and model 3 was 
further adjusted for other variables (parental aggravation, parent-child 
interaction, participation in organized activities and physical activity) 
based on Model 2. Given that some confounding variables was only 
available for children between the ages of 6 and 17 and there is much 
difference between preschooler and school-age children, we divided the 
samples into two sections (preschooler: 0–5 years of age; children and 
adolescents: 6–17 years of age) for analysis separately. For the pre­
schooler, based on the guidelines on screen time for children under 5 
years of age (World Health Organization, 2019), we used screen time of 
less than 1 h per day as the reference to assess the associations between 
excessive screen time and developmental problems. For children and 
adolescents, the screen time of less than 2 h per day as the reference to 
examine associations according to the guidelines on the screen time for 
children and adolescents (World Health Organization, 2020). Age dif­
ferences of the association between screen time and developmental and 
behavioral problems were explored through subgroup analyses based on 
age subgroups that samples of children and adolescents were divided 
into two age subgroups (children aged 6–11 years old and 12–17 years 
old). Sex difference on the associations were also examined by different 
sex subgroups. Considering that screen use in adolescents is particularly 
prevalent and the teens have higher levels of screen time (Twenge and 
Campbell, 2018), We further adjusted for screen time of less than 3 
h/day as the reference to explore whether the association of excessive 
screen use with developmental and behavioral problems was stable and 
robust. All analyses were performed by SPSS 23.0 software, and P value 
less than 0.05 at two-side test was considered statistical significance. 
3. Results 
3.1. Characteristics of subjects 
Of 101,350 children, 52,659 (52.0%) were boys, and most children 
(77.4) were White race. For the screen use of all included children, 
13,156 (13.0%) were reported with less than 1 h/day of screen time, 
16,606 (16.4%) with 1 h/day, 28,997 (28.6%) with 2 h/day, 19,533 
(19.3%) with 3 h/day, and 23,058 (22.8%) with 4 or more hours/day. 
For the prevalence of excessive screen time, 70.3% of preschoolers aged 
0–5 years old and 80.2% of children and adolescents aged 6–17 years old 
had been identified with excessive screen time. For the outcome of 
developmental and behavioral problems, 8388 (8.3%) had behavioral 
and conduct problem, 7179 (7.1%) had developmental delay, 1047 
(1.0%) had intellectual disability, 8190 (8.1%) had speech disorder, 
7230 (7.2%) had learning disability, 2929 (2.9%) had ASD, and 10,206 
(10.1%) had ADHD. There were significant differences for the preva­
lence of all types of developmental and behavioral problems among 
different categories of screen time and the trend of the prevalence of 
developmental and behavioral problems was increased with the cate­
gory of screen times (Fig. 2). The detailed characteristics of children are 
presented in Table 1. 
3.2. Association between screen time and developmental and behavioral 
problems 
The results of associations between screen time and developmental 
and behavioral problems among preschoolers are shown in Table 2. 
Overall, preschoolers with excessive screen time showed higher odds of 
developmental and behavioral problems. Specially, it can be seen that 
excessive screen time was positively associated with all seven types of 
developmental and behavioral problems without adjusting confounding 
factors. After adjusting potential confounding factors, compared with 
less than 1 h per day, children with 2, 3, 4 or more hours of screen time 
per day significantly showed 1.34 to 2.12 times odds of developmental 
delay, 1.54 to 2.38 times odds of speech disorder and 2.08 to 3.49 times 
odds of ASD, preschoolers with ≥4 h of screen time per day significantly 
had 1.76 times (95%CI: 1.33–2.33) odds of behavioral and conduct 
problem, 1.96 times (95%CI: 1.38–2.78) odds of learning disability and 
1.85 times (95%CI: 1.17–2.93) odds of ADHD. In addition, there were 
significant dose-response relationships between the level of screen time 
and odds of each type of developmental and behavioral problems. 
Conversely, compared with less than 1 h screen time per day, children 
who had 1 h of screen time per day showed significant lower odds of 
intellectual disability (adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.21–0.80, P =
0.009), but there was no significant association between other cate­
gories of screen time and intellectual disability. 
The results of associations between screen time and developmental 
and behavioral problems among children and adolescents aged 6–17 
years old are presented in Table 3. Children and adolescent with 
excessive screen time showed higher odds of behavioral and conduct 
problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, learning disability, ASD 
and ADHD. Specially, with adjusting confounding factors, children and 
adolescents with 3 h of screen time per day significantly showed 1.11

times (95%CI: 1.01–1.22) odds of behavioral and conduct problem and 
1.16 times (95%CI: 1.07–1.25) odds of ADHD, and children and ado­
lescents with ≥4 h of screen time per day significantly showed 1.46 time 
(95%CI: 1.34–1.59) odds of behavioral and conduct problem, 1.13 times 
(95%CI: 1.02–1.24) odds of developmental delay, 1.12 times (95%CI: 
1.02–1.22) odds of learning disability, 1.27 times (95%CI: 1.10–1.47) 
odds of ASD and 1.32 times (95%CI: 1.22–1.43) odds of ADHD. There 
was also significant dose-response relationships between the level of 
screen time and odds of each type of developmental and behavioral 
problems. Similar to preschoolers, there was negatively association 
between screen time and intellectual disability that compared with 
children with less than 2 h of screen time per day, children with 3 and ≥
4 h of screen time per day significantly had lower odds of intellectual 
disability (adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0.98 for 3 h/day of screen 
time, adjusted OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54–0.84 for ≥4 h/day of screen 
time).

3.3. Association between screen time and developmental and behavioral 
problems among different age and sex subgroups 
The results of associations between screen time and developmental 
and behavioral problems among different age subgroups are presented 
in Tables S1 and S2. Consistent with the main findings, children aged 
6–11 years with excessive screen time showed higher odds of behavioral 
and conduct problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, learning 
disability, ASD and ADHD and significant dose-response relationships 
were identified. However, adolescents aged 12–17 years with excessive 
screen time did not showed significant association with most types of 
developmental and behavioral problems except for behavioral and 
conduct problem, intellectual disability and ADHD. Compared with non 
excessive screen time, adolescents aged 12–17 years old with ≥4 h/day 
of screen time showed 1.42 times (95%CI: 1.24–1.63) odds of behavioral 
and conduct problem and 1.34 times (95%CI: 1.20–1.49) odds of ADHD. 
Conversely, adolescents with 3 and ≥4 h/day of screen time showed 
0.61 times (95%CI: 0.45–0.83) and 0.50 times (95%CI: 0.38–0.67) odds 
of intellectual disability. 
The results of associations between screen time and developmental 
and behavioral problems among different age subgroups are presented 
in Tables S3–S6. Boys aged 0–5 years with excessive screen time showed 
higher odds of developmental and behavioral problems. Boys aged 0–5 
years old with 2, 3, ≥4 h/days of screen time had 1.32 to 1.99 times odds 
of developmental delay, 1.46 to 2.29 times odds of speech disorder, and 
2.16 to 3.59 times odds of ASD. Boys aged 0–5 years old with ≥4 h/days 
of screen time had significantly higher odds of behavioral and conduct 
problem (adjusted OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.43–2.77), learning disability 
(adjusted OR = 2.14, 95%CI: 1.38–3.33) and ADHD (adjusted OR =
2.53, 95%CI: 1.43–4.47). However, therefore was no significant asso­
ciation between excessive screen time and most types of developmental 
and behavioral problems among girls with 0–5 years old (Table S4). For 
children and adolescents, boys aged 6–17 years old with excessive 
screen time showed higher odds of developmental and behavioral 
problems except intellectual disability, but no significant associations 
between excessive screen time and developmental delay, speech disor­
der and ASD were also found among girls aged 6–17 years old (Tables S5 
and S6). 
3.4. Sensitively analysis based on the reference of screen time 
After adjusting the reference for screen time (<3 h/day), we rean­
alysis the association between screen time and developmental and 
behavioral problems among children and adolescents. Overall, children 
and adolescents with ≥3 h/day of screen time showed higher odds of 
behavioral and conduct problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, 
learning disability, ASD and ADHD, but lower odds of intellectual 
disability, which is consistent with the mainly findings among children 
and adolescents using the <2 h/day of screen time as the reference 
(Table S7). There was differences on the results of association between 
screen time and developmental and behavioral problems between dif­
ference age groups of children and adolescents. Specially, children aged 
6–11 years old with 3 and ≥4 h/day of screen time showed significantly 
higher odds of developmental delay, speech disorder and ASD and 
children aged 6–11 years old with ≥4 h/day of screen time showed 
significantly higher odds of behavioral and conduct problem and ADHD

(Table S8). However, among adolescents aged 12–17 years old, screen 
time was not associated with developmental delay, speech disorder, 
learning disability and ASD (Table S9). We also observed sex difference 
on the association between screen time and developmental and behav­
ioral problems using the <3 h/day of screen time as the reference. Boys 
aged 6–17 years old with ≥3 h/day of screen time showed significantly 
higher odds of behavioral and conduct problem, developmental delay 
ASD and ADHD, but no significant association between screen time and 
developmental delay, speech disorder, learning disability and ASD 
among girls aged 6–17 years with ≥3 h/day of screen time was found 
(Tables S10 and S11). 
4. Discussion 
We have identified that more than three quarters of children had ≥1 
h per day of screen time and almost one quarters of children had ≥4 h 
per day of screen time, and more than 70% of children had excessive 
screen time, which reflects the universality and severity of the frequency 
of digital media use among children in the US. The prevalence of 
excessive screen time of US children is consistent with the findings in 
India children aged <5 years (Varadarajan et al., 2021) and 
meta-analysis in Brazilian adolescents (Schaan et al., 2019), but obses­
sively higher than the results of national youth risk behavior survey 
among adolescents in the US (Onyeaka et al., 2022). This discrepancy 
may be due to the different measurement of screen time between studies 
that in US national youth risk behavior survey, children were asked to 
response the screen time behavior which may cause withholding re­
ports. For the association between screen time and developmental and 
behavioral problems of children, this study has indicated that among 
preschoolers, ≥4 h/day of screen time was significantly associated with 
behavioral and conduct problem, learning disability and ADHD and ≥2 
h/day of screen time was significantly associated with developmental 
delay, speech disorder and ASD; among children and adolescents, 
excessive screen time was significantly associated with ADHD, ≥4 h/day 
of screen time was significantly associated with developmental delay, 
learning disability and ASD. The findings in preschoolers are partially in 
line with previous studies (McArthur et al., 2022; Rocha et al., 2021; Hill 
et al., 2020; Kushima et al., 2022; Varadarajan et al., 2021; Chong et al., 
2022) that higher level of screen time can increase the risk of behavioral 
problems, delayed achievement of developmental milestones, speech 
delay, ASD and ADHD, but inconsistent with a cohort study in US which 
implied that screen media exposure was not associated with ASD and 
ADHD risk (Heffler et al., 2020). The findings of this study in children 
and adolescents are consistent with previous studies which identified 
excessive screen time was associated with conduct and hyperactivity 
problems (Ozmert et al., 2022; Vohr et al., 2021). Unexpectedly, we also 
have identified an interesting result that preschoolers with 1 h/day of 
screen time showed significantly lower risk of intellectual disability and 
children and adolescents with 2 or more hours/day of screen time 
showed significantly lower odds of intellectual disability. These findings 
indicate that small time of screen media exposure seem to be beneficial 
for intellectual development among preschoolers, but youth with higher 
screen time may be less likely with intellectual disability. Inconsistently, 
a cohort study in extremely preterm children found that children with 
high screen time had lower mean full-scale IQ scores but not significant 
(Vohr et al., 2021), and a cross-sectional study in India indicated that 
excess screen time was not significantly associated with the intelligence 
of preschool children (John et al., 2021). It should be noted that in this 
study, the ratio of intellectual disability is relatively low (1.0%) among 
children in the US, which is different from the intelligence indicators of 
previous studies (Vohr et al., 2021; John et al., 2021), and intellectual 
disability is mainly caused by inheritance or perinatal risk factors such 
as premature birth or diseases and children with intellectual disability 
may be less likely with digital media use. Therefore, intellectual 
disability of children maybe not affected by screen time of children 
which need to be examined in the further longitudinal studies. 
This study has also identified age differences on the association be­
tween screen time and developmental and behavioral problems that 
most types of developmental and behavioral problems were significantly 
associated with 2 or more hours/day of screen time in both preschoolers 
(0–5 years old) and children (6–11 years old), and the strength of as­
sociation was stronger for preschoolers, but excessive screen time were 
only significantly associated with behavioral and conduct problem and 
ADHD in adolescents (12–17 years old). These findings are consistent 
with previous studies which also found different adverse effect of screen 
time on physical and mental health of children (Reid Chassiakos et al., 
2016; Twenge and Campbell, 2018). This suggests that a time window of 
the adverse effect of screen time may exist which has been demonstrated 
in previous studies (Zimmerman and Christakis, 2005; Chen et al., 2021; 
Zhao et al., 2022). Sex differences on the association between screen 
time and developmental and behavioral problems of children were also 
observed that among preschoolers, boys with excessive screen time had 
significant high odds of all developmental and behavioral problems 
except intellectual disability, but girls with higher level of screen time 
had a significant high odds of developmental delay, speech disorder and 
ASD; among children and adolescents aged 6–17 years old, excessive 
screen time were associated with most of developmental and behavioral 
problems among boys, whereas only high amount of screen time per day 
showed significant and positive association with behavioral and conduct 
problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, and ADHD among girls. 
It is similar to the findings of the meta-analysis that boys showed 
stronger correlations between screen time and externalizing problems 
compared with girls (Eirich et al., 2022). Conversely, it has been 
demonstrated that girls showed larger associations between heavy dig­
ital media use and low psychological well-being than boys (Twenge and 
Martin, 2020). The cause for sex differences on the association is not 
clear and the possible explanation may be that boys have a longer screen 
time and are demonstrated to show more screen compliance than girls 
(Hinkley et al., 2013) and there are differences in digital media activities 
that girls spending more time on social media and smartphones and boys 
spending more time gaming (Twenge and Martin, 2020). The underlying 
mechanism needs to be further explored in further studies. 
The clinical and public health implication of this study suggests that 
parents or caregivers should strictly follow recommendations of the 
guidelines to limit their children’s screen time, and early identification 
and screening factors associated with screen time is beneficial. 
Furthermore, health care providers should be aware of the hazard of 
excessive screen exposure and carry out early intervention in children 
with excessive digital media use to prevent mental and behavioral 
problems. The differences on the association between screen time and 
developmental and behavioral problems among different age and sex 
subgroups imply that more attention should be payed on preschoolers 
and boys who may be the vulnerable populations of developmental and 
behavioral problems under the impact of excessive digital media use. 
4.1. Strength and limitations 
This study utilized a large sample size to comprehensively examine 
the association between screen time and seven types of developmental 
and behavioral problems across all childhood, and further explored age 
and sex differences of the correlations. The findings of this study pro­
vided additional evidence for associations between excessive screen 
time and child development and behavior. However, several limitations 
in our study should be noted. Firstly, NSCH survey was the cross- 
sectional design, which limited us to make causal inference that 
whether digital media use is a cause of developmental and behavioral 
problems cannot be concluded based on the cross-sectional nature of this 
study. In addition, there may be a reverse association because children’s 
behavioral problems may cause them to spend more time on screen 
media devices. A previous longitudinal study have demonstrated bidi­
rectional associations between screen time and internalizing behaviors 
for preschoolers (Neville et al., 2021). Therefore, longitudinal studies 
G. Qu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Journal of Psychiatric Research 161 (2023) 140–149

need to be conducted to verify the findings of this study. Secondly, the 
information of screen time and developmental and behavioral problems 
of children were collected through the recalling of caregivers which may 
cause information bias. It is suggested that reliable clinical diagnosis by 
pediatricians for developmental and behavioral problems as well as the 
use of objective screen exposure measurement tools will be beneficial in 
the future studies focus on digital media use and healthy development of 
children. Thirdly, it should be noted that different types of digital media 
use might have various impacts on the development of children, but the 
effect of total screen time can be examined because no detailed screen 
time on different types of digital media use was available in 2018–2020 
NSCH survey. Fourthly, the unavailability of continues data on screen 
time makes it difficult to determine the cutoff value for screen time to 
have a significant effect on developmental and behavioral problems. 
Fifthly, although some important characteristics regrade to the children, 
family and caregivers/parents had been adjusted in multivariate models, 
some potential confounding factors such as mental health of primary 
caregivers, media time of parents/caregivers and family history of dis­
ease were not considered because these information were not surveyed 
in NSCH. Finally, screen time was limited to weekdays, therefore, 
whether digital media use in weekend is closely associated with devel­
opmental and behavioral problems of children is unknown. Nonetheless, 
the relationship between screen time and developmental and behavioral 
problems is crucial to examine as a prerequisite for further investigation 
of content. 
5. Conclusions 
This study has revealed the prevalence of excessive screen time 
among children in the US, and demonstrated positively associations 
between excessive screen time and developmental and behavioral 
problems of children and there was age and sex differences. Specially, 
excessive screen time was positively associated with behavioral and 
conduct problem, developmental delay, speech disorder, learning 
disability, ASD and ADHD and these associations were more stronger 
among preschoolers. The significant dose-response relationships were 
found for the associations between screen time level and odds of 
developmental and behavioral problems. Moreover, boys with excessive 
screen time showed high odds of most types of developmental and 
behavioral problems. This implies that more attention should be paid on 
excessive digital media use of preschoolers and boys because they may 
be more vulnerable to the excessive screen time. Caregivers, educators, 
policy makers, and health care providers should pay more attention to 
the screen time of children and it is necessary to take applicable in­
terventions at an early stage for children with excessive digital media 
use.
