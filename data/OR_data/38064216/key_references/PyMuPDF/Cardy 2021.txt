The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in screen time for children and families.
Traditionally, screen time has been associated with negative physical and mental health
outcomes, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of
these outcomes. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the change
in screen time during COVID-19 school closures for children with ASD, and (2) examine
the parent perceived impact of screen time on mental health and quality of life of children
and their families. Canadian parents and caregivers of children 19 years of age and
younger were eligible to participate in an anonymous, online survey study. This survey
was available in English, consisted of 28 questions, took ∼10-min to complete, and was
available for 6 weeks (May 22 through July 6, 2020). The total sample consisted of 414
responses (ASD: n = 127, mean age = 11.7 ± 4.06 years; community sample: n = 287,
mean age = 9.4 ± 4.26 years). Seventy-one respondents were missing responses to
our primary question and removed from the analyses (ﬁnal sample n = 344). Compared
to the community sample, the ASD group had a signiﬁcantly higher screen time use
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic school closures [weekdays: difference =
1.14 (SE = 0.18), t = 6.56, p < 0.0001; weekends: difference = 1.41 (SE = 0.20), t
= 6.93, p < 0.0001]. Mean total screen time during the pandemic was 6.9 h (95% CI
6.49, 7.21) on weekdays and 6.3 h (95% CI 5.91, 6.63) on weekends for the ASD group,
and 5.6 h (95% CI 5.28, 5.92) on weekdays and 5.0 h (95% CI 4.70, 5.34) on weekends
for the community sample. There was a signiﬁcant increase in screen time during the
COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic period in the ASD group
[weekdays: mean difference = 3.8 h (95% CI 3.35–4.25), p < 0.0001; weekends: mean
difference = 1.5 h (95% CI 1.17–1.92), p < 0.0001]. Gender was a signiﬁcant predictor
of parent perceived mental health and quality of life, with male gender associated with
a higher likelihood of negative impact [quality of life (child/family) OR = 1.8 (95% CI
1.1–2.9), corrected p = 0.040; mental health OR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.1–3.1), corrected
p = 0.0028]. Parents’ most frequently endorsed emotions toward screen time were

guilt, frustration, and worry. Results of this survey study revealed that children with ASD
were less likely to beneﬁt from screen time to cope with social isolation, and screen
time resulted in signiﬁcantly more lost time on social interactions than the community
sample, which may exacerbate difﬁculties in social domains. Given the unprecedented
circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel context of technology use, the
ﬁndings of this study highlight the need for revision of screen time recommendations to
reﬂect the current needs of children and families.

INTRODUCTION
School closures, social distancing, and other pandemic response
measures introduced to control the spread of the novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have led to a massive surge
in screen time for children and youth (1–4). Screen time,
deﬁned as the amount of time interacting with electronic
screen technology, is traditionally associated with a multitude
of negative physical and mental health outcomes. However, the
novel context of technology use during the pandemic period is
challenging the traditional notions of harm as many families
now depend on digital devices to cope with the imposed
restrictions and psychological impact of the pandemic. Screen
time, which is typically associated with social isolation (5, 6), is
now paradoxically enabling virtual social connections to mitigate
the impact of physical and social distancing requirements. Often
viewed as hindering academic activities (7), screen time is quickly
becoming the primary mode of education for many children.
And social media, which is thought to contribute to anxiety and
depression (8–13) and misinformation (14) is also becoming a
place to seek support, share positive messaging, and disseminate
COVID-19 resources and strategies to improve mental health.
Despite its signiﬁcant inﬂuence on physical and mental health,
the impact of screen time on children and youth has been
largely neglected in the current pandemic and very little is
known about how much screen time use has changed during this
period. Of speciﬁc concern, even less is known about screen time
experiences of children and youth with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), who are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from screen
time (15, 16). ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized primarily by diﬀerences in social communication
skills and the presence of restricted/repetitive behaviors (17), with
a prevalence of 1 in 66 (15.2 per 1,000) children aged 5–17 years
in Canada (18). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, children with
ASD were exposed to more screen time compared to typically
developing (TD) children and other clinical groups (19). The
observed greater and earlier onset of interest in screen viewing
in this population is likely inﬂuenced by a multitude of factors
[see systematic review by (19)], such as the amount of social,
cognitive, or physical eﬀort required, the interpersonal reprieve
it may provide, and the lack of barriers to engagement. Higher
pre-pandemic screen time, combined with the loss of services
and supports during the pandemic and the disorder’s hallmark
pre-disposition for intense and restricted pre-occupations (17),
may put children and youth with ASD at a greater risk than other
children for negative outcomes of increased screen time during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the shift in the context of use
and increased reliance on technology during the pandemic, there
is a critical need to understand the both the changes in screen
time use and its impact on the well-being and quality of life (QoL)
of children with ASD.
This study aims to ﬁll the above knowledge gaps by surveying
screen time use in Canadian children and youth with ASD during
the school closures following the pandemic declaration on March
11, 2020. Our primary objectives were to: (1) characterize the
change in parent reported screen time in children with ASD
during the COVID-19 school closures, and (2) examine the
parent perceived impact of screen time on mental health and
QoL of children with ASD and their families. Our exploratory
aims were to examine predictors of screen time change and
perceived impact.

at
Holland Bloorview, Canada’s largest pediatric rehabilitation
hospital located in Toronto, Ontario (20, 21). The survey was
disseminated through email distribution lists and/or social media
channels (Twitter, Facebook) belonging to Holland Bloorview,
the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network (22),
and autism organizations and research centers. The survey was
available for ∼6 weeks (May 22 through July 6, 2020) covering
the end of the ﬁnal term of the 2019–2020 school year in Canada.
All participants provided electronic informed consent. Upon
completion of the survey, participants were able to enter a draw
for one of three $50 gift cards. The study was approved by the
institution’s Research Ethics Board.
Participants
Canadian parents and caregivers of children 19 years of age and
younger were eligible to participate in the survey. Membership
in the ASD group was determined based on parent-reported
primary diagnosis.
Instrument
The survey was available in English, took ∼10-min to complete,
and consisted of 28 close-ended questions (Likert-type, matrix,
single-answer, and multiple-answer) and one open-ended free-
text question (Supplementary Methods 1). The survey questions
were adapted from existing instruments (1, 23). To answer

Children’s COVID-19 Screen Time Changes
our research questions, the survey covered three key content
areas: (1) technology use before and during the COVID-19
pandemic, (2) the parent perceived impact of technology use on
parent perceived QoL and mental health, and (3) the diagnostic,
sociodemographic, and family characteristics of respondents.
Technology use was quantiﬁed as hours of use (in total, per
device, and per activity) per day on weekdays and weekends
(1). Parent’s perception of the impact of technology use on child
and family QoL and mental health was measured on a 5-point
categorical scale from “very negative impact” to “very positive
impact.” Lost time on other activities in favor of technology
use and parents’ emotions toward screen time (both measured
on a 4-point categorical scale from “never” to “always”), as
well as domains of beneﬁt of technology use (e.g., coping
with social isolation, online education, emotion regulation)
were also surveyed. The diagnostic, sociodemographic, and
family characteristics explored included household income and
highest level of education, child’s age, gender, race, diagnoses,
and symptoms, if the child received educational support, the
respondent’s relationship to child, the number of children in
the home, the number of adults responsible for childcare,
the number of adults working inside and outside the home,
and geographical information (ﬁrst three digits of postal
code). The survey concluded with a single open-ended free-
text question, which provided a space for respondents to
share anything else regarding their child’s technology use
during the COVID-19 school closures. For the purpose of
the survey, “technology” referred to electronic screen media
that included televisions, computers, laptops, game consoles,
handheld consoles, virtual and augmented reality devices,
smartphones, and tablets.
Community Involvement
The survey was developed in consultation with parents of
children with ASD.
Analyses
The data were analyzed in R 3.6.3 statistical programming (24).
Outliers were identiﬁed and removed based on inspection of
statistical distributions and measures of spread. We examined the
signiﬁcance of change during the COVID-19 period using a t-
test with Bonferroni correction for two comparisons (weekend,
weekday). Predictors of change were examined using multiple
linear regression analysis, logistic regression, and ordinal logistic
regression depending on the nature of the data. The primary
predictors examined were group, age, and gender based on
existing research on predictors of technology use (25–28).
The results are reported with Bonferroni correction for three
comparisons. Exploratory predictors examined were the number
of adults working from home, number of siblings, household
salary, and parental education, as well as the total screen
time, the number of hours spent on diﬀerent activities. These
variables were chosen based on known predictors of screen
time as well as demographics factors that may modulate the
impact of COVID-19 on families (25, 29, 30). No multiple
comparison correction was performed for the exploratory
predictors. Regression diagnostics were used to evaluate the
model ﬁt with respect to heteroscedasticity and non-normality.
Participants with incomplete data were included in the analyses
where possible. Supplementary Table 1 provides the number of
samples available for each of the demographic variables.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The sample consisted of 414 responses (ASD n = 127;
community group n = 287). The community group was
composed of children with no diagnosis (TD subgroup; n = 112)
as well as those with diagnoses of attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD; n = 17), anxiety disorder (n = 5), intellectual
disability (n = 8), learning disability (n = 6), other (n =
10), and missing diagnosis information (n = 129). Seventy-one
respondents were missing responses to our primary question and
were removed from the analyses. The ﬁnal sample consisted of
344 responses. The primary outcome (change in screen time)
was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the community group and
those with missing diagnoses. Analyses were done with the entire
community sample as well as the TD subgroup of the community
sample (no missing diagnoses).
Table 1 details the demographic characteristics of these three
groups. The majority of the participants were from the province
of Ontario (89%), one of the Canadian provinces with the highest
prevalence of COVID-19. As seen, both the community sample
and its TD subgroup were signiﬁcantly younger than the ASD
group, had a larger proportion of females, and signiﬁcantly
higher household income and parental education, but not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in race distribution or number of children
in the household. To address the imbalance, two approaches were
taken. First, the primary analyses were rerun with age, gender,
household income, and parental education as covariates. Second,
we subsampled the two groups to generate groups matched
in age, gender, race distribution, number of children in the
household, household salary, the number of adults responsible
for childcare, working from home, and working outside the home
(n = 156; Supplementary Table 2). The primary analyses were
rerun on matched samples.
The majority of participants in the ASD group communicated
verbally (83%). They either attended regular classrooms (26%),
received support in a regular classroom (30%), or attended a
special education classroom (32%). The most frequently co-
occurring symptoms or conditions in this group were anxiety
disorders (34%), ADHD (31%), and learning disability (26%).
Supplementary Table 3 provides detailed characteristics of the
group. For both the ASD and community groups, the majority
of respondents were mothers (ASD: 91%, community: 88%),
followed by fathers (ASD: 8%, community: 10%). The number
of adults responsible for childcare [ASD: mean = 1.9 (SD =
0.56), community: mean = 2.2 (SD = 0.57), p < 0.0001] and
number of adults working from home [ASD: mean = 0.8 (SD =
0.71), community: mean = 1.2 (SD = 0.71), p < 0.0001] were
both signiﬁcantly higher in the community group. The number
of adults working outside the home at least 1 day a week was not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the groups.

Screen Time
Pre-pandemic, mean total screen time in the ASD group was
perceived by parents to be 3.3 h [95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
2.92, 3.63] on weekdays and 4.9 h (95% CI 4.55, 5.27) on
weekends. In the community sample, mean pre-pandemic screen
time was perceived as 2.0 h (95% CI 1.71, 2.34) on weekdays and
3.7 h (3.34, 3.98) on weekends. During the COVID-19 pandemic
school closures, mean weekday and weekend total screen time
during for the ASD group was 6.9 h (95% CI 6.49, 7.21) and 6.3 h
(95% CI 5.91, 6.63) of use, respectively, while the community
sample reported 5.6 h (95% CI 5.28, 5.92) and 5.0 h (95% CI
4.70, 5.34) of use, respectively. Compared to the community
sample, the ASD group had signiﬁcantly higher screen time use
before and during the pandemic on weekdays and weekends
[weekdays: diﬀerence = 1.14 (SE = 0.18), t = 6.56, p < 0.0001;
weekends: diﬀerence = 1.41 (SE = 0.20), t = 6.93, p < 0.0001].
The conclusions did not change when controlling for age, gender,
parental education, and income, or after rerunning the analyses
with the TD and matched subgroups.
Analyses revealed a signiﬁcant increase in total screen time
during the pandemic (vs. before) in the ASD group (Figure 1;
two-sided t-test; weekdays: mean diﬀerence = 3.8 h [95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) 3.35, 4.25], p < 0.0001; weekends: mean
diﬀerence = 1.5 h [95% CI 28 1.17, 1.92], p < 0.0001). For the
ASD group, there was no signiﬁcant eﬀect of age or gender on
the change in screen time.
When looking at the entire sample, there was a signiﬁcant age
by group interaction, suggesting increased change in screen time
for younger children with ASD relative to the community sample
{Figure 2; weekdays: diﬀerence in regression coeﬃcients = 0.2
[standard error (SE) = 0.06], p = 0.001; weekends: diﬀerence =
0.1 (SE = 0.05), p = 0.019}. The interaction remained signiﬁcant
when the analyses were rerun with the TD subgroup (weekdays
only), but not with the matched sample. The latter was likely due
to limited age range in the matched sample.
In terms of the distribution of screen time (Figure 3A), the
longest screen time durations were reported for watching videos
[ASD: mean hours = 2.4 (SD = 2.09); community: mean hours
= 1.7 (SD = 1.47)], playing video games [ASD: mean hours =
1.6 (SD = 2.18); community: mean hours = 1.2 (SD = 1.94)],
and engaging in online learning [ASD: mean hours = 1.6 (SD =
1.63); community: mean hours = 1.7 (SD = 1.68)]. The highest
usage (Figure 3B) was reported for tablets [ASD: mean hours =
2.7 (SD = 2.93); community: mean hours = 1.5 (SD = 1.65)]
and computers/laptops [ASD: mean hours = 2.4 (SD = 2.31);
community: mean hours = 2.1 (SD = 2.22)].
Parent Perceived Impact
Our results revealed mixed perceptions of impact of screen
time on parent perceived child and family QoL and mental
health, with nearly equal proportions of respondents endorsing
positive and negative impact (Figure 4). There was no signiﬁcant
eﬀect of group or age, but gender was a signiﬁcant predictor
of both parent perceived QoL and mental health, with male
gender associated with a higher likelihood of a negative perceived
impact [QoL (child/family) odds ratio (OR) = 1.8 (95% CI
1.1, 2.9), corrected p = 0.040; mental health OR = 1.9 (95%
CI 1.1,3.1), corrected p = 0.0028]. The conclusions remained
unchanged when the analyses were rerun with the TD and
matched subgroups.
Supplementary Table 4
provides
the
results
of
ordinal
regression for the exploratory predictors. Higher likelihood of
negative perceived impact was associated with increased screen
time on weekdays [family QoL OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.02, 1.23),
p = 0.02; child’s mental health OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.04, 1.25),
p = 0.006] and weekends [family QoL OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.01,
1.21), p = 0.04], and the number of hours playing video games
[family QoL OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.00, 1.26), p = 0.04] and watching
videos [family QoL OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.02, 1.28), p = 0.02]
on weekends. Lower likelihood of negative perceived impact was
associated with screen time spent connecting with friends and
family on weekdays [child’s QoL OR = 0.7 (95% CI 0.56, 0.92), p
= 0.01; family QoL OR = 0.8 (95% CI 0.61, 1.0), p = 0.05; child’s
mental health OR = 0.7 (95% CI 0.53, 0.87), p = 0.002], playing
educational games on weekends [child’s QoL OR = 0.7 (95%
CI 0.53, 1.012), p = 0.05], using therapeutic apps on weekdays
[child’s QoL OR = 0.5 (95% CI 0.28, 0.99), p = 0.05], and weekday

To further probe the speciﬁc domains of negative perceived
impact, the respondents were asked to indicate how often
children lost time on sleep, homework, physical activity, or social
interactions because of screen time (Figure 5). For the ASD
group, always/often choices were most frequently endorsed for
losing time on social interactions (47%) and physical activity
(41%). Ordinal logistic regression revealed signiﬁcantly more
lost time on social interactions for the ASD group compared
to the community sample [OR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.66, 4.36), p <
0.0001]. Marginal group eﬀects were also found for lost time on
homework [OR = 1.6 (95% CI 0.97, 2.65), p = 0.06] and physical
activity [OR = 1.5 (95% CI 0.96, 2.47), p = 0.07]. The eﬀects of
age and gender were not signiﬁcant.

No beneﬁts of screen time for the family were
endorsed by 11 and 5% of the ASD group and community
sample, respectively.
For the child, the community sample had a higher likelihood
of beneﬁting from screen time to cope with social isolation [OR
= 2.4 (95% CI 1.43, 4.1), corrected p = 0.003], but decreased
likelihood of beneﬁting in the emotion regulation domain [OR =
0.27 (95% CI 0.11, 0.59), corrected p = 0.003]. Age was positively
associated with beneﬁts in social coping [OR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.02,
1.15), corrected p = 0.03]. For the family, age was negatively
associated with using technology as reward [OR = 0.86 (95% CI

Children’s COVID-19 Screen Time Changes
DISCUSSION
Our results showed a signiﬁcant increase in screen time for
children and youth with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic
(3.8 h on weekdays, 1.5 h on weekends). This is in line with
other studies of technology use during COVID-19 in the general
pediatric population across the world (1, 2, 4). For example,
in their longitudinal survey study in Shanghai, China, Xiang
et al. (4) found that screen time of children and adolescents
surged by ∼30 h per week from January to March 2020. Another
pre-peri lockdown longitudinal study conducted in Italy (2),
found that leisure screen time of children and adolescents
increased by more than 4.5 h per day. These studies took place
in countries that were experienced early COVID-19 outbreaks
(Italy, China) (31). How and to what extent pandemic measures
were enforced (e.g., stricter lockdowns), the density of living
arrangements (e.g., multi-family residential housing), and the
built environment (e.g., availability of parks and outdoor spaces)
may be contributors to the observed variability in screen time
increases. Furthermore, seasonal diﬀerences in behavior may
have contributed to screen time behaviors for both learning
and leisure, as the present study was conducted at the end of
the school year in spring/summer as opposed to late winter in
previous studies. Regarding total weekday and weekend screen
time during the COVID-19 school closures, the ASD group
exhibited 6.9 and 6.3 h of use, respectively, while the community
sample reported 5.6 and 5.0 h of use, respectively. The latter is
consistent with the results of another pandemic survey study
of a representative, nation-wide sample of Canadian children
(n = 1,472), in which average daily screen time was calculated
at 5.1 h for children (5–11 years) and 6.5 h for youth (12–
17 years) (1). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that, as a
salient consequence of the pandemic response measures, children
and youth are spending a substantial proportion of their days
engaged in screen time. This raises concerns over the long-
term and developmental ramiﬁcations of such extensive use.
At the same time, it is important to note that current screen
time recommendations (32) are based on pre-pandemic evidence
and speciﬁed solely for leisure use. Given the unprecedented
circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the novel context
of technology use, there is a critical need for revision of screen
time recommendations to reﬂect the current needs of children
and families.
We anticipated that children with ASD would exhibit greater
surges in screen time during school closures compared to other
children due to loss of supports and services, potential use of
screen time by families to manage challenging behaviors, and
diﬃculties arising from intense and restricted pre-occupations
related to screen use. Interestingly, our results did not conﬁrm
this. This may be due to the elevated pre-pandemic screen time
levels observed in this population, or a result of a marked loss
of opportunities for in-person participation in social and leisure
activities for the community sample, as these opportunities are
often limited for children with ASD even without the pandemic
measures in place.
We also did not ﬁnd an association between change in screen
time and other demographic and socio-economic factors. This
was unexpected given the diﬀerential association of technology
use with gender, race, and socioeconomic status (25, 27–29), and
the many inequities moderating the impact of COVID-19 on
families (33, 34). Given our limited number of responses from
racialized and lower income families, further research targeted at
marginalized populations is needed.
Compared to the ASD group, there was a signiﬁcantly steeper
increase in change in screen time with age for the community
sample. A positive association of age and screen time is well-
documented in the literature (35–37), however, there is some
research to suggest a milder age gradient for children with ASD
(38). Similarly, results of the present study suggest children with
ASD have exhibited a more consistent change in screen time
across the age span during COVID-19, resulting in an increased
change in screen time for younger children with ASD compared
to the community sample. This diﬀerence may be related to
younger children with ASD relying more heavily on screens
for entertainment or distraction than other children during the
COVID-19 school closures, or the more signiﬁcant loss of school-
based supports. These results may reﬂect a greater dependence
on screen time to cope with social isolation in adolescents in the
community sample, but not those with ASD. Further research is
needed to validate this.
The impact of screen time on children and families during
the COVID-19 pandemic reported by parents was mixed
regarding perceived mental health and QoL, with male gender
associated with higher likelihood of negative impact despite a
lack of signiﬁcant diﬀerences in screen time or increase in use
compared to females. This concern is supported by research
detailing greater adverse eﬀects of screen time for males in terms
of speciﬁc mental health [e.g., pathological gaming (39)] and
physical health domains [e.g., obesity (40), adiposity (41), and
metabolic risk factors (42)], though reported eﬀects are mixed
(43, 44). The diﬀerences observed in this study may also be
a reﬂection of parental attitudes toward speciﬁc screen time
behaviors (e.g., video gaming compared to social media use),
how parents experience screen time behaviors of their children
(e.g., video game play may be more disruptive), or a diﬀerence
in how boys and girls are spending time on each device or
activity (e.g., violent vs. non-violent video games, types of videos
watched). The likelihood of negative perceived impact was also
found to be positively associated with total screen time, number
of hours playing video games and time spent watching videos,
but negatively associated with time spent connecting with friends
and family, on social media, playing educational games, and
using therapeutic apps. Interestingly, although online learning
accounted for a large proportion of screen time, the amount
of time spent online learning was not predictive of the parent
perceived impacts of screen time during the COVID-19 school
closures. Once replicated in other samples, these ﬁndings can
lead to formulation of more activity-speciﬁc recommendations

health and QoL.
The ASD group and the community sample reported similar
beneﬁts of screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic for
their children’s social connectivity, education, and leisure time;
however, the community sample had a higher likelihood of

Children’s COVID-19 Screen Time Changes
beneﬁtting from screen time to cope with social isolation.
Conversely, almost half of children with ASD frequently lost
time on social interactions due to their technology use during
the COVID-19 pandemic, a rate signiﬁcantly higher than for the
community sample. Due to the hallmark characteristics of ASD
(17), it may be that children with ASD have greater diﬃculty
engaging in social interactions given the physical and social
distancing requirements of the pandemic response, or have a
smaller pool of peers with whom they could socialize (45).
Alternatively, children with ASD may exhibit a preference for
non-social screen time activities as these may be less emotionally
and cognitively demanding. Parents of children with ASD
further reported disproportionately aﬀected physical activity and
time spent on homework due to screen time. Despite similar
increases in screen time during the pandemic period, children
with ASD appear to be at increased risk for these negative
outcomes. This may be due to their higher overall screen time
compared to other children or may be related to characteristic
traits of the disorder (i.e., restricted or intense interests) that
change how children with ASD engage during screen time. Our
ﬁndings reﬂect the proposed consequences of technology use in
children with ASD (15), and raises concerns over compounding
negative outcomes for this population in instances of prolonged
school closures.
Parents’ emotions toward screen time were overwhelmingly
negative with guilt, frustration, and worry as the most frequently
endorsed emotions, a ﬁnding that transcended diagnoses,
socio-economic, and demographic characteristics (except age).
Unsurprisingly, these negative emotions were predicted by total
screen time in our exploratory analyses, and feelings of guilt in
particular were negatively associated with age. However, parental
concerns over screen time are not unique to the pandemic
period; prior research indicates as many as 84% of parents report
concerns over their children’s screen use (46). The feeling of relief
was also frequently endorsed by parents and may be attributed
to the role digital devices have played in educating, regulating
emotion, and child minding (i.e., screen time babysitting). While
there are fewer alternatives to screen time for kids during
the COVID-19 school closures, parental mental health needs
specially related to feelings of guilt over the amount screen time
may be actionable targets.
Strengths
This study has several strengths and represents a signiﬁcant and
timely contribution to the literature. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst study to investigate changes in screen time in children and
youth with ASD and assess how that change compares to other
children in Canada. A recent nation-wide parent-report survey
conducted by ParticipACTION assessed movement behaviors of
Canadian children and youth, including sedentary screen time,
∼1-month after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic
(1). The present study extends this research by quantifying the
change in screen time, examining these changes following more
prolonged exposure to the pandemic response (2- to 3-months),
and investigating screen time in a clinical population of youth.
This study is also the ﬁrst to investigate the parent perceived
impact of increased screen time on children and families’ mental
health and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Canada. The results of the exploratory analyses, once replicated,
can yield actionable targets that can be used to inform guidelines
and recommendations for families, and support speciﬁc activities
for optimal engagement with technology for children and youth
during the COVID-19 school closures. Speciﬁcally, screen time
appears to be more beneﬁcial for the child and family when
it is used as a means to socially connect with others, to
learn new skills, and to support one’s mental health through
therapeutic apps.
Limitations
The results of this must be interpreted in the context of
several limitations. First, all outcomes were based on parent-
report rather than direct quantitative measurement and may be
subject to response bias. Parent’s awareness of their children’s
screen time behavior may be facilitated or hindered by their
own routine changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such
as working from home, increased childcare demands, and
ﬁnancial and psychological stressors. Moreover, parents who
are not actively engaged in screen time with their children
may not be able to accurately account for their technology
use. Secondly, as parents were not required to answer every
question to complete the survey, there is uncertainty over
those left unanswered (e.g., missing diagnosis information). To
address this, we showed that the conclusions remained similar
when the analyses were rerun on subgroups and matched
samples where appropriate. A third limitation is that our sample
included a disproportionately low number of families with lower
household incomes (47). Despite this limitation, the observed
screen time in the community sample during the COVID-19
school closures was in line with that of a recent representative,
nation-wide sample of screen time in Canadian children during
the pandemic period (1). Lastly, due to our survey distribution
strategy, we were unable to calculate the response rate. It is
possible that non-respondents diﬀer from respondents in ways
that are pertinent to the aims of the survey [non-response
eﬀect (48)].
CONCLUSIONS
The present survey characterizes an increase in screen time
during the COVID-19 school closures in the Canadian pediatric
ASD population, with the largest increases in weekday use.
Although children with and without ASD exhibited comparable
screen time increases, children with ASD were found to
have signiﬁcantly greater usage both prior to and during
the pandemic. Parents’ perceived impact of screen time on
child and family mental health and quality of life during the
pandemic was mixed, though a stronger negative inﬂuence
for males was found. Children were found to beneﬁt most
from screen time for social connections, education, and leisure
time; however, children with ASD were less likely to beneﬁt
from screen time to cope with social isolation than other
children. In fact, screen time of children with ASD resulted
in signiﬁcantly more lost time on social interactions compared
to the community sample, which may exacerbate diﬃculties
