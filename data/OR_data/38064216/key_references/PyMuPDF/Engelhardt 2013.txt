Media Use and Sleep Among Boys With Autism
Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, or Typical Development
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) or attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for sleep disturbances and
excessive media use. However, the relationship between media
use and sleep in children with ASD or ADHD has not been studied.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In-room access to screen-based media
and video game hours were associated with less sleep among
boys with ASD. The relationships between media use and sleep
were much more pronounced among boys with ASD than among
boys with ADHD or typical development.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationships between media
use (television, computer, and video games) and sleep among boys with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with attention-
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or with typical development (TD).
METHODS: Participants included parents of boys with ASD (n = 49), ADHD
(n = 38), or TD (n = 41) (ages 8–17 years). Questionnaires assessed daily
hours of media use, bedroom access to media, and average sleep hours
per night.
RESULTS: Bedroom media access was associated with less time spent
sleeping per night, irrespective of diagnostic group. Bedroom access to
a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced
sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Mul-
tivariate models showed that, in addition to bedroom access, the
amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated
with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the re-
lationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep
was mediated by hours of video game play.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that media-related variables
may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances
in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize
the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals
with ASD. Overall, the current ﬁndings suggest that screen-based media
time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may
be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in
children with ASD. Pediatrics 2013;132:1081–1089

Children with neurodevelopmental dis-
orders are at increased risk for a vari-
ety ofsleep-related disturbances.1 Sleep
problems are common among chil-
dren with autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs), with prevalence rates ranging
from 50% to 80%,2–5 and include high
rates of delayed sleep onset and night
waking.6,7 Children with attention-deﬁcit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also ex-
perience difﬁculties with sleep, includ-
ing bedtime resistance and increased
difﬁculty falling asleep.8 Sleep prob-
lems are more common among chil-
dren with ASD or ADHD than among
typically developing (TD) children9–11
and can have detrimental effects on
daytime functioning for both children
and their families.12–14
The etiologies of sleep problems in
individuals with ASD or ADHD are multi-
faceted, including, for example, disrup-
tionsincircadianrhythmsandmelatonin
regulation.7,8
Because these biological processes are
primarily inﬂuenced by the light/dark
cycle,15 children with ASD or ADHD may
be particularly susceptible to sleep-
related
environmental
factors
that
emit bright light, such as computer or
television screens.16
Screen-based media use is one well-
established environmental correlate of
sleep problems in TD children.16 Indeed,
in-room access to a TV, computer, or
electronic games has been shown to be
associated with less total sleep in pre-
vious studies.17–20 Similarly, children
who spend more time using these me-
dia sleep less,17,21–23 leading some
researchers to speculate that bedroom
access to screen-based media may have
an indirect effect on sleep.16 However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has
speciﬁcally tested this indirect effect
hypothesis, nor has any study examined
how media use relates to sleep among
individuals with ASD or ADHD.
Screen-based media use may be a par-
ticularlyimportantvariabletoconsider
asitrelatestosleepinchildrenwithASD
and ADHD. Compared with TD children,
children with ASD or ADHD spend more
time playing video games and watching
TV,24–27 exhibit higher rates of prob-
lematic game use,28–30 and have more
difﬁculty disengaging from screen-
based media.31 This increased use
and preoccupation with screen-based
media, coupled with the potential in-
ﬂuence of bright screens on melatonin
production and circadian rhythms,
might place individuals with ASD or
ADHD at greater risk for media-related
sleep problems than TD children.
The purpose ofthe current study wasto
examine the relationships between
bedroom media access, average media
exposure, and average time spent
sleeping. The ﬁrst hypothesis was that
bedroom access (and average expo-
sure) to screen-based media would be
associated with less time spent sleep-
ing.Consistentwithresearchindicating
that individuals with ASD and ADHD are
atincreasedriskforsleepproblemsand
problems disengaging from screen-
based media, our second hypothesis
wasthattherelationshipsbetweenmedia
use and sleep would be more pro-
nounced in the ASD and ADHD groups
(relative to the TD group). Finally, con-
sistent with research on media use and
sleep in the general population,16 we
speciﬁcally tested the hypothesis that
in-room access to screen-based media
would have an indirect effect on total
sleep time through average media
hours.
METHODS
Participants
Parents of boys with ASD, ADHD, or TD
wererecruitedforparticipationinastudy
on screen-based media use. Data from
boys taking melatonin (n = 14) were re-
moved before analyses. Thus, the ﬁnal
sample consisted of 128 boys (ASD = 49,
ADHD=38,TD=41)ranginginagefrom8
to 17 years (mean 6 SD: 11.8 6 2.5
years). The majority of the boys were
white (85%). Most participants earned
more than $41 000 per year (63%) and
were currently married (71%). Some
participants also indicated that their
child was taking medications associated
with insomnia (18%; eg, stimulants) or
drowsiness (28%; eg, a1 agonists) (see
Table 1 for demographic characteristics
by group).
Boys in the ASD group all had a previous
diagnosis of ASD, including autistic dis-
order (42.9%), Asperger’s disorder (26.5%),
or pervasive developmental disorder
not otherwise speciﬁed (30.6%). They
were recruited through an academic
medical center specializing in the
treatment and diagnosis of individuals
with ASD. The standard diagnostic
process includes evaluation by a phy-
sician and/or a psychologist and stan-
dardized diagnostic tools, such as the
AutismDiagnosticObservationSchedule32
and/or Autism Diagnostic Interview–
Revised.33 Three boys with ASD had an
IQ of #70, and only 2 were reported
by parents to have no current use of
phrase speech.
Boys with ADHD all had a previous di-
agnosis of ADHD and were recruited
throughabehavioralanddevelopmental
pediatricsclinic atanacademicmedical
center.
Boys in the TD group were recruited by
word of mouth and with the use of ﬂyers
placed in community locations and in
local general pediatric ofﬁces. They had
no previous diagnosis of ASD, ADHD,
or other developmental disorder (as re-
ported by their parents); were not tak-
ing medications for developmental or
behavioral problems; and did not score
above clinical cutoffs on the diagnostic
screening measures described below.

income, current medications, and di-
agnostic information.
Current ASD Symptoms
Current ASD symptoms (past 3 months)
were measured by using the Social
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ).34
Parents respond to 40 “yes” or “no”
items, yielding a composite score rang-
ing from 0 to 39. The SCQ has adequate
reliability,35,36 as was the case here
(Cronbach’s a ranged from 0.62 to 0.81
across groups).
ADHD Symptoms
ADHD symptoms were measured by
using the 18-item ADHD Total score
from the Vanderbilt Attention-Deﬁcit/
Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating
Scale.37 Parents responded to items by
using a scale ranging from 0 (never) to
3 (very often). The Vanderbilt Attention-
Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent
Rating Scale has shown adequate re-
liability in previous research,38 as was
the case here (Cronbach’s a ranged
from 0.87 to 0.93 across groups), and
has been used in previous research
examining ASD samples.39
In-Room Access to Screen-Based
Media
Parents responded to 3 separate ques-
tions indicating whether their child had
in-room access to a (1) TV, (2) computer,
or (3) video game system.
Average Hours Spent Watching TV and
Playing Video Games per Day
Parents indicated the number of hours
per average weekday and per average
weekenddaytheirchild spent watching
TV and playing video games (on a com-
puter or dedicated game system). The
average number of hours per day (for
each activity) was calculated by mul-
tiplying the weekend and weekday re-
sponses by 2 and 5, respectively, and
then dividing the sum of this total by 7,
consistent with previous research.26,30
Sleep Hours
Parents were asked “How many hours
does your child sleep per night?”
Analytic Approach
Totestourﬁrsthypothesis,thebivariate
associations between in-room media
access and sleep, and the associations
betweendailyhoursofmediaandsleep,
were analyzed separately. Our second
hypothesis that the relationship be-
tween these variables differed as
a function of diagnostic group was
tested by using general linear models
(GLMs). Sleep hours served as the de-
pendent variable; diagnostic group,
media variable, and group 3 media
variable interaction terms served as
independent variables. All GLMs con-
trolled for the following variables
(which will not be mentioned further):
marital status, income, use of medi-
cations associated with insomnia or
drowsiness, and age. Our hypothesis
that the association between in-room
access to screen-based media and
time spent sleeping would be mediated
by the daily hours spent with that
particular media was tested by using 2
linear equations.40 Mediation analyses
were conducted for average TV and
video game hours separately by group.

RESULTS
Only boys with complete data on the
variablesincluded ina speciﬁc analysis
were retained for that analysis. As
a result, different degrees of freedom
were observed across the models
reported below. Table 2 shows the zero-
order relationships between all con-
tinuous variables. All reported means
depict least square estimates.
Sample Characteristics
Groups differed on parental marital
status, total family income, and use of
medications associated with insomnia
or drowsiness and on SCQ and ADHD
Total scores but did not differ on age,
number of siblings, or race (see Table 1
for sample characteristics by group).
The ASD group had higher SCQ scores
than both the ADHD and TD groups
(Cohen’s ds = 1.2 and 2.0, respectively);
the ADHD group had higher SCQ scores
than the TD group (d = 0.71). The ASD
and ADHD groups had higher ADHD
Total scores than the TD group (ds = 2.1
and 2.4, respectively); the ASD and
ADHD groups did not differ on ADHD
Total scores.
A GLM showed that the average number
of hours spent sleeping per night did
not differ between the ASD, ADHD, or TD
groups. The ASD group spent more time
watching TV and playing video games
perdaythantheTDgroup(ds=0.54and
0.80, respectively); the ADHD group did
not differ from the ASD or TD group on
these measures.
Hypothesis 1: Media Use and Sleep
Boys with an in-room TV spent less time
sleeping per night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6
1.1 hours) than boys without an in-
room TV (mean 6 SD: 9.0 6 0.9
hours; F[1,121] = 16.9, P , .001, d =
0.70). However, the average amount of
time spent watching TV per day was
unrelated to the number of hours spent
sleeping per night (r = 20.14, P = .12).
Boys with an in-room computer spent
less time sleeping per night (mean 6
SD: 7.9 6 1.2 hours) than boys without
an in-room computer (mean 6 SD: 8.7 6
1.0 hours; F[1,121] = 9.9, P = .002, d =
0.72), and boys with an in-room video
game system slept fewer hours per
night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6 1.1 hours)
than boys without an in-room system
(mean 6 SD: 8.8 6 1.0 hours; F[1,121] =
7.2, P , .01, d = 0.48). Additionally, the
amount of time spent playing video
games per day was negatively associ-
ated with the number of hours spent
sleeping per night (r = 20.50, P ,
.0001).
Hypothesis 2: Group Differences in
the Relations Between Media Use
and Sleep
The relationship between having an in-
room TV and sleep was moderated by
group (F[2,112] = 3.8, P = .03) (see
Fig 1). Post-hoc mean comparisons
using Tukey’s adjustment showed that
the association between having an in-
room TV and sleep was pronounced
among the ASD group (t = 4.2, P , .001,
d = 0.78), but not among the ADHD
group (t = 0.55, P = .99) or the TD group
(t = 0.35, P = 1.0). Group diagnosis did
not moderate the relationship between
the average amount of time spent
watching TV per day and time spent
sleeping (F[2,109] = 0.93, P = .40). The
relationship between having an in-
room computer and sleep also was
moderated by group (F[2,112] = 5.2,
P , .01) (see Fig 2). Post hoc mean
comparisons using Tukey’s adjustment
suggests that the association between
an in-room computer and sleep was
large in the ASD group (t = 3.7, P , .01,
d = 1.0) but negligible in the ADHD (t =
0.64, P = .99) and the TD (t = 0.19, P =
1.0) groups. The relationship between
in-room video game access and sleep
was found to be similar across groups
(F[2,112] = 1.0, P = .36). The relation-
ship between sleep and time spent

playing video games per daydiffered by
group (F[2,108] = 3.5, P = .03). This in-
teraction was probed by inspecting the
bivariate correlations between sleep
hours and average video game hours
played per day as a function of group
(a scatterplot depicting the nature of
this interaction is shown in Fig 3).
These analyses showed that the re-
lationship between sleep and average
video game hours per day among boys
withASDwas large(r= 20.70,P,.001).
This same pattern, although smaller,
held among boys with ADHD (r = 20.35,
P = .04) but was nonexistent in the TD
group (r = 20.10, P = .56).
Separate GLMs were also conducted
withindiagnosticgrouptodeterminethe
extent to which each of these media-
related variables accounted for vari-
ability in sleep, the outcome variable,
while also controlling for age and
medications associated with insomnia
or drowsiness. Table 3 depicts all model
results by group. Only the signiﬁcant
results are discussed. In the ASD group,
age and average video game hours per
day were negatively associated with
sleep, and boys with in-room access to
a TV slept less than boys without in-
room access to a TV. No predictors
were signiﬁcant in the ADHD group. In
the TD group, age was the only signiﬁ-
cant predictor, such that older boys
slept less per night than younger boys.
Hypothesis 3: Indirect Effects
(Mediation) of In-Room Media
Access on Sleep
In the ASD group, in-room access to
video games (ie, access to a computer
or dedicated game system) was asso-
ciatedwithdailyvideogamehours(P,
.0001), and daily video game hours
were associated with less sleep after
accounting for the association be-
tween in-room game access and sleep
(P , .0001; see Fig 4A). The 95% conﬁ-
dence interval for the magnitude of this
indirect effect ranged from 20.42 to 2
1.50, suggesting signiﬁcant mediation
(see Fig 4B). Notably, although in-room
access to a video game was associated
with less sleep (P , .001) in a simple
linear regression, this relationship
disappeared (P = .52) after controlling
for daily video game hours. That is,
among boys with ASD, the variance in
sleep hours accounted for by in-room
access to a game system and/or com-
puter is largely transmitted through
average hours spent playing video
games per day. All other models testing
for mediation were nonsigniﬁcant and
are not discussed.
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge,
to examine how access and exposure
to media relate to sleep among boys
with ASD, ADHD, or TD. Results showed
that in-room access to a video game

system was associated with less time
spent sleeping per night for all groups,
consistent with previous research.17,19
Interestingly, in-room access to a com-
puter or TV was signiﬁcantly related to
less sleep among boys with ASD but not
among those with ADHD or TD. Average
video game exposure per day was also
associated with less time spent sleep-
ing in the ASD and ADHD groups but not
in the TD group. Among boys with ASD,
multivariate regression models exam-
ining the unique contribution of media-
related variables to sleep revealed that
in-room TVs and average video game
hours per day were associated with
less sleep, above and beyond the effect
of additional media and sleep-related
variables. The results also indicated
that in-room access to video games
had an indirect effect on time spent
sleeping among boys with ASD.
Althoughthecurrentresultsindicatethat
media-relatedsleepeffectsaremarkedly
greater among children with ASD, the
reasons for this ﬁnding are unclear.
Perhaps the most intuitive explanation is
that exposure to video games, particu-
larly at night, intrudes on the amount of
time that could be spent sleeping, oth-
erwise known as the displacement hy-
pothesis.16 Because children with ASD
have more trouble disengaging from
screen-based media,31 it may be more
likely that these media would contribute
to bedtime resistance and delayed sleep
onset for this group. Another possibility
is that exposure to brightly lit screens
may disrupt melatonin production,41–45
which could have a particularly detri-
mental effect on sleep quality in children
with ASD because they are already at
risk for abnormally low melatonin con-
centrations.42–44
Alternatively,
media-
related physiologic arousal may in-
terfere with sleep onset. For example,
video game play has been shown to in-
crease physiologic arousal,46 which
couldbe especially problematic if games
are played immediately before bedtime.
Given that children with ASD are at risk
for autonomic hyperarousal,47,48 and
that hyperarousal has been linked to
insomnia in the general population,49,50
these potential physiologic effects may
be especially pronounced for children
with ASD.
Sleep-related disturbances are a clini-
cally important issue for children with
neurodevelopmentaldisordersandtheir
families. For example, sleep problems
can exacerbate and worsen repetitive
and stereotypic behaviors,51 inattention
and hyperactivity, and other problem-
atic daytime behaviors.52–54 Sleep prob-
lems can also interfere with learning

and cognition,55 contributing to wors-
ening functional impairment. Evidence
also suggests that problems with sleep
can adversely affect family function-
ing.56,57 Although much of the data
reported on the relationship between
sleep problems and outcomes have
been correlational, treatment inter-
vention studies suggest that efforts
aimed at treating sleep problems can
help mitigate daytime behavioral prob-
lems in children with ASD.58,59
Limitations and Future Directions
Our study provides important pre-
liminary informationabout therelations
between screen-based media and sleep
in childrenwithASD and ADHD. However,
several limitations should be noted.
First, our measure of sleep consisted of
a simple parent-reported estimate of
averagenighttimehoursofsleep.Future
research should include more compre-
hensive standardized sleep measures,
including multidimensional tools that
assess different features of sleep, such
assleeponset,bedtimeresistance,sleep
duration, night waking, and parasom-
nias.60 Additionally, the use of multiple
informants, sleep diaries, or objective
measures (eg, actigraphy) may also be
helpful.61
An additional limitation of the current
study is that we were unable to accu-
rately assess the timing of screen-based
media use. As a result, although we
suspect that much of the reductions in
total sleep time in the current study are
related to nighttime (versus daytime)
media use, similar to previous re-
search,62 we cannot deﬁnitively say that
this is the case. Therefore, future studies
in individuals with ASD or ADHD should
include measures that better approxi-
mate prebedtime media exposure.62
Additionally, experimental designs63 may
be especially helpful in investigating the
effect of screen-based media on both
sleep and daytime behavior in children
with ASD or ADHD. Such studies may
involve randomized assignment into
presleep media exposure versus no
exposure groups to investigate within-
and between-subject effects. These
study designs would allow for the most
direct testingof hypothesizedprocesses
(eg, displacement, hyperarousal, mela-
tonin interference) by which media ex-
posure may affect sleep and behavioral
outcomes.
Finally, although diagnostic screening
instruments and information about
previous diagnoses were collected,
comprehensive diagnostic measures
were not administered as part of the
current study. Future research on me-
dia use and sleep in children with ASD
and ADHD should include gold standard
diagnostic tools to further examine the
relationships between these variables
among well-characterized samples.
Conclusions
The current ﬁndings suggest that the
associations between media exposure
and sleep are more pronounced among
boys with ASD than among boys with
ADHD or TD and suggest that in-room
access to screen-based media and
time spent playing video games may
place individuals with ASD at increased
risk for sleep problems. These ﬁndings
highlighttheimportanceofconsidering
screen-basedmediauseinbothresearch
and assessment of sleep problems in
children with ASD. Autism specialists
and primary care physicians should
routinely assess screen-based media
habits when addressing sleep prob-
lems in children ASD, because this may
represent an important intervention
target for improving sleep.

FLIGHT TO THE CITY: We live in a beautiful rural area of Vermont. The views of the
meadows, mountains, and farms are gorgeous. However, maintaining the yard
and animals is a lot of work. We cannot simply walk a few blocks or even a few
miles to a restaurant, and buying milk involves a two mile bike ride or walk. As the
children leave the nest, my wife and I keep thinking about returning to the city.
Evidently we are not alone in our thoughts.
As reported in The Wall Street Journal (August 9, 2013), baby boomers are
ﬂocking to cities. Hip urban neighborhoods are the new hot spot – not only for the
young with money, but the middle-aged as well. Baby boomers have been mi-
grating to the cities since the early 1990s. The movement slowed during the re-
cession, but has picked up speed again. Based on online real estate brokerage
data, over the past decade, more than a million baby boomers have moved within
ﬁve miles of the downtown of the 50 largest cities in the US.
The reasons for the migration are myriad. Cities are now safer and cleaner,
offering immediate access to restaurants, theater, movies, concert venues, and
shops.Often,thecommutecanbeonfootorviapublictransportation.Withchildren
out of the house, baby boomers do not have to worry about schools or having
enough space for all the children and their friends. Many baby boomers like the
ethnic and age diversity of the city, preferring not to stay in the same spot with the
sameacquaintancesforever.Oneproblemwiththemigrationisthatthecosttolive
in these trendy areas continues to rise as baby boomers are competing for
a limited number of condominiums with other baby boomers and young adults.
WhileIdonotexpect wewillmoveanytimesoon,asIridethetwomilestobuysome
