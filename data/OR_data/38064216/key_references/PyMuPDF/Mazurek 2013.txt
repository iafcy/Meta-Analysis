Video Game Use in Boys With Autism Spectrum Disorder,
ADHD, or Typical Development
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with ADHD are at risk for
problematic video game use. However, group differences in media
use or in the factors associated with problematic video game use
have not been studied.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Boys with ASD and ADHD demonstrated
greater problematic video game use than did boys with typical
development. Inattention was uniquely associated with
problematic use for both groups, and role-playing game genre
was associated with problematic use among the ASD group only.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to examine video game use in
boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with
ADHD or typical development (TD) and to examine how speciﬁc symp-
toms and game features relate to problematic video game use across
groups.
METHODS: Participants included parents of boys (aged 8–18) with ASD
(n = 56), ADHD (n = 44), or TD (n = 41). Questionnaires assessed daily
hours of video game use, in-room video game access, video game
genres, problematic video game use, ASD symptoms, and ADHD
symptoms.
RESULTS: Boys with ASD spent more time than did boys with TD playing
video games (2.1 vs 1.2 h/d). Both the ASD and ADHD groups had
greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video
game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that
inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the
ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games
predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only.
CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video
games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at
greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.
Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with
problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game
preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video
game use among children with ASD. These ﬁndings suggest a need
for longitudinal research to better understand predictors and
outcomes of video game use in children with ASD and ADHD.

Childrenwithautismspectrumdisorder
(ASD)andthosewithADHDareatriskfor
preoccupation with video games. Stud-
ies have shown that children with ASD
spend substantial amounts of time
playing video games,1–3 have difﬁculty
disengaging from them,4 and show
higher levels of problematic (addictive)
video game use than do children with
typical development.5 Similarly, children
with ADHD exhibit greater problematic
video game use than do children with
TD,6 and ADHD symptomsare associated
with greater time spent on video
games7,8 and with greater problematic
game use.8 Han et al9 also found a re-
duction in problematic video game use
among children with ADHD after an
8-weektrialofmethylphenidate.Thisline
of research suggests that the behav-
ioral and neurobiological mechanisms
of ADHD may be closely related to
problematic video game use, as dis-
cussed in 2 recent reviews on the re-
lationship between ADHD symptoms and
video game addiction.10,11 Although video
game addiction is not a formal di-
agnosis, studies have found that it is
characterized by the same features as
other behavioral addictions, including
salience, tolerance, withdrawal, relapse,
mood modiﬁcation, and conﬂict.12–14 Ad-
ditionally, theproblematicvideogameuse
construct can be reliably assessed,15,16
has good construct validity,17 and is
associated with negative functional
outcomes.18
The primary diagnostic features of ASD
include impairment in social and com-
munication skills and engagement in
restricted/repetitive behaviors.19 These
core symptoms may be directly related to
the development of problematic video
game play patterns. Speciﬁcally, a ten-
dency to develop encompassing pre-
occupations or intense interests may
lead to difﬁculty disengaging from video
games. The audiovisual and structural
features of video games, coupled with
their relative lack of social demands, may
also make them particularly reinforcing
for children with ASD. However, symp-
toms of inattention and hyperactivity are
also common co-occurring problems for
children with ASD,20–22 which may also
relate to problematic game use. Given
that children with ASD and ADHD have
distinct diagnostic features, yet share
common symptoms and are at risk for
problematic video game use, a better
understanding of the relations among
these variables across diagnostic groups
is important. Surprisingly, studies have
not yet examined how these groups
compare in video game play or whether
the correlates of problematic game use
are similar across groups.
The current study investigated these
issuesby(1)comparingvideogameuse
in boys with ASD, ADHD, or TD and (2)
examining the relative contribution of
speciﬁc symptom types and game fea-
tures in predicting problematic video
game use. Due to the signiﬁcant gender
differencesinASDandADHDprevalence
and phenotypes23–26 and the increased
risk for problematic game use among
boys,12,18 the current study examined
video game use among boys only.
Thiswastheﬁrststudytoexaminethese
issues, so competing hypotheses were
tested. Speciﬁcally, if inattention and
hyperactivity largely account for vari-
ability in problematic video game use
across groups, no differences in video
game use would be expected when
comparing ASD and ADHD groups,
but signiﬁcant differences would be
expected (for both groups) compared
with TD children. Alternatively, if prob-
lematic video game use is more closely
related to core ASD symptoms, differ-
ences would be expected when com-
paring ASD and ADHD groups.
METHODS
Participants
The sample included parents of 56 boys
with ASD, 44 boys with ADHD, and 41
boyswithTD,ranginginagefrom8to18
(mean 11.7 years, SD 2.5 years). See
Table 1 for demographic information.
Participants with ASD were recruited
through an academic medical center
specializing in ASD diagnosis and
treatment and had been previously di-
agnosed with an ASD, including autistic
disorder (46.4%), Asperger’s disorder
(25.0%), or pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise speciﬁed (PDD
NOS) (28.6%), according to the center’s
clinical care model. The standard di-
agnostic battery generally includes
evaluations by a physician and/or
psychologist and the use of standard-
ized tools, including the Autism Di-
agnostic Observation Schedule27 and/or
Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised.28
Only 4 participants had an IQ of #70,
and only 2 were reported by parents to
have no current use of phrase speech.
Participants with ADHD were recruited
through a university-afﬁliated develop-
mental and behavioral pediatrics clinic,
and they all had been previously di-
agnosed with ADHD. See Table 2 fora list
of current medications.
Participants in the TD group were
recruited through the community with
the use of ﬂiers and word-of-mouth
recruitment and had no previous di-
agnosis of ASD, ADHD, or other de-
velopmental disorder as reported by
parents.TDgroupparticipantsfellbelow
clinical cutoffs on diagnostic screening
measures (described later) and were
not taking medications for behavioral
or developmental concerns.
Measures
Video game use was assessed by using
a questionnaire designed for the cur-
rent study. Parents reported the num-
ber of hours per day their child spent
“playing video or computer games”
during out-of-school hours (data were
collected during months in which
school was in session). Parents pro-
vided separate estimates for “typical”
weekday and weekend days. An average

daily use variable was created by mul-
tiplying the weekday value by 5 and the
weekend value by 2, and dividing the
sum of these values by 7, consistent
with previous research.1,5 Parents were
also asked: “Does your child have
a video game system in his room?”
Parents also listed their child’s 3 most
commonly played video games during
the past month. Game titles were coded
into mutually exclusive genre catego-
ries based on descriptions from the
Entertainment Software Rating Board
website and were cross-referenced
with descriptions from 2 popular gam-
ing websites (Gamespot and IGN). Genre
categories included (1) action/action-
adventure, (2) adventure, (3) role-playing,
(4) strategy, (5) puzzle/mini-game, (6)
educational, (7) ﬁghting, (8) ﬁrst-person
shooter, (9) music, (10) platform, (11)
racing, (12) simulation, (13) sports
simulation, and (14) ﬁtness.
Problematic video game use was
assessed by using a modiﬁed version of
the Problem Video Game Playing Test
(PVGT).15 The original PVGT was de-
veloped as a self-report measure of
problematic video game use based on
the behavioral addiction model13 but
was modiﬁed in a previous study for
use with children.5 This parent-report
version includes 19 items rated on a
4-point scale ranging from 1 (Never) to
4 (Always); total PVGT scores represent
a sum of all items. Cronbach’s a ranged
from 0.90 to 0.94 across groups.
Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity
symptoms were assessed by using the
Vanderbilt Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
DisorderParentRatingScale(VADPRS).29
Items are rated on a 4-point scale
ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 (Very Often),
and the Inattention (9 items), Hyperac-
tivity (9 items), and ADHD Total scale
scores were examined. The VADPRS has
good internal consistency, validity, and
reliability30 and has been used in ASD
studies.31 Cronbach’s a ranged from
0.87 to 0.94 across groups.
Current ASD symptoms were assessed
by using the Social Communication
Questionnaire–Current
(SCQ).32
The
SCQ is a parent-report questionnaire
with strong reliability and validity.32–34
The Current form was used, focusing
on behavior over the most recent
3-month period. Items are rated as “Yes”
or“No”(totalpossiblescoresrangefrom
0 to 39). Cronbach’s a ranged from 0.62
to 0.83 across groups.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Groups did not differ by age, race, or
number of siblings. Group differences
in parent marital status and household
income were observed (see Table 1). A
1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
revealed that SCQ scores differed sig-
niﬁcantly across groups, F(2, 138) =
45.5, P , .001. Tukey post-hoc com-
parisons showed that the ASD group
had higher SCQ scores (mean 13.7, SD
5.6) than both ADHD (mean 8.1, SD 5.4,
P , .001) and TD groups (mean 4.4, SD
2.4, P , .001). The ADHD group also
had higher scores than the TD group
(P = .001). A 1-way ANOVA also showed
group differences on the ADHD Total
score: F(2, 138) = 60.2, P , .001. Tukey
post-hoc comparisons showed that the
ADHD group exhibited higher ADHD To-
tal scores (mean 30.3, SD 12.1) than the
TD group (mean 7.5, SD 5.9, P , .001).
However, the ADHD and ASD (mean 28.0,
SD 12.0) groups did not differ.
Video Game Use
We examined diagnostic group differ-
ences in daily video game hours
using the general linear model while
controlling for household income (di-
chotomousvariable,1=income#$80 000,
and 2 = income .$80 000) and parent
marital status (dichotomous variable,
1 = married, and 2 = not married). The
results revealed signiﬁcant diagnostic
group differences in daily video game
hours (Table 3). Bonferroni post-hoc
comparisons revealed that boys with
ASD spent more time playing video
games than did boys with TD (P = .01,

d = .80), whereas boys with ADHD did
not differ signiﬁcantly from either
group.
In-Room Video Game Access
The x2 tests revealed signiﬁcant group
differences for in-room video game
access (Table 4). Post-hoc bivariate x2
tests showed that a greater percent-
age of both the ASD and ADHD groups
had in-room video game systems
compared with the TD group, (P = .001
and P = .002, respectively), whereas the
ASD and ADHD groups did not differ.
Video Game Genre
Dichotomous variables (coded 0 = no,
1 = yes) were created to indicate
whether each game genre was 1 of the
top 3 most frequently played. To reduce
thepossibilityofTypeIerror,aBonferroni
correction was applied by dividing the
a level (a = .05) by the number of total
comparisons (14), yielding an adjusted
signiﬁcance level (a = .004). Two-tailed
Fisher exact tests comparing all 3
groups revealed signiﬁcant differences
in the shooter and sports genres (see
Table 4). Post-hoc bivariate Fisher exact
tests showed that a greater percent-
age of the TD (P = .002) group preferred
shooter games compared with the
ASD group. Also, a greater percentage
of the TD group preferred sports
games compared with the ADHD group
(P = .001).
Problematic Video Game Use
Diagnostic group differences in PVGT
score were examined by using the
general linear model, controlling for
household income (dichotomous), pa-
rental marital status (dichotomous),
anddailyvideogamehours(acorrelate
of problematic game use in previous
research12 and r = 0.51, P , .001 in the
current study). The results indicated
diagnostic group differences in PVGT
score (P = .001). Bonferroni post-hoc
comparisons indicated that the ASD
and ADHD groups had higher PVGT
scores than the TD group (P = .001, d =
1.12, and P = .03, d = .98, respectively).
However, the ASD and ADHD groups did
not differ (see Table 3).
Regarding video game genre prefer-
ence, 1-way ANOVA revealed that boys
who played role-playing games had
higherPVGTscores(mean45.0,SD11.9)
than those who did not (mean 35.6, SD
10.7): F(1, 142) = 11.2, P = 001. A fac-
torial ANOVA showed that the di-
agnostic group 3 role-playing game
interaction was nonsigniﬁcant, F(2,
135) = 1.7, P = .18, suggesting a similar
relationship
between
role-playing
preferences and PVGT scores across
groups.
Associations Between Symptoms
and Problematic Video Game Use
Subsequent analyses were conducted
separately by group to examine the
relative contribution of particular symp-
toms in predicting problematic video
game use.
ASD Group
PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.36, P = .008),
inattention (r = 0.48, P , .001), and
hyperactivity (r = 0.38, P = .004) but
not with SCQ (r = 20.01, P = .97). To
determine the relative contribution of
these variables to PVGT score, a simulta-
neous linear regression was conducted
withPVGTscoreasthedependentvariable
and daily video game hours, role-
playing genre, inattention, and hyper-
activity as independent variables. The
results indicated that daily video game
hours (b = .29, t = 2.6, P = .01), role-
playing genre (b = .25, t = 2.2, P = .03),
and inattention (b = .43, t = 2.8, P = .01)
remained signiﬁcant predictors of PVGT,
whereas hyperactivity was not a signiﬁ-
cant predictor (P = .54) when control-
ling for the other variables in the model.
ADHD Group
PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.47, P = .002)
and inattention (r = 0.37, P = .01) but
not with hyperactivity (r = 0.20, P = .19).
Linear regression results indicated
that daily video game hours (b = .49, t =
3.7, P = .001) and inattention (b = .36,
t = 2.1, P = .04) remained signiﬁcant
predictors of PVGT, whereas hyperac-
tivity and role-playing genre (P = .97
and P = .70, respectively) were not.
TD Group
PVGT score was correlated with daily
video game hours (r = 0.70, P , .001),
inattention (r = 0.55, P , .001), and
hyperactivity (r = 0.50, P = .001). Linear
regression results showed that daily
video game hours (b = .59, t = 5.9, P ,
.001) and hyperactivity (b = .32, t = 2.9,
P = .006) remained signiﬁcant pre-
dictors of PVGT, whereas inattention
and role-playing genre (P = .07 and
P = .87, respectively) were not.
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study to examine video
game use among boys with ASD com-
pared with those with ADHD or TD.
Consistent with previous ﬁndings,5
boys with ASD spent signiﬁcantly more
time than did boys with TD playing
video games, and this alone (2.1 h/d)

exceeded the American Academy of
Pediatrics’ recommendation for com-
bined screen-based media exposure.35
The estimates of daily video game time
for both ASD and TD groups were highly
consistent with those from another
recent study of similarly aged children5
and extend those ﬁndings by including
a comparison group of boys with ADHD.
Estimates of video game hours per day
in children with ADHD have not been
previously reported, yet our ﬁndings
were also consistent with a small study
showing that children with ADHD and
TD did not differ on broader measures
of game play frequency or duration.6
Importantly, the current study extends
previous ﬁndings with regard to prob-
lematic patterns of video game play.
Boys with ASD and boys with ADHD
demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater
problematic video game use than did
boyswithTD,whereastheASDandADHD
groups did not differ from one another.
These ﬁndings replicate and extend
previous research that has found dif-
ferencesinproblematicvideogameuse
whenseparatelycomparingASDandTD
groups5 and ADHD and TD groups.6 To
further explore this issue, we exam-
ined the role of particular symptoms in
relation to problematic video game
use. Among boys with ASD, problematic
video game use was positively corre-
lated with inattention and hyperactivity
but not with overall ASD symptoms.
Furthermore, in multivariate models,
hyperactivity was not a signiﬁcant
predictor of problematic video game
use beyond the effects of game play
variables, whereas inattention was
signiﬁcantly associated with problem-
atic video game use across the ASD and
ADHD groups.
These results shed light into potential
associated features of problematic
game use and are consistent with
previousstudieslinkingimpulsivityand
inattention with problematic video
game use.6,8,18 Children with ASD and
those with ADHD experience difﬁculties
with impulse control and response in-
hibition,36 and these problems appear
to be closely related to video game
preoccupation. In contrast, core ASD
symptoms were not associated with
either hours of video game play or
problematic video game use. Longitu-
dinal studies among children with ASD
will be essential to determine whether
attention problems contribute to mal-
adaptive video game use, whether
problematic video game use leads to
attention problems, and whether there
are bidirectional inﬂuences (as in
general population studies).7
This was also the ﬁrst study to examine
game genre preferences among chil-
dren with ASD compared with other
children. A somewhat greater, though
not signiﬁcantly different, percentage
of boys with ASD preferred role-playing
games (eg, the Pokémon series) com-
pared with boys with TD. This ﬁnding
is noteworthy, because role-playing
games have been associated with
problematic video game use in previous
studies.37–39 In fact, boys who preferred
role-playing games had higher prob-
lematic video game use than did those
who did not. This relationship remained
signiﬁcant even when controlling for
additional game- and symptom-level
variables in multivariate regression
models. These results suggest that
game genre may provide its own unique
contribution in the prediction of prob-
lematic game use, above and beyond
the effects of other well-known corre-
lates of problematic game use. More-
over, boys with ASD who prefer this
genre may be at even greater risk for
negative game-related sequelae.
Interestingly, boys with ASD were much
lesslikelythanboyswithTDtoplayﬁrst-
person shooter games. Because we did
notassessthereasonsforgamechoice,
wecanonlyhypothesizethereasonsfor
this difference. First-person shooter
games are fast-paced, audiovisually
intense, and violent, and game play
often results in increased physiologic
arousal.40,41 Given that individuals with
ASD are at increased risk for anxiety42
and sensory reactivity,43,44 these types
of games may be less appealing for
many individuals with ASD.
Finally, the results showed that boys
with ASD or ADHD had greater in-room
access to video games than did boys
with TD. It is possible that their pre-
occupation with games results in

Group comparisons were conducted by using x2 test when possible. Effect size is described by Cramer’s V. Fisher’s exact test
(2-sided) was used in cases in which cell counts were ,5. Post hoc bivariate analyses were performed by using Fisher’s exact
tests; groups with matching superscripts within rows differed at the P , .004 level.

increased access. Alternatively, greater
access may lead to more problematic
use or preoccupation. Another possi-
bility is that parents of children with
ASD or ADHD may offer increased ac-
cess to these media as a means of
managing difﬁcult behavior. This idea
has been discussed in other studies of
families of children with ASD4 and dis-
ruptive behavior disorders.45
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Primarylimitationsofthecurrentstudy
included reliance on parent-report
measures and a lack of comprehen-
sive measures for diagnostic conﬁr-
mation. Future studies should include
a multimethod, multi-informant ap-
proach, including gold standard di-
agnostic tools, to evaluate the impact of
particular symptoms on screen-based
media use. Although overall ASD symp-
toms, as measured by the SCQ, were not
related to problematic game use, the
use of multidimensional measures of
core symptoms may yield different re-
sults. In particular, speciﬁc difﬁculties
with restricted interests and preoccu-
pations may be most closely related to
the tendency to develop problematic
patterns of video game use. Additionally,
therelativelysmallsamplesizemayhave
limited our ability to detect meaningful
group differences in correlates of prob-
lematic video game play patterns.
Standardized measures of intellectual
and language functioning would also
behelpfultodeterminewhethermedia
use differs as a function of cognitive
or language level. Also, the cross-
sectional study design provides in-
formation about associations between
variables and suggests areas for fur-
ther study. However, causal con-
clusions cannot be drawn from the
current ﬁndings. Longitudinal studies
areneededtoextendthisresearchand
to examine the long-term effects of
screen-based media use in children
with ASD.
CONCLUSIONS
Theseresultssuggestthatchildrenwith
ASD and those with ADHD may be at
particularly high risk for signiﬁcant
problems related to video game play,
including excessive and problematic
video game use. Attention problems, in
particular, are associated with prob-
lematic video game play for children
with ASD and ADHD, and role-playing
games appear to be related to prob-
lematic game use particularly among
children with ASD. Although longitudi-
nal research is needed to examine the
outcomes of problematic video game
use in these special populations, gen-
eralpopulationstudieshaveshownthat
problematic game use can have sig-
niﬁcant detrimental effects.19 Thus, the
current ﬁndings indicate a need for
heightened awareness and assess-
ment of problematic video game use in
clinical care settings for children with
ASD and ADHD.
