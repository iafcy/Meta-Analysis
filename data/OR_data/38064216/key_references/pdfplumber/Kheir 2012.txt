Abstract
Background: Autism impactsthe lives of the family looking after a child withthe condition indifferent ways,and
forces family membersto modify their daily lives to suit their reality. Toour knowledge, noprevious research
investigated concern and considerations ofparents/caregivers ofchildrenwith autism in Qatar or the Arabic
speaking Middle Eastern region.
Methods: Caregivers of a child who was between theage of3 to17 years old atthe time of thestudy and who
was diagnosed with ASD (Autistic Group or AG) were recruited from thetwo main developmental pediatric and
children rehabilitation clinics inQatar. The control group (non-autism group, or NAG) was represented by
caregivers of a non-autistic child betweentheage of3 to 17 years old atthe time of thestudy and who were
visiting a family clinic of a primary health care facility for routine medical check-up. Data collected from both
groups included related to the child (e.g. the child’s date of birth, his/her relation to the caregiver,numberof
siblings, numberof hours of sleep ina day, numberof hours spent watching televisionor videos prior to age 3,
time spent indoors prior to age 3, absenteeism from school, and use of a nanny to care for thechild)and to the
caregiver (education level, profession, level ofconsanguinity using the phylogram method). Inaddition to these
questions, caregivers intheAGwere asked specific questions around maternal concernand considerations in
respect to the future oftheirchildrenand thespecialized services they receive.
Results: Children inthe autism group spent more time indoors,watching television, or sleeping thanchildrenin
thenon-autismgroup. Only around 40% of caregivers inthe autism group said they would encouragetheir child to
getmarried and become a parent when s/he grows up. Anumberof caregivers of children with autism frequently
utilize specialized rehabilitation services; others did express theirneeds for theseservices and made comments
about having to wait a longtime before theywere provided withsome of the services. Religious faithhelped
caregivers inaccepting having a child with autism. General health-relatedquality oflife didnot differ significantly
between the caregivers of thetwo groups, although mental health was consistentlypoorerin theautism group of
caregivers.
Conclusions: The study draws attention to the concerns of thefamilies of children withautismand their
expectations about the future of their children. The findings can be used by policy makers in planning services to
support thesefamilies in Qatar.
