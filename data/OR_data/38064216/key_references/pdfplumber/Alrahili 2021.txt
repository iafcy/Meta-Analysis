Abstract
Research problem
Advances in technology have ensured its inevitable integration in our life. Children, being at a vulnerable
age period of development, are spending more time on electronic devices. Some studies reported negative
effects on sleep, physical health such as obesity and vision problems, and behavioral changes such as
aggressive behavior with exposure to violent media content.
Research significance
We will study the effect of using electronic devices on communication skills in children in Saudi Arabia. Our
findings can be used to raise awareness on this matter.
Research objectives
The aim of our study is to examine the association between screen time and social communication skills
among children of four years to six years of age in Saudi Arabia.
Research methodology
A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the relationship between social skills development and
screen time by using a validated Arabic version of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). The
sample in this study consists of 308 children from four to six years of age.
Research results
The results showed that the hours spent using the electronic device were significantly associated with having
an SCQ score ≥ 15 (P < 0.05). A high SCQ score was prevalent in 19.7% (n = 31) of children who spent >3
hours using an electronic device compared to 10.2% (n = 5) and 7.84% (n = 8) of children who spent an hour
or <2 hours using electronic devices, respectively.
Conclusion
Our study highlighted a significant association between the daily hours spent on devices and having an SCQ
score above 15, which suggests a deficit in social skill development and having autism spectrum disorder-
like symptoms.

Introduction
Advances in technology have ensured its inevitable integration in our life. Children, being at a vulnerable
age period of development, are spending more time on electronic devices. Some studies have reported
negative effects on sleep, physical health such as obesity and vision problems, and behavioral changes such
as aggressive behavior with exposure to violent media content [1-3]. However, the benefits of using
electronic devices are undeniable. To list a few, electronic devices have facilitated social communication
among children in this period of repetitive lockdowns and restricted outdoor activities. In addition, it has
revolutionized learning as children have easy access to educational content [3]. Hence, the American
Academy of Pediatrics has made age-specific recommendations for media use by children that balance its
risks and benefits.
The recommendation on screen time is for caregivers to co-watch good programs with children of 2‒5 years

of age for a duration not exceeding one hour a day. Children above 5 years can watch alone while adhering to
clear restrictions on screen time and program types that are left to the caregiver to set, avoiding negative
effects on the child’s sleep, behavior, or other aspects of health [4]. Similarly, the World Health Organization
recommends that children of 4‒6 years of age should not exceed one hour of screen time in a day [5]. The
Saudi Ministry of Health makes the same recommendations as the American Academy of Pediatrics
guidelines [5].
Healthcare professionals are interested in tracking developmental milestones in children, which can be
divided into the following domains: motor skills, social/emotional, language/communication, and cognitive
domains. In regard to social development, children of 4‒6 years of age are expected to show interest in other
children, play in groups, desire being liked by friends, and understand the concept of cooperation and
apology [6]. In contrast, ignoring other children, being excessively shy, and failing to recognize others’
feelings are considered red flags of developmental delay for ages 4, 5, and 6 years, respectively [7].
In regard to language and communication development, children of 4‒6 years of age are expected to be able
to tell stories and describe events [6]. If children aged 4, 5, and 6 years fail to answer simple questions,
rhyme, and tell clear stories, respectively, they have probably missed a milestone [7]. We postulate that
those milestones can be disturbed by increased screen time. Using the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventor, a
study found that increased screen time is associated with lower social skills in preschool children
[8]. Another study among preschool children found that increased screen time was associated with lower
prosocial skills in boys but higher prosocial skills in girls [9].
Moreover, another study conducted among preschoolers in China indicated that the risk of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD)-like symptoms increases remarkably in preschoolers whose screen time is >2 hours a day [10].
Another study found that early age of screen exposure increases the incidence of autistic behaviors among
preschoolers [11]. A study in Japan showed that the average use of mobile phones was 24 hours per week
[12].
A few studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia to identify the most used devices and determine the exposure
to these devices. The most used devices are the television, followed by mobile phones and tablets then
followed by Computers, In addition children use electronic devices for >4 hours per day [13]. Moreover, there
is another study that shows that smartphones are the most common devices used by children (mean usage of
28.5±27 hours per week), followed by tablets (7.5±15 hours per week) and laptops (3±7.4 hours per week). The
median duration of use of all the devices together was 35 hours per week [14].
An interesting finding by a study shows that higher-quality screen exposure has been linked to better
language skills, whereas higher-quantity screen exposure, introduced early in development, has been linked
to lower language skills [15]. There are not enough data on the association between screen time exposure
and ASD-like symptoms such as delay in language development, unusual social interactions, odd play
patterns, and unusual communication patterns [16].
Our study aimed to examine the association between screen time and social communication skills among
children of 4‒6 years of age in Saudi Arabia and identify the factors associated with high SCQ scores.
Materials And Methods
A cross-sectional survey design was conducted to examine the relationship between social skills
development and screen time using a validated Arabic version of the Social Communication Questionnaire
(SCQ) [17]. The sample in this study consists of 308 children aged 4‒6 years. Data were collected in two
steps: first, the researchers shared a form through different social media platforms to collect personal
information and contact data of interested participants. Three hundred and eight participants showed
interest in participating in this study and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) was sent to them.
The inclusion criteria were children aged 4‒6 years. The exclusion criteria were non-Arabic-speakers and
children with developmental disorders or cognitive delay. Also the aim of this study was to study the
association between screen time and social communication skills among children of four years to six years of
age in Saudi Arabia.
Study design
The Social Communication Questionnaire consists of 40 items. It is a parent-reported scale that can be used
to screen for symptoms associated with ASD. We used a validated Arabic version of SCQ with a Cronbach’s
alpha coefficient of 0.916, showing high reliability. It also showed high sensitivity and specificity of 0.796
and 0.966, respectively. The 40 items are dichotomous, with only ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as possible answers. Item 1 is
only used to assess whether the child can speak with short phrases or sentences, while Items 2 through 40
are used for the actual scoring. Items 2, 9, and 19 through 40 are negatively worded wherein individuals are
awarded 1 for response option no and 0 for yes. This reduces the need to reverse the scores. For the other
items (i.e., Items 3 to 8 and 10 to 18), a score of 1 is awarded if the answer is yes and 0 otherwise.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R v 3.6.3. Counts and percentages were used to summarize the
categorical variables. The means ± standard deviation or the median/interquartile ranges were used to
summarize the distribution of normal and non-normal continuous variables, respectively. The chi-square
test was used to investigate the association between categorical variables. Linear regression was used to
assess the factors associated with higher total SCQ scores. Hypothesis testing was performed at 5% level of
significance.

Regarding the education level of the caregivers, 63.3% of the respondents had completed university
education, 21.4% had a postgraduate degree, and 8.44% of the respondents had completed only high school.
Tablets and iPads were the main devices used by 40.3% of the children. Mobile phones and televisions were
the main devices used by 26% and 26.6% of the children, respectively. Approximately half of the children
had a personal device (43.5%); less than one quarter shared devices with the family (20.1%); and 36.4% did
not have a personal device. One-half of the respondents (51%) spent more than three hours using the
electronic device daily; one-third used it for two hours daily (33.1%); and 15.9% used it for an hour or less
daily (Table 1).
The results showed that 20.4% of the children had problems with social chat, and 20.1% could not
understand non-verbal communication. One-third of the respondents (34.1%) were not interested in peers;
a similar number did not have a best friend (32.1%); and 40.3% did not use gestures to draw attention. Only
7.7% of the children had problems with active communication, and only 7.1% did not have a normal range of
facial expressions (Figure 1).

Discussion
This study aimed to investigate and provide a new insight into the relationship between prolonged
electronic device exposure and autism-like symptoms based on the assumption that excessive use of
electronics may lead to ASD-like symptoms. A self-administered questionnaire containing the Social
Communication Questionnaire scale (SCQ) was used for preschool children, and other variables added
including a question about the hours spent on devices by children.
The results indicate that most of the children used electronic devices for >3 hours daily. Surprisingly, the
study highlighted a significant association between the daily hours spent on devices and having an SCQ
score above 15, which suggests that children using electronic devices for >3 hours daily may suffer from
ASD-like symptoms, indicating the need for further comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the
diagnosis. Additionally, the results show that the average SCQ score is higher in participants using the
electronic devices for >3 hours even if they did not reach the cut-off point of an SCQ score = 15. However,
the type of association - causation or coincidence - has not yet been established.
2021 Alrahili et al. Cureus 13(10): e18787. DOI 10.7759/cureus.18787 8 of 10
A cohort study of 2152 children was conducted to determine the association between screen
time exposure in the first 18 months of life and the development of ASD-like symptoms using the Modified
Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at two years. This study showed that screen time exposure early
in life can be associated with ASD-like symptoms [18]. Interestingly, previous studies concluded that ASD
children have a remarkable attraction to screen viewing at a younger age compared to their healthy peers.
This is explained by their nature of having less social leisure [19] and preference for computing activity over
social network browsing because it is very demanding for them to be socially engaged [20].
Moreover, previous research has proven that the severity of ASD symptoms is proportionate to screen time,
clearly recognized in atypical sensory responsiveness and greater susceptibility to developmental delay,
specifically in the language domain [21]. Simultaneously, the reverse casualty must be considered. Our data
failed to show a significant relationship between an SCQ score above 15 and the marital status and
education of the caregiver or the age and gender of the child. Contrary to our expectations, although the
majority of the participants’ caregivers was well educated and expected to be aware of the risk of
overexposure, most of the children had personal devices, with the tablet being the most common. Therefore,
it is crucial to emphasize the risk and benefits of these electronic gadgets.
In line with our hypothesis, a large-scale study conducted in Korea on toddler children to determine the
effect of screen time on language development through multiple interviews and questionnaires found that
language delay is proportional to screen time, with a 2.7 times greater risk for those who spend 2 hours of
watching television [22]. The reliability of this data is impacted by several factors.
Limitations
First, data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic when all schools and kindergartens had shifted to
virtual classes and activities. Second, this study was subject to reporter bias as it relies on caregiver recall.
Third, our study was limited to caregiver who uses social media.
Conclusions
This study has shown that there is a significant association between daily hours spent on devices especially
three hours and more and having an SCQ score above 15, which may suggest a possible ASD-like symptoms.
However, the type of association has not yet been established. Our findings can be used to raise awareness
on this matter and help set guidelines on the use of media for children. Future studies are required to assess
association.
