Lay abstract: COVID-related lockdown led to a radical modification of daily
activities and routines known to affect sleep. In a sample of 1800 adults, we
observed that, before lockdown, participants with autism displayed significantly

Effect of lockdown, in ASD and the general
population (intragroup before/after comparison)
All studied measures of sleep were significantly affected
by the lockdown in both groups (Table 2). Compared to
pre-lockdown, both the comparison group and partici-
pants with autism had poorer self-rated sleep quality as
well as less regular and delayed sleep–wake rhythm, with
later bed and wake-up time resulting in a delayed mid-
point of sleep (all p<0.001). However, modification in
sleep duration was not linear, with an increase of
extremes (less than 6 h and more than 10 h) in both
groups. Behavioral measures were also affected by the
lockdown, with longer screen time in the evening, and
less exposure to daylight. In both groups, there was an
increase of participants not doing any exercise but also
anincreaseofparticipantsexercisingeveryday.
Lockdown affected sleep in a similar way in both
groups, with an equivalent difference before and during
lockdown in sleep duration, bedtime, wake-up time, and
overall sleep quality (Table 3). Regarding behavioral
measures, the comparison group was more likely to
increase the frequency of physical activity and daylight
exposure (see Figure 1). They were also more likely to
increase evening screen time exposure. This could be
explained by the fact adults with autism already had a
very high screen exposure before lockdown, with 37%
spending 3 h or more in front of a screen in the evening;
there was thus less opportunity for them to increase even
furtherthisexposure,resultinginaceilingeffect..

Adults with autism presented the same differences with

and wake-up time remained later, resulting in a later
mid-point of sleep (see Figure 2), although extremely
early bedtimes, between 21:00 and 22:00, were still more
present in participants with autism. Adults with autism
alsomaintained worsesleep–wakerhythm related behav-
iors with less physical activity, less daylight exposure,
and more screen time, although the “less than an hour”
exposure to screen time was more frequent in the ASD
group(Table2,allp<0.001).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first
attempt to investigate the impact of lockdown strategies
on sleep and circadian rhythms in an adult population
with autism compared to a large sample of the general
population. Ourstudy showsthatadultswithautismhad
