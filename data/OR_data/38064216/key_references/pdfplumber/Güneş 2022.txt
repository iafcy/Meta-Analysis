prenatal and postpartum depression, and excess exposure to screen might be
related to an increased risk for ASD.

that the emerged link between prenatal antidepressant
use and autism might not be a byproduct of confound-
ing factors. The authors also mentioned that the absolute
risk of autism was lower.33 Nevertheless, a recent epide-
miological study from Canada proved against in utero
serotonergic antidepressant exposure and ASDs.34 In
the current study, any medication use during pregnancy
was recorded without specifying subcategories, therefore
we abstain from drawing any conclusions. However, our
results might implicate a benefit in widening the focus
of future research on the association between prenatal
medication exposure and ASD risk.
Technological developments impose a great change in
our daily lives. In connection with this, concerns about
the impact of screen- based technologies are increasing.
There is a growing body of research suggesting a link
between excessive exposure to screen and psychologi-
cal outcomes particularly in children and adolescents.35
