ABSTRACT
Objective: Early years of childhood form the basis of intelligence, personality, social behaviour, and capacity to learn
and nurture oneself as an adult. Our objective was to find out the effects of screen time on behavior of pre-schoolers,
which could provide scientific grounds to the control of digital screen time.
Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted in four private preschools of Islamabad from June -November 2021. A
sample size of 200 children ages three-five years were selected through multistage random sampling using a parental
questionnaire. Children were grouped based on daily screen time of ≤60 minutes or >60 minutes. Analysis was made
based on the Child behavior checklist for ages eighteen months-five years results. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was
found to be 0.925. It was analyzed using SPSS version 22. Chi-square test, independent sample t-test and multi linear
regression were applied to determine the association and significance levels between the variables.
Results: Study results indicate increased screen time was statistically significant with child’s age, education level and
employment status of mothers. It was observed that pre-schoolers with screen time of > 60 minutes tend to suffer
more from withdrawal syndrome (11.94±3.91, p = 0.014) sleep problems (10.97±3.20, p = 0.010) and Autism spectrum
problems (17.66±5.89, p = 0.047) as compared to pre-schoolers with screen time ≤60 minutes. Strongest predictor of
outcome variable was found to be mothers education level (ß = 21.53).
Conclusion: Study findings revealed that excessive screen time has deleterious effect and is associated with behavioural
problems of pre-schoolers.
