Abstract: Background: This study investigates how children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) make use of computer gam-
ing and computer-mediated communication (CMC) in comparison to their nonautistic peers. Method: Parents fi lled out a standardized ques-
tionnaire on media use, gaming disorder (GD), and CMC. Sixty-two boys with a diagnosis of ASD aged 4 to 17 years (mean = 11.5; SD = 3.2) were
compared to 31 healthy control boys (mean = 11.5; SD = 3.7). Results: Children and adolescents with ASD used CMC less frequently than their
nonautistic peers but played video games for longer times than the controls. They preferred playing alone rather than in company of others and
less frequently in multiplayer mode. Levels of GD symptoms were higher in boys with ASD. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with ASD
seem to be an especially vulnerable subpopulation for GD. For them, the gaming situation (alone and in single-player mode) and CMC behavior
seem to correspond to social patterns in real life. Our fi ndings also provide support for the inclusion of offl ine gaming in the GD defi nition.
Keywords: autism spectrum disorder, gaming disorder, computer-mediated communication, children, adolescents
Zusammenfassung: Fragestellung: Die Studie untersucht, wie Kinder und Jugendliche mit Autismus-Spektrum-Störung (ASS) im Vergleich zu
ihren nichtautistischen Altersgenossen Computerspiele und Internetbasierte Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten (IBK) nutzen. Methodik: Die El-
tern füllten einen standardisierten Fragebogen über Mediennutzung, Computerspielabhängigkeit und IBK aus. 62 Jungen mit der Diagnose ASS
im Alter von 4 bis 17 Jahren (Mittelwert = 11.5; SD = 3.2) wurden mit 31 unbeeinträchtigten Jungen als Kontrollgruppe (Mittelwert = 11.5; SD =
3.7) verglichen. Ergebnisse: Kinder und Jugendliche mit ASS benutzten IBK weniger häufi g und spielten Computerspiele länger als die Kinder in
der Kontrollgruppe. Bei gegebener Diagnose ASS spielten sie eher allein, nicht in Gesellschaft anderer und seltener im Mehrspielermodus. Das
Niveau der Computerspielabhängigkeit war bei Jungen mit ASS höher. Schlussfolgerung: Kinder und Jugendliche mit ASS scheinen eine beson-
ders gefährdete Gruppe für die Entwicklung einer Computerspielabhängigkeit zu sein. Die Spielsituation (allein und im Einzelspieler-Modus)
und das IBK-Verhalten entspricht den sozialen Mustern im realen Leben. Unsere Ergebnisse unterstützen auch den Einbezug von Offl ine-
Spielen in die Defi nition von Computerspielabhängigkeit.
