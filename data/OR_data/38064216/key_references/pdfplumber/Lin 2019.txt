ABSTRACT: Objective: Despite evidence that excessive screen use may contribute to negative health, de-
velopmental, emotional, and behavioral outcomes, more children are engaging in increasing amounts of
screen-related activities. For children with neurodevelopmental conditions, increased screen use could ex-
acerbate emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBDs) by interfering with sleep quantity and quality. Aims: This
study examined the possible mediating role of sleep in the relationship between screen use and EBDs in
preschool children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) clinically referred to a child development
centerinSingapore.Methods:Ascreenusequestionnairedevelopedforthepurposesofthepresentstudy,
theChildren’sSleepHabitsQuestionnaire,andtheStrengthsandDifficultiesQuestionnairewerecompleted
by 367 caregivers of 2- to 5-year-old children with NDDs (39.5% autism spectrum disorder; 36.8% speech-
language disorders; 23.7% others). Results: Average daily screen use duration was 3.98 hours, with 93.9%
exceeding 1 hour of screen time daily. 57.7% of children had screen devices in their bedrooms, while 52%
commenced screen use at the age of 18 months or earlier. Sleep problems fully mediated the relationship
between the number of bedroom screen devices and children’s EBDs, as well as between the age of first
screen use and EBDs, but not between hours of screen use and EBDs. Controlling for age, developmental
level, and family income, children who started using screens earlier than 18 months and who had screen
