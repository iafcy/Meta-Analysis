Abstract
We used parent report data to investigate video game playing, aggression, and social impairment in adolescents with autism
spectrum disorder. Parents of autistic adolescents were more likely to report that their child plays video games as a hobby
compared to parents of adolescents with typical development and also reported that their children spent more time playing
video games. For autistic participants, we found no differences in aggression levels or social impairment when comparing
players versus non-players. However, playing video games “more than average,” as compared to “average” was associated
with greater aggression and greater social impairment on “awareness” and “mannerisms” subscales. Future studies should
focus on how type of video game(s) played is associated with these clinically important variables.
