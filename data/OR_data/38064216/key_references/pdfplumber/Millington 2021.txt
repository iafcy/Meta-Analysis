Abstract
Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents playing twice as much as their Typically Devel-
oping peers. The aims of this study are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming
Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient can predict time
spent playing video games. 57 participants were recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The
preliminary results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further investiga-
tion revealed interactions between autistic traits and several motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and
customisation. This has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.
