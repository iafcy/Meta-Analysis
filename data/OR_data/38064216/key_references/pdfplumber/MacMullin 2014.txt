Abstract
Although electronic technology currently plays an integral role for most youth, there are growing concerns of its excessive
and compulsive use. This study documents patterns and impact of electronics use in individuals with autism spectrum
disorder compared to typically developing peers. Participants included 172 parents of typically developing individuals
and 139 parents of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, ranging in age from 6 to 21 years. Parents
completed an online survey of demographics and the frequency, duration, and problematic patterns of electronics use in
their youth and young adults. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder were reported to use certain electronics more
often in the last month and on an average day, and had greater compulsive Internet and video game use than individuals
without autism spectrum disorder. Across both samples, males used video games more often than females. Compared
to parents of individuals without autism spectrum disorder, parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder were
significantly more likely to report that electronics use was currently having a negative impact. The implications of
problematic electronics use for individuals with autism spectrum disorder are discussed.
