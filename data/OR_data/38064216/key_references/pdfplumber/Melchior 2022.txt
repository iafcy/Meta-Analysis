Abstract
Background: Screen media use in early childhood has largely increased in recent years, even more so during the
COVID‑19 epidemic, and there is much discussion regarding its influence on neurodevelopment, including Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Methods: We examined the relationship between use of TV, computer, tablet and smartphone at age 2 years and risk
of ASD assessed in telephone‑based questionnaires among 12,950 children participating in the nationally representa‑
tive ELFE (‘Etude Longitudinale Française sur les Enfants’) birth cohort study in France.
Results: In inverse‑probability weighted (IPW) multinomial regression analyses, children’s weekly or daily screen
media use was associated with an increased likelihood of an intermediate risk of ASD (IPW‑controlled OR for weekly
use:1.07, 95% CI 1.02—1.12; IPW‑controlled OR for daily use:1.05, 95% CI 1.02—1.08) but inversely associated with
a high risk (IPW‑controlled OR for weekly use: 0.60, 95% CI 0.50—0.73; IPW‑controlled OR for daily use: 0.75, 95% CI
0.62—0.91), as ascertained by the M‑CHAT. This was confirmed when studying TV as well as computer/tablet expo‑
sure separately.
Conclusions: Overall, our nationally‑representative study conducted among a large sample of 2‑year‑old children,
indicates a complex relationship between screen exposure and ASD risk.
