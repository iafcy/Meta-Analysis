predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only.
CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video
games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at
greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.
Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with
problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game
preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video
game use among children with ASD. These findings suggest a need
for longitudinal research to better understand predictors and
outcomes of video game use in children with ASD and ADHD.
