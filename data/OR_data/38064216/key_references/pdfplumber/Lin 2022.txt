Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder that brings heavy burdens to families and
the society. This case-control study explored risk factors for ASD based on 74,252 children aged 3–12 years who were
recruited from general education kindergartens, primary schools, and special education schools in Shanghai, China. One
hundred ninety-two children were identified with ASD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders—Fifth Edition. Male sex, the presence of anoxia or asphyxia at birth, artificial feeding, adverse maternal psychologi-
cal status, complications during pregnancy and higher paternal education were associated with ASD even after controlling
for age, residential district, family history of mental disorders, parental personality, and amount of daily TV viewing.
