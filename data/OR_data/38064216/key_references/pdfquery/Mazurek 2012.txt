Abstract This study examined the nature of television, 
video game, and social media use in children (ages 8–18) 
with autism spectrum disorders (ASD, n = 202) compared 
to typically developing siblings (TD, n = 179), and rela- 
tive to other activities. Parents completed measures 
assessing children’s screen-based and other extracurricular 
activities. Children with ASD spent approximately 62 % 
more time watching television and playing video games 
than in all non-screen activities combined. Compared with 
TD siblings, children with ASD spent more hours per day 
playing video games (2.4 vs. 1.6 for boys, and 1.8 vs. 0.8 
for girls), and had higher levels of problematic video game 
use. In contrast, children with ASD spent little time using 
social media or socially interactive video games.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by 
signiﬁcant impairment across communication, social, and 
behavioral domains (American Psychiatric Association 
2000), and are associated with a range of other co-occur- 
ring difﬁculties such as cognitive impairment (Chakrabarti

and Fombonne 2005; De Bildt et al. 2005), poor adaptive 
functioning (Carter et al. 1998; Kanne et al. 2011), and 
psychiatric problems (Lecavalier 2006; Simonoff et al. 
2008). Between 42 and 78 % of adults with ASD obtain 
poor to very poor overall outcomes (Billstedt et al. 2005; 
Eaves and Ho 2008; Howlin et al. 2004), highlighting the 
importance of identifying factors that inﬂuence long-term 
success. Emerging research in this area has shown that 
adolescents and adults with ASD have limited participation 
in social and community activities (Orsmond et al. 2004; 
Orsmond and Kuo 2011; Shattuck et al. 2011), which may 
exacerbate long term functional difﬁculties. Characterizing 
patterns of activity engagement among children and ado- 
lescents with ASD may provide important information for 
understanding both short- and long-term outcomes. 
The use of electronic screen-based media appears to be a 
particularly relevant 
type of discretionary activity for 
children with ASD. The term ‘‘screen-based media’’ will be 
used henceforth to refer to television, video games, com- 
puter games, and electronic social media (including email, 
text messages, and online social networking sites). Screen- 
based media has become an increasingly popular tool for 
entertainment and social connection among typically 
developing children and adolescents (Olson 2010; Roberts 
and Foehr 2008). However, excessive use of television and 
video games has been linked to negative outcomes among 
typically developing children (Hancox et al. 2005; Johnson 
et al. 2007; Marshall et al. 2004; Sharif et al. 2010; Zim- 
merman and Christakis 2005). Preoccupation with these 
media also appears to be a clinically signiﬁcant problem for 
many children with ASD, according to clinical and anec- 
dotal reports (Nally et al. 2000; Winter-Messiers 2007). In 
contrast, some screen-based media may have the potential 
to enhance interventions and social engagement, especially 
given the increasing availability of electronic social- 


networking tools. Surprisingly, there has been almost no 
empirical research on the topic. 
Television and Video Game Use Among Typically 
Developing Children 
Television viewing and video game play are highly popular 
activities among typically developing children and adoles- 
cents. In a nationally representative sample of 2,002 children 
and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18, participants 
were found to spend an average of 3 h per day watching live 
or time-shifted television, and an average of 1.2 h per day 
playing video games (Rideout et al. 2010). Similarly, data 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) collected between the years 2001 and 2006 also 
revealed patterns of screen-based media use among a large 
sample of 8,707 children. Over 47 % of the children in the 
sample spent 2 or more hours per day using screen-based 
media, including television, videos, and computers (Sisson 
et al. 2009). More recently, among a large sample of 1,323 
children (ages 6–12), average daily time spent watching 
television viewing was 2.9 h per day, and time spent playing 
video games averaged 1.3 h per day (Swing et al. 2010). 
There is also a growing body of research demonstrating 
that excessive use of television and video games can have 
detrimental effects for typically developing children and 
adolescents. For example, in a recent longitudinal study of 
over 6,500 adolescents, Sharif et al. (2010) found that the 
amount of time spent watching television and playing video 
games had a negative effect on school performance. These 
ﬁndings were largely consistent with previous studies of the 
association between academic performance and time spent 
watching television (Hancox et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2007) 
and playing video games (Hastings et al. 2009; Sharif and 
Sargent 2006). Other studies have found that time spent 
using screen-based media is negatively related to time spent 
interacting with others (Vandewater et al. 2006) and 
engagement in physical activity (Sisson et al. 2010), which 
may partially explain the signiﬁcant association between 
time spent in screen-based media use and obesity (Proctor 
et al. 2003; Vandewater et al. 2004; Viner and Cole 2005). 
increasing popularity of video games, 
researchers have also begun to develop a more nuanced 
understanding of problematic, or pathological, patterns of 
video game play (Gentile 2009). Research in this area indi- 
cates that these patterns share many common features with 
other types of behavioral addictions (Gentile 2009; Grifﬁths 
2000; King et al. 2011b; Tejeiro Salguero and Mora´n 2002). 
These core components are generally thought to include 
salience (e.g., preoccupations, craving), tolerance (requiring 
increasing amounts of time spent playing), withdrawal 
(negative emotional reactions when game play is discon- 
tinued), relapse (failed attempts to stop or reduce play), 

mood modiﬁcation (game play as a means of relieving 
unpleasant emotions), and conﬂict (game play results in 
conﬂict with self, others, or obligations) (Gentile 2009; 
Grifﬁths 2005, 2000; King et al. 2011a). There is increasing 
evidence that problematic video game play can be reliably 
assessed (Gentile 2009; King et al. 2011b; Tejeiro Salguero 
and Mora´n 2002); and small 
to moderate associations 
between problematic video game play and negative mental 
health, social and academic performance have been found 
(see Ferguson et al. 2011 for review). A recent longitudinal 
study also found that pathological gaming among children 
was associated with negative outcomes at 2-year follow-up, 
including poor school performance and increased levels of 
depression, anxiety, and social phobia (Gentile et al. 2011). 
Although research has not yet examined problematic video 
game play patterns among children with ASD, the propensity 
to become preoccupied with speciﬁc interests and activities 
may make this pattern more likely. 
Social Media and Socially Interactive Game Play 
in Typically Developing Children 
Among recently emerging technologies, the use of social 
media has also become widespread among typically devel- 
oping adolescents (Subrahmanyam and Greenﬁeld 2008). 
These media include, email, chat rooms, instant messages, 
text messages, web-based social networking sites (e.g., 
Facebook), video sharing sites (e.g. YouTube), and many 
other new and emerging tools. In addition, although televi- 
sion viewing and video game play are assumed to be largely 
solitary, at least some of these activities can also be socially 
interactive. For example, Lenhart et al. (2008) found that 
97 % of the 1,102 American adolescents they surveyed 
played video games. Of those who played games, 65 % 
played with other people in the same room, and 27 % played 
with other people through online connections. Both quali- 
tative and quantitative research has also shown that social 
competition and social connection can be motivators for 
video game play among typically developing children 
(Lucas and Sherry 2004; Olson 2010; Olson et al. 2008). 
There has been increasing interest in examining the role 
of electronic social media in adolescent development 
(Subrahmanyam and Greenﬁeld 2008; Subrahmanyam et al. 
2008), as well as ongoing debate regarding the impact of 
such media on social engagement. Some studies have found 
that internet use can be a solitary and socially isolating 
activity (Nie 2001; Nie et al. 2002), while others have argued 
that social media use can enhance social relationships among 
both adults and adolescents (Robinson et al. 2000; Shklovski 
et al. 2004; Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Gross et al. (2002) 
found that adolescents interacted in online communication 
largely with existing circles of friends. They also found that 
online communication was often related to social topics, and 



was often motivated by a desire for companionship. Valk- 
enburg and Peter (2007) also found that adolescents reported 
feeling closer to existing friends when they communicated 
online. Similar trends have been reported among young 
adults, the majority of whom report social engagement with 
existing friends as a primary reason for engaging in social 
networking sites (Subrahmanyam et al. 2008). 
Asynchronous online communication, such as email, 
instant messaging, and text messaging, offer users the beneﬁt 
of maintaining more control over social interactions than do 
face-to-face or real-time online interactions (Walther 1993; 
Walther and Burgoon 1992). These technologies offer 
opportunities for social interaction in a format that does not 
require attention to nonverbal cues, gestures, facial expres- 
sions, or vocalization (Walther 2007), all areas that are 
speciﬁcally impaired among individuals with ASD (Ameri- 
can Psychiatric Association 2000). Thus, social media may 
offer promise for enhancing social interaction among indi- 
viduals with ASD, given that computer technology provides 
a more controlled and predictable environment than face-to- 
face interaction. However, the extent to which children with 
ASD access this technology and how their usage patterns 
may compare to same-aged peers remains unexplored. 

Despite the abundance of information regarding screen- 
based media use among typically developing children, we 
know very little about patterns of media use among chil- 
dren with ASD. In one of the few studies related to this 
topic, Orsmond and Kuo (2011) used a time diary method 
to examine daily activities among a sample of 103 ado- 
lescents with ASD. Mothers were asked to complete time 
use diaries for the most recent weekday and weekend day, 
recording both the primary activity and duration. Watching 
television was the most frequent discretionary activity (an 
average of 2.27 h per day among those who watched 
television), followed by using computers (an average of 
1.65 h per day among those who used computers). These 
ﬁndings were similar to those of Shane and Albert (2008), 
who found that children with ASD spent signiﬁcantly more 
time using screen-based media than they spent in any other 
leisure activity (Shane and Albert 2008). 
In a more recent study of screen-based media use among 
adolescents with ASD (ages 13–17) enrolled in the National 
Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2), a large percent- 
age of the sample was reported to spend most of their free 
time watching television (60.3 %) and/or playing video 
games (41 %). Rates of non-social media use were signiﬁ- 
cantly higher among adolescents with ASD than among 
adolescents with other disabilities (i.e., intellectual disabil- 
ities, 
learning disabilities, and speech/language impair- 
ments) (Mazurek et al. 2012). However, the amount and 

intensity of media use were not examined, and comparisons 
to a typically developing sample were not possible. 
Further research is needed to characterize the patterns of 
screen-based media use among children with ASD. Given 
concomitant difﬁculties with social skills and tendencies to 
develop intense preoccupations (American Psychiatric 
Association 2000), children with ASD may be at greater 
risk for problematic use of some screen-based media. 
Video games are predicted to pose a particular risk given 
their inherently reinforcing design, and previously estab- 
lished patterns of problematic, or pathological, use among 
subsets of the general population (e.g., Gentile 2009). On 
the other hand, the use of socially interactive media may 
offer potential beneﬁts for children with ASD to the extent 
that they access these technologies. 
The role of gender in screen-based media use is also rel- 
evant to this population, given previously reported sex dif- 
ferences in ASD prevalence and phenotype (Mandy et al. 
2012). Among typically developing children and adoles- 
cents, gender differences have been found with regard to 
some types of screen-based media. Although boys and girls 
do not appear to differ in television viewing (Cillero and Jago 
2010; Gorely et al. 2004; Rideout et al. 2010), studies have 
consistently shown that boys spend signiﬁcantly greater 
amounts of time playing video games than girls (Gentile 
2009; Marshall et al. 2006). For example, among a large 
sample of 8–18 year-old children and adolescents, boys 
spent an average of 1 h 37 min per day playing video games, 
compared to 49 min per day among girls (Rideout et al. 
2010). Males are also at much greater risk than females for 
pathological video game play patterns (Gentile 2009; Gen- 
tile et al. 2011; Lemmens et al. 2011). However, evidence for 
gender differences in social media use has been mixed. Some 
studies have found that girls spend more time using social 
media (Rideout et al. 2010), while others have found little to 
no gender difference in amount of social media use (Ohan- 
nessian 2009; Pujazon-Zazik and Park 2010). Thus, gender 
may require special consideration in characterizing screen- 
based media use among children with ASD. 
The purpose of the current study was to characterize the 
amount and intensity of television, video game, and social 
media use among children with ASD as compared to typi- 
cally developing children, and relative to engagement in 
other activities. 


The sample for the current study included 202 children and 
adolescents with ASD and 179 typically developing sib- 
lings. Participants were recruited with the assistance of the 

Interactive Autism Network (IAN) Project at the Kennedy 
Krieger Institute, Baltimore, Maryland. 
All participating families were enrolled in IAN, a 
national open enrollment ASD registry, which includes 
families of children in the United States who have been 
professionally diagnosed with an ASD. Upon enrollment 
into IAN, families provide information about their child’s 
primary ASD diagnosis, including completing the Social 
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (Berument et al. 
1999) and a range of other survey questions and measures 
focused on both child and family functioning. 
In a recent study by Daniels and colleagues, validity of 
parent-reported diagnosis among the IAN sample was 
conﬁrmed through external clinical documentation among 
98 % of the sample investigated (Daniels et al. 2012). Lee 
et al. (2010) also established the accuracy of parent- 
reported diagnosis among a subset of the IAN sample who 
were evaluated using gold-standard diagnostic tools, 
including the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (Lord 
and Rutter 1994) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule (Lord et al. 2002). In their study, 99 % of the 
sample met criteria for ASD on the ADI-R, and 93 % met 
criteria based on developmental history and ADOS (Lee 
et al. 2010). Thus, the reliability of parent-reported diag- 
nosis among the IAN sample appears to be high. 
Eligible parents were recruited for the current study by 
email, and data were collected online via web-based parent- 
completed survey. To be eligible to participate in the current 
study, all participants in the ASD group were required to 
have a parent-reported diagnosis of ASD, including Autism 
or Autistic Disorder 
(53.5 %), Asperger’s Disorder 
(27.2 %), or Pervasive Developmental Disorder, NOS 
(17.3 %). Parents were also asked to describe the type of 
clinician who provided the child’s diagnosis, and to report 
their child’s IQ range (if previously assessed). Table 1 pro- 
vides sample characteristics for the ASD group. 
All participants in the sibling group were required to 
have no previous diagnosis of an ASD or other develop- 
mental disorder. Children in both groups were required to 
be between the ages of 8 and 18, with a mean age of 
12.1 years (SD = 2.8) for the ASD group, and 12.5 years 
(SD = 2.6) for the sibling group. Consistent with the 
gender differential 
in the current 
sample a greater percentage of the ASD group was male 
(83.7 %) than in the sibling group (49.2 %). The majority 
of the total sample was Caucasian (88.6 %).

income, number of siblings, diagnostic information about 
the child with ASD, parent-reported IQ estimates (if 
known), and speciﬁc information about activity and screen- 
based media use, as described below. 

Parents were asked to estimate, in average number of hours 
per day, the amount of time their children spent engaged in 
the following activities outside of school: ‘‘reading for 
pleasure,’’ ‘‘doing homework/studying,’’ ‘‘spending time 
with friends,’’ ‘‘playing sports/other physical activity,’’ 
‘‘watching TV,’’ ‘‘playing video or computer games,’’ and 
‘‘using email, Facebook, or texting.’’ Parents were asked to 
provide separate estimates in each category for ‘‘typical 
weekday’’ and ‘‘typical weekend day.’’ Consistent with 
previous methods (Orsmond and Kuo 2011; Zimmerman 
and Christakis 2005), an average daily use variable was 
created for each activity by multiplying the weekday 
response by 5, multiplying the weekend response by 2, and 
dividing the sum of these by 7. 

Parents were also asked to report whether their children 
ever played computer games, console video games, 



handheld video games, or games on cell phones. They were 
also asked the following questions regarding interactive 
video game play: ‘‘Does your child play video or computer 
games with friends in the same location’’ and ‘‘Does your 
child play video or computer games with others (‘‘online 
multi-player’’) in different locations?’’ If parents responded 
‘‘yes’’ to either of these, they were also asked to report the 
frequency on a four-point scale ranging from ‘‘less than 
once per month’’ to ‘‘5–7 times per week.’’ Finally, parents 
were asked to list the three most common video games 
their children had played in the past month. 


A modiﬁed version of the Problem Video Game Playing 
Test (PVGT) (King et al. 2011b) was used to examine 
problematic aspects of video game play. The PVGT was 
recently developed to measure problematic game playing 
in accordance with Grifﬁths’ (2005) components model 
of behavioral addiction. The measure includes 20 items 
to 
rated on a 5-point 
‘‘always.’’ The development sample included 785 ado- 
lescents and adults recruited from both the general 
population, and from a college population. High internal 
consistency (ranging from .92 to .93) was reported, and 
evidence for validity included high correlations between 
total PVGT scores and frequency and duration of game- 
play (correlations ranging from .41 to .55) (King et al. 
the 
2011b). For 
wording of several items was adjusted to increase rele- 
vance for younger participants, and modiﬁed from ﬁrst- 
person to parent-report format. Item 20 from the original 
scale (which focused on mood modiﬁcation) was dropped 
due to parent reported difﬁculty in responding to this 
item during pilot testing of the modiﬁed instrument. 


Given these modiﬁcations, we examined preliminary 
psychometric properties of this measure in the current 
sample. Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients were used to eval- 
uate internal consistency of the modiﬁed scale. Item reli- 
ability estimates were very strong, with Cronbach’s alpha 
of .942 for the scale for the entire sample (n = 381), 
a = .937 for the ASD group (n = 202), and a = .938 for 
the sibling group (n = 179). Item-total correlations were 
.55 and higher for the total sample. Evidence for construct 
validity was also demonstrated in the current sample by 
signiﬁcant positive correlations between total PVGT score 
and average number of hours per day spent playing video 
games (r = .454, p \ .001). Our reliability and validity 
statistics were highly consistent with those reported by 
King et al. (2011b). Given that factor analysis of the ori- 
ginal scale found support for a single factor, a PVGT total 
score was used in subsequent analyses. 


Descriptive statistics, including percentage, mean, standard 
deviation, and range, were conducted to characterize the 
sample. Pearson’s correlations were computed to examine 
bivariate relationships among continuous variables, and Chi- 
square analyses were used to examine relationships between 
categorical variables. A series of one-way analysis of vari- 
ance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine differences 
between children with ASD and typically developing chil- 
dren in time spent engaged in activities, time spent using 
screen-based media, and PVGT scores. Given previous 
ﬁndings regarding gender differences in media use, and 
uneven group sizes across gender and diagnostic groups, 
separate one-way ANOVA models were examined for each 
gender. Levene’s statistic was signiﬁcant in some cases, 
indicating that the assumption of homogeneity of variances 
for ANOVA was violated. Welch adjusted statistics are 
reported for models in which these assumptions were vio- 
lated. Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19. 


Children with ASD were reported to spend a large amount 
of time using screen-based media. Parents estimated that 
their children with ASD spent an average of 1.9 h per 
and 3.1 h per weekend day 
weekday (SD = 1.4) 
(SD = 2.1) watching television, and an average of 2.0 h 
per weekday (SD = 1.6) and 3.1 h per weekend day 
(SD = 2.3) playing video games. In contrast, children with 
ASD were reported to spend considerably less time 
engaged in non-screen activities. Children with ASD were 
reported to spend, on average, 4.5 h per day engaged in 
screen-based media 
(including television and video 
games), as compared to an average of 2.8 h per day in all 
speciﬁed non-screen activities combined (including read- 
ing, homework, studying, spending time with friends, and 
engaging in physical activity). See Table 2 for complete 
data regarding average daily time spent across each activity 
by gender. 
One-way ANOVA results revealed no signiﬁcant group 
differences in amount of time spent engaged in any activity 
based on IQ ([70 vs. B 70), with the exception of hours 
per day spent on homework, F(1, 109) = 6.0, p = .016, 
which was signiﬁcantly greater among those with IQ scores 
above 70 (M = .46, SD = .59) than among those with IQ 
scores at or below 70 (M = .88, SD = .69). No signiﬁcant 
differences were found in amount of time spent engaged 
in any activity based on race, parent marital status, or 
household income.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to 
examine potential differences between children with ASD 
and typically developing (TD) siblings in activity partici- 
pation. Separate analyses were conducted by gender. As 
shown in Table 2, both boys and girls with ASD spent 
signiﬁcantly more time playing video games than typically 
developing children, F(1,253) = 19.4, p \ .001 for boys; 
F(1,118) = 15.1, p \ .001 for girls. Girls with ASD also 
spent signiﬁcantly more time watching television than 
typically developing female siblings, F(1,118) = 4.3, 
p = .04; however, statistically signiﬁcant differences in 
between ASD and TD groups were not observed with 
regard to time spent watching television among boys. Both 
boys and girls with ASD also spent signiﬁcantly less time 
than typically developing children in all non-screen activ- 
[F(1,253) = 9.4, 
ities, 
p = .002 for boys; F(1,118) = 39.9, p \ .001 for girls], 
doing homework, [F(1,253) = 15.4, p \ .001 for boys; 


F(1,118) = 11.1, p = .001 for girls], spending time with 
friends, 
boys; 
F(1,118) = 120.3, p \ .001 for girls], and engaging in 
physical activity, [F(1,253) = 28.0, p \ .001 for boys; 
F(1,118) = 9.1, p = .003 for girls] (Fig. 1). 



Regarding problematic video game play, boys with ASD 
demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher PVGT scores (M = 38.9, 
SD = 11.6) than typically developing boys (M = 33.7, 
SD = 9.8), F(1,243) = 28.0, p \ .001, Cohen’s d = 0.65. 
Welch adjusted ANOVA F statistics are reported for males 
due to lack of homogeneity of variance. Among girls, those 
with ASD also demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher PVGT 
scores (M = 33.2, SD = 7.6) than typically developing 
girls (M = 27.0, SD = 7.9), F(1,101) = 28.0, p = .001, 
Cohen’s d = 0.81. Table 3 provides item mean scores for

ASD and typically developing sibling groups for both girls 
and boys. Results of group comparisons indicate that the 
boys with ASD obtained signiﬁcantly higher item mean 
scores on 11 out of 19 items compared to typically 
developing boys; and girls with ASD obtained signiﬁcantly 
higher item mean scores on 9 out of 19 items compared to 
typically developing girls. 

Both boys and girls with ASD were reported to spend very 
few hours per day using email, Facebook, or texting 
(M = 0.2, SD = 0.6 for boys, M = 0.3, SD = 0.7 for 
girls). Additionally, children with ASD spent signiﬁcantly 
less time using social media than typically developing 
children, 
boys; 
F(1,118) = 21.2, p \ .001 for girls]. 



With regard to socially interactive game play, approxi- 
mately half of the boys with ASD (47.9 %) and over half of 
the girls with ASD (61.3 %) never played video games 
with other people, and only 15 % of boys and 6.5 % of 
girls with ASD were reported to play video games with 
others at least once per week (see Table 4). The great 
majority of children with ASD (76 % of boys and 90.3 % 
of girls) never played online multiplayer games. Boys with 
ASD were signiﬁcantly more likely than typically devel- 
oping boys to never play video games with other people 
(47.9 vs. 21.6 %), v2(1, N = 255) = 16.8, p \ .001, and 
were signiﬁcantly more likely to never play online multi- 
player video games with others (76.0 vs. 39.8 %), v2(1, 
N = 255) = 32.7, p \ .001. In contrast, girls with ASD 
were equally likely to never play video games with others, 
either in person or online as compared to girls without 
ASD. 

This study is the ﬁrst to examine the nature and amount of 
television, video game, and social media use among chil- 
dren with ASD as compared to typically developing chil- 
dren. Children with ASD in the current sample were 
reported to spend, on average, 4.5 h per day using screen- 
based media. This is well in excess of recommendations by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommends 
no more than 1–2 h of screen-based media per day 
(American Academy of Pediatrics 2001). Children with 
ASD spent approximately 62 % more time watching tele- 
vision and playing video games than engaged in non-screen 
activities (including reading, studying, spending time with 
friends, and engaging in physical activities). Parents 
reported that on average, their children with ASD spent 
approximately 4.5 h per day watching television and 
playing video games, as compared to 2.8 h per day in non- 
screen activities. This pattern was reversed among typically 
developing siblings, who spent nearly 87 % more time on 
non-screen activities than on screen-based activities (5.7 
vs. 3.1 h per day). Children with ASD also spent signiﬁ- 
cantly greater amounts of time playing video games than 
typically developing children, but signiﬁcantly less time 
engaged in academic, physically active, or social activities. 

Consistent with anecdotal observations, our results show that 
children with ASD have a strong preference for electronic 
entertainment tools, particularly television and video games. 
This preference for video games was particularly striking. 
When comparing time spent playing video games in ASD 
versus typically developing groups, the effect sizes ranged

from medium (among boys) to large (among girls). Inter- 
estingly, the amount of time girls with ASD spent playing 
video games was similar to that of typically developing boys. 
This suggests that diagnostic group differences are present 
irrespective of gender, and that diagnostic group differences 
may be especially pronounced for girls. 
The underlying reasons for this preference for video 
games are not well understood. There is evidence that 
many individuals with ASD have strengths in visual per- 
ceptual skills (Jolliffe and Baron-Cohen 1997; Mottron 
et al. 2006; Shah and Frith 1993), and respond particularly 
well to visual stimuli (Mineo et al. 2009). These areas of 
relative strength may make visual media more inherently 
rewarding for individuals with ASD. Another possible 
explanation for this preference may relate to overall play 
skill patterns. Children with ASD often show deﬁcits in 
both functional and symbolic play (Jarrold et al. 1993); 
however, they are able to demonstrate pretend play actions 
when speciﬁcally cued or prompted (Charman and Baron- 
Cohen 1997; Jarrold et al. 1996). With this in mind, chil- 
dren with ASD may prefer video game play to more 
self-directed or generative play activities. Video games 
offer inherent structure and prompting, and present cir- 
cumscribed, yet 
imaginative, experiences for the user. 
Game rules are generally well-deﬁned, yet users are able to 
engage freely within the conﬁnes of the game world. Video 
games also offer clear visual and/or auditory cues and 
immediate reinforcement. Rather than creating original 
play scenarios, which may be challenging for many chil- 
dren with ASD (Jarrold et al. 1996), users are able to 
choose from pre-determined options within the game. 
Video games also offer opportunities for mastery and 
achievement (Olson 2010), which may also increase their 
appeal for children with ASD. 
In contrast, the amount of time spent watching television 
was not markedly different among children with ASD as 
compared to typically developing children. Both groups 
were reported to spend a relatively large amount of time on 
this activity, and signiﬁcant differences were only observed 
when comparing girls with and without ASD. Even in this 
case, the observed effect size was relatively small. The 
overall similarity among groups in television viewing is 
interesting, and lends support to previous assertions that 
television is ubiquitous among American families, with 
approximately 99 % of families having at least one tele- 
vision set (Rideout et al. 2010; Roberts and Foehr 2008). 
Because television represents a more passive activity than 
video game play, it is also likely that television viewing 
may occur concurrently with other activities for some 
children. Assessment of multi-tasking (i.e., watching tele- 
vision while engaging in other activities) in future studies 
may reveal differential patterns of television use across 
varying levels of symptom severity or functional level. 


The results of the current study also provide new infor- 
mation about problematic aspects of video game play. 
Children with ASD in the current sample were reported to 
have signiﬁcantly greater levels of problematic use of 
video games than typically developing children, and this 
was true for both genders. Among the most commonly 
reported problems were spending more time playing video 
games than with friends or family, thinking life would be 
boring without video games, thinking about video games 
even when not playing, feeling upset when not able to play, 
looking forward to the next gaming session, and having 
trouble disengaging or stopping him/herself from playing. 
All of these problems were endorsed at signiﬁcantly higher 
levels among children with ASD than among typically 
developing children (for both genders). In addition, boys 
with ASD were reported to have signiﬁcantly greater 
problems than typically developing boys in getting angry 
when interrupted from games, playing games to ‘‘get his 
mind off other things,’’ and playing longer than intended. 
In contrast, girls with ASD were rated more highly than 
typically developing girls in playing video games ‘‘too 
much.’’ These ﬁndings indicate that although there may be 
some gender-speciﬁc patterns, children with ASD of both 
genders are more likely to demonstrate problematic pat- 
terns of play than typically developing children. These 
results suggest that for many children with ASD, video 
game play can become salient and preoccupying, and can 
be associated with distress. Coupled with the fact that 
many children with ASD were reported to spend more time 
playing video games than engaging with friends or in other 
pro-social activities, this ﬁnding lends support to anecdotal 
concerns voiced by many parents and clinicians. Future 
research is needed to identify longitudinal predictors and 
consequences of problematic game use among children 
with ASD. 
Research examining pathological video game use has 
recently begun to identify individual risk factors among the 
general population. In a recent longitudinal study exam- 
ining trajectories of pathological gaming among 3,034 
adolescents, Gentile and colleagues found that the amount 
of time spent playing video games and impulsivity at 
baseline predicted the number of pathological gaming 
symptoms. 
lower social competence and 
greater impulsivity also predicted increases over time in 
pathological gaming symptoms (Gentile et al. 2011). These 
ﬁndings suggest that children with ASD may be at greater 
risk for problematic gaming due, in part, to their core 
impairments in social competence (American Psychiatric 
Association 2000), and associated difﬁculties with impul- 
sivity and response inhibition (Corbett et al. 2009). The 
inclusion of measures of core and associated symptoms of 



ASD in future studies would be helpful in identifying 
factors that may predispose some children with ASD to 
become preoccupied with these media, and whether those 
factors are similar for both genders. Furthermore, previous 
studies have found that video game genre (particularly 
role-playing games) is related to pathological game use 
among typically developing adolescents (e.g., Rehbein 
et al. 2010). Thus, a speciﬁc examination of video game 
genre in predicting problematic gaming patterns among 
children with ASD will be important in future studies. 

Some have noted that although individuals with ASD spend 
a great deal of time using electronic media, this media may 
offer them an avenue for social interaction (Benford and 
Standen 2009; Brownlow et al. 2006; Muller et al. 2008). 
However, in the current study, children with ASD were 
reported to spend very little time using social media 
(including email, social media websites, or sending text 
messages). Children in the ASD group used social media 
an average of only 0.2 h per day. This was signiﬁcantly 
less than typically developing siblings, who were reported 
to spend approximately 1 h each day using social media. 
Similarly, children with ASD were signiﬁcantly less likely 
than typically developing children to play video games 
with other people, either in-person or online. The majority 
of children with ASD who played video games never 
played them with other people; whereas the majority of 
typically developing children played video games with 
others at least once per month. 
These patterns indicate that the social difﬁculties asso- 
ciated with ASD may extend beyond face-to-face interac- 
tions. Children with ASD in the current sample spent little 
time interacting with friends in person, or engaging with 
others virtually using social media or video games. These 
ﬁndings call into question the assumption that electronic 
media is widely used for social interaction among children 
with ASD. Our ﬁndings may also be consistent with pre- 
vious research conducted by Valkenburg and Peter (2007). 
Although they found that online communication may 
stimulate social intimacy among some adolescents; they 
also found that adolescents who were lonely, introverted or 
socially anxious were less likely to use the internet for 
social communication (Valkenburg and Peter 2007). Future 
research should examine whether and how social media use 
changes over time, particularly among adults with ASD. 

Given our strong evidence of preference for television and 
video games among children with ASD, clinicians may be 
able to maximize motivation and task engagement by 
incorporating electronic media technologies into interven- 
tions. For example, the use of video games may be an 
effective reinforcer that can be built 
into intervention 
programs to increase positive behaviors. This would be 
consistent with previous studies that have successfully used 
restricted interests or repetitive behaviors as motivators 
within intervention programs (Baker et al. 1998; Charlop- 
Christy and Haymes 1996; Wolery et al. 1985). For 
example, Baker et al. (1998) found that developing activ- 
ities using a child’s restricted interests resulted in intrin- 
sically motivating opportunities for social play among 
children with autism. 
There has also been increasing interest in video- and 
computer-based learning applications for autism interven- 
tion (Moore and Taylor 2000; Rayner et al. 2009). Bellini 
and Akullian (2007) concluded that existing evidence 
supports in the inclusion of video modeling and video self- 
modeling as an evidence-based practice for children with 
ASD. A number of studies using single-subject designs to 
examine video-based techniques have demonstrated treat- 
ment effects in a range of areas, including language and 
social communication skills (Charlop-Christy et al. 2000; 
Hetzroni and Tannous 2004; Sherer et al. 2001), behavioral 
functioning, and adaptive skills (Shipley-Benamou et al. 
2002). Anecdotal descriptions also indicate that children 
with ASD particularly enjoy these computer-based inter- 
vention activities. For example, during the course of a 
multiple baseline design computer-based intervention 
study, Hetzroni and Tannous (2004) noted that ‘‘all par- 
ticipants preferred the computer interactive program’’ and 
that ‘‘they always wanted to go to work with the computer’’ 
(p. 110). Evidence supporting generalization of skills into 
real world contexts remains somewhat limited, however 
(Wainer and Ingersoll 2011). Care must also be taken to 
develop strategies for building generalization from solitary 
screen-media formats to real-world social situations, par- 
ticularly given the current evidence that children with ASD 
do not appear to commonly initiate socially interactive 
screen-based media use. Additional research is needed to 
inform the development of interventions that 
leverage 
potentially positive aspects of these technologies, while 
reducing negative or problematic aspects of screen-based 
media use. 

The current study was limited by reliance on parent-report 
for constructs of interest. Future studies would beneﬁt from 
more detailed characterization of the sample, including 
quantitative information about ASD symptom severity and 
level of cognitive, 
language and adaptive functioning. 
Although no group differences in activity participation 
were found based on parent-reported IQ in the current 



sample, it is possible that standardized measurement of 
these constructs would reveal differential patterns of 
screen-based media use among children with varying levels 
of ASD symptom severity and IQ. One possibility is that 
individuals with greater symptom severity or lower intel- 
lectual functioning may spend more time using less cog- 
nitively demanding media, such as television; while those 
with milder symptom presentations may have increased 
engagement in a wider range of activities. Alternatively, 
excessive use of some screen-based media may be asso- 
ciated with the presence and intensity of restricted interests 
for children with ASD, irrespective of overall severity. In a 
recent study of screen-based media use among adolescents 
with autism in the National Longitudinal Transition Study- 
2 (NLTS2), functional cognitive abilities were found to be 
signiﬁcant predictors of both video game play and social 
media use (i.e., email and internet chatting) (Mazurek et al. 
2012). Orsmond and Kuo (2011) also found that adoles- 
cents with ASD and intellectual disabilities were less likely 
to use computers than those with average intelligence. 
Additionally, individuals with intellectual disabilities have 
been found to have difﬁculties with basic computer skills 
and technology (Davies et al. 2001; Li-Tsang et al. 2005). 
It is not yet known whether individuals with ASD with co- 
occurring intellectual disabilities have similar difﬁculties, 
or whether technological capability may be an area of 
relative strength for this population even in the presence of 
cognitive impairment. 
Although the current study provides important infor- 
mation regarding the nature of screen-based media use 
among children with ASD, more research is needed in 
order to understand predictors and consequences of various 
patterns of media use. Although groups in the current 
sample did not differ on items assessing the perceived 
impact of video game use on homework completion or 
grades, more objective measures of academic performance 
and cognitive functioning are needed to more fully assess 
the relationships between these variables. This would also 
provide further information about whether the construct of 
pathological game use is valid for the current population. 
Prospective longitudinal designs would be most helpful 
in order to determine whether and how screen-based media 
use inﬂuences functional outcomes and developmental 
trajectories of children with ASD. It will be particularly 
important to determine whether such effects are signiﬁcant 
even after controlling for initial levels of severity and 
functioning. Given that studies among the general popu- 
lation have found associations between screen-based media 
use and academic performance, attention problems, obes- 
ity, and activity engagement (Hastings et al. 2009; Land- 
huis et al. 2007; Sharif et al. 2010; Sisson et al. 2010; 
Vandewater et al. 2004), these speciﬁc outcome areas will 
be important targets for examination among children with 

ASD. Future research in this area would inform the 
development of clinically-relevant screen-based media 
recommendations for both clinicians and families.
