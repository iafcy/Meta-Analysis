Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Screen Time: Results from a large, 
nationally representative US study 












More than half US children exceed screen time AAP recommendation. No evidence children 
with ASD differ from other US children in total, media, or computer leisure screen time; they 
display a milder age gradient for computer time than other children. 









 
 
 
 
 



Background/aims: To test the hypotheses that children with ASD have higher screen time than 
other children on a US nationally representative sample and that children with ASD are 
overrepresented among children who exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) screen 
time recommendation (<= 2h/day). 
Methods: The National Survey of Children’s Health 2011-12, a nationally representative survey, 
asked parents to report their child’s (ages 6-17) average daily media usage. ASD subpopulation 
(n=1393) was compared to children without ASD (non-ASD, n=64,163). Differences were 
compared using design-corrected F tests. Regression models were estimated for both groups 
separately. Adjusted Wald tests were used to rigorously test the hypotheses. 
Results: More than half US children exceed the AAP screen time recommendation. Compared to 
non-ASD, children with ASD had similar amounts of total screen time (3.21 h/day vs. 3.46 
h/day, p>.05), media (TV/video) time and computer/mobile device leisure time. Children with 
ASD have a milder age gradient than the general population on computer/mobile device usage. 
Children with ASD were proportionally represented among high users (>2h/day). Data did not 
support hypotheses. 
Conclusions: In a large, nationally representative US sample, there was no evidence that 
children with ASD differ in their screen time habits from other children. Both groups have high 
screen time use. Caution should be exercised before assuming that children with ASD are at 
higher risk of exceeding AAP screen time recommendations. Efforts to promote adherence to the 
recommendation are needed, but they should neither target nor exclude children with ASD.
