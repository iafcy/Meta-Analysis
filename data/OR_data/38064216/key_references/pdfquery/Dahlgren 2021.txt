Abstract 
To date, studies using cross-sectional methodologies make up a majority of the literature surrounding children with autism 
spectrum disorders and participation in physical activity and screen time. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine how 
physical activity and screen time behaviors co-develop for children with and without an autism spectrum disorder. To address 
this research gap, this study compared how physical activity and screen time levels changed over time (9 to 18 years of age) 
between youth with autism spectrum disorder and youth with neurotypical development. Data on the levels of moderate- 
to-vigorous physical activity, light physical activity, television-, and video game-based screen time, collected as a part of the 
“Growing up in Ireland” study, were compared between youth with autism spectrum disorder and a propensity-matched 
sample of youth with neurotypical development (n = 88 per group; 176 in total). Robust regression analyses indicated that 
children with autism spectrum disorder became less active over time compared to children with neurotypical development 
and that video game screen time also differed significantly between the groups when children were 9 years old. These findings 
elucidate important disparities present between these groups of children during pivotal developmental times.

Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at an 
increased risk of poor health outcomes compared to youth 
with neurotypical development (ND; Mannion & Leader, 
2013). For example, youth with ASD tend to have a higher 
prevalence of obesity (23.05% vs 15.91%; Healy et al., 
2018) and obesity-related health conditions, including Type 
II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (Shedlock 
et al., 2016) compared to their peers with ND. These health

disparities exacerbate as youth with ASD enter adulthood 
(Croen et al., 2015; Eaves & Ho, 2008). Approximately 
40% of adults with ASD have obesity and 25% are hyper- 
tensive, as compared to 23% and 15% of adults with ND, 
respectively (Croen et al., 2015; Eaves & Ho, 2008). In an 
effort to understand and ultimately reduce these health dis- 
parities, it is critical to examine the modifiable behaviors 
that impact health, including physical activity (PA) and 
sedentary behavior (SB). As health behaviors in childhood 
track into adulthood (Hayes et al., 2019; Malina, 2001; 
Telama, 2009), a focus on understanding trajectories of 
health behaviors in childhood among individuals with ASD 
is of utmost importance. 
Children (i.e. aged <13 years) with ASD tend to have 
lower (Ayvazoglu et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Tyler et al., 
2014) or comparable (Bandini et al., 2013; Boddy et al., 
2015; Corvey et al., 2016) levels of PA compared to chil- 
dren with ND. As children move into adolescence, the dis- 
parity in PA levels between groups is clear. PA levels of 
adolescents with ASD are most often reported to be lower 
than that of their peers with ND (MacDonald et al., 2011; 
McManus et al., 2012; Memari et al., 2013; Pan et al., 
2016). Reflecting this deviation, age is consistently identi- 
fied as being negatively associated with PA levels among 
youth with ASD (Jones et al., 2017). Highlighting this, 
MacDonald and colleagues (2011) examined the PA pat- 
terns of youth with ASD between the ages of 9 and 18 years 
and demonstrated that the mean amount of time spent in 
moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 17 min for the 
youngest group and 10 min for the older group. 
Comparisons of levels of SB, often represented by 
screen time (ST), between youth with ASD and youth with 
ND lead to mixed conclusions. Heavy ST use is well docu- 
mented among youth with ASD (Stiller & Mößle, 2018), 
and several studies report higher levels of ST among youth 
with ASD compared to youth with ND (Chonchaiya et al., 
2011; Engelhardt et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2015; South 
et al., 2005). On the contrary, however, studies comparing 
levels of ST between youth with ASD and youth with ND 
have also reported no differences (McCoy et al., 2016; 
Montes, 2016; Potvin et al., 2013). Difference in trajecto- 
ries of ST use with age do, however, appear to differ 
between youth with ASD and ND; ST levels appear to be 
positively associated with age among youth with ASD and 
are negatively associated with age among youth with ND 
(Montes, 2016; Must et al., 2014; South et al., 2005). In 
other words, ST increases with age for youth with ASD 
and ST decreases for youth with ND. 
Thus far, studies of PA and ST among youth with ASD 
have relied on cross-sectional studies, providing us with a 
“once off” insight into PA and ST levels among this popula- 
tion (Scharoun et al., 2017; Stiller & Mößle, 2018). While 
informative for comparing samples, cross-sectional meth- 
odologies do not observe trends over time, which is essen- 
tial for drawing conclusions on how PA and ST behaviors 
develop (Gordon-Larsen et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2013). A 
paucity of longitudinal studies is a major gap in the litera- 
ture. Longitudinal methods can enhance our understanding 
of the timing, nature, and extent of the changes among PA 
and ST behaviors across time and informs the development 
of targeted interventions at times when health behaviors are 
at risk of worsening. Therefore, to begin to address this 
research gap, this study compared how PA and ST levels 
changed over time (aged from 9 to 18 years) between youth 
with ASD and youth with ND. 


Data came from waves 1, 2, and 3 of the nationally repre- 
sentative longitudinal study “Growing up in Ireland.” This 
study began in 2006 and employed a fixed panel design, fol- 
lowing the progress of a cohort of 9-year-old children born 
between November 1997 and October 1998. Data were col- 
lected at three time points. Wave 1 (9 years) was collected 
between September 2007 and April 2008. Wave 2 (13 years) 
was collected between August 2011 to March 2012, and 
Wave 3 (17/18 years) was collected between April 2015 and 
August 2016. The study administered child- and caregiver- 
report surveys garnering information on youth and their 
families and explored the following key domains of the 
youths’ lives: health and physical development, educational/ 
cognitive development, socio-emotional and behavioral 
well-being, and economic and civic participation. A total of 
8568 children who were 9 years of age and their families 
were surveyed at Wave 1. At Wave 2, 7525 families partici- 
pated in the study, a retention rate of 89%. At Wave 3, data 
were collected on 6216 children who were 17/18 years of 
age representing a 74% retention rate, excluding the 172 
families who were positively identified during Wave 1 or 
Wave 2 fieldwork as no longer living in Ireland from the 
base of 8568 families who were initially interviewed in 
Wave 1. Data were successfully collected at all waves on 
6039 children. At Waves 2 and 3, data were collected from 
the adolescent. Several strategies were employed to elicit an 
accurate response from participants. For example, the inter- 
viewer received training about how to establish a good rap- 
port with the adolescent and the power imbalance that may 
exist between interviewer and participant (Murray et al., 
2010). In addition, the interviewer was instructed to explain 
a question when not understood by the respondent, and 
prompt cards were available with the possible answers if 
necessary (Murray et al., 2010). 
For the purpose of this study, youth with ASD were 
defined as those who were identified by their parents as 
having a current diagnosis of ASD, received by a medical 
professional at any time in Wave 1 (9 years), Wave 2 
(13 years), or Wave 3 (17/18 years). By Wave 3, 91 children 
were identified as having a diagnosis of ASD. A propensity

score matched (PSM) sample of 88 youth with ND was 
then created, matched to the youth with ASD based on gen- 
der and income adjusted for household size at Waves 1, 2, 
and 3. This resulted in a full sample of 176 children. 
The propensity-matched sample included 138 males 
and 38 females. At Wave 3, the mean income adjusted 
for household size was €14,068 (standard deviation 
(SD) = 7811). Of the youth with ASD, 62.5% (n = 55) 
received at least one type of support or service, com- 
pared to 8% (n = 7) of youth with ND. Resource teach- 
ing/learning support was the most frequently reported 
support received by youth with ASD (50%, n = 44), 
followed by special needs assistant (29.5%, n = 26). A 
third (n = 38) of youth with ASD also had an intellec- 
tual disability. No race or ethnicity information was 
available to be utilized for this study. See Table 1 for an 
overview of sample demographics. 

Demographic measures. Demographic variables examined 
in this study included gender and income adjusted for 
household size. To further characterize the sample with 
ASD, data were also provided on (1) the presence of an 
intellectual disability and (2) the number and type of ser- 
vices received by the child, including (a) teaching/learning 
support, (b) special needs assistant, (c) speech and lan- 
guage therapy, (d) management programs, (e) school psy- 
chologist, (f) occupational therapist, (g) physical therapist, 
(h) psychiatrist, and (i) special help or resources in such 
because of limitations. This information was parent- 
reported at Wave 2 (see Table 1). 
PA. Data on MVPA levels were collected on children at 
each wave using the question: 
How many times in the past 14 days has [the Study Child/you] 
done at least 20 minutes of exercise hard enough to make him/ 
her breathe heavily and make his/her heart beat faster? [Hard 
exercise includes, for example, playing football, jogging, or 
fast cycling]. Include time in physical education class. 
Response options included none, 1–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9 days 
or more. Similarly, data on light physical activity (LPA) 
were collected via the question: 
How many times in the past 14 days has [the Study Child/you] 
done at least 20 minutes of light exercise that was not hard 
enough to make him/her breathe heavily and make his/her 
heart beat fast? [Light exercise includes, walking or slow 
cycling]. Include time in physical education class. 
Response options included none, 1–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9 days 
or more. The questions were posed to the parent at Wave 1 
and the child at Wave 2 and 3. 
ST. Time spent watching television (TV) was assessed 
during all three Waves of data collection. At waves 1 and 
2, respondents were asked “on a normal weekday during 
term-time, how many hours does [the Study Child/you] 
spend watching TV, videos or DVDs? Please remember to 
include time before school as well as time after school?” 
Response options included none, less than an hour, 1 hour 
to less than 3 hours, 3 hours to less than 5 hours, 5 hours to 
less than 7 hours, or 7 hours or more. At Wave 3, respond- 
ents were asked: 
How much time do you spend on each of the following activities 
on a typical day (where it is your main activity at the time)? 
Respondents reported time spent “Watching television/films 
on a weekday. Response options were 30-min increments from 
(1) 0–30 min to (13) 361 min or more. The questions were 
posed to the parent at Wave 1 and the child at Wave 2 and 3. 
Time spent playing video games (VGs) was also 
assessed during each wave of data collection. At Waves 1 
and 2, respondents were asked 
on a normal weekday, during term-time, about how much 
time does spend playing videogames such as, Playstation, 
X-box, Nintendo etc? Please include time before school as 
well as time after school. DO NOT include time spent using 
computers in school. 

How much time do you spend on each of the following activities 
on a typical day (where it is your main activity at the time)? 
Respondents reported time spent “Playing video/computer 
games” on a weekday. Response options were 30-min incre- 
ments from (1) 0–30 min to (13) 361 min or more. The ques- 
tions were posed to the parent at Wave 1 and the child at 
Waves 2 and 3. For consistency across waves, ST variables 
were coded across waves as “1 = no screen time,” “2 = less 
than 1 hour of screen time,” “3 = 1–3 hours of screen time,” 
and “4 = 4 or more hours of screen time.” 


As this is a national data collection effort, children with an 
ASD were not directly involved in the design, implemen- 
tation, analysis, or interpretation of the “Growing Up in 
Ireland” study. 

Our analytic approach employed PSM between youth with 
ND and youth with ASD. PSM was utilized to estimate the 
model similarly to an experimental design by creating a 
group with ASD and a control group (i.e. children with 
ND) matched on key socio-demographic variables 
(Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). The two groups were 
matched using income adjusted for household size at all 
three waves of data and child gender. PSM models func- 
tion under the assumption that the matched groups are 
demographically similar, yet differ on a grouping variable 
of interest (Austin, 2011); for this study that included the 
presence of ASD. 
The matched sample was then utilized to run chi-square 
tests on variables of interest such as MVPA and LPA, time 
spent watching TV, and time spent playing VGs. These pre- 
liminary analyses were used to understand how youth with 
ASD and youth with ND compared descriptively on each 
variable across each wave of data from the original study. 
Several robust regression models were run via the 
RREG command in Stata 14.0 to further understand the 
relationship between the matched sample and the variables 
of interest at the final wave of data collection while control- 
ling for prior time points. Robust regression weights each 
observation based on absolute residuals, with data possess- 
ing larger residuals being assigned smaller weights. 
Separate models regressed each outcome variable of inter- 
est—vigorous and light PA, and TV- and VG-ST—on the 
binary ASD/ND predictor. Four separate models were run, 
one for each outcome of MVPA, LPA, TV-ST, and VG-ST. 
All models utilized ASD status (ASD or ND) as the inde- 
pendent variable and Wave 3 assessment of each respective 
variable as the dependent variable. All models controlled 
for participate sex, income adjusted for household size, and 
the prior scores of each respective outcome variable at 
Waves 1 and 2. These prior time points were utilized in 
order to understand how ASD status predicted participation 
in both PA and ST activities when children were aged 
17/18 years while controlling for prior participation. 


PA. At the age of 9 years, 44.3% (n = 39) of children with 
ASD engaged in 9 or more days of MVPA compared to 
62.5% (n = 55) among children with ND, but this difference 
was not statistically significant (χ2(4) = 9.14, p = 0.057). 

MVPA decreased for both groups by the age of 13 years, 
with this decrease being greater among children with ASD. 
At the age of 13 years, adolescents with ASD most com- 
monly participated in 1–2 days of MVPA (31.8%, n = 28) 
compared to adolescents with ND who most frequently 
engaged in 9 or more days of MVPA (36.3%, n = 32; χ2(4) 
= 17.49, p < 0.001). Levels of MVPA continued to decrease 
through the age of 17/18 years, whereby adolescents with 
ASD participated in significantly fewer days compared to 
adolescents with ND (χ2(4) = 17.97, p < 0.001; see Table 2 
and Figure 1). More specifically, by the age of 17/18 years, 
adolescents with ASD most frequently participated in no 
days of MVPA (29.5%, n = 26), compared to adolescents 
with ND who most frequently engaged in 6–8 days of MVPA 
(26.1%, n = 23). 
Levels of LPA did not significantly differ between chil- 
dren with ASD and children with ND at the age of 9 years 
(χ2(4) = 3.32, p = 0.506). Children with ASD and children 
with ND most commonly participated in 9 or more days of 
LPA (65.9%, n = 58% and 76.1%, n = 67%, respectively). 
However, by the age of 13 years, the difference in LPA lev- 
els between groups increased as adolescents with ASD par- 
ticipating in fewer days compared to adolescents with ND 
(χ2(4) = 15.22, p = 0.001). By the age of 13 years, adoles- 
cents with ASD most commonly participated in 3–5 days of 
LPA (28.4%, n = 25) compared to adolescents with ND 
who most frequently engaged in 9 or more days of LPA 
(36.3%, n = 32). The difference in LPA was not significant 
between groups at the age of 17/18 years (χ2(4) = 5.61, p = 
0.230; see Table 2). At the age of 17/18 years, adolescents 
with ASD and adolescents with ND most commonly partici- 
pated in 9 or more days of LPA (32.9%, n = 29% and 
37.5%, n = 33, respectively; see Table 3 and Figure 1). 
ST. Time spent watching TV did not differ between groups 
at any data collection time points (p > 0.05 for Waves 1, 2, 
and 3; see Table 4 and Figure 1). At Wave 1 and 2, youth 
with ASD and youth with ND most commonly watched 
1–3 hour of TV per day (Wave 1: 61.3%, n = 54% and 
71.5%, n = 63, respectively and Wave 2: 40.9%, n = 36% 
and 59%, n = 52, respectively). At Wave 3, adolescents 
with ND were still most likely to engage in 1–3 hour of TV 
time per day (47.7%, n = 42), whereas adolescents with 
ASD were most likely to engage in 1–3 hour per day 
(30.6%, n = 27) or 0 hour per day (30.6%, n = 27). 
VG-related ST only significantly differed between 
groups during Wave 1 of data collection (χ2(3) = 8.42, p = 
0.027; see Table 5). At Wave 1, children with ASD and 
children with ND most commonly engaged in 1–3 hour of 
VG play per day (34%, n = 30% and 54.5%, n = 48, 
respectively). At Wave 2, most adolescents with ASD and 
ND participants reported spending less than 1 hour playing 
VG per day (31.8%, n = 28% and 48.8%, n = 43, respec- 
tively). At Wave 3, adolescents with ASD and ND reported 
to most often spend no time playing VG (see Figure 1).

A robust regression analysis was run on each outcome of 
interest (i.e. MVPA, LPA, ST-TV, and ST-VG) at Wave 3 
when children were aged 17/18 years in order to under- 
stand if ASD status was related to participation in each 
outcome at Wave 3 when controlling for earlier participa- 
tion at Waves 1 and 2. The only statistically significant 
difference found in activity participation at Wave 3 was 
for MVPA. Specifically, having ASD was related to sig- 
nificantly less participation in MVPA when participants 
were aged 17/18 years compared to their ND peers after 
controlling for prior time points of MVPA participation 
(b = −0.67, p = 0.002). There were no statistically sig- 
nificant differences based on ASD status for Wave 3 out- 
comes of LPA, ST-TV, or ST-VG (see Table 6).

By adolescence, youth with ASD are significantly less physi- 
cally active compared to their peers with ND (MacDonald 
et al., 2011; McManus et al., 2012; Memari et al., 2013; Pan 
et al., 2016; Ratcliff et al., 2018). Our understanding of when 
this disparity in PA levels develops is hampered by a lack of 
longitudinal studies. This study, for the first time, begins to 
address this research gap by revealing that disparities in 
MVPA levels between children with ASD and children with 
ND, which exist at the age of 9 years, progressively worsen 
between the age of 9–13 years, and further worsen from the 
age of 13–17/18 years. Moreover, this study suggests that the 
disparities in LPA between groups emerge between the age 
of 9 and 13 years.

An age-related decline in PA levels is well documented 
among youth with ND, as demonstrated by longitudinal stud- 
ies (Sallis, 2000); this study suggests that this phenomenon is 
exacerbated among youth with ASD. Several social factors are 
reported to contribute to the decline of PA from childhood to 
adolescents among youth with ND. These factors include a 
lack of social support and negative self-perceptions of compe- 
tence to perform (Bélanger et al., 2011). These factors may be 
compounded among children with ASD due to their unique 
social and communication behaviors associated with ASD 
(Corvey et al., 2016). This speculation is supported by research 
in which children with ASD and their parents reported a host 
of social barriers to PA, including stress that arise from social 
interaction (Arnell et al., 2020), being victims of bullying in 
PA settings, being excluded from activities by peers or

practitioners (e.g. physical education teachers) (Blagrave & 
Colombo-Dougovito, 2019; Healy et al., 2013; Must et al., 
2015), and having difficulty initiating social interactions 
(Obrusnikova & Miccinello, 2012). To improve health behav- 
ior trajectories and reduce the steep decline in PA levels among 
children with ASD, a multi-pronged approach to increase or 
maintain PA among this population, as they enter adolescence, 
is critical. Combatting the more-severe decline in PA levels 
that exists for children with ASD will demand a focus on pro- 
viding appropriate physical education, school-based extra- 
curricular PA opportunities, and community and home-based 
PA opportunities. Examining the multi-level factors that dis- 
tinguish between children with ASD who decrease, maintain, 
or increase their PA participation as they enter adolescence is 
an important precursor to these efforts. 
Our data showed both ST-TV and ST-VG levels were 
comparable among children with ASD and children with 
ND at the age of 9, 13, and 17/18 years, with the exception 
of ST-VG at the age of 9 years. These results reflect previ- 
ous studies reporting comparable levels of ST between 
youth with ASD and youth with ND (McCoy et al., 2016; 
Montes, 2016; Potvin et al., 2013). Interestingly, TV-ST 
levels among children with ASD decreased from the age 
of 13–17/18 years (to illustrate; only 30% of 17/18 years 
with ASD participated in more than an hour of TV-ST at 
the age of 17/18 years compared to 66% and 62% of chil- 
dren with ASD at the age of 9 and 13 years, respectively). 
A lack of studies of ST-TV of youth with ASD at this age 
make it difficult to ascertain the novelty of this finding. 
These data suggest that intervening to reduce levels 
among children with ASD and children with ND might be 
particularly warranted between the age of 9 and 13 years, 
when increases in VG-ST and TV-ST occur. Increased ST 
is positively associated with conditions including obesity, 
sleep problems, depression, and anxiety (Domingues- 
Montanari, 2017) and negatively associated with aca- 
demic performance (Zimmerman & Christakis, 2005). 
Increased ST has also been associated with lower PA lev- 
els (Sandercock et al., 2012). The interdependence 
between PA and ST may contribute to the inverse relation- 
ship that appears to exist between trajectories of these 
behaviors, particular between LPA and ST levels for chil- 
dren with ASD. Giving further credence to the interde- 
pendence between PA and ST behaviors among children 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


with ASD, the factors reported to promote ST use among 
children with ASD reflect the barriers this population 
reports for PA (e.g. the non-social aspect of TV and VGs, 
the consistency and predictability of these forms of enter- 
tainment (Durkin, 2010)). Combatting decreasing levels 
of PA and intervening to reduce ST levels might be best 
tackled in unison, with multi-behavior interventions, tar- 
geting common social factors. 

The longitudinal nature of the data, collected at three time 
points across a critical, formative period of development 
(i.e. 9–17/18 years) was a strength of the study. These data 
provide insight into how PA and ST behaviors change or 
intensify through childhood to adolescence. The propen- 
sity-matched groups of youth with ASD and ND was also 
a strength, ensuring samples were comparable by gender 
and socioeconomic status. 
Several limitations should also be noted and considered 
in the interpretation of findings. First, data collection was 
self- and parent-report which can increase the risk of bias 
as some participants may not accurately recall informa- 
tion. For example, previous studies have found that parent- 
reported measures tend to overestimate children’s PA 
(Adamo et al., 2009). Moreover, some adolescents with 
ASD may not have been able to respond to the survey at 
the age of 13 or 17/18 years, despite the efforts made to 
make data collection accessible and thus dropped out of 
the study. Data on reasons for attrition are not available. 
Second, the sample size of this study was relatively small, 
decreasing the statistical power of the results and making 
generalizability difficult. This is particularly salient among 
the heterogeneous population of children with ASD. Third, 
data collection began in 2003 and ended in 2016. The ben- 
efit of having such a long time-period to study also incurs 
the issue of having to consider socio-cultural and techno- 
logical changes that occur during this time-period. For 
example, use of the Internet has grown exponentially in 
the last decade (Anderson et al., 2017). It is unknown how 
trajectories of PA and ST from the age of 9–17/18 years 
will evolve in the coming decades. 

Our understanding of PA and ST levels among children 
with ASD is largely derived from cross-sectional studies, 
which limit our ability to observe trajectories of behavior. 
This study expands upon this research by examining PA 
and ST over a longer time-period (8 years), with data col- 
lected at three different time points. This longitudinal data 
provide a comprehensive account of PA and ST patterns. 
Most notably, the data demonstrate disparities in MVPA 
between children with ASD and ND to progressively 
worsen from the age of 9–18 years, and disparities in levels 
of LPA to worsen from the age of 9–13 years. Longitudinally 
studies of PA and ST among younger children with ASD, 
larger samples, and using objective measures of PA and ST 
are urgently required.
