Abstract 
Objective To study the early social experience and digital media exposure in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 
comparison with typically developed children. 
Methods Details of digital-media exposure and early social experience in 65 children with ASD were compared with those in a 
control group of equal number of typically developed children, matched for age and gender. Prenatal and perinatal factors were 
also studied. The diagnosis of ASD was based on the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) diagnostic tool 
and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria. Variables which were 
biologically relevant and has a P value of < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were analyzed by logistic regression to obtain the 
adjusted effect measures. 
Results Children with ASD were exposed to digital media at an earlier age and spent significantly more time with digital media 
and less time with their mothers, compared to typically developed children. Exposure to digital media before 21 mo was 
associated with risk of ASD and the risk increased when mothers spent less than 6.5 h per day with the baby. Family history 
of epilepsy and developmental delay, maternal stress during the antenatal period, and absence of exclusive breastfeeding during 
the first 6 mo were significantly more in children with ASD. 
Conclusion There are significant differences in the early life social experience and digital-media exposure in children with ASD 
compared to typically developed counterparts. Given the reported rise in prevalence of ASD, these findings stress the need for 
further prospective studies to explore these potentially modifiable risk factors.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social commu- 
nication and social interaction associated with restricted, re- 
petitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities [1]. The 
prevalence of ASD according to the Center for Disease 
Control (USA) Surveillance Data for 2016 was 1/64 among 
children aged 4 y [2]. There is a wide variation in the reported 
prevalence of ASD in India ranging from 0.1% to 1.4% [3–5]. 
ASD has a complex and heterogeneous etiology with both 
genetic and environmental risk factors. Gene-environment in- 
teraction leading to heritable epigenetic changes in gene ex- 
pression is one of the emerging theories on the etiology of 
ASD [6]. It has been proposed that environmental risk factors 
may influence in-utero neurodevelopment through epigenetic 
mechanisms [7]. 

The environmental risk factors implicated include parental 
age, natal and prenatal factors, maternal infections and auto- 
immune disorders, medication use during pregnancy, mater- 
nal lifestyle and dietary factors, and environmental toxins [6]. 
Excessive exposure to visual media and less parent child play 
in early life has also been reported as risk factor for ASD [8]. 
Difference in exposure to the environmental risk factors 
may be one of the reasons for the wide variation in the report- 
ed prevalence of ASD in India [3]. These are modifiable risk 
factors and the knowledge about the region-specific differ- 
ences is crucial to plan preventive strategies. 
Despite the increasing prevalence of ASD [9], very few stud- 
ies have looked into the role of perinatal and psychosocial risk 
factors in the etiology of ASD in this part of the country. Health 
indices of Kerala are comparable to those of the developed world 
and recently the state has achieved the unique target of single 
digit infant mortality rate (IMR) [10]. Increased survival of pre- 
term and low birth weight babies is likely to contribute to in- 
creased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders including 
ASD. The living environment in Kerala is also unique with sig- 
nificant expatriate population, working mothers, and single 
mothers [11]. Hence, it is pertinent to look for the perinatal and 
psychosocial risk factors for ASD in the state. 
The present study was conceived in this backdrop with the 
aim to assess the early social experience and digital-media 
exposure in children with ASD in comparison with typically 
developed children. The study also aimed to compare the pre- 
natal and perinatal factors in children with ASD with those in 
typically developed children. 

A case control study design was chosen, and the study was 
conducted at the Child Development Services of the Institute 
of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) and Govt. 
Medical College, Kozhikode, among the children who 
attended the out-patient (OP) services. Children with a clinical 
diagnosis of ASD who attended the OP during the 18 mo from 
December 2017 to June 2019 were included in the case group. 
Children in the 3- to 8-y age group were consecutively recruit- 
ed for the study. Children with progressive neurological dis- 
orders were excluded. 
The control group included typically developed children 
with no neurological disorders who attended the general pe- 
diatric OP for minor illnesses like upper respiratory Infection. 
Both the groups were matched for age and gender. Sample 
size was calculated as 74 in each group to detect an odds ratio 
(OR) of 3 as statistically significant, assuming that the expo- 
sure prevalence of low birth weight was 20% [12] and a power 
80% and 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) using Open 
Epiref online software [13]. 

A questionnaire was prepared to document the perinatal and 
psychosocial factors and the data collection was done by 
interviewing either one of the parents and verifying the avail- 
able records. Parents were asked to report at what age the child 
was exposed intentionally to digital media like TV, mobile, 
video games, etc. and also how many hours the child spends 
watching digital media during the previous 2-wk period to doc- 
ument the details of digital-media exposure. The average time 
spent by the mother or the primary caretaker with the child per 
day during the first two years of life was obtained by appropri- 
ate questions in the questionnaire. Personal perception on stress 
experienced by the mothers during pregnancy was obtained by 
two questions incorporated in the main proforma on the pres- 
ence or absence of stress and the type of stress. The diagnosis of 
ASD was made using the INCLEN diagnostic tool [14] and 
satisfying DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD. The diagnosis 
was confirmed by an expert in child psychiatry (PK) and neu- 
rosciences (SB). Co-morbid disorders were diagnosed based on 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Socioeconomic status was assessed 
based on modified Kuppuswami scale [15]. Informed consent 
from the parents was obtained and the study was approved by 
the institutional ethics committee. 
The data were entered in to the excel data sheet and ana- 
lyzed with SPSS V.16 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) statis- 
tical package. The results were expressed in terms of frequen- 
cy and percentage for qualitative variables and in terms of 
mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables. OR 
with 95% CI was used to assess the strength of association. 
Quantitative variables like duration of media exposure, age of 
starting the media exposure and average time spent with moth- 
er were compared between the two group using Mann- 
Whitney U-test as the data was skewed. A multivariable lo- 
gistic regression was used to find the adjusted OR and 95% 
CI. Variables which were biologically relevant and had P 
value of < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were put in the 
logistic regression to obtain the adjusted effect measures. P 
value of < 0.05 was taken as level of significance for associ- 
ation between exposure variables and ASD. 
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is extensively 
used in clinical epidemiology to quantify how accurately a test 
can discriminate between diseased state and nondiseased state. 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of separabil- 
ity and if the AUC is nearer to 1, it indicates that the model is 
better in distinguishing cases and controls. The authors applied 
ROC curve to assess the probability of developing autism spec- 
trum disorder in the settings of early digital media exposure and 
also for the time spent with the mother. 

The study group consisted of 65 children with ASD and 
included 53 (81.5%) boys and 12 (18.5%) girls. The mean 

age of children with ASD was 4.77 y (SD ± 1.57). They 
belonged to lower, middle, and upper socioeconomic clas- 
ses in 26 (40%), 11 (17%), and 28 (43%) cases, respectively 
and 38 (58.5%) were from joint families and 27 (41.5%) 
from nuclear families. The age- and sex-matched control 
group included 65 typically developed children with 47 
(72.2%) boys and 18 (27.8%) girls with a mean age of 
4.40 y (SD ± 1.52). 
All children with ASD had delayed language development 
and only 10 (15%) children were able to communicate mean- 
ingfully. The majority of them (51; 78.4%) had impaired in- 
tellectual functioning and 5 (7.7%) had co-morbid ADHD. 
Hearing impairment was present in 2 (3%) children. 
Prenatal and perinatal factors with statistically significant 
difference between the study group and the control group on 
univariate analysis are described in Table 1. 
Children with ASD were exposed to digital media at an 
earlier age and they spent significantly more time with dig- 
ital media compared to the children in the control group 
(Table 2). The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.756 imply- 
ing association with younger age of onset of audio-visual 
media exposure and autism spectrum disorders. Onset of 
exposure less than 21 mo was associated with a risk of de- 
veloping ASD with sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 
72% (Fig. 1). 
On the other hand, children with ASD spent significantly less 
time with the mother/primary caretaker compared to the children 
in the control group (Table 2). The area under the ROC curve 
was 0.830 and the risk of ASD was found to decrease with the 
mother spending 6.5 hour per day on average with the baby, with 
a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 72% (Fig. 2). 
Multivariable logistic regression was done with the risk 
factors that reached statistical significance in univariate anal- 
ysis. Neonatal seizure and family history of ASD were not 
included in regression as there were zero subjects among con- 
trols. On multivariate analysis it was found that family history 
of epilepsy and developmental delay, maternal stress during 
the antenatal period, absence of exclusive breastfeeding dur- 
ing the first 6 mo, early exposure to digital media and in- 
creased screen-time, and mother spending less quality time 
with the child had significant association with ASD (Table 3). 

The authors have studied the early life social experience and 
digital-media exposure in children with ASD in comparison 
with those in typically developed children and also compared 
the prenatal and perinatal factors. They found that children 
with ASD spent significantly more time with digital media 
and the latter were exposed to digital media at an earlier age, 
compared to typically developed children. On the other hand, 
the authors found an inverse relationship between quality time 
spent with mother during the first 2 y and the risk for ASD. 
Over-exposure to digital media may lead to neurochemical 
and neuroanatomical changes in the brain and influence learn- 
ing and cognition [16]. But whether excessive screen time 
during early childhood has any direct effect on increasing 
the risk for ASD is still inconclusive, with some studies 
reporting an association [8, 17, 18] and others finding none 
[19]. It is likely that children with ASD preferred to be left 
alone and spend time with visual media rather than with

parents due to the inherent characteristics of the autistic symp- 
tomatology. The finding that children with ASD spent more 
time with digital media and less time with mothers warrants 
more attention in the Indian context, in view of a study from 
south India which had reported that around one third of chil- 
dren with ASD had social experiential deprivation and fo- 
cused interventions resulted in better short-term outcomes. 
They chose the working definition of social experiential dep- 
rivation as mothers spending less than 2 h per day with the 
child, screen time more than 4 h a day or excessive solitary 
time of the child [20]. Similar findings had been reported in 
studies from abroad also [17]. Another recent study from 
south India reported that families of children with ASD spent 
significantly more time in front of digital media and less time 
interacting with the child [21]. 
Many studies in the past had reported that breast feeding 
has a protective effect on ASD [22–24]. In the present sample, 
children who received exclusive breast feeding during the first 
6 m of life were significantly less in the ASD group compared 
to the control group. The present data are insufficient to 
Fig. 1 Age of first exposure to 
visual media — ROC curve 
conclude that exclusive breastfeeding has a protective effect 
against ASD since feeding problems are common in these 
children and mothers may be compelled to give artificial 
feeds. It has been observed that even when initiated at the 
recommended age, mothers could not sustain breastfeeding 
due to practical problems [25]. The protective effect of 
breastfeeding need not be due to the nutritional aspects alone. 
Breastfeeding helps to promote mother-child bonding and bet- 
ter mother-child interaction and provides the crucial stimula- 
tion for brain development. Difficulties in sustaining 
breastfeeding may be contributing to social experiential deri- 
vation in children with ASD. 
The finding that maternal stress during pregnancy is a risk 
factor for ASD emphasizes the importance of psychological 
wellbeing of pregnant mothers which often does not get due 
attention. This is an area which needs further exploration. 
Stress during the antenatal period can adversely affect 
neurodevelopment and predisposes to neurodevelopmental 
disorders including ASD [26].

the mother in 1st 2 y of life (ROC 
curve) 
Among the many prenatal and perinatal factors, in- 
creased parental age and preterm birth are now considered 
to be proven risk factors for ASD [6]. It has been postulated 
that multiple prenatal and perinatal factors, rather than any 
single one, are involved in the etiology of ASD [27]. In the 
present sample, prematurity and increased maternal age had 
a significant association with ASD in univariate analysis, 
but the association was not found to be significant in multi- 
variate analysis. Even though the risk of ASD increases with 
both paternal and maternal age, the relationship with mater- 
nal age was found to be stronger [28]. Possible biological 
mechanisms for the age-related risk for ASD include 
increased chance for de novo mutations and genetic aberra- 
tions in older parents; more chance of unfavorable in-utero 
environment; and increased chance of obstetric complica- 
tions in older mothers [29]. 
Increased presence of neurodevelopmental problems like 
autism, developmental delay, epilepsy, and psychiatric ill- 
nesses in the families of children with ASD, which were also 
reported in previous studies [30–32] may be indicative of the 
genetic etiology of autism. Many psychiatric and 
neurodevelopmental disorders share common risk factors 
and probably the vulnerability to develop psychiatric disor- 
ders is inherited and not individual disorders [31].

The prevalence of ASD is increasing the world over, including 
India. Being a neurodevelopmental disorder with no specific 
treatment, early identification of the modifiable risk factors 
and appropriate intervention is crucial for prevention. Even 
though there are case- control studies on the perinatal and 
prenatal risk factors, Indian data on digital-media exposure 
and quality time being spent with mothers in children with 
ASD is scant. The authors found that there is an association 
between early childhood exposure to digital media and risk for 
developing ASD. 
Despite the inherent limitations of a hospital-based study 
with small sample size and the recall bias, the present study 
gives preliminary evidence to the potentially modifiable risk 
factors of ASD relevant to the Indian context. Further, pro- 
spective studies to identify the region-specific risk factors and 
randomized blinded interventional studies are needed in this 
area to provide robust scientific evidence for the effective 
management of children with ASD.
