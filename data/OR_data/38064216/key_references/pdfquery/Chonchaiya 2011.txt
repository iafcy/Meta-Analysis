ABSTRACT 
Aim: To examine the pattern and extent of television viewing in children with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with typically developing controls and those with 
delayed language development (DLD). 
Methods: 
controls (mean age 2.43 ± 0.81 years) were enrolled. Fifty-six individuals with DLD, who 
had language developmental levels similar to those with ASD, were enrolled in our previous 
study. Main outcome measures included onset and frequency of television viewing, in 
addition to the type of programme and whether a caregiver cowatched television. 
Results: Those with ASD began to watch television signiﬁcantly earlier than controls 
(6.44 ± 6.35 vs. 12.41 ± 6.00 months of age, p £ 0.0001*) and spent more time watch- 
ing television than those with DLD (4.60 ± 1.91 vs. 3.05 ± 1.90 h ⁄ day, p £ 0.0001*) 
and controls (4.60 ± 1.91 vs. 2.06 ± 1.21 h ⁄ day, p £ 0.0001*). Those with ASD 
appeared to watch more adult programmes than normal controls, and they were less likely 
to watch television with caregivers than both control groups. 
Conclusion: There is an earlier onset and higher frequency of television viewing in 
autistic children compared with children with typical development. 
INTRODUCTION 
Media has become an important environmental factor in 
the household that can have an impact on the daily lives of 
young children because they have often begun to watch 
television very early, by 3 months of age. In addition, more 
time is spent in front of the screen, with an average of 
approximately 3–4 h ⁄ day, more than any other leisure 
activity besides sleeping (1,2). This early exposure and 
increased amount of television viewing exceeds the recom- 
mendations by The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 
which suggests that children ‡2 years of age should have 
<2 h of watching television per day. In addition, parents 
should watch television together with their child and dis- 
cuss the content and children <2 years of age should avoid 
watching television (3). Thus far, there are several studies 
demonstrating harmful effects of media on young children, 
including violence (4), obesity (5,6), sleep problems (7), 
(8–10), adverse 
delayed language development 
effects on cognition (11) and attention problems (12,13). 
Therefore, this evidence should no longer be disregarded by 
parents, paediatricians, teachers, entertainment industries 
and policy makers (1,14). 

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex group of 
heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders with signiﬁ- 
cant impairments in social and communication domains in 
addition to restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours 
(15). It is an urgent public health concern in many coun- 
tries. Estimates reported by the Autism and Developmental 
Disabilities Monitoring Network in the US show that 
approximately up to 110 in 10 000 children, 3–17 years of 
age have ASD (16). Early detection by a multidisciplinary 
team can lead to a better outcome for those children with 
ASD from comprehensive developmental and behavioural 
interventions (17,18). In some preschool-age children with 
autism, they can have unusual responses to sensory stimuli 
and relative strength in visual-spatial perception (19,20). 
Therefore, various learning interventions including the Pic- 
ture Exchange Communication System and videotape mod- 
elling were developed to help those with ASD acquire 
functional communication spontaneously (21,22). Accord- 
ing to parent reports, some of those with ASD demonstrated 
a high interest 
in television, videotapes and computer 
programmes, but the pattern and extent of media use specif- 
ically in young individuals with ASD or other neurodevel- 
opmental disorders have rarely been studied. Additionally, 
little is known about how to appropriately recommend 
media use for caregivers of those with ASD or other neuro- 
developmental disorders. We focused solely on television in 
this current study as its use was more widely reported when 
compared with music ⁄ audio, computers and video (14). 
Moreover, television is easily accessed by young children 
and widely used in the household in Thailand. To better 





provide appropriate recommendations on television use for 
parents of children with ASD, we therefore compared tele- 
vision viewing habits in those with ASD with typically 
developing controls and those with DLD from our previous 
study (9). 
METHODS 
Study subjects 
Study subjects included 54 children with ASD with a mean 
age of 2.56 years (SD 0.66, age range 1.5–3.83 years) and 56 
children with DLD with a mean age of 2.11 years (SD 0.47, 
age range 1.33–3.67 years), who were seen at the develop- 
mental clinic, Division of Growth and Development, 
Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial 
Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during September 2005 to 
August 2006. Eighty-four typically developing children with 
a mean age of 2.43 years (SD 0.81, age range 1.5–4 years), 
who came to the well baby clinic at King Chulalongkorn 
Memorial Hospital, Bangkok during the same period, were 
enrolled as normal controls. Those with DLD and normal 
controls were recruited in our previous study (9). The enrol- 
ment of typically developing controls was based on age and 
gender matched to those with ASD. The diagnosis of ASD 
was conﬁrmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revised criteria 
(15), followed by a developmental and behavioural paediat- 
ric team consensus discussion including all authors in addi- 
tion to a psychologist, developmental and behavioural 
paediatric fellows, a speech and language pathologist, a 
physical therapist and a behavioural specialist. DLD was 
diagnosed based on a clinical evaluation by the multidisci- 
plinary team mentioned above. Those with known causes of 
DLD including ASD, genetic syndromes, hearing loss, neu- 
rological disorders and global developmental delay were 
not included in the DLD group (9). The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of King Chulalongkorn 
Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn 
University, Bangkok. 


Study protocol 
After informed consent was obtained, all subjects under- 
went a full medical history, physical examination, and a full 
developmental assessment by either author (WC or CP), 
who are both developmental and behavioural paediatricians 
with expertise in ASD. The medical history covered an 
extensive review of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal his- 
tory, developmental milestones, developmental delay or 
regression, and behavioural problems, 
in addition to a 
review of systems, and medication use. Table 1 lists charac- 
teristics of those with ASD, DLD and controls. Socioeco- 
income, 
nomic 
education, primary caregiver, number of family members 
and family support (the involvement of other family mem- 
bers to help take care of the child). Table 2 lists parental 
and family characteristics of those with ASD, DLD and con- 
trols. The television viewing habits mainly focused on how 
early (onset) and on average how much television the sub- 
jects watched (frequency), what programmes they preferred 
to watch (content), and how they watched television (con- 
text) to document whether they were allowed to watch tele- 
vision alone or whether caregivers cowatched with them. 
The average time of interactive activities where caregivers 
jointly spent with their children each day, including helping 
them to brush their teeth, take a bath, get dressed, helping 
with toileting, listening to them about daily activities, eating 
with them, teaching and encouraging them to talk, playing 
with them, etc., and the average time caregivers talked with 
their children during the day, including telling stories and 
reading to them, were also thoroughly assessed by an in- 
depth interview. Table 3 illustrated comparisons of televi- 
sion viewing habits and time characteristics, including the 
average time of interactive activities and the average time 
caregivers talked with their children during the day,

between individuals with ASD with typically developing 
controls, and those with DLD. 
Developmental assessment included hearing screening, 
evaluation of joint attention and sociability, observation of 
play, expressive and receptive language, hyperactive, repeti- 
tive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviours in the session. 
Furthermore, developmental screening was performed by 
using Denver-II (23), which is a validated developmental 
screening tool widely used in Thailand. Language develop- 
mental level was determined by the age where subjects can 
pass those items at the 75th percentile on language develop- 
mental domain in the Denver-II. 
Statistical analysis 
Continuous variables were compared between subjects 
with ASD and the typically developing control group, 
and also between those with ASD, and those with DLD 
using either one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or 
comparison, Mann–Whitney U-test, 
nonparametric 
and 
assumption of normality 
depending upon the 
equality of variance in each group. Categorical variables 
were compared by Fisher’s exact test. Analysis of covari- 
ance (ANCOVA) was conducted if background variables 
were signiﬁcantly different between the groups and 
potentially associated with the main outcome measures 
by using those variables as covariates. All statistical anal- 
yses were performed with SPSS version 18.0 (IBM, Inc, 
for Windows and all p-values 
Somers, NY, USA) 
reported are two-sided and the signiﬁcance level is 0.05. 
RESULTS 
Characteristics of study subjects 
There were no signiﬁcant differences in background vari- 
ables including chronological age, gender, birth order, pre- 
term birth, birth weight and past medical illness between 
individuals with ASD and typically developing controls 
(Table 1). Nor were there signiﬁcant differences in parental 
and family characteristics between both groups of subjects 
(Table 2). However, mothers of individuals with ASD were

slightly older than controls’ mothers. As expected, those with 
ASD had language developmental delay documented by 
developmental history and the Denver-II. Although those 
with DLD were signiﬁcantly younger than those with ASD, 
the language developmental age was not signiﬁcantly differ- 
ent from those with ASD. In addition, an average of father’s 
income in those with DLD was signiﬁcantly lower than those 
with ASD, but the comparison of combined parental income 
between these two groups did not reach a signiﬁcant level. 
Comparison of television viewing habits between those 
with ASD and typically developing controls 
Individuals with ASD began to watch television prior to the 
development of their receptive and expressive language. 
Interestingly, an approximately 6-month earlier onset of tele- 
vision viewing was observed in those with ASD compared 
with typically developing controls. Most controls began to 
watch television after they started to speak meaningful 
words. Prior to 12 months of age, more individuals with ASD 
began to watch television compared with controls. However, 
before 24 months of age, both groups began to watch televi- 
sion earlier than the AAP recommendations. Regarding the 
frequency of television viewing, those with ASD appeared to 
spend signiﬁcantly more time watching television than con- 
trols and the AAP recommendations. Those with ASD were 
more likely to watch adult programmes including advertise- 
ments, TV series, news, games, entertainment shows and 
music videos than controls. Furthermore, individuals with 
ASD were more likely to be allowed to watch television on 
their own compared with controls. 
Comparison of television viewing habits between those 
with ASD and those with DLD 
Interestingly, higher frequency of television viewing was 
demonstrated in those with ASD compared with those with 
DLD. There were signiﬁcantly higher rates of watching tele- 
vision ‡2 h ⁄ day and no joint interaction during television 
viewing in individuals with ASD compared with those with 
DLD (Table 3). After adjusting for chronological age, gen- 
der, father’s and mother’s income, and whether the mother 
was a primary caregiver of the child, those with ASD 
appeared to spend more time watching television than those 
with DLD (estimated means ± SE, 
vs. 
3.32 ± 0.26 h ⁄ day, F1,102 = 6.862, p = 0.01). There was an 
interesting trend towards an earlier onset of television view- 
ing in those with ASD compared with those with DLD after 
adjusting for the variables mentioned earlier (estimated 
means ± SE, 5.72 ± 0.84 vs. 7.90 ± 0.84 months of age, 
F1,102 = 3.01, p = 0.086). 

DISCUSSION 
This is the ﬁrst study demonstrating the pattern and extent 
of television viewing in individuals with ASD compared 
with typically developing children and those with DLD 
from the perspective of a developing country, where young 
children can be inﬂuenced by the media (9). However, our 
they 
cautiously 
ﬁndings 


demonstrated an association, not a cause-and-effect ﬁnding. 
Although an increased frequency of television use in those 
with ASD in this current study was in agreement with a 
study by Shane and Albert and May et al. (24,25), none of 
those previous studies surveyed television use in younger 
individuals with ASD, nor mentioned the onset of television 
viewing in those with ASD. There may be a combination of 
social and language deﬁcits in addition to restricted and 
repetitive behaviours in those with ASD, risks for attention 
problems and abnormal regulation to arousal stimuli. Fur- 
thermore, caregivers may not successfully engage their chil- 
dren, so that children with ASD may occupy themselves 
with nonsocial activities including television viewing. An 
adult moderator and enriched parent–child interaction can 
be very critical for brain development in young children 
with and without ASD (26). Behavioural symptoms of ASD 
were more likely to emerge over time, beginning in the sec- 
ond half of the ﬁrst year by prospectively demonstrating the 
slow decline in social communication behaviours, and loss 
of skills in those who were later diagnosed with ASD (27). 
Therefore, ASD symptoms may emerge at approximately 
6 months of age in those with ASD in our study where 
social and communication deﬁcits became problematic, 
reﬂecting why those with ASD appeared to watch television 
earlier than their typically developing peers. The onset of 
television use at approximately 6 months of age may be an 
indirect clue for social and ⁄ or language deﬁcits in those 
who are at risk of ASD. Furthermore, potentially detrimen- 
tal effects of the media mentioned in the Introduction sec- 
tion, which can co-occur in those with ASD should be 
taken into consideration. Increased attention to the screen, 
imitation of words and developing procedural knowledge 
about television’s devices were observed in those with ASD 
(24), but how this knowledge can be pragmatically general- 
ized in a way of social communication in the daily lives of 
those with ASD needs to be elucidated. 
The signiﬁcant weaknesses of our study included small 
sample sizes, the lack of standardized ASD assessments and 
using just an interview without another objective assess- 
ment of television viewing habits (e.g. behavioural observa- 
tion in the household). However, we tried to compensate 
for this weakness by interviewing strictly to the protocol 
regardless of the groups of the subjects. Population-based 
studies with long-term follow-up in those with ASD and 
typically developing controls are needed. Moreover, short 
and long-term consequences of media use in those with 
ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders should be fur- 
ther studied to better provide appropriate anticipatory guid- 
ance for parents of those with ASD, particularly the topics 
in terms of how to optimize beneﬁts and potential risks 
from the media for their children. Future studies should also 
consider how beneﬁcial effects of television viewing includ- 
ing imitation and prosocial behaviours can lead to develop- 
interventions through media, 
ing interactive educational 
which should be more developmentally appropriate for 
those with ASD and ultimately modify or shape on abnor- 
mal neuronal networks in developing brains of those with 
ASD (28).
