Anecdotal data on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
computer use has apparently led IT companies to look spe- 
cifi cally for autistic employees (Florentine, 2015; Jones, 
2016). Why are people on the autistic spectrum so valuable 
for the IT sector? 
ASD is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition (Jo- 
seph, Soorya, & Thurm, 2015). Diagnostic criteria in the 5th 
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychological Association, 
2013) include social-communicative and interactional def- 
icits as well as restricted repetitive behaviors. Epidemio- 
logical rates of ASD range from 1 % (Fombonne, 2003) to 
6 % (Newschaff er et al., 2007). Psychiatric comorbidities 
are frequent in children with ASD (Simonoff et al., 2008), 
but gaming disorder (GD) as a new ASD comorbidity and 
the impact of ASD on computer-mediated communication 
(CMC) have not been studied in detail. 
Social and verbal activities appear to lead to a reduction 
of the social impairments (Orsmond & Kuo, 2011), high- 
lighting the importance of the type of leisure time. Leisure

Abstract: Background: This study investigates how children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) make use of computer gam- 
ing and computer-mediated communication (CMC) in comparison to their nonautistic peers. Method: Parents ﬁ lled out a standardized ques- 
tionnaire on media use, gaming disorder (GD), and CMC. Sixty-two boys with a diagnosis of ASD aged 4 to 17 years (mean = 11.5; SD = 3.2) were 
compared to 31 healthy control boys (mean = 11.5; SD = 3.7). Results: Children and adolescents with ASD used CMC less frequently than their 
nonautistic peers but played video games for longer times than the controls. They preferred playing alone rather than in company of others and 
less frequently in multiplayer mode. Levels of GD symptoms were higher in boys with ASD. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with ASD 
seem to be an especially vulnerable subpopulation for GD. For them, the gaming situation (alone and in single-player mode) and CMC behavior 
seem to correspond to social patterns in real life. Our ﬁ ndings also provide support for the inclusion of ofﬂ ine gaming in the GD deﬁ nition. 

Zusammenfassung: Fragestellung: Die Studie untersucht, wie Kinder und Jugendliche mit Autismus-Spektrum-Störung (ASS) im Vergleich zu 
ihren nichtautistischen Altersgenossen Computerspiele und Internetbasierte Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten (IBK) nutzen. Methodik: Die El- 
tern füllten einen standardisierten Fragebogen über Mediennutzung, Computerspielabhängigkeit und IBK aus. 62 Jungen mit der Diagnose ASS 
im Alter von 4 bis 17 Jahren (Mittelwert = 11.5; SD = 3.2) wurden mit 31 unbeeinträchtigten Jungen als Kontrollgruppe (Mittelwert = 11.5; SD = 
3.7) verglichen. Ergebnisse: Kinder und Jugendliche mit ASS benutzten IBK weniger häuﬁ g und spielten Computerspiele länger als die Kinder in 
der Kontrollgruppe. Bei gegebener Diagnose ASS spielten sie eher allein, nicht in Gesellschaft anderer und seltener im Mehrspielermodus. Das 
Niveau der Computerspielabhängigkeit war bei Jungen mit ASS höher. Schlussfolgerung: Kinder und Jugendliche mit ASS scheinen eine beson- 
ders gefährdete Gruppe für die Entwicklung einer Computerspielabhängigkeit zu sein. Die Spielsituation (allein und im Einzelspieler-Modus) 
und das IBK-Verhalten entspricht den sozialen Mustern im realen Leben. Unsere Ergebnisse unterstützen auch den Einbezug von Ofﬂ ine- 
Spielen in die Deﬁ nition von Computerspielabhängigkeit.

time as well as educational and working environments are 
increasingly being infl uenced by new mass media, includ- 
ing computers, video games, the internet, smartphones, 
and social media. Electronic screen media could facilitate 
the perception and understanding of individuals with ASD 
thus appealing to them particularly (Mineo, Ziegler, Gill, & 
Salkin, 2009). 
In addition, the use of CMC is especially important re- 
garding autistic core symptoms (e. g., Thurlow, Lengel, & 
Tomic, 2004). CMC can be defi ned as the use of elec- 
tronic devices for communication purposes; examples in- 
clude emails, text messaging, social networks like Face- 
book or Instagram, and instant messengers like WhatsApp 
or Skype. There are limited empirical data available on 
CMC use and social adaptation in real life (Mikami, 
Swedo, Allen, Evans, & Hare, 2010) and their implica- 
tions for individuals with ASD. On the one hand, based on 
the social compensation hypothesis (Valkenburg & Peter, 
2007), they are drawn to CMC because it allows inter- 
actions from a safe distance with higher control and 
with fewer contextual, auditory, and visual distractions 
(Finkenauer, Pollmann, Begeer, & Kerkhof, 2012). Fur- 
ther, typical autistic problems of face-to-face communica- 
tion are reduced (Mazurek, 2013; Van Schalkwyk et al., 
2017), such as the recognition of facial expressions (Rump, 
Giovannelli, Minshew, & Strauss, 2009) and defi cits in 
verbal and nonverbal communication (Tager-Flusberg, 
Paul, & Lord, 2003). The opposing rich-get-richer hypoth- 
esis (Valkenburg & Peter, 2007) suggests that young peo- 
ple display a cross-situational continuity of social interac- 
tion which transfers to CMC. Thus, the socially competent 
use CMC to extend social networks, whereas those with 
communicational diffi culties in real life also have diffi cul- 
ties with CMC (virtually “poor-get-poorer”). Preliminary 
empirical studies support the latter theory, showing be- 
low-average CMC usage times for individuals with ASD 
(Mazurek et al., 2012; Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2013). 
Another important aspect of new mass media is video 
gaming. Video games encompass a wide range of diff erent 
genres (e. g., action, adventure, role-playing, strategy) for 
various electronic devices in diff erent social settings (e. g., 
online, offl ine, alone, or with others). Video gaming could 
be especially rewarding for autistic youth (Mazurek & Wen- 
strup, 2013), as they have enhanced general visual abilities 
(Mottron, Dawson, Soulières, Hubert, & Burack, 2006). 
Because of their extraordinary attention to details and their 
visual abilities (O’Riordan & Plaisted, 2001), individuals 
with ASD are exceptionally adept at video games that re- 
quire fast visual scanning for stimuli in a complex environ- 
ment, such as in shooter or construction games (Ors- 
mond & Kuo, 2011). Studies have shown that young people 
with ASD use video games excessively (Liu et al., 2017; 
Mazurek & Engelhard, 2013a; Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2013). 
Video games can also have positive potentials (Green & 
Bavelier, 2006; Li & Atkins, 2004), such as creating new 
cognitive challenges and providing relaxation. They can be 
used in the treatment of persons with ASD (Bernard-Opitz, 
Sriram, & Nakhoda-Sapuan, 2001; Hetzroni & Tannous, 
2004). While electronic media do not lead to social isolation 
and addictive behavior in healthy young people (Lenhart et 
al., 2008; Olson, 2010; Olson, Kutner, & Warner, 2008), 
children and youth with ASD are at risk for social diffi culties 
and isolation (Bölte, 2009; Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2013). 
DSM-5 (American Psychological Association, 2013) in- 
troduced the concept of internet gaming disorder (IGD) 
and defi ned it as “the persistent and recurrent use of the 
internet in order to play games, that leads to clinically sig- 
nifi cant impairment.” Diagnostic criteria further encom- 
pass fi ve of nine symptoms, for example, an exceeding pre- 
occupation with the games, increasing time spent gaming 
before feeling satisfi ed, withdrawal symptoms, risks to- 
ward relationships, job or education, and others. The Beta 
Draft of the WHO ICD-11(International Classifi cation of 
Diseases, 11th revision) proposes the diagnostic category of 
gaming disorder (GD) (WHO, 2018), including persistent 
online and offl ine gaming patterns with impaired control 
over gaming, increasing priority of gaming and the con- 
tinuation of gaming despite negative consequences. 
Instruments to measure GD are lacking or of low quality 
(King, Haagsma, Delfabbro, Gradisar, & Griffi ths, 2013; 
Petry et al., 2014) and cannot provide accurate prevalence 
rates for GD (King et al., 2013). 
The etiology of video gaming and internet addiction is 
“complex and multicausal,” including classical and operant 
conditioning as well as neurobiological processes (Koepp et. 
al., 1998; Vousooghi, Zeinolabedin, Sadat-Shirazi, Eghba- 
li, & Zarrindast, 2015; Weinstein & Lejoyeux, 2015). Psy- 
chosocial risks encompass male sex, impulsiveness, low so- 
cial skills, loneliness, and an increased amount of time 
spent gaming (Chen, Chen, & Gau, 2015; Gentile et al., 
2011; Lemmens, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2011; Paulus, Ohm- 
ann, von Gontard, & Popow, 2018), as well as attentional 
diffi culties and hyperactivity (Bioulac, Arfi , & Bouvard, 
2008; Carli et al., 2013; Gentile, 2009; Paulus et al., 2018) 
and online role-playing, shooter, action-adventure and 
strategy video games (Elliott, Golub, Ream, & Dunlap, 
2012; Rehbein, Kleimann, & Mößle, 2010). 
Children and youth with ASD are at special risk for GD 
symptoms (Liu et al., 2017; Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2013; Ma- 
zurek & Engelhardt, 2013a, So et al., 2017) with a higher 
rate of males (Fombonne, 2003), increased playing times 
(Mazurek & Wenstrup, 2013; Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013a) 
and preference of video games with increased addictive 
qualities (Elliot et al., 2012; Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013a; 
Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013b; Rehbein et al., 2010). In ad- 
dition, decreased social skills (Gentile et al., 2011; Lem- 


. W. Paulus et al., Gaming Disorder and Computer-Mediated Communication in ASD 
F 

mens et al., 2011; Mazurek & Engelhardt, 2013a), certain 
qualities of screen-based media (Mineo et al., 2009; Ma- 
zurek & Wenstrup, 2013), and internet addiction are further 
risks (Finkenauer et al., 2012; Romano, Truzoli, Osborne, & 
Reed, 2014). Previous studies found that young patients 
with ASD spend less time with CMC and more with gaming, 
mirroring their social diffi culties in their gaming behavior 
(Mazurek et al., 2012; Mazurek & Engelhard, 2013a; Ma- 
zurek & Wenstrup, 2013). However, replications of these 
fi 
 ndings with controls and with standardized assessment 
tools are outstanding. 
Therefore, this study investigates the associations be- 
tween ASD, CMC, and video gaming in young patients 
with ASD and in a control group. We hypothesized the fol- 
lowing concerning video gaming: 
1. Patients with ASD prefer to play alone rather than in 
company of others and to play less frequently in multi- 
player mode. 




Concerning CMC, there were two main hypotheses: 
1. ASD patients spend less time using CMC and use it less 



Participation in the study was voluntary, and there was no 
fi 
 nancial compensation. All participants and their parents 
gave informed consent. The local ethics committee ap- 
proved the study. Participants with ASD were recruited at 
two locations in Southwest Germany: at the specialized 
outpatient clinic for autistic disorders at a tertiary univer- 
sity hospital for child and adolescent psychiatry and at a 
center for autism therapy (ATZ Saar). 
All patients with confi rmed ASD diagnoses, aged be- 
tween 4 years and 17 years and 11 months attending the 
outpatient clinic and the center from January to July 2015 
who were willing to participate were included in the sam- 
ple (N = 68, 62 boys, 6 girls). 
Data of 85 controls was collected via word-of-mouth re- 
cruitment as well as in several sports clubs. Eighteen con- 
trol children had to be excluded because of missing data (1 
case), because the child was too young (1 case), and be- 
cause of total scores below 1 on the CBCL/4-18 (Achen- 
bach, 1991; Arbeitsgruppe Deutsche Child Behavior 
Checklist, 1998; Döpfner, Plück, & Kinnen, 2014), suggest- 
ing unclear statements (16 cases). Because of large diff er- 
ences in the gender distribution between the ASD and con- 
trol group, it was decided to only include male participants. 
Thus, 31 (33.3 %) control boys without a documented psy- 
chiatric diagnosis, mean age 11.5 years (SD = 3.7, range 4 to 
17.8 years), and 62 (66.7 %) boys with a confi rmed autistic 
diagnosis, mean age 12 years (SD = 3.2, range 4.5 to 17.7 
years) took part in the study. The two groups did not diff er 
in age. The fi nal total sample consisted of N = 93 boys. 
A notable diff erence, however, was found in the type of 
school: Whereas most control boys attended elementary 
(35.5 %, n = 11) or secondary schools (46.5 %, n = 15), boys 
with ASD most likely attended special schools (29 %, n = 
18). The mean intelligence score of the ASD group, as re- 
ported by the parents, was in the average range with 87.6 
(SD = 23.8), ranging from 50 to 143, although comparabili- 
ty of the scores is limited: Because of the large age range, 
the scores stem from several diff erent intelligence tests. 
22 % (n = 14) of the boys had a reported IQ below 70 and 
14 % (n = 9) had a reported IQ above 114. Approximately 
one-third of the ASD boys were taking one or more medi- 
cations, with methylphenidate being the most frequently 
used substance (18 %, n = 11), followed by melatonin (6 %, 
n = 4), amphetamine (5 %, n = 3), atomoxetine (3 %, n = 2), 
pipamperone (3 %, n = 2), and aripiprazole (1 %, n = 1). 61 % 
of the autistic boys had two or more comorbid diagnoses, 
most frequently developmental disorders (language disor- 
ders, motor disorders, specifi c learning disorders) and at- 
tention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Parents of all participants were given general informa- 
tion regarding the study and two questionnaires to fi ll in. 
Video game and CMC use as well as GD symptoms (online 
and offl ine gaming) were assessed with a parent question- 
naire specifi cally compiled for this study, based on a ques- 
tionnaire developed for a former study (Paulus, Sinzig, 
Mayer, Weber, & von Gontard, 2018). To the knowledge of 
the authors, no established questionnaire met the specifi c 
requirements of this study (suffi cient psychometric evalu- 
ation, parents as informants, age range of 4 to 17 years, 
and German language). 
The questionnaire comprised four sections. The fi rst 
part covered basic information about the child or adoles- 
cent. Parents of ASD patients additionally answered ques- 
tions concerning the primary diagnosis, comorbid disor- 
ders, and the IQ of their sons. The second part, labeled 
“video game use,” started with an introductory defi nition 
of the study’s concept of video games. This was followed by 
items relating to the number and types of devices owned by 
or being accessible to the child and the frequency as well as 
usage time of video gaming. Usage time was assessed by 
single choice question (0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2 h, 5 h, 7 h, 
more than 7 h) as well as by an open-ended question (free 
format indication: hours/minutes). Additionally, there 
were questions about social aspects of video gaming (play- 



. W. Paulus et al., Gaming Disorder and Computer-Mediated Communication in ASD 
F 
ing in multiplayer mode, by oneself or with others, online 
or offl ine). The third section (Table 1), labeled “video gam- 
ing behavior,” assessed the degree of GD symptoms. 
The 16 items were composed in accordance with the 
symptom criteria of the internet gaming disorder of 
DSM-5, with supplementary items on sleeping and eating 
behavior. They were rated on a 4-point scale ranging 
from 0 (never) to 3 (always). A total score and mean values 
were calculated by adding up the 16 items. Missing items 
were replaced by mean values. Reliability was high with 
Cronbach’s α = .93. As confi rmed by a reliability analysis, 
total reliability did not increase by eliminating any of the 
16 items. Additionally, discriminatory power analyses en- 
sured a value of r > .3 for every item. Thus, all 16 items 
remained in the scale for the calculations. Because a suf- 
fi 
 cient psychometric evaluation is still lacking, no cut-off 
value could be set to determine pathological cases of 
gaming disorder. 
Patterns of CMC use were determined in the fourth and 
last section of the questionnaire. If the answer to the fi rst 
item concerning whether the child has online access to 
CMC was answered with “no,” parents could directly con- 
tinue with the next questionnaire. If the answer was “yes,” 
six more items followed, relating to frequency and dura- 
tion of media usage and the three most frequently used 
applications. 
To increase the external validity of autism spectrum di- 
agnoses and to validate the control group, we used all 11 
syndrome scales of the Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL/4- 
18, (Achenbach, 1991; Arbeitsgruppe Deutsche Child Be- 
havior Checklist, 1998; Döpfner et al., 2014). All paramet- 
ric and nonparametric data analyses (t-tests, Mann 
Whitney U-tests, chi-square tests) were conducted with 
the IBM SPSS Statistics program, version 23. 


Boys with ASD scored signifi cantly higher in all CBCL 
scales than the controls (Table 2). They scored highest on 
“social problems,” “thought problems,” and “attention

problems,” which agrees with the typical CBCL profi le of 
children with ASD (Bölte, Dickhut, & Poustka, 1999). A 
detailed analysis of the control group’s CBCL syndrome 
scales’ outliers showed no ASD typical profi les, validating 
the group membership. 
half of the control boys owned a smartphone, χ²(1) = 6.09, 
p = .014 (Figure 2). Again, more ASD boys possessed an- 
other kind of mobile phone, χ²(1) = 5.589, p = .018. 


More than two thirds of the ASD boys had access to a com- 
puter or a home video game console, and about half of 
them had access to a handheld video game console, a tab- 
let computer, and a smartphone (Figure 1). Overall, more 
ASD boys had access to technical devices than the control 
group, although the diff erences mostly didn´t reach statis- 
tical signifi cance (see Figure 1). A notable exception was 
the access to smartphones: The proportion of the control 
boys with access to a smartphone was about 20 % higher, 
though this diff erence also failed to reach statistical signifi - 
cance (χ²(1) = 2.61; ns). In return, the proportion of ASD 
boys who had access to another kind of mobile phone (not 
web-enabled) was signifi cantly larger, χ²(1) = 5.66, p = .017 
(Figure 1). ASD boys also had signifi cantly greater access 
to a children’s computer for educational purposes, χ²(1) = 
3.875, p = .049 (Figure 1). 
The number of media devices owned by the children was 
largely comparable between groups (Figure 2). But here the 
diff erence concerning the possession of smartphones was 
statistically signifi cant: Only a quarter of the ASD boys but 
About two-thirds of the ASD boys (65.5 %, n = 36) and the 
controls (65.5 %, n = 19) usually played video games offl ine. 
About one-tenth (11 %) of the ASD boys and one-quarter 
(24 %) of the controls reported using video games usually 
online. There were similarly considerable diff erences be- 
tween the groups: 84 % of ASD boys usually played by 
themselves, but only 66 % of the controls. Subsequently, 
frequencies of playing in the company of parents, siblings, 
and friends were all lower for the ASD boys than for the 
control group. The biggest diff erence emerged in the fre- 
quency of playing usually in the company of friends (ASD 
boys: 24 %, controls: 48 %). ASD boys (n = 54, mean rank = 
38.67, Mdn = 0.0) were also less likely than the control 
group (n = 29, mean rank = 46.67, Mdn = 0.0) to play video 
games in multiplayer mode, Mann-Whitney U = 618.5, z = 
–1.75, p = .044, r = –.19, 1-β = .54. Furthermore, a chi-square 
test revealed a signifi cant interaction between group and 
playing video games alone or in company of others, χ²(1) = 
7.35, p = .006. ASD boys were 4.29 times more likely (OR) 
to play video games on their own (Hypothesis 1). 
As expected, the mean daily video gaming time of ASD 
boys (85 min, SD = 11.4) was signifi cantly higher than that

sche Child Behavior Checklist, 1998).

favorite games of the control boys. 
There was a nonsignifi cant diff erence between groups 
in the frequency of video gaming, Mann-Whitney U = 
878.0, p = ns, r = –.07. Power was very low with 1-β = .17 
(Hypothesis 2). 
Lastly, as hypothesized, ASD boys (M = 0.71, SD = 0.62) 
were revealed to have comparably higher rates of GD 
symptoms than the control boys (M = 0.38, SD = 0.30), 
t(90) = –3.52, p < .001, d = .62) (Hypothesis 3). 
In an open-ended format parents reported the three 
most commonly played video games. Minecraft was re- 
ported most often as the favorite video game for ASD boys 
(18.5 %, n = 10), followed by racing games (9.3 %). Mi- 
necraft also was the most often reported favorite game in 
20 % of the the controls, although the football game FIFA 

Boys with no access to CMC were excluded for subse- 
quent analyses, 79 % (n = 49) of ASD boys and all control 
boys used CMC at least sometimes. As expected, ASD 
boys (n = 30, mean rank = 18.41, Mdn = 2.5) used CMC 
signifi cantly less frequently than the controls (n = 15, 
mean rank = 28.7, Mdn = 4.0), Mann-Whitney U = 109.5, 
p = .003, r = –.41). Interestingly, as can be seen in Table 3, 
a considerable number of ASD boys (21 %) did not use 
CMC at all despite its potential accessibility (Figure 1). In 
the open-ended answering format, boys with ASD used

CMC on average for 29 minutes/day and controls for 
51 minutes/day, but the diff erence did not reach statistical 
signifi cance, probably because of low power, t(38) = 1.22, 
p = .12., d = –.4 (Hypothesis 4). 
In an open-ended format parents reported the three 
most commonly used CMC applications. The instant mes- 
sengers WhatsApp (65 %) and Skype as well as the web- 
page Youtube (both 20 %) were the most frequently used 
applications by ASD boys. Controls showed a similar pat- 
tern of preferred programs with one exception: Youtube 
was not the most frequently used program for any of them 
(Hypothesis 5). 

The results suggest that children and adolescents with 
ASD (at least boys) diff er from their nonautistic peers in 
specifi c patterns of media use as well as the severity of GD 
symptoms. 

A reduced accessibility to and possession of a smartphone 
in ASD boys was the most intriguing fi nding in the descrip- 
tive analysis. One possible explanation might be that ASD 
children have less interest in smartphones and thus do not 
ask their parents to buy them one because of their lack of 
concern about the social status associated with a smart- 
phone. Because social recognition and standing are less 
important to ASD patients (Izuma, Matsumoto, Camer- 
er, & Adolps, 2011), they might be satisfi ed with a less ex- 
pensive, less technically and visually sophisticated mobile 
phone. This would explain the higher number of ASD pa- 
tients using another kind of mobile phone. The use of 
smartphones in individuals with ASD could be an interest- 
ing topic for future research. 

As hypothesized, the autistic boys played video games for 
longer periods of time (85 min vs. 51 min). This fi nding 
successfully replicates data of US studies by Mazurek and 
colleagues (Mazurek & Engelhard, 2013a; Mazurek & 
Wenstrup, 2013) as well as Asian studies (Liu et al., 2017; 
So et al., 2017). However, contrary to our hypotheses, 
there was no signifi cant diff erence in the frequency of 
gaming. This, again, might be explained by the small 
sample size. It could also indicate that boys with ASD 
don’t necessarily play more often, yet if they do play, they 
continue to do so for longer times than their peers. Video 
games may be of such great appeal to boys with ASD that 
it is even harder for them to stop playing. Fittingly, the 
data in this study supports the preexisting evidence of a 
heightened level of GD symptoms in ASD boys compared 
to controls. Again, US data by Mazurek and colleagues 
were replicated in Germany, even though we used a dif- 
ferent measurement procedure. Young patients with ASD 
do in fact seem to be an especially vulnerable subpopula- 
tion for GD. 
On the other hand, computer gaming symptoms in indi- 
viduals with ASD can be diffi cult to isolate from restricted 
interests and repetitive behaviors, which are common in 
persons diagnosed with ASD (e. g., Mazurek et al., 2012). If 
computer gaming occurs as part of an addictive disorder, it 
is a pathological symptom; but if computer gaming is a re- 
strictive interest of an individual with ASD, it should not 
automatically be considered pathological. This distinction 
has vital implications for therapy: If an individual with 
ASD has developed a GD, it should be treated as comorbid 
diagnosis. But if the gaming activity is a restricted interest,

it might be a useful aspect to implement into the therapy of 
the autistic core symptoms (Winter-Messiers, 2007). 
Furthermore, our fi ndings suggest diff erences concern- 
ing the social aspects of video gaming. Boys with ASD 
were shown to play video games signifi cantly less often in 
multiplayer mode and were more likely to play them exclu- 
sively by themselves. As with CMC, social patterns in real 
life seem to be refl ected in the gaming situation. Whilst 
several social aspects play a crucial role when typically de- 
veloped children play video games (Lenhart et al., 2008; 
Olson, 2010; Olson, Kutner, & Warner, 2008), ASD boys 
are apparently less able to use the opportunities for social 
interaction that video games can off er. 
With regard to the ongoing scientifi c debate on the clas- 
sifi cation and nosology of a possible IGD versus GD, it 
could be argued that the fi ndings in this study provide sup- 
port for the inclusion of offl ine gaming (and not only online 
gaming) in the defi nition: Young patients with ASD exhib- 
ited addictive patterns of gaming that in a way were more 
“isolated” (less multiplayer mode, more gaming exclusive- 
ly on their own, less use of CMC). The DSM-5 defi nition of 
IGD includes only online gaming and would thus probably 
not allow for a diagnosis in many cases of patients from the 
autistic spectrum. Another group of patients whose addic- 
tive gaming behavior might also be diffi cult to describe 
with the DSM-5 IDG criteria are preschool children (Pau- 
lus, Sinzig, Mayer, Weber, & von Gontard, 2018). 

Regarding CMC, we identifi ed a signifi cant diff erence in 
use patterns between boys with and without ASD. As ex- 
pected, autistic boys used CMC less frequently, supporting 
the rich-get-richer hypothesis. These fi ndings agree with 
the preliminary fi ndings by Mazurek and Wenstrup (2013), 
enabling further generalization because of our independ- 
ent control group. It appears that children and youth with 
social defi cits use the internet less than their socially more 
competent peers to communicate. The assumption of a 
cross-situational continuity of individual communication- 
al features apparently applies to the internet as well. In our 
study, there was a notable diff erence between usage times 
of CMC (29 vs. 51 min), which probably didn´t reach sta- 
tistical signifi cance due to low power and the small sample 
size. But there might also be another explanation: More 
than one-fi fth of the ASD boys who had access to CMC 
devices and apps never used CMC, and one-fourth used it 
less than once a week. Taken together, these fi ndings could 
mean that a subgroup of ASD boys hardly uses CMC at all, 
whereas another subgroup uses CMC even longer than so- 
cially competent boys. The social compensation hypothe- 
sis may apply to this latter group, in that they recognize 
and make use of the potential inherent in this form of com- 
munication to improve their social skills. Nonclinical stud- 
ies show CMC to lead to an increase in social integration 
(Kraut et al., 2002) and a decrease in loneliness and de- 
pression (Shaw & Gant, 2002). Such an ASD subgroup and 
positive eff ects of CMC need to be investigated further. 
The identifi cation of this subgroup could help to develop 
therapeutic approaches for social skills in children and ad- 
olescents with ASD. 

A major strength of this study is that it investigates two 
large and relevant fi elds of new mass media and their 
meaning in the daily life of autistic children and adoles- 
cents. To our knowledge, this study is the fi rst to investi- 
gate the association between children and adolescents 
with ASD from 4 to 17 years of age with CMC and GD 
compared to an independent control group. It also repli- 
cates fi ndings of American studies in a German sample 
with diff erent measurements, thus enabling a broader the- 
oretical generalization. GD symptoms were determined 
using a questionnaire that covers all nine DSM-5 dimen- 
sions of IGD. Ecological validity of our fi ndings is high, 
given the quasiexperimental design of the study. 
One major limit is the cross-sectional design of this 
study, so that no causal associations can be identifi ed. Fur- 
ther limitations are the partially low power, and that only 
parent reports were used for most information. Because of 
the recruitment process, the intelligence scores of the con- 
trol boys were not assessed, but in light of the types of 
school they attended, intelligence can be expected to be 
normally distributed. Also, the questionnaire on computer 
and internet use has not been psychometrically evaluated 
and normed. Lastly, because of lacking data, only boys 
were included for the investigations, which reduces gener- 
alizability of the fi ndings to girls. 
In summary, young male patients with ASD used CMC 
less frequently than their peers. They played video games 
for longer times, played alone rather than in company of 
others, and played less frequently in multiplayer mode. 
Levels of GD symptoms were higher in boys with ASD, 
which makes patients with ASD very likely to be a specifi - 
cally vulnerable population for GD. The gaming situation 
(without company and in single-player mode) as well as 
the CMC behavior seem to mirror real-life social patterns. 
Some of the exact characteristics that make a person 
with ASD special can be of help not only to IT companies 
but perhaps also to those with ASD themselves. It remains 
open whether the distinctive features of ASD youth re- 
garding the use of electronic media identifi ed in this study 
should be seen as a part of the pathology or whether they

in fact demonstrate how digital media can be of special 
benefi t to ASD patients. The success of training programs 
using computer technology, such as The Transporters (Go- 
lan et al., 2009), FEFA (Bölte et al., 2002) and Mind Read- 
ing (Golan & Baron-Cohen, 2006), supports the latter con- 
clusion. A very recent study by Sundberg (2018) even 
suggests that online games might help individuals with 
ASD to build and sustain friendships and feel less lonely.
