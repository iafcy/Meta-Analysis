Objective: Screen exposure has been shown to have negative effects on the psychological and physical 
development of children. The aim of this study was to investigate the screen exposure among the children 
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to compare it with healthy children. 
Method: The sample of our study consisted of 17 cases who were admitted to Bezmialem Vakıf University 
Hospital Pediatric and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic and diagnosed with ASD and 20 age and gender- 
matched healthy controls. Autism spectrum disorder was diagnosed via The Childhood Autism Rating scale. 
Screen exposure was investigated by a questionnaire developed by the researchers based on the relevant 
literature. 
Results: ASD and control group (C) did not differ in age (ASD=38.7±10.8 months, F=40.1±17.5 months; t=0.28, 
p=0.77) and gender (ASD 6/17 female, F=13/20 girls; χ2 =3.25; p=0.07). The average daily TV watching time 
of the ASD group (3.2±2.2 hours) was significantly higher than that of the C group (1.5±0.7 hours) (z=2.35, 
p=0.019). In addition, the ASD group (11.1±5.7 months) started to watch TV at a younger age than the C 
group (16.5±7.4 months) (z=2.18, p=0.029). When the other electronic media gadgets were examined, the 
children in both groups were found to use the phone at a high rate than tablets and computers. The average 
daily telephone time of the ASD group (1.9±1.7 hours) was higher than the C group (0.8±0.8 hours) (z=1.87, 
p=0.061). 
Conclusion: TV exposure of children with ASD was found to be earlier and higher; and studies with a larger 
sample are needed to clarify the role of this condition in the etiology.
