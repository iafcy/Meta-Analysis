factors, screen time in a group of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
and age and sex- matched clinical controls to evaluate risk factors specific to ASD. 
Methods: The study included 211 ASD patients (177 boys, 34 girls; mean age 
44.3 ± 13.0 months) and 241 (190 boys, 51 girls; mean age 44.6 ± 14.1 months) age and 
sex group matched clinical controls. Non- ASD diagnoses were expressive language 
disorder (n = 135, 56.0%), intellectual disability (n = 15, 6.2%), attention deficit- 
hyperactivity disorder (n = 6, 2.4%), oppositional disorder (n = 6, 2.4%), and other 
behavioral or emotional problems (no diagnosis; n = 79, 32.8%). A sociodemographic 
data form was used to collect data regarding pre- , peri- , and postnatal factors and 


depression during pregnancy, and maternal postpartum depression were more 
frequent in the ASD group (p = 0.005, p = 0.035, and p = 0.001 respectively). There 
was a statistically significant difference between groups with regards to maternal 
any medication use during pregnancy (p = 0.004). The mean duration of daily 
screen exposure was higher in the ASD group (9.90 ± 5.10 h) compared to non- ASD 
children (4.46 ± 3.40 h; p < 0.001). A ROC curve showed that 8.5 h and above total 
daily screen exposure (AUC = 0.808 [95% CI: 0.769– 0.848], p < 0.001; 55% sensitivity, 
90.5% specificity) is likely to be associated with increased risk for ASD.

autism, perinatal, postnatal, prenatal, screen exposure 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmen- 
tal disorder characterized by deficits in social commu- 
nication and interactions, stereotypic behaviors, and 
restricted interests beginning in early childhood.1 ASD 
is the leading cause of disability in children under 5 years 
of age and accounted for 7.7 million disability adjusted 
life years in 2010.2 The global prevalence estimate of 
ASD has increased from 0.6% to 1%– 2% since 2012, de- 
spite being highly variable across different sites of the 
world.3– 6

Although no clear pathogenesis has so far been iden- 
tified, a substantial body of evidence has revealed that 
both genetic and environmental factors interact in the 
etiology of ASD. A metanalysis of twin studies suggests 
a heritability estimate of 64%– 91%.7 Genetic factors 
include copy number variations, point mutations, and 
translocations involved in neurodevelopment, neural 
communication, and social interaction. DNA methyl- 
ation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA are 
among the epigenetic factors suggested to have an im- 
portant role in the pathogenesis of ASD.8 
To date, a few meta- analyses on pre- , peri- and post- 
natal environmental risk factors associated with ASD 
have been conducted using both different and overlap- 
ping data.9– 13 Kolevzon et al.10 included seven studies 
in their meta- analysis, of those four were prospective, 
population- based cohort studies, and the others were 
retrospective. The authors suggested that advanced 
parental age, maternal birthplace outside of North 
America and Europe, low birthweight, preterm deliv- 
ery, and intrapartum hypoxia were potential risk factors 
for autism. Gardener et al. conducted a meta- analysis 
of studies through March 2007 performing less strict 
inclusion criteria. Results have been published in two 
different articles.12,13 Associated prenatal risk factors 
were advanced parental age at birth, maternal prenatal 
medication use, bleeding, gestational diabetes, being 
first born versus third or later, and having a mother 
born abroad.12 Peri- and neonatal risk factors associated 
with increased risk of autism were cesarean delivery, 
abnormal presentation, umbilical- cord complications, 
fetal distress, birth injury or trauma, multiple birth, 
maternal hemorrhage, summer birth, low birthweight, 
small for gestational age, congenital malformation, low 
5- min Apgar score, feeding difficulties, meconium as- 
piration, neonatal anemia, ABO or Rh incompatibility, 
and hyperbilirubinemia.13 Guinchat et al.11 performed a 
meta- analysis of 85 case– control and population- based 
studies. The authors incorporated the results with re- 
gard to pregnancy risk factors provided by Gardener 
et al.12 into their review with the addition of data from 
articles later published. Bleeding and maternal medi- 
cation use but not gestational diabetes were confirmed 
as ASD related risk factors after the inclusion of recent 
data.11 Peri- and postnatal risk factors which emerged 
in the meta- analysis by Guinchat et al.11 were generally 
consistent with the review by Gardener et al.13 The most 
recent of these meta- analyses published by Wang et al.9 
pooled data from 12 case control and five cohort studies 
and favored advanced parental age, parental race: White 
and Asian, gestational hypertension, gestational diabe- 
tes, maternal and paternal education college graduate+, 
threatened abortion, antepartum hemorrhage, prenatal 
infections, maternal autoimmune disease as prenatal 
risk factors; preterm birth, cesarean delivery, gestation 
age ≤36 weeks, spontaneous labor, induced labor, no 
labor, breech presentation, preeclampsia, fetal distress 
as perinatal risk factors; low birthweight, postpartum 
hemorrhage, male gender, and brain anomaly as postna- 
tal risk factors related to ASD. When a subgroup analy- 
sis based on inclusion criteria was performed, low Apgar 
score was identified as a risk factor in the studies using 
DSM − 4/5. Mother's country of birth outside Europe or 
North America was not confirmed as a risk factor for 
ASD by Wang et al.9 
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention re- 
ported 2.5 times increase in the prevalence estimate of 
ASD from 2000 to 2014 in USA.5 It has not yet been 
clarified whether this could be attributable to changes 
in diagnostic criteria, better diagnostic tools, better 
identification and screening methods, younger age at 
diagnosis, inclusion of milder cases, and increased pub- 
lic and clinician's awareness or there is a true increase in 
the risk of ASD.14– 16 Albeit controversial, the increase 
in the prevalence of ASD redirects researchers' atten- 
tion to environmental factors. Among those, excess 
screen time is a growing concern amongst clinicians 
since it is known to have negative effects on early learn- 
ing and development. A number of studies have shown 
that children and adolescents with ASD are exposed to 
more screen time than their typically developing peers 
or other clinical groups and that the exposure starts at 
a younger age.17 Therefore, in this study we aimed to 
investigate pre- , peri- , and postnatal factors, and screen 
time in a group of patients with ASD and age and sex 
matched clinical controls to evaluate the risk factors 
specific to ASD. 


This study involved 211 ASD patients with ages ranging 
from 2 to 6 years old and 241 age and sex group matched 
clinical controls admitted to Bakirkoy Research and 
Training Hospital for Mental Health and Neurological 
Disorders, Istanbul, Turkey, Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry Department between April and December 
2018. An ASD diagnosis was made using DSM- 5 criteria1 
and confirmed by child psychiatrists with at least 5 years 
of experience. The assessment was based on clinical in- 
terview with the parents, direct examination of the child 
and the evaluation of global development of the child by 
standardized instruments for the age group. To eliminate 
possible recalling problems study included only patients 
who were diagnosed within the last 6 months and aged 
between 2 and 6. Children under the age of 2 were not 
included to avoid misdiagnosis. Exclusion criteria for the 
study and the control group were having a visual or hear- 
ing impairment, and any genetic or neurological disorder 
(children with epileptic disorders were included). 

 
 


A sociodemographic data form was created by the au- 
thors to collect data. The data form was comprised of 
questions with regard to parental factors including 
maternal and paternal age, maternal and paternal ed- 
ucation, maternal and paternal lifetime psychiatric diag- 
nosis; prenatal factors such as risk of miscarriage, birth 
order (first vs. later born), maternal hypertension, gesta- 
tional diabetes, maternal thyroid dysfunction, maternal 
depression, severe psychological stress, maternal medica- 
tion use, and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, peri- 
and postnatal factors such as any problem in the delivery, 
gestational age, birthweight, incubator need or intensive 
care unit treatment, neonatal jaundice, phototherapy 
need for neonatal jaundice, epileptic seizure of the child, 
maternal postpartum depression, frequent change in the 
caretaker (more than 3 caretakers in the first 2 years), and 
daily total screen time (ST). ST refers to time spent on 
visual screen- based technologies including televisions, 
computers/tablets, smart phones, and gaming devices. 
Both active and passive screen exposure (e.g., back- 
ground TV watching) were calculated by asking parents 
how many hours a day their child was exposed to screen. 
The data form was completed by the researchers via 
directing question to the parents during the clinical 
interviews. 

The study protocol has been approved by the Medical 
Ethics Committee of the Bakirkoy Training and 
Research Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurological 
Disorders. The procedures followed in this study were in 
accordance with the ethical standards of the medical eth- 
ics committee and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, 
as revised in 2000.18 An informed consent was obtained 
from the parents prior to participation in the study. 

Descriptive statistics were calculated using the Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS) 
program, version 17. Demographic data are reported as 
mean ± standard deviation, median (range), number, and 
percentage. Univariate analysis was performed for de- 
mographic and clinical characteristics of the patients to 
predict our groups using student- T test, Chi- square test, 
or Fisher's exact test as appropriate for individual vari- 
ables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Analysis of the discriminatory ability of two groups were 
performed using the C statistic comparison with receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The best cutoff 

value for the daily screen time was derived, having maxi- 
mum accuracy and minimal weighted error. 

In total, 452 children aged 2 to 6 were included in the 
study. A total of 211 children (177 boys, 34 girls; mean 
age 44.3 ± 13.0 months) were diagnosed with ASD and 
241 (190 boys, 51 girls; mean age 44.6 ± 14.1 months) 
were non- ASD children. Non- ASD diagnoses were ex- 
pressive language disorder (n = 135, 56.0%), intellectual 
disability (n = 15, 6.2%), attention deficit- hyperactivity 
disorder (n = 6, 2.4%), oppositional disorder (n = 6, 2.4%), 
and other behavioral or emotional problems (no diagno- 
sis; n = 79, 32.8%). There was no significant difference 
between ASD and non- ASD group with regards to age 
(p = 0.587) and sex (p = 0.186). 
Comparison of parental characteristics between ASD 
and non- ASD groups is shown in Table 1. Comparisons 
of ASD and Non- ASD groups regarding prenatal factors 
and peri- postnatal factors are shown in Tables 2 and 3, 
respectively. Maternal severe psychological stress and 
depression during pregnancy, and maternal postpar- 
tum depression were more frequent in the ASD group 
(p = 0.005, p = 0.035, and p = 0.001, respectively). There 
was a statistically significant difference between groups 
with regards to maternal any medication use during 
pregnancy (p = 0.004). 
A statistically significant difference was found be- 
tween ASD and Non- ASD groups concerning total daily 
screen time. The mean duration of daily screen exposure 
(9.90 ± 5.10 h) was higher in the ASD group compared 
to non- ASD children, of those mean total daily screen 
exposure was 4.46 ± 3.40 h (p < 0.001). Receiver operat- 
ing curve (ROC) showed that 8.5 h and above total daily 
screen exposure (AUC = 0.808 [95% CI: 0.769– 0.848],

be associated with increased risk for ASD in the child 
(Figure 1). 

In this study we aimed to identify pre- , peri- , and post- 
natal environmental factors, and screen time in a group 
of children with ASD and age matched clinical controls. 
According to our findings, maternal prenatal depres- 
sion, severe psychological stress, and maternal medi- 
cation use during pregnancy, maternal postpartum 
depression, and excess screen time were risk factors as- 
sociated with ASD. According to the meta- analyses on 
pre- , peri- , and postnatal factors associated with ASD, 
factors consistently found to be related with ASD are 
advanced parental age, maternal prenatal medication 
use, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pre- 
term delivery, abnormal presentation, fetal distress, low 
birthweight, and low Apgar score.9– 13 
Evidence from animal and human studies suggest that 
prenatal stress interacts with genetics to increase the 
risk for neurodevelopmental disorders19,20 Accordingly, 
the results of our study show that maternal exposure to 
significant psychological stress during pregnancy, pre- 
natal and postpartum depression are associated with 
offspring ASD. In line with our findings, previous stud- 
ies employing natural disasters as a model for maternal 
stress exposure during pregnancy support the possi- 
bility of a link between prenatal stress and autism.21– 23 
Moreover, maternal history of childhood abuse,24 and 
fear of partner or sexual, emotional, or physical abuse in 
the 2 years before the birth year are reported to contrib- 
ute to the risk for ASD.25 In a Danish nationwide pop- 
ulation based cohort study, parental psychiatric history 
for affective disorders before or after birth was associ- 
ated with an independent risk of autism with a RR of 
2.91 (95% CI: 1.65, 5.14).26 Another large epidemiological 
study in Denmark refuted an association between ma- 
ternal bereavement and autism; however, an association 
was found before accounting for cofounders including 

 
 

particularly without intellectual disability; and suggested 
that the emerged link between prenatal antidepressant 
use and autism might not be a byproduct of confound- 
ing factors. The authors also mentioned that the absolute 
risk of autism was lower.33 Nevertheless, a recent epide- 
miological study from Canada proved against in utero 
serotonergic antidepressant exposure and ASDs.34 In 
the current study, any medication use during pregnancy 
was recorded without specifying subcategories, therefore 
we abstain from drawing any conclusions. However, our 
results might implicate a benefit in widening the focus 
of future research on the association between prenatal 
medication exposure and ASD risk. 
Technological developments impose a great change in 
our daily lives. In connection with this, concerns about 
the impact of screen- based technologies are increasing. 
There is a growing body of research suggesting a link 
between excessive exposure to screen and psychologi- 
cal outcomes particularly in children and adolescents.35 
For young children under 5 years of age, ST is associ- 
ated with poorer cognitive and language development, 
and impaired communication abilities.35– 39 Adverse 
connections between behavior problems, total difficul- 
ties, self- regulation, and prosocial behavior have also 
been shown.35 A review and metanalysis of 16 studies on 
relations between ST and autism reports that children 
and adolescents with ASD are exposed to more ST than 
their typically developing peers or other clinical groups 
and the exposure starts at a younger age.17 Accordingly, 
in this study, young children with ASD were reported 
being exposed to more ST compared to clinical controls 
including children with developmental delay in language 
and cognition, and behavioral problems. Moreover, a 
ROC curve analysis showed that screen exposure over 
8.5 h at a younger age is related to an increased risk of 
ASD. ST is hypothesized to associate ASD through dis- 
placement of activities that promote learning, such as 
imaginative play, with stimulus of no significant de- 
velopmental value, by limiting social interactions with 
friends and family members which are vital for devel- 
oping language, communication, and socioemotional 
skills, and by its impact on processing social and psy- 
chological situations that require adequate time and 
reflection due to rapid and parallel processing of infor- 
mation on electronic media.17 Despite all the abovemen- 
tioned cumulating evidence regarding the link between 
screen exposure and ASD, the direction of the relation- 
ship remains questionable, or a bidirectional link should 
be considered since recent research points that excessive 
media exposure is more likely in infants and toddlers 
with a difficult temperament, or self- regulation prob- 
lems or toddlers with social emotional delays possibly 
as a parent coping strategy.40– 43 Additionally, children 
with ASD may prefer screen media use over social and 
physical activities.17 
In this study we failed to prove associations between 
advanced parental age, gestational diabetes, gestational

analysis of daily total screen time 
maternal psychiatric conditions.27 A large Swedish reg- 
ister study reported that maternal bereavement stress in 
the third trimester of pregnancy, and during the second 
postnatal year increased the risk for ASD in offspring.28 
Prenatal maternal stress exposure is also shown to be a 
significant predictor of ASD- related symptom severity 
and communication abilities in children with ASD.29 
Studies examining the relationship between offspring 
autism and prenatal medication use primarily focus on 
anticonvulsive and psychotropic medications.11,12,30 A 
large systematic review and network meta- analysis ex- 
amined the effect of antiepileptic drugs on neurodevel- 
opment of children exposed in utero or during breast 
feeding. This network meta- analysis on autism includ- 
ing five cohort studies, 2551 children, 12 treatments evi- 
denced that oxcarbazepine (OR 13.51, CrI 1.28 to 221.40), 
valproate (OR 17.29, 95% CrI 2.40 to 217.60), lamotrigine 
(OR 8.88, CrI 1.28 to 112.00) and lamotrigine + valproate 
(OR 132.70, CrI 7.41 to 3851.00) were associated with a 
significantly greater risk of autism.31 Studies investigat- 
ing the links between prenatal antidepressant exposure 
and autism present inconsistent results. A recent meta- 
analysis on six case– control studies (117 737 patients), 
however, demonstrated a positive association between 
preconception and prenatal antidepressant exposure 
and ASDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% CI: 1.49– 2.20). The 
association weakened when controlled for past maternal 
mental illness (OR, 1.52; 95% CI: 1.09– 2.12) yet being sig- 
nificant.32 Results from a large observational prospec- 
tive cohort study from Sweden supported the association 
between prenatal antidepressant exposure and autism, 

 
 


hypertension, preterm birth, low birthweight and ASD 
despite substantial evidence provided in recent re- 
search.9– 13 We assume that the small sample size of this 
study accounts for the lack of related evidence. Moreover, 
the study sample was recruited from a tertiary mental 
health care center serving children and adolescents with 
parents from lower socioeconomic background and 
lower educational levels which might have resulted in rel- 
atively lower mean maternal and paternal age at birth, 
and therefore, a lack of findings supporting the associ- 
ation between advanced parental age and ASD. Larger 
epidemiological studies from Turkey might prove similar 
associations. 

There are two intriguing results of the current study. 
First, prenatal maternal psychological stress, prenatal 
and postpartum depression, and second, excess expo- 
sure to screen were more frequent in children with ASD 
compared to clinical controls including children with 
cognitive and language delay, and behavioral problems. 
However, there are certain limitations to the present 
study that should be taken into account. First, the study 
has a retrospective design relied on maternal report of 
pre- , peri- , and postnatal events. It is plausible to as- 
sume that mothers of children with ASD might be more 
likely to recall pre- , peri- , postnatal events compared 
to mothers of children presenting with other problems. 
In addition, the data might have been different if medi- 
cal records of the children and the mothers could have 
been obtained. Almost all above mentioned studies are 
based on parental reports or surveys that are inclined 
to reporter bias. Prospectively designed future research 
should collect data via clinical observations and verifi- 
able medical records. Moreover, despite many studies 
on the potential role of pre- and perinatal complications 
in the emergence of ASD, the casual direction of the re- 
lationship is to be argued.10 Additionally, in this study, 
ST has been defined as the children's time spent on TV, 
computer, tablet, and smart phones; background TV 
exposure and screen exposure through parental use of 
electronic devices have been included. There is a growing 
body of research implicating deleterious effects of ST in 
children and adolescents44 and the potential associations 
between children's growing exposure to screens and the 
increase of ASD prevalence is an important topic to dis- 
cuss. Future studies should compare passive ST (back- 
ground screen exposure etc.) versus active ST, ST with 
versus without parent interaction, and different contents 
to better evaluate these associations. Further research 
may raise clinician, policymaker, and public awareness 
regarding the link between excess screen exposure and 
the increased risk for developmental disorders in young 
children and protective strategies (ST limitation, etc.) 
can be established.
