Abstract 
Objective Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participate in less physical activity (PA) and more sedentary 
behavior than their peers without ASD. 
Methods The study employed Chi-square analyses of the NSCH 2016–2017 data to compare PA, TV/video watching/gam- 
ing, and usage of portable electronic devices by children with and without ASD by age and ASD severity. 
Results Results suggest more than two and a half times as many children 6–11 and 12–17 years old with ASD failed to 
engage in 60 min of PA during the past week compared to peers without ASD. As children aged, their PA time decreased, 
with a larger percentage drop for children with ASD. For children ages 6–11 years, an inverse relationship was found between 
PA and ASD severity that was not found for older children. As the children got older, children with ASD spent more time 
watching TV/video watching/gaming than peers without ASD, with differing results by ASD severity. More children Birth 
to 5 years ASD used portable electronic devices than their peers without ASD and more young children with ASD used 
devices for 3 or more hours a day. Roughly the same proportions of children 12–17 years old used devices for more than 3 h 
a day but differential results were found between children with and without ASD for less than 1 h of device use. 
Conclusions for Practice These data can be used to advocate for individualized PA interventions and services to increase PA 
and decrease sedentary behaviors of children with ASD. 


What is already known on this subject? Previous research 
shows children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) par- 
ticipate less in physical activity (PA) and exercise than their 
typically developing peers and spend more time than their 
peers in sedentary behaviors. 
What this study adds? This study analyzes the newest data 
from a national data set. The study compares participation 
by children 0–17 years old without ASD to children with 
ASD, by severity level, in PA, time spent TV/video watch- 
ing/gaming, and use of a portable electronic device. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to include data on a wide 
range of electronic devices, inclusive of tablets, that takes 
into account the recent large swings in how often children 
watch TV/video watching/gaming and use portable elec- 
tronic devices. Given prior research that indicates strong 
relationships between technology use and PA, this is the first 
study to explore the severity levels of ASD as they relate to 
technology use and PA. These data can be used to advocate 
for individualized PA interventions and the appropriate sup- 
porting services in order to increase the PA behaviors and 
decrease the sedentary behaviors of children with ASD.

New Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (U.S. Dept. 
of Health and Human Services 2018) recognize the impor- 
tance of physical activity (PA) on health. However, research 
shows that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 



participate in less PA and more sedentary behavior than 
their peers without ASD (Corvey et al. 2016). Similar to 
individuals who follow typical development, this lower PA 
and higher sedentary behavior in children and adolescents 
with ASD has been associated with a negative impact on the 
physical domain. However, an association was found with 
poor cognitive or social skills in children and adolescents 
who exhibit less PA and more sedentary behavior (Memari 
et al. 2017). 
When they do participate in PA, individuals with ASD 
can experience benefits to physiological, cognitive, psycho- 
logical, and behavioral functioning (Sorensen and Zarrett 
2014). PA by individuals with ASD was shown to signifi- 
cantly improve sleep quality and cognition in individuals 
(Tse et al. 2019), motor skills and executive function (Pan 
et al. 2017), physical fitness (Ana-Maria and Ion-Sebastian 
2018), and multiple domains of their health-related quality 
of life (Hamm and Yun 2019). Most notably, exercise has 
been identified as an evidence-based practice for students 
with ASD (Sam et al. 2019). However, implementing PA 
interventions can be quite challenging with this population. 
Barriers to PA for individuals with ASD may include deficits 
in motor skills, sedentary behavior and obesity, social and 
behavior deficits associated with ASD, parental concerns, 
and lack of appropriate programs (Nichols et al. 2019). 
Another barrier to PA for children with ASD may be the 
amount of time they spend with TV/video games or using a 
portable electronic device, or overall screen time (Mazurek 
et al. 2012). Mazurek and Wenstrup (2013) collected data 
on the use of electronic devices by 202 children and adoles- 
cents with ASD and 179 typically developing siblings. The 
children with ASD spent more time watching TV and play- 
ing video games than in all non-screen activities combined 
and more hours per day playing video games. They also had 
higher levels of problematic video game use. 
In a systematic review of 35 studies, none of which 
included digital tablets but some of which included other 
screen usage, Jones et al. (2017) studied the prevalence and 
correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in 
children with ASD compared to typically developing peers. 
Children with ASD spent more time with screens, more 
time in sedentary behaviors, and less time in PA than typi- 
cally developing peers. Age was inversely associated and 
sex inconsistently associated with PA, and age and sex were 
inconsistently associated with sedentary behavior. 
Healy and Garcia (2019) compared psychosocial factors 
related to PA and screen-time of children 9 years old with 
and without ASD. The children with ASD participated in 
less PA than their typically developing peers. A significant 
association between ASD and bullying was found for light 
PA. Children with ASD who reported having been bullied 
were less likely to participate in light PA. No significant 
differences were found in participation of lower PA or daily 

screen time of two groups of children. Children with ASD 
had lower perceptions of their popularity, greater anxi- 
ety, more peer challenges, and lower ratings of prosocial 
behavior. 
Research studies have explored the independent rela- 
tionship of PA and sedentary behaviors on health outcomes 
for typically developing children, but not for children with 
ASD. In typically developing children, there appears to be 
independent positive impacts on their health and fitness, 
particularly those children who are overweight or obese, 
when sedentary behaviors, often defined as TV viewing, are 
reduced and/or physical activity levels are increased. One 
study showed that reducing sedentary behaviors had the 
greater positive impact (Epstein et al. 1995). Mitchell et al. 
(2012) positively associated sedentary behavior with obesity 
in 12-year-olds, and found that low levels of moderate-to- 
vigorous physical activity increased the sedentary 12-year- 
olds’ odds of being obese. With evidence that excessive use 
of screen-based media is linked to overweight and obesity in 
children, reducing TV viewing is associated with decreased 
health risk factors (Marshall and Ramirez 2011). We do not 
have data on whether or not reducing screen-based media 
usage by individuals with ASD might improve participation 
in PA, as has been shown in typically developing peers. A 
better understanding of time spent by children with ASD 
in PA, with TV/videos, and with other portable electronic 
devices is needed in order to determine if research such as 
these studies with typically developing children should be 
replicated with children with ASD. 
The National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) data 
set has been previously analyzed to better understand use of 
screens, prevalence of overweight/obesity, and PA by chil- 
dren and adolescents with and without ASD. In an analysis 
of the 2011–2012 data, Montes (2016) did not find evidence 
that children with ASD differ in their screen time habits from 
other children (both groups had high screen usage); however, 
ASD data were not analyzed by severity level. Johnson et al. 
(2016) used the same data set and found children and ado- 
lescents with ASD had higher prevalence of being obese and 
overweight than children and adolescents without ASD, with 
television time as a predictor for both groups. The analysis 
also indicated that children with ASD who used portable 
electronic devices for 4 or more hours per day were more 
likely to be overweight or obese than those who did not use 
devises. Healy et al. (2018) looked at NSCH 2011–2012 
data for children 6 years of age and up with and without 
ASD. Focusing on their results for children with ASD, the 
researchers found no environmental factors were associated 
with PA, and the presence of a bedroom TV and the lack 
of limits on screen time were associated with screen time. 
As reviewed above, children with ASD participate in less 
PA and more sedentary behaviors, including more screen 
time, than their peers without ASD even though they receive 

 

similar benefits from PA as their peers. Evidence suggests 
characteristics of the diagnosis, parental influence, commu- 
nity factors, and screen time may contribute to these find- 
ings related to activity levels. National data (Anderson 2015) 
indicate that by 2015, 68% of adults had a smartphone and 
45% had a tablet computer. These percentages were up from 
35% with smartphones and only 3% having a tablet in 2010. 
In addition, by 2017, 98% of children age 8 and under live in 
a home with a mobile device (Common Sense Media 2017). 
Prior research about technology has often focused on watch- 
ing TV and DVD/Video, using video game equipment, and 
using laptop or tower computers. The Common Sense Media 
survey found decreases in TV/DVD/Video gaming and com- 
puter use for children, with a ninefold (from 4% in 2011 to 
35% in 2017) increase in how much time was spent with 
mobile devices. The increased availability of smart phones 
and electronic tablets at home, in schools, and during inter- 
vention means that individuals with ASD likely have more 
opportunities for screen time usage. 
During a time of more access to screens, do individu- 
als with ASD continue to exhibit low levels of PA? Given 
the amount of time that individuals with ASD have been 
shown to spend with screens used by a variety of devices 
(not including tablets), given the many benefits of PA, and 
given the widespread understanding that PA should be indi- 
vidualized in order to have optimal benefit, it is important to 
know what the most current data suggest about children with 
ASD. It is also important to explore PA and screen time that 
includes tablets by age and ASD severity level. Current data 
regarding how time is spent by children and adolescents with 
and without ASD can inform decisions regarding future indi- 
vidualized behavioral interventions and educational lessons 
that aim to increase PA and decrease sedentary behaviors 
in children with ASD, including subgroups of children and 
adolescents with similar ASD severity levels. 
The purpose of this research was to analyze the NSCH 
2016–2017 data by comparing PA, TV/video watching/gam- 
ing, and usage of portable electronic devices by children 
with and without ASD by age and severity level of ASD. 
The NSCH 2016–2017 data set identifies the severity level 
of the child with ASD. Even though the 2011–2012 data set 
included a question about children’s use of TV/video watch- 
ing/gaming and a question about using portable electronic 
devices, usage of these devices has changed considerably 
over the past decade (Alkhayat et al. 2020). For example, 
one survey found a 50% decrease in TV/video watching 
and a 350% increase in mobile device use for young chil- 
dren from 2011 to 2017 (Common Sense Media 2017). We 
have not seen current data that compare children with ASD 
by age from 0 to 17 years and by severity level to children 
without ASD regarding PA, TV/video watching/gaming, and 
usage of portable electronic devices. Therefore, our specific 
research questions were, are there statistically significant 
differences in (1) the weekly amount of exercising, playing 
a sport, or participating in PA for at least 60 min differ by 
age groups and severity levels for children with ASD com- 
pared to typically developing peers, (2) the average time on 
a weekday spent in front of a TV watching TV programs, 
videos, or playing video games differ by age groups and 
severity levels for children with ASD compared to typically 
developing peers, and (3) the average time on a weekday 
spent with computers, cells phones, handheld video games, 
and other electronic devices, doing things other than school- 
work, differ by age groups and severity levels for children 
with ASD compared to typically developing peers. 

The NSCH, funded and directed primarily by the United 
States Health Resources and Services Administration’s 
Maternal and Child Health Bureau, provided national and 
state-level data on the physical and emotional health of 
American children 0–17 years old (2016/2017 National 
Survey of Children’s Health 2019). The 2016–2017 sur- 
veys were conducted by the United States Census Bureau. 
Random sampling by mail occurred to identify households 
with one or more children under 18 years old. One child per 
household was randomly selected to be the subject of the 
survey, with an oversampling of children with special health 
care needs and children 0–5 years of age. For 2016–2017, a 
total of 71,811 surveys were completed (50,212 in 2016 and 
21,599 in 2017). An initial screen questionnaire was used 
prior to a more detailed, age-specific questionnaire that was 
applied to only one child per household. Respondents were a 
parent or caregiver with knowledge of the health and health- 
care of the child. Households had the option to respond via 
a web instrument or a paper instrument, both of which were 
available in English and Spanish. The combined data set 
for 2016 and 2017 allows for more opportunities to analyze 
variables with small sample sizes or low prevalence and to 
conduct more complex analysis across variables. 
From the completed questionnaires, 1711 respondents 
to the 2016–2017 NSCH indicated they currently had a 
child with Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger’s 
syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder (survey 
grouped all 5 into “ASD”). The 1711 families in the sample 
represent 2.4% of all participants in the survey. Compared 
to the families who did not have children with ASD, there 
were slightly more families (15.3% vs. 10.5%) with a child 
with ASD that were 0–99% of the federal poverty level, and 
fewer families with a child with ASD (35.5% vs. 43.1%) that 
earned 400% or more of the federal poverty level (Table 1). 
A frequency analysis of the racial make-up of the sample of 
families indicated small differences between the two groups.

Chi-squared analyses explored percentage responses 
regarding children with and without ASD on the child’s: 
(1) weekly amount of exercising, playing a sport, or partici- 
pating in PA for at least 60 min by age groups and severity 
levels (“PA time”), (2) average time on a weekday spent in 
front of a TV watching TV programs, videos, or playing 

video games (“TV/video watching/gaming”), and (3) aver- 
age time on a weekday spent with computers, cells phones, 
handheld video games, and other electronic devices, doing 
things other than schoolwork (“portable electronic devices”). 
Respondents for the NSCH were only asked to indicate PA 
time for at least 60 min within a day during the last week 
if the child was 6 or more years of age. In the combined 
2016–2107 data set, a new data variable was created that 
aggregated children with ASD if the response was moderate 
or severe. However, the authors of this research article chose 
to analyze the ASD data using the 2016 and 2017 criteria of 
mild, moderate, and severe for exploratory purposes related 
to practical implications for the field. 

The first set of analyses examined the weekly amount of 
exercising, playing a sport, or participating in PA for at 
least 60 min by age groups and severity levels. Chi-square 
analyses found significant differences among the percent- 
ages of children with and without ASD that engaged in PA 
for greater than 60 min at least once a day (see Table 2). 
Almost 21% of children with ASD did not have a single 
day of 60 min or more PA during the week which contrasts 
with only 8% of children without ASD. For children ages 
6–11 years old, 11.4% of those with ASD versus 3.6% of

Three times as many children with ASD (16.2%) vs. 5.4% of 
0–5-year-old children without ASD did not watch/participate 
in any TV/video watching/gaming. This result for young 
children contrasts with the two older groups of children that 
had similar percentages for children with ASD and without 
ASD who did not engage in TV/video watching/gaming. 
Chi squared analyses indicated that the only statistical 
difference for TV/video watching/gaming and severity of 
ASD was with the 6–11-year-old children (Table 2). Of note 
(Fig. 2), 16% of children with severe ASD watched no TV 
compared to 4.1% of children with moderate ASD and 3.7% 
of children with mild ASD. Results indicated 16.6% of chil- 
dren with mild ASD, 28.9% of children with moderate ASD, 
and 24.1% of children with severe ASD spent 3 h or more 
with TV/video watching/gaming. 
The final set of analyses explored children with and 
without ASD and average time on a weekday spent with 
computers, cells phones, handheld video games, and other 
electronic devices, doing things other than schoolwork. Chi- 
square analyses indicated significant differences for all three 
age groups of children by diagnosis (Table 2). The largest 
differences were between 12 and 17-year-old children with 
and without ASD. Children with ASD used a portable elec- 
tronic device for an average of 3+ h/weekday more often 
than children without an ASD, with differential effects for 
the age of the child. Findings indicate contrasts of 15% of 
0–5 years-old children with ASD vs. 4.5% of children with- 
out an ASD; 23.3% of 6–11-year-old children with ASD ver- 
sus 12.3% of children without ASD; and 46% 12–17-year- 
old children with ASD vs. 41% of children without ASD. 

those without ASD reported zero days of 60 min of PA. 
With the older age group, 27.3% of the 12–17-year-olds with 
ASD and 11.2% of their peers without ASD had zero days 
where they engaged in 60 min or more PA. Findings indi- 
cated 16.5% of 12–17-year-olds without ASD and 27.9% 
of 6–11-year-olds without ASD were engaged in PA every 
day compared with 10.6% of 12–17-year-olds with ASD and 
20.3% of 6–11-year-olds with ASD. 
Children that were 6–11 years old engaged in signifi- 
cantly more PA for 60 min than 12–17-year-old children. 
The same percentage (44%) of younger and older children 
with ASD engaged in PA for 1–3 days. However, 24.8% 
of 6–11-year-old children with ASD and only 18.3% of 
12–17-year-old children with ASD met the PA criteria for 
4–6 days. The largest difference was 20.3% of younger chil- 
dren with ASD versus 10.6% of older children with ASD met 
the PA requirement every day. Results also varied by ASD 
severity for engagement in PA (see Fig. 1). For the younger 
6–11-year-old children, children with more severe levels of 
ASD engaged in less PA of 60 min or more than children 
with milder forms of ASD. At the same time, analysis indi- 
cated a corresponding decrease in the number of children 
from mild to moderate to severe ASD that had 60 min of PA 
for 4 or more days. No significant differences across ASD 
severity levels were found for the 12–17-year-old children 
with ASD (see Table 2). 
The second set of analyses examined the average time on 
a weekday spent in front of a TV watching TV programs, 
videos, or playing video games, with response options of: 
Less than 1 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, or 4 or more hours per day. 
Results indicated Chi-square statistically significant differ- 
ences (Table 2) for all of the three age groups by time and 
diagnosis of ASD. Children with ASD engaged in substan- 
tially more TV/video watching/gaming than children without 
ASD. For example, results for watching TV/video watching/ 
gaming for more than 4 h a day were: 12% of 0–5-year- 
old children with ASD versus 3.7% of their peers without 
ASD; 9.7% of 6–11-year-old children with ASD versus 5.0% 
of their peers without ASD; and 21% of 12–17-year-old 
children with ASD vs. 10.9% of their peers without ASD.

Yet, even with the guideline and the likelihood of multiple 
PA opportunities, as all children in this study increased 
in age, their PA time decreased but the percentage drop 
was larger for children with ASD. This begs the question, 
“How are children and adolescents with ASD spending 
their time?” For the age-related results of our other two 
research questions, our analysis indicated that as the ages 
of most children in this study increased, children with 
ASD spent more time watching TV/video watching/gam- 
ing than their peers without ASD and they engaged with 
portable electronic devices for longer periods of time than 
their peers without ASD, a finding that provides new infor- 
mation given the previous lack of research that included 
portable electronic devices. 
This study provides initial data on ASD severity levels 
related to PA, time spent watching TV/video watching/ 
gaming, and use of portable electronic devices. As severity 
of ASD increased across all age groups, time spent in PA 
decreased. However, it is interesting that results for time 
spent watching TV/video watching/gaming did not show 
trends by severity of ASD across the age ranges. Children 
6–11 years old with severe ASD spent the least amount of 
time with TV/video watching/gaming, yet children 0–5 years 
and 12–17 years with severe ASD spent the most amount 
of time with TV/video watching/gaming compared to their 
age group peers with mild or moderate ASD. The largest 
percentage of children watching more than 4 h of TV/video 
watching/gaming were the Birth to age 5 children with 
severe ASD. Like time spent in PA, as ASD severity lev- 
els increased across all age groups, there was more daily 
usage of portable electronic devices doing things other than 
schoolwork. 
The findings for PA and sedentary behaviors of children 
with ASD are largely supported by prior research regarding 
American children, as presented in a systematic review by 
Jones et al. (2017). In addition, using the 2016 NSCH data 
set, Ratcliff et al. (2018) found that children with ASD from 
6 to 7 years old had significantly lower participation levels in 
physical, recreational, social, skill, and jobs/chores activi- 
ties than typically developing children. Older children with 
ASD had greater disparity among the types of leisure activi- 
ties. The same 2016 NSCH data set was analyzed by McCoy 
and Morgan (2020), who found adolescents (10–17 years 
old) with ASD were less likely to engage in 60 min of PA 
as the severity of their diagnosis increased. Using the same 
data set we used, McCoy and Morgan (2020) found that ado- 
lescents with ASD (severity was not analyzed) were more 
likely than their typically developing peers to watch TV for 
more than 2 h/day but were not more likely to use comput- 
ers/portable electronic devices for more than 2 h/day. Factors 
that inhibit or prohibit PA by children with ASD could be 
related to symptoms of ASD, the PA environment, family 
context that limits or provides related supports or resources, 
A Chi squared comparison of age by ASD severity for 
using portable electronic devices found significant differ- 
ences for children ages 6–11-years-old and 12–17-years-old, 
but not for the 0–5 year-old children (Table 2). For chil- 
dren 6–11-years-old and 12–17-years-old, data indicated an 
increasing trend (Fig. 3) of children with a greater degree of 
severity of disability not using a portable electronic device. 
At the same time, for all three age groups, children with 
more severe ASD used portable electronic devices for more 
than 4 h to a greater degree than children with mild or mod- 
erate levels of ASD. 

Results of this study support existing literature that indi- 
cates there is a notable difference in PA participation by 
children with and without ASD from birth to 17 years old. 
Of particular concern is the finding in this study that more 
than two and a half times as many children 6–11 years old 
and 12–17 years old with ASD failed to engage in 60 min 
or more of PA time during the past week compared to 
age-matched children without ASD. In many schools and 
communities, these age ranges are the ones with school- 
based and community-based opportunities for PA, includ- 
ing physical education, inclusive sports and recreational 
opportunities, after-school non-profit services, and various 
programs for therapeutic recreation. Additionally, the cur- 
rent national guideline (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human 
Services 2018) of participation in PA at least 60 min daily 
by children in these age groups has been a recommenda- 
tion since the original guideline was published in 2008.

availability of trained PA professionals, and neighborhood 
or home environment (Healy et al. 2018). 
Collectively, our results and research reviewed in this 
article indicated that children with ASD do not follow the 
American Academy of Pediatrics’ most recent policy state- 
ment on screen time (AAP Council on Communications and 
Media, Media and Young Minds 2016). The policy state- 
ment reviews research on the impact of screen time on over- 
all development, sleep, obesity, and parent interaction. The 
policy discourages use of screen media other than video- 
chatting for children younger than 18 months, advises only 
high-quality programming/apps for children 18–24 months 
with shared usage between parent and children and an avoid- 
ance of the child using the screen solo, and promotes a limit 
of 1 h or less a day of high-quality programming for children 
older than 2 years. 
Notably, the NSCH data we analyzed did not include 
questions about what portable electronic devices are used 
for, except noting “other than ‘schoolwork”. It is possible 
the time children with ASD spend with portable electronic 
devices may be caused by adult-directed interaction with the 
devices. Although typically conducted with a low number 
of participants, studies employing video games as a form 
of intervention have been used to teach children with ASD 
skills such as sportsmanship (Ferguson et al. 2013); motor 
skills (Taheri and Sotoodeh 2018); functional skills for use 
in contexts such as home, school, community, and job (Goo 
et al. 2019); daily living and motor skills (Kellems et al. 
2018); social interactions (Stone et al. 2019); social skills, 
living skills, and academic skills (Withey 2017); social play 
(Francis et al. 2019); music education in an environment that 
decreased stress, and anxiousness, increased socialization, 
and promoted friendships (Hillier et al. 2016); and improved 
communication skills (Alzrayer and Banda 2017). 
Also important to note is the time with portable electronic 
devices may not equate to child being sedentary during that 
time. It would be informative for future research to explore 
how children with ASD at all severity levels interact with 
portable electronic devices, and determine the percentage 
of time this interaction represents sedentary behaviors vs. 
PA. If a significant amount of time spend with portable elec- 
tronic devices is in sedentary behaviors, then this time along 
with the time spent watching TV/video watching/gaming 
and using home gaming system, may be opportunities for 
caregivers to encourage the child with ASD to participate 
in PA. Using portable electronic devices to increase PA may 
also capitalize on the preference visual input of individuals 
with ASD (Mazurek et al. 2012). 
Capitalizing on their familiarity with videos and portable 
electronic devices, exergaming may be one way to improve 
the PA time for children with ASD (Dickinson and Place 
2014; Golden and Getchell 2017). It may also be a way to 
address the results we found regarding ASD severity levels 
because exergaming may be more accessible and adaptable 
to individual preferences and developmental levels than in- 
person PA. Stanish et al. (2017) found adolescents with ASD 
spent less time in moderate and vigorous PA than typically 
developing peers, but the time they did spent was most often 
via walking/hiking or active video gaming. Other research 
indicated exergaming sessions provided a significant 
increase in heart rate (Bittner et al. 2017; Ryuh et al. 2019). 
Given the common usage of portable electronic devices by 
young children with any ASD severity level, as shown in this 
study, and the positive outcomes cited above, exergaming 
may be an appropriate form of PA intervention for young 
children with ASD, as well as one that could potentially 
remain viable as they age, and should be explored in future 
research studies. 
In order for any form of virtual reality, including exer- 
gaming, to have a long-term positive impact on individuals 
with ASD, research shows that the space must be tailored 
to their individual need, which would include ASD severity 
level. A systematic literature review of studies employing 
PA-based interventions for adolescents with ASD found that 
highly effective intervention mechanisms included prompt- 
ing, modeling, praise, and structured teaching (Sorensen 
and Zarrett 2014). The sensory load in the system must also 
be appropriately controlled and adapted to meet the sen- 
sory needs of the individual (Boyd et al. 2018). Therapeutic 
‘games’ (or exergames) should integrate the expertise of 
clinicians, input of children, and experience of designers to 
achieve objectives and be enjoyable for children (Malinverni 
et al. 2017). Applications that aim to teach basic relational 
concepts should employ best practices from early intensive 
behavioral intervention (Mykyta and Zhou 2017). 
The results of this study should be interpreted in consid- 
eration of its limitations. The survey relies on self-report, 
which yielded a data set limited to cross-sectional analy- 
sis. The authors did not control the questions in the survey 
and were unable to explore variables, specifically; (1) we 
do not know what the portable electronic devices were used 
for “other than schoolwork”, and some of that usage could 
have included PA; therefore, we cannot assume that all of 
the time reported as device usage time employed sedentary 
behaviors; (2) we do not know the children’s gross motor 
proficiency levels and can only make somewhat educated 
assumptions about such based on ASD severity level; (3) 
we do not know the family context, particularly how much 
parents or other caregivers do or do not engage in PA and 
how influential their behaviors are on their children; and 
(4) we do not know the specifics of the PA. In addition, we 
did not control for comorbidities, maladaptive behaviors, or 
medications. While previous research has not shown strong 
associations with these factors and levels of PA by children 
with ASD (Corvey et al. 2016; Jones et al. 2017), those stud- 
ies did not include portable electronic device use. Finally, 

demographic information for the families who had a child 
with ASD indicated a slightly larger percentage of families 
in the 0–99% category of Federal Poverty Level. Although 
prior research (Rideout and Katz 2016) has indicated few 
differences between household income, other research 
(Common Sense Media 2019) has indicated that tweens 
from higher-income homes are on social media less than 
tweens from lower-income households. The availability and 
use of electronic handheld devices, and these relationships 
to physical activity remains an area of limited research when 
considering children with ASD. 
These data, which used a large sample size from a 
national study and included a comparison group, can be 
used to advocate for individualized PA interventions and 
the appropriate supporting services in order to increase the 
PA behaviors and decrease the sedentary behaviors of chil- 
dren with ASD. As children spend a large portion of the year 
in schools, teachers, and physical educators in particular, 
should create positive and supportive opportunities for chil- 
dren to engage in PA, with particular emphasis on teaching 
motor skills to young children and helping them implement 
them in appropriate environments, establishing healthy hab- 
its that could help increase time spent in PA as they age 
(Jones et al. 2017). This is especially important for children 
with a greater severity of ASD, as this study demonstrated 
that these children spend a disproportionate amount of time 
TV/video watching/gaming and using portable electronic 
devices, while at the same time having the largest percentage 
of days without a single 60-min bout of PA.
