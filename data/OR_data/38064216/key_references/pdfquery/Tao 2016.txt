Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
relationships between screen time (ST), nighttime sleep 
duration, and behavioural problems in a sample of pre- 
school children in China. A sample of 8900 children aged 
3–6 years was enrolled from 35 kindergartens, in four 
cities, in two provinces, in China to evaluate the relation- 
ships between ST, nighttime sleep duration, and behav- 
ioural problems. Children’s ST and nighttime sleep dura- 
tion were assessed by questionnaires completed by parents 
or guardians. Behavioural problems were assessed using 
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and 
the Clancy Autism Behaviour Scale (CABS). Multivariate 
analysis was used to assess the associations between ST, 
nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems. The 
total SDQ and CABS scores were higher in children with 
2 h/day and sleep duration <9.15 h/day (a P < 0.001 
ST 
for all). After adjusting for potential confounders, chil- 
dren with ST 
2 h/day had a significantly increased risk 
of having total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct 
problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial prob- 
lems, as well as behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum 
disorder. Similar results were found in children with sleep 
duration <9.15 h/day. No significantly increased risk of 
emotional symptoms was observed for short sleep duration. 
Preschool children with more ST and short nighttime sleep 
duration were significantly more likely to have behavioural

standing of prevention and intervention for psychosocial 
problems in children.

A growing body of evidence suggests that excessive sed- 
entary behaviour begins at a very young age, particularly 
for screen-based sedentary behaviours [1]. However, a 
previous study found that most parents believed that their 
young child did not have excessive screen time (ST) [2]. 
There is a growing body of evidence which demonstrated 
that the negative health effects of ST include behavioural 
and emotional problems in children [3–5], as well as nega- 
tive health outcomes in adults [6]. Another important health 
issue, which should be noted in relation to ST, is adequate 
sleep among children [7]. ST exposure, such as TV viewing 
and computer use, was associated with shorter sleep dura- 
tion in a previous study [8]. Children who had insufficient 
sleep were significantly more likely to have had sleep and 
behavioural problems [9], and these associations appeared 
to be bidirectional in longitudinal research [10]. 
Behavioural problems in children are quite common 
worldwide [11], and persist until at least late childhood, 
imposing substantial burdens on children and parents [12]. 
To date, a small but emerging number of studies found 
that ST and sleep duration were risk factors for behav- 
ioural problems among young children [13–15]. Therefore, 
early detection of such problems in children is important. 
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 


 
validated tool for the identification of psychosocial prob- 
lems in preschool-aged children [16]. Although ST and 
sleep duration both affect children’s behaviours and emo- 
tions, there is a limited amount of research on the effects 
of ST and sleep duration on behavioural problems using 
the most common screening instruments, such as the SDQ. 
Moreover, little is known about the associations between 
ST and sleep duration and behaviours relating to autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies have reported 
that the mainly leisure time for ASD children is ST [17]. 
This is important because behavioural problems are com- 
mon in young children with ASD [18]. 
The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the 
relationships between ST and nighttime sleep duration and 
behavioural problems in a representative cross-sectional 
sample of children aged 3–6 years old. Behavioural prob- 
lems were assessed using the SDQ and the CABS. We 
hypothesized that preschool children who had more ST and 
slept less were more likely to have had behavioural prob- 
lems compared with those who had less ST and slept more. 


This cross-sectional study was conducted in Anhui and 
Jiangsu Provinces, located in east China, between March 
and June 2015. Four cities, Tongling, Anqing, Wuhu, and 
Yangzhou, were randomly selected in two provinces. Chil- 
dren aged 3–6 years, from 35 kindergartens, were enrolled 
in the study. Questionnaires were distributed by maternal 
and child health care professionals. The parents or guard- 
ians of each child completed a structured questionnaire, 
which included the SDQ and CABS. A total of 9103 chil- 
dren were identified to take part in the survey. Question- 
naires which were missing too much information were 
excluded from the analysis. Complete or almost com- 
plete questionnaires were returned from 8900 children. 
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Anhui Medical University. Informed consent was obtained 
from all the parents or guardians who completed the 
questionnaires. 


The parents or guardians reported their children’s ST 
using the following question: “How many hours per day 
does your child usually (a) spend watching TV; (b) spend 
using a computer to play games (other than homework); (c) 
spend using a cell phone; (d) spend using iPad and other 

electronic devices; at weekdays and weekend days, respec- 
tively?” Total weekly ST was the sum of TV time, com- 
puter time, cell phone time, and iPad and other electronic 
device time during weekdays and weekends. Average daily 
ST was calculated (5/7 
 [ST 
during the weekend]). ST was categorized as low (<2 h/ 
day) or high ( 
2 h/day), according to the recommendation 
of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 







Nighttime sleep duration was assessed with the follow- 
ing two questions with two parts each: (1) “During the 
past month, when have your child usually gone to bed on 
a weeknight?”; “During the past month, when have your 
child usually gotten up on a weekday?”; and “During the 
past month, how long has it usually take your child to fall 
asleep on a weeknight?”. (2) “During the past month, when 
have your child usually gone to bed during the weekend 
night?”; “During the past month, when have your child usu- 
ally gotten up during the weekend day?”; and “During the 
past month, how long has it usually take your child to fall 
asleep during the weekend night?”. These questions were 
used to create the duration of nighttime sleep on weekdays 
and weekends, separately. Sleep duration was calculated 
by (hours in bed–hour taking to fall asleep). Average daily 
duration of nighttime sleep was calculated (5/7 
 [night- 
time sleep duration on weekdays] 
 [duration of 
nighttime sleep on weekend days]). Duration of nighttime 
sleep was categorized as short (<sample mean) or long 
( 
sample mean), using the mean of the average nightly 
≥ 
duration of sleep for the whole sample (9.15 h/day). 






Parents or guardians completed the SDQ, a screening 
instrument with 25 items relating to strengths and difficul- 
ties and eight items relating to the severity and the impact 
of problems. The SDQ-P contained five subscales: emo- 
tional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inatten- 
tion, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviour. 
Parents or guardians rated items as 0, 1, or 2 for “not true”, 
“somewhat true”, and “certainly true”, respectively. The 
total difficulties score (range 0–40) was obtained by sum- 
ming the scores of the emotional symptoms, conduct prob- 
lems, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer relationship prob- 
lems. Higher scores are indicating more serious problems, 
except for the “prosocial behaviour” subscale, for which 
higher scores indicated more positive behaviours. Each 
subscale and the total difficulties score were dichotomized 
into healthy (normal category) or at-risk (borderline and 

 

abnormal categories) group [13]. Previous research demon- 
strated that the internal consistency for the total difficulties 
score was good (Cronbach’α, 0.78) [16]. 

The CABS was assessed by parents or guardians to iden- 
tify children’s behavioural symptoms relating to ASD. This 
scale was first reported in 1969 [19] and was widely used 
in mainland China [20]. The CABS contained 14 items that 
were scored on a three point scale from 0 to 2 for “Never”, 
“Occasionally”, and “Often”, respectively. The total score 
can be categorized into three groups using cutoffs of 14 and 
14 and had <3 “never” responses 
21. Children who scores 
and >6 “often” responses were considered potential cases 
of autism. In the present study, children with scores 
14 
were considered at-risk. The at-risk categorizations for the 
SDQ and CABS scales were used to identify children at 
risk of behavioural and emotional problems. 



The variables included in the analysis as potential con- 
founders were gender, age, number of siblings, parental 
educational level, and family income. Maximum edu- 
cational level of the parents was classified as the highest 
educational level of the parent who had more formal educa- 
tion. Maternal and birth information were also retrospec- 
tive reported. These variables included gestational weeks, 
maternal age, delivery mode, birth weight, and breastfeed- 
ing. Preterm birth was defined as gestational age <37 com- 
pleted weeks. 
Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained 
maternal and child healthcare personnel at each kindergar- 
ten. Height (measured to the nearest 0.1 cm) and weight 
(measured to the nearest 0.1 kg) were measured when the 
children wore light clothes. Body mass index (BMI) was 
calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m2). 
The World Health Organization Child Growth Standards 
for age- and sex-specific cutoffs were used [21]. Over- 
weight was defined as BMI between the 85th and <95th 
percentile for age and sex, and obesity was defined as BMI 



distributions of the total CABS score and SDQ subscale 
scores and total scores were skewed; thus, the relationships 
between ST, sleep duration, CABS, and SDQ scores were 
assessed using Mann–Whitney U tests. Spearman correla- 
tion coefficients (r) were used to assess the associations of 
ST and sleep duration with CABS and SDQ scores. Mul- 
tiple logistic regression models were used to test whether 
each exposure variables was independently associated 
with an increased risk of behavioural problems. A wide 
range of variables that were correlated with behaviour and 
could potentially bias the associations between ST, sleep 
duration, and outcome were adjusted for in the regression 
models. These potential confounders included gender, 
age, number of siblings, child’s BMI, maternal income, 
maximum educational level of parents, gestational weeks, 
maternal age, breastfeeding, delivery mode, birth weight, 
and ST/sleep duration. 




The mean (SD) age of the study sample was 4.37 (0.99) 
years, and 47.1% were female. A maximum educational 
level of no more than high school was reported by 28.9% 
of parents, and 44.1% of parents reported a family income 
>4000 Yuan/month. Of the children, 11.7% were over- 
weight and 14.5% were obese. 



2 h/day and <2 h/ 
day were 42.7% (3801/8900) and 57.3% (5099/8900), 
respectively. The percentages of children with sleep dura- 
tion <9.15 h/day and 
9.15 h/day were 57.0% (5069/8900) 
and 43.0% (3831/8900), respectively. The sample charac- 
teristics stratified by ST and sleep duration are shown in 
2 h/ 
Table 1. The proportion of the sample which had ST 
day did not vary significantly by age, gestational weeks, 
or delivery mode. There were significant differences in the 
prevalence of sleep duration <9.15 h/day between different 
age, family income, and delivery mode groups. 

Differences between ST and sleep duration 
and behavioural problems 
The frequencies and proportions of parental socio-demo- 
graphic characteristics, birth information, and child infor- 
mation were calculated for different groups of ST and 
sleep duration using Chi-square tests. Descriptive statistics 
(mean and standard deviation [SD]) for the total CABS 
scores and SDQ subscale, and total scores were calcu- 
lated for the different ST and sleep duration groups. The 
Table 2 reports the mean scores for SDQ total and subscale 
scores, and total CABS scores for the different ST and 
sleep duration groups. The total SDQ and CABS scores 
were higher in children with longer ST (both P < 0.001). 
The SDQ subscale scores for emotional symptoms, conduct 
problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems were higher in 
children with longer ST (P < 0.001 for all). The prosocial

Associations between long ST, short sleep duration, 
and risk for behavioural problems 
Table 4 shows the odds ratios that estimated the asso- 
ciations between ST, sleep duration, and being at risk for 
behavioural problems. Most associations were evident in 
both crude and adjusted models. Children with more ST 
were significantly more likely to be at risk for behavioural 
problems compared with those with less ST. Children with 
shorter sleep duration had a significantly increased risk of 
behavioural problems compared with those who had longer 
sleep duration. These findings were consistent for each of 
the SDQ subscale scores. 
The simultaneous associations of ST and sleep on being 
at risk for behavioural problems were stronger than ST 
or sleep, separately. All associations were evident in both 
crude and adjusted models (Table 4). 

As hypothesized, the present study found that preschool chil- 
dren with long ST and short sleep duration were significantly 
more likely to have behavioural problems, after controlling 
for potential confounding factors. Specifically, children with 
long ST and short sleep duration had higher scores on CABS 
(which assessed ASD-related behaviours) compared with 
children with short ST and long sleep duration. 
Children are spending an increasing amount of their 
time engaged in screen exposure. Compared with other 
cultural backgrounds of children, Chinese preschool chil- 
dren have a less ST exposure with 2.03 h an average day.

Preschool-aged children in the United States spend an 
average 4.1 h of ST daily at home and in day care settings 
[22]. International statistics indicate that children in Can- 
ada, the United States, and Australia are spending between 
1.5 and 7.0 h daily in screen-viewing activities [23]. ST 
contributes to a variety of pediatric health problems [4]. 
Exploration of the associations between ST exposure and 
behavioural problems during early childhood is an emerg- 
ing research area, and a variety of assessments to identify 
psychosocial problems have been used [24, 25]. Previous 
researches have suggested that ST might be associated with 
increased behavioural and emotional problems in children, 
including aggression [26], reduced prosocial behaviour 
[27], and attentional problems [28], which are consistent 
with our results. Hinkley et al. suggested that higher levels 
of early childhood electronic media use were associated 
with risk for emotional and peer problems [13]. Findings 
from the present study support the conclusion that there is 
an adverse influence of electronic media use on children’s 
psychosocial well-being. 
Our result differs from those from a nationally repre- 
sentative US study, which showed no evidence that children 
with ASD differ in their ST habits from other children [17]. 
A possible explanation for this inconsistency is that the US 
study used parental-reported history of ASD, instead of a 
standardized screening tool for ASD. 
ST may affect children by displacing their sleep time 
[29]. However, previous studies focused solely on ST or 
sleep duration and did not investigate associations with the 
two factors simultaneously, as was done in this study. The 

 

present study provides evidence that short sleep duration 
was significantly associated with emotional and behavioural 
problems among children aged 3–6 years, even after adjust- 
ment for potential confounders. The relationship between 
sleep problems and behavioural problems in children is well 
established. A population-based longitudinal study showed 
that short sleep duration at 18 months of age significantly 
predicted the incidence of behavioural problems at 5 years 
of age [30]. Scharf et al. [14] reported that shorter night- 
time sleep duration in preschool children is associated with 
higher likelihood of externalizing behavioural symptoms 
based on parental report, using the Preschool and Kinder- 
garten Behaviour Scale. However, different assessments of 
behavioural problems were used in aforementioned studies. 
The use of a uniform measurement for childhood behav- 
ioural problems in future studies is necessary to confirm 
the observed associations. Our study found that preschool 
children with short sleep duration had higher risk of ASD 
behaviour than children with long sleep duration. These 
findings confirm the results of previous studies which exam- 
ined the relationship between sleep problems and daytime 
behaviour of children with ASD [15]. 
Several possible mechanisms may explain the aforemen- 
tioned associations. The effect of ST on children might be 
also via influencing beliefs and behaviours. Based on social 
learning theory, children can easily learn by observing and 
imitating contents they see on the screen [5]. High ST has 
been associated with poor health outcomes such as increased 
sleep problems among children with ASD [31]. The social 
withdrawal hypothesis suggests that increased ST leads to 
less social interaction, which may have subsequent detrimen- 
tal effects on positive well-being [32]. Further researches on 
mechanisms are needed to undertake in the early childhood 
population, to identify these associations clearly. 
The strengths of this study include the large sample 
size and the statistical adjustment for a large number of 
potential covariates. In addition to information the chil- 
dren, maternal and birth data were assessed as potential 
confounders to better estimate the associations between 
ST and sleep time and behavioural problems. Despite these 
strengths, our study has several limitations. The data about 
bed time and wakeup time were retrospective and reported 
by parents and might have been subject to recall biases. 
However, as suggested in a previous study on sleep start 
and end time reported by parents, the actual sleep dura- 
tion was accurately estimated by actigraphy [33]. ST was 
also reported by parental proxy, which might have been 
inaccurate as parents were not always with their children. 
However, as preschool children’s ST exposure occurs 
mostly at home, there is good reason to believe that ST 
was accurately measured. ST and sleep duration were cat- 
egorized, and so small associations might not have been 
detected, leading to conservative estimates in this analysis. 
A previous study suggested that children’s emerging proso- 
cial behaviour might have been shaped by the interactive 
contributions of interpersonal maternal emotion socializa- 
tion [34]. Our study did not control for maternal emotion 
status for mothers. Finally, this survey was cross-sectional 
and an etiologic relationship cannot be determined. It is 
important to note that the relationships between ST, sleep 
duration, and behaviour in preschool children are likely 
bidirectional [9]. However, there is good reason to believe 
that long ST and short sleep duration led to behavioural 
problems, as data from previous prospective studies have 
established the temporal order in other populations [13, 
30]. Further longitudinal studies are required to examine 
causal pathways in these associations and to determine the 
potential roles of ST and sleep duration in preventing men- 
tal health problems. Particularly, the mechanism underlying 
these relationships requires further research. 

This study offers insight into the associations between ST 
and sleep duration and behavioural problems among pre- 
school children in China. Our findings suggest that preschool 
children with long ST and short sleep duration were signifi- 
cantly more likely to have behavioural problems. Only by 
understanding the distinct links of ST and sleep duration 
with behaviour, we can pinpoint potential avenues for inter- 
vention. Based on our results, it is important for parents to 
limit their children’s ST to no more than 1–2 h/day. Parents 
are also advised to regulate their children’s sleep habits to 
ensure that their children received adequate amount of sleep.
