We examined the relationship between video-based media viewing (screen time), behavioral 
outcomes, and language development in 120 36-month-old children with a family history of 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or no 
family history of either condition. Participants were classified into one of three diagnostic groups: 
ASD (n=20), ADHD Concerns (children with elevated ADHD symptoms; n=14), or Comparison 
(n=86). Children in the ADHD Concerns group spent more time viewing screen media than 
Comparison children. Increased screen time was associated with lower receptive and expressive 
language scores across groups. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the direction of 
effects and causality. 




The amount of time children spend viewing electronic media (hereafter referred to as 
“screen time”) has increased dramatically in the last two decades (Chen & Adler, 2019) 
despite research demonstrating significant associations with a variety of negative 
developmental outcomes (Hinkley et al., 2014; Lin, Cherng, Chen, Chen, & Yang, 2015; 
Tomopoulos et al., 2010). The latest recommendations issued by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) suggest no independent screen time for children younger than age 2 and no

more than 1 hour per day for children 2 to 5 years of 0age (AAP Council on 
Communications and Media, 2016). Preschoolers who engage in screen time more than 2 
hours per day demonstrate increased emotion dysregulation and diminished prosocial 
behavior (Domingues-Montanari, 2017; Stiglic & Viner, 2019), elevated inattention and 
hyperactivity (Christakis, Zimmerman, DiGiuseppe, & McCarty, 2004; Landhuis, Poulton, 
Welch, & Hancox, 2007; Wu et al., 2017), and lower language (Byeon & Hong, 2015; Duch 
et al., 2013; Hutton et al., 2019; Zimmerman,Christakis, & Meltzoff, 2007) among a range 
of other negative associations relevant to child health and well being. 
Longitudinal studies in community samples suggest that increased screen time may 
contribute to delayed developmental milestones, increased inattention, and lower language 
skills over time (Madigan, Browne, Racine, Mori, & Tough, 2019; Tamana et al., 2019; 
Tomopoulos et al., 2010). These associations may be especially relevant to subgroups of 
children at increased risk for developmental delays and/or behavioral difficulties, such as 
those with a family history of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention-Deficit/ 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). 
Children with a first-degree relative diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD are at increased 
likelihood for receiving these diagnoses themselves (Miller et al., 2019; Ozonoff et al., 
2011) and are also more likely to experience other behavioral challenges or subthreshold 
symptoms of either disorder (Clifford et al., 2013; Messinger et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2018; 
Toth, Dawson, Meltzoff, Greenson, & Fein, 2007). Children diagnosed with ASD and 
ADHD have been shown to view greater amounts of screen media than typically developing 
children (Ceranoglu, 2018; Lingineni et al., 2012; Slobodin, Heffler, & Davidovitch, 2019), 
putting them at greater risk for the negative effects of increased screen time documented in 
the literature. Children with developmental delays and/or behavior problems may be the 
most vulnerable to the negative effects of excess screen time due to the developmentally 
beneficial interactions that screen time may replace (American College of Pediatricians, 
2016; Pempek, Kirkorian, & Anderson, 2014; Roseberry, Hirsh-Pasek, & Golinkoff, 2014). 
To our knowledge, screen time has not previously been examined in young children with a 
family history of ASD or ADHD, despite the demonstrated associations between screen 
time, language development, and these diagnoses. This study examines the relationship 
between screen time, diagnostic status, and language development in 36-month-old children 
more likely to exhibit atypical development due to a family history of ASD or ADHD. Based 
on the previous literature, we hypothesized that 36-month-old children diagnosed with ASD 
and those with elevated ADHD symptoms would engage in more screen time than 
comparison children. In addition, we hypothesized a negative association between screen 
time and language development. 


This study is a cross-sectional analysis of data at the 36-month time point from a prospective 
longitudinal investigation of children at increased familial risk for ASD and ADHD. The 
research was conducted under the approval of the university’s Institutional Review Board 



and informed consent was obtained for all participants. Clinical assessments were conducted 
by Masters- or Ph.D.-level examiners trained to reliability on all measures and unaware of 
familial risk group, previous test results, or diagnoses. 

2.2.1 Recruitment Groups: The sample included 120 36-month-old children with 
increased likelihood to develop either ASD (n = 62) or ADHD (n = 30) based on the 
diagnostic status of an older sibling (ASD or ADHD) or parent (ADHD), or with no family 
history of either disorder (n = 28) in first, second, or third degree relatives. Participants were 
recruited between 6 and 18 months of age (M = 7.45 months, SD = 2.37). To verify 
recruitment group status, proband diagnoses of ASD were confirmed via diagnostic reports 
from a clinician and a score above the diagnostic cut-off for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012). Proband diagnoses of 
ADHD were confirmed via diagnostic reports from a clinician or documentation of 
treatment for ADHD. When medical records were not available for sibling probands, an 
evaluation was performed by the study team to confirm diagnosis. When medical records 
were not available for parent probands (Familial ADHD group only), eligibility was 
established by self-report of prior ADHD diagnosis and T-scores of ≥ 65 on the ADHD 
Index of the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS; Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, 
1999) as rated by the partner/spouse. Exclusion criteria for the higher-likelihood groups 
(Familial ASD and Familial ADHD) included diagnosis of a genetic disorder in the proband 
and birth before 32 weeks gestation in the participating child. 
The primary inclusion criterion for children in the lower-likelihood group (No Familial 
ASD/ADHD) was status as a younger sibling of a child with typical development. Exclusion 
criteria for this group included birth before 37 weeks gestation; developmental, learning, or 
genetic conditions in any older sibling; and ASD or ADHD in a first-, second-, or third- 
degree relative. 
2.2.2 Outcome Groups: Study participants were classified into one of three groups 
based on a standardized diagnostic evaluation conducted at 36 months of age. The ASD 
group (n = 20) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria for ASD and obtained a score 
over the ASD cutoff on the ADOS-2. The ADHD Concerns group (n = 14) included children 
who exhibited developmentally atypical levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity- 
impulsivity. Though the median age of ADHD diagnosis is 7 years of age (Visser, et al., 
2014), symptoms of the disorder are believed to emerge earlier in development, indicating 
elevated risk for later diagnosis (Curchack-Licktin, Chacko, & Halperin, 2014; Miller et al., 
2018). Following the approach taken by Hatch et al. (2020), children in this group had a 
clinical best estimate outcome of “ADHD Concerns” based on examiner observation during 
the evaluation, 4 or more DSM-5 symptoms of ADHD in either the inattentive or 
hyperactive domain or 5 or more DSM-5 symptoms across both domains, and at least one 
symptom endorsed by 2 or more raters based on the ADHD-RS (parent and teacher report) 
or a DSM-5 checklist (examiner). Children rated by examiners as having elevated ADHD 
symptoms in addition to an ASD diagnosis (n = 6) were included in the ASD group based on 



their primary diagnosis of ASD. The Comparison group (n = 86) included all other 
participants from all recruitment groups who did not meet criteria for ASD or ADHD 
Concerns. 

2.3.1 Screen Time.—Parents completed a questionnaire indicating the number of hours 
their child spent watching television programs, movies, and streaming media content on any 
device on a typical recent weekday and weekend day (rating scale: 0, < 1, 1, 2, 3, or ≥ 4 
hours per day). Responses of less than 1 hour and 4 or more hours were coded as 0.5 and 4 
respectively. Following prior work (Madigan et al., 2019; Zimmerman et al., 2007), a 
weighted daily average was used as the primary variable for analysis, calculated by 
multiplying the weekday response by 5, the weekend response by 2, and dividing the sum of 
these by 7. This resulted in a possible range for the screen time variable of 0 to 4 hours per 
day. 
Most prior studies of screen time have examined time spent watching television and/or 
videos and these activities account for the preponderance of screen time in young children 
(Chen et al., 2019; Rideout, 2017). To facilitate comparison with previous research, a 
question regarding other screen media use (including interactive educational content, playing 
video games, browsing the internet, or using social media) was not included in the 
calculation of screen time for analyses. The amount of time spent on these heterogeneous 
activities did not differ between outcome groups (ps > 0.80) and, consistent with prior 
research at this age (Rideout, 2017), comprised a low proportion (0.22) of total screen media 
use in our sample. 
2.3.2 Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL; Mullen, 1995).—This standardized 
developmental test for children birth to 68 months has high internal consistency (median 
0.91) and test–retest reliability (median 0.84). The Expressive and Receptive Language 
subscale T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) were used in the current analyses to assess language 
development. 
2.3.3 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2).— 
This semi-structured play-based interaction and observation, was administered to all 
participants to assess symptoms, determine outcome classification, and confirm proband 
ASD diagnosis. Following ADOS-2 guidelines, the Module 1 protocol was administered to 
children with language development at the pre-verbal or single word level (n = 18) and 
Module 2 was administered to children with phrase speech (n = 102). 
2.3.4 Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale – Preschool 
Version (ADHD-RS).—The ADHD-RS, a measure demonstrating excellent reliability and 
validity (McGoey, DuPaul, Haley, & Shelton, 2007), was used to collect parent-reported 
ADHD symptoms for outcome group classification. Whenever possible, an additional rater 
familiar with the child (e.g., daycare provider, preschool teacher) also completed the rating 
scale (n = 75). 




Analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by planned comparisons between groups, was 
employed to examine the effects of outcome group on screen time. Regression analyses were 
employed to examine concurrent associations between screen time and receptive and 
expressive language. To control for potential effects of relevant outcome and demographic 
factors, outcome groups (i.e., ASD or ADHD Concerns) were dummy-coded and added to 
the models, as well as sex and maternal education. Interaction terms (i.e., screen time with 
outcome groups, sex, and maternal education) were tested, but none were significant and 
therefore not retained in final models. Variables were entered into the regression models 
simultaneously. 

The effect of family history of diagnosis (i.e., recruitment group) on screen time was not 
significant, F(2, 115) = 1.57, p = 0.21, and therefore recruitment group was not included in 
subsequent analyses. 
Maternal education was significantly correlated with screen time, F(1, 115) = 14.13, p < 
0.001), so it was included in the ANOVAs as a covariate. There was a significant effect of 
outcome group on screen time, F(2, 115) = 4.28, p = 0.002, after adjusting for maternal 
education. Post hoc analyses, using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, 
indicated that this main effect was due to significantly greater mean hours of screen time in 
the ADHD Concerns group (adjusted M = 2.18, Standard Error (SE) = 0.23) than the 
Comparison group (adjusted M = 1.54, SE = 0.09), p = 0.03. There were no significant 
differences (ps > 0.20) in screen time between the ASD group and either the Comparison 
group or the ADHD Concerns group. 
Model parameters for the regression analyses are presented in Table 2. Screen time was 
significantly associated with language scores (receptive: β = −0.31, SE = 0.99, p < 0.001; 
expressive: β = −0.26, SE = 0.95, p = 0.002), after accounting for outcome, sex, and 
maternal education. As expected, ASD status was associated with lower language 
performance (receptive: β = −0.49, SE = 2.31, p < 0.001; expressive: β = −0.52, SE = 2.22, p 
< 0.001) compared to the Comparison group. Male sex was associated with lower expressive 
language scores (β = −0.16, SE = 1.56, p = 0.03). There was no association between sex and 
receptive language scores (β = −0.13, SE = 1.62, p = 0.07). There was no effect of ADHD 
Concerns outcome or maternal education on receptive or expressive language performance. 

This study found that 36-month-old children with elevated ADHD symptoms spent 
significantly more time viewing screen media than the Comparison group. This is consistent 
with prior research demonstrating that older children meeting full criteria for ADHD engage 
in greater amounts of screen time (Ceranoglu, 2018) and suggests that this association exists 
much earlier in development, even when symptoms of ADHD are just emerging. 



Counter to our hypothesis, screen time for children diagnosed with ASD did not differ from 
the Comparison group. Although several previous studies have reported increased screen 
time in children with ASD (for review see Slobodin et al., 2019), a recent nationally 
representative epidemiological study comparing screen time in a large group of children 
with ASD (n = 1393) to those without ASD (n = 64,163) found no group differences 
(Montes, 2016), consistent with our findings. 
There were no differences in screen time based on recruitment group, indicating that screen 
time is associated with behavioral phenotypes and not with likelihood for diagnosis based on 
family history. 
Consistent with our hypothesis, screen time was associated with lower language abilities 
across all groups, with both receptive and expressive language scores decreasing with 
increased screen time. Even when controlling for the expected effects of outcome group, 
children with the highest amount of screen time demonstrated the lowest language 
development. This finding is particularly relevant to our sample, which is already at high 
risk for a variety of delays, including language (Marrus et al., 2018; Mueller & Tomblin, 
2012). 
Although participants were part of a larger longitudinal study, the variable of interest to the 
present analyses was collected at only a single time point and thus directionality of effects 
cannot be established. Both ASD and ADHD are disorders with multifactorial etiologies and 
high heritability (Faraone et al., 2005; Rommelse, Franke, Geurts, Hartman, & Buitelaar, 
2010; Tick, Bolton, Happé, Rutter, & Rijsdijk, 2016), but neither is solely genetically 
determined and there is a great search for environmental factors that may increase risk. It is 
possible that increased screen time may have a negative impact on behavior and 
developmental progress, even if it is not causal to an underlying disorder. Children with 
challenging behaviors, such as those with increased inattention and hyperactivity, may be 
given greater access to screen media by parents to help manage their behaviors (Radesky, 
Silverstein, Zuckerman, & Christakis, 2014; Thompson, Adair, & Bentley, 2013). However, 
these children may be more vulnerable to the loss of real-world learning opportunities 
incurred as viewing time increases and may supplant developmentally beneficial 
interactions, potentially further exacerbating behavioral difficulty. Children in high-risk 
groups may be differentially susceptible to a variety of negative environmental effects on 
development (Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2007), including screen 
time. Additional study of the impact of screen time on children exhibiting developmental 
delay and/or behavioral problems is needed. 
This study is the first to examine relationships among screen time, behavioral outcomes, and 
language in a preschool-aged sample of children at increased risk of developmental and/or 
behavioral challenges. Though most previous studies of screen time have included larger 
community samples, the majority have relied solely on parent report for outcome measures. 
A strength of the current study is our data collection methods, which include diagnostic and 
language assessments conducted by expert examiners unaware of risk status or previous 
testing. 



Our study has several limitations. In keeping with most studies of child media habits, screen 
time data was collected via parent estimates and may not accurately capture, and likely 
underestimates, the amount of screen media viewed by children per day. Data regarding the 
screen media content (e.g., educational vs. entertainment) was not collected, and therefore 
we were unable to examine whether relationships with screen time varied by type of content. 
The results in our sample of children at increased likelihood for ASD and ADHD may not 
be generalizable to other groups at risk for behavioral difficulties or developmental delay. 
Because these data were collected at a single time point, the current analyses cannot address 
the direction of effects and causality. Longitudinal examination of screen time and 
developmental outcomes is necessary to better understand the mechanism of the associations 
and also evaluate diagnostic status in the ADHD concerns group at later ages. Although 
children in the ADHD Concerns group exhibited elevated symptoms of ADHD, given the 
young age of our sample, most did not yet meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The sample in 
this study is being followed longitudinally into later childhood, which will help address 
some of these limitations. 

As hypothesized, higher amounts of screen time were observed in children with ADHD 
concerns and there was a negative association between screen time and language 
development in all outcome groups. Counter to our hypothesis, screen time in children with 
ASD was intermediate to the two other outcome groups and did not differ significantly from 
either group. 
Efforts to increase parental awareness of the potential negative effects of increased screen 
time on child development are necessary given that, on average, children in the United States 
exceed the AAP recommended daily amount of screen time by more than double (Rideout, 
2017). Our study supports the literature demonstrating an association between increased 
screen time and diminished language development in young children and extends the 
findings to include children with below average language development and other delays 
and/or behavior problems. The findings also demonstrate that young children with elevated 
symptoms of ADHD may be the most likely to engage in excess screen time in this age 
group. 
Less screen time is consistently associated with more positive outcomes on a variety of 
measures of development, language, and behavior, although underlying mechanisms are not 
well understood. Screen time reduction is a simple and benign intervention that may have a 
positive effect on child development. Providing increased education and guidance to parents 
including behavioral management support and specific strategies and alternatives to help 
reduce the use of screen time may benefit families with young children, particularly those 
with developmental difficulties.

36-month-old children with elevated ADHD symptoms had the most screen 
time. 
Higher screen time was associated with lower receptive/expressive language 
scores. 
Screen time was associated with behavioral phenotype, not family history of 
ASD/ADHD. 
Increased parent education regarding screen time guidelines, behavioral 
management support and screen time reduction strategies may benefit 
families of young children, particularly those with developmental difficulties.
