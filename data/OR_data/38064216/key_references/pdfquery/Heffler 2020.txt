IMPORTANCE Despite growing evidence that parent-child interactions and time viewing 
digital media affect child development, these factors have rarely been studied in association 
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. 
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of experiential factors, including social activities and 
screen viewing in the first 18 months of life, perinatal factors, and demographic factors, with 
ASD-like symptoms and risk on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at 
2 years. 
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data for this cohort study were derived from the 
National Children’s Study, a US multicenter epidemiological study of environmental 
influences on child health and development. A total of 2152 children were enrolled at birth 
from October 1, 2010, to October 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to 
December 3, 2019. 
EXPOSURES Caregivers reported whether the child viewed television and/or videos (yes or 
no) at 12 months of age, hours of viewing at 18 months of age, time spent by the caregiver 
reading to the child (number of days per week compared with daily) at 12 months of age, and 
frequency of playing with the child (daily or less than daily) at 12 months of age. Prematurity, 
maternal age at birth, child sex, household income, race/ethnicity, and caregiver 
English-language status were included in analysis. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Significant association of exposures with ASD risk by 
M-CHAT and/or ASD-like symptoms assessed by revised M-CHAT (M-CHAT-R) total score in 
multiple regression models. 
RESULTS Among the 2152 children included in the analysis (1099 boys [51.1%]), television 
and/or video viewing (yes or no) at 12 months of age was significantly associated with greater 
ASD-like symptoms at 2 years of age (change, 4.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-8.3%) but not with ASD 
risk (risk prevalence rates, 8.3% vs 4.4%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.40; 95% CI, 
0.86-2.29). Similarly, parent-child play daily compared with less than daily was significantly 
associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms at 2 years of age (change, −8.9%; 95% CI, −16.5% 
to −0.9%) but not with ASD risk (risk prevalence rates, 6.4% vs 14.0%; AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 
0.31-1.08). However, high screen viewing at 18 months of age was not significantly associated 
with ASD-like symptoms (change, 10.7%; 95% CI, −2.0% to 23.0%) or ASD risk by M-CHAT 
(AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.56-2.49) at 2 years of age. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found greater screen exposure and less 
caregiver-child play early in life to be associated with later ASD-like symptoms. Further 
research is needed to evaluate experiential factors for potential risk or protective effects 
in ASD.

creased to a current level of 1 in 59 children in the United 
States.1 Although genetics impart 50% to 80% of risk 
in ASD, nongenetic contribution of risk is also significant but 
poorly understood.2 Perinatal and demographic factors have 
been associated with ASD risk.3-5 However, findings are in- 
consistent regarding the association between socioeconomic 
status and ASD prevalence6,7 and differences in prevalence 
among minority and nonminority populations.1,8 
Early experiential factors, such as screen media viewing 
and parental reading to and playing with one’s children, have 
rarely been studied prospectively in association with ASD 
symptom outcomes. However, greater screen viewing has been 
associated with ASD and negative developmental outcomes.9-15 
Screens interfere with parent-child interactions16 and offer little 
opportunity for learning for infants and toddlers compared with 
real-life social interactions.17-19 In addition, socially engaged 
parenting has been associated with positive child develop- 
mental outcomes.20-23 Because of the potential for these modi- 
fiable experiential factors to contribute to negative and posi- 
tive child development, a better understanding of the 
association of these experiences with ASD outcomes may pro- 
vide opportunities to somewhat mitigate genetic predisposi- 
tion. Using longitudinal data from the National Children’s Study 
(NCS), a US multicenter epidemiological study of environmen- 
tal influences on child health and development,24 we exam- 
ined the extent to which early screen exposure and social en- 
gagement through play and reading as well as previously 
identified perinatal and demographic factors were each asso- 
ciated with later risk of ASD and ASD-like symptoms as mea- 
sured by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers 
(M-CHAT).25 

Data Source and Study Sample 
Participants in this cohort study were enrolled at birth in the 
NCS from October 1, 2010, to October 31, 2012. Data for the pre- 
sent report are from the NCS Archive,24 a publicly available re- 
pository of NCS data and samples in which 5608 children and 
their caregivers participated in at least a portion of the study 
visits from preconception through 42 months of age. Initially 
intended as a large national cohort study of environmental ef- 
fects on children, the NCS was discontinued prematurely by 
the National Institutes of Health. For the present report, only 
children in the subcohort who had an M-CHAT score before NCS 
termination were included. This study was deemed exempt 
from formal approval by the Drexel University institutional re- 
view board and from informed consent because the NCS data 
source contained no personally identifying information. This 
study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa- 
tional Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. 
The study cohort was not intended to be nationally rep- 
resentative. Experiential factors were assessed at 12 months 
of age, with screen exposure also assessed at 18 months of age. 
At the 12-month visit, caregivers answered questions assess- 
ing screen viewing frequency (“Does your child watch TV/ 
DVDs?” [no or yes]), reading frequency (“How often does par- 
ticipant read or look at books with child?” [once a week or less; 
2-4 days a week; 5-6 days a week; or every day]), and care- 
giver play frequency (“How often does participant play with 
toys with child?” [less than daily or daily]). At the 18-month 
visit, screen exposure was assessed with the question, “Over 
the past 30 days, on average, how many hours per day did child 
watch TV and/or DVDs?” Responses were none, 1 hour or less, 
2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, and 5 or more hours. Given that prior 
retrospective research has found early screen exposure of more 
than 4 hours to be associated with ASD,10 the 18-month screen 
exposure variable was recoded as 3 hours per day or less or 4 
hours per day or more. 
Perinatal and Demographic Factors 
Gestational age was coded as very premature (<32 weeks), pre- 
mature (32-35 weeks), or full term (≥36 weeks). Maternal age 
was coded as 34 years or younger, 35 to 39 years, or 40 years 
or older. Household income was recorded on a 4-point scale 
as less than $30 000, $30 000 to $49 999, $50 000 to $99 999, 
or $100 000 or more. English-speaking caregiver was re- 
corded in response to the item, “Was the interview com- 
pleted in English?” (no or yes). Race/ethnicity, included as a 
variable to examine whether outcomes differed across race/ 
ethnicity, was recorded by parent response on the question- 
naire to preset categories determined by the NCS, including 
non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, black, Asian, American Indian/ 
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, mul- 
tiple ethnicities/races, or other. The race/ethnicity was re- 
coded as Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
or non-Hispanic other owing to a small number of respon- 
dents in each of the other race/ethnicity categories. 
Outcomes were assessed using the M-CHAT, a validated 
screening tool to assess ASD-like symptoms among toddlers 
aged 16 to 30 months.25 Primary caregivers completed the 23- 
item M-CHAT, which uses a yes or no response format, when 
their child was 19 to 30 months of age (mean [SD], 26.6 [2.1] 
months). The M-CHAT has 2 different modes of scoring that 
served as outcomes. First, ASD risk was assessed using the origi- 
nal M-CHAT scoring, with a positive screen finding indicated 





Question Are screen media exposure and social and demographic 
factors associated with the risk for autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) or ASD–like symptoms on the Modified Checklist for Autism 
in Toddlers at 2 years of age? 
Findings This cohort study of 2152 children controlled for 
perinatal and demographic variables and found that television 
and/or video exposure and less caregiver-child interactive play at 
12 months of age were each significantly associated with greater 
ASD-like symptoms, determined by total revised Modified 
Checklist for Autism in Toddlers score, but not with the risk of ASD. 
Additional perinatal and demographic findings are discussed. 
Meaning Less screen exposure and more parent-child play at 12 
months of age were associated with fewer ASD–like symptoms at 2 
years of age, and more research on early experiential factors is 
recommended.

by the endorsement of 2 or more critical items or 3 or more of 
any items.25 Because the M-CHAT has a low positive predic- 
tive performance in the general population,26 we also as- 
sessed ASD-like symptoms based on total score of the revised 
M-CHAT (M-CHAT-R), on which higher scores correlate with 
greater specificity.27 Three questions included in the original 
M-CHAT were dropped on the M-CHAT-R owing to poor pre- 
dictive performance.27 Accordingly, total scores were based on 
summing the 20 M-CHAT questions that had content parallel 
to the M-CHAT-R items, with total scores ranging from 0 to 20 
(higher scores indicate greater ASD-like symptoms).27 
quency at 12 months, reading frequency at 12 months, screen 
exposure at 12 months, and screen exposure at 18 months. Like- 
wise, a linear regression analysis was conducted using the total 
M-CHAT-R score as the outcome with the same covariates. In 
the linear regression model, the M-CHAT-R score was cor- 
rected for positive skew using a natural log transformation. For 
ease of interpretation, the results from the linear regression 
models are presented in terms of percentage change calcu- 
lated as (1 − eβ) × 100, where β indicates coefficients from the 
linear regression model. The percentage change can be inter- 
preted as change in the expected M-CHAT-R score of a given 
category compared with that of the reference category of a vari- 
able in percentage scale. To correct for heteroskedasticity of 
the M-CHAT-R score in the linear regression, the robust linear 
model macro28 with the HC3 variance-covariance matrix was 
used. For both logistic and linear regression analyses, 
E-values were computed for each significant risk factor to pro- 
vide an estimate of unobserved confounding.29 E-values es- 
timate the minimum strength of association that an unmea- 
sured confounder would need to have with the risk factor and 
outcome to nullify an observed association. Multiple imputa- 
tion of 100 data sets was conducted to manage missing data 
(12.7% missing) with all study variables included in the impu- 
tation model. All analyses were conducted using SPSS soft- 
ware, version 24.0 (IBM Corporation). 

Participant Characteristics 
A total of 3603 children had 2-year visits in the NCS, and of 
these, the parents of 2231 (61.9%) voluntarily completed the 
M-CHAT; 79 potential participants were ineligible owing to hav- 
ing multiple children from the same families. The population 
for this analysis included the remaining 2152 children (1099 
boys [51.1%] and 1053 girls [48.9%]) (Table 1). Responders in- 
cluded biological parents for 1973 children (91.7%), guard- 
ians for 164 (7.6%), grandparents or other relatives for 11 (0.5%), 
teachers for 2 (0.1%), and child care providers for 2 (0.1%). 
eTable 1 in the Supplement gives characteristics of the study 
cohort (with completed M-CHAT) compared with the non- 
study cohort (children too young at NCS termination or par- 
ents did not elect to complete the M-CHAT). eTable 2 in the 
Supplement compares the county of origin of study and non- 
study NCS cohorts. Overall, 150 participants (7.0%) had posi- 
tive screens on the M-CHAT, including 84 of 1099 boys (7.6%) 
vs 66 of 1053 girls (6.3%). 
Data Analysis 
Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to December 3, 
2019. All variables related to characteristics of the study popu- 
lation were categorical. We present the patient characteris- 
tics as counts and percentages. We fitted a multiple logistic re- 
gression model to estimate the association of demographic, 
perinatal, and experiential factors with ASD risk. The covari- 
ates included in the logistic regression model were gesta- 
tional age, maternal age at birth, child sex, family income, 
English-speaking status of parents, race/ethnicity, play fre-

tion, reading to one’s child less than daily compared with daily 
at 12 months of age was not significantly associated with ASD- 
like symptoms or ASD risk. 
Perinatal and Demographic Factors 
Gestational age of 32 to 35 weeks (compared with ≥36 weeks) 
was associated with greater ASD risk by M-CHAT (AOR, 2.49; 
95% CI, 1.38-4.50) and with greater ASD-like symptoms 
(change, 12.7%; 95% CI, 1.6%-25.2%) when controlling for the 
other factors. Less than 32 weeks’ gestation did not show a sig- 
nificant association with either outcome, likely owing to the 
modest sample of very premature infants. Family income of 
$30 000 to $49 999 compared with less than $30 000 was as- 
sociated with lower ASD risk (AOR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74) 
but not with ASD-like symptoms, whereas family income of 
$50 000 to $99 999 was associated with both lower ASD risk 
(AOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19-0.99) and fewer ASD-like symptoms 
(change, −9.3%; 95% CI, −13.8% to −4.7%), and family in- 
come of $100 000 or more was associated only with fewer ASD- 
like symptoms (change, −13.8%; 95% CI, −17.7% to −7.8%). His- 
panic ethnicity compared with non-Hispanic white ethnicity 
was associated with a higher ASD risk (AOR, 3.38; 95% CI, 2.20- 
5.65) and greater ASD-like symptoms (change, 17.4%; 95% CI, 
8.7%-26.7%). Black (change, 23.9%; 95% CI, 12.9%-35.8%) and 
other (change, 16.5%; 95% CI, 7.0%-27.0%) race/ethnicity com- 
pared with non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity were both as- 
sociated with greater ASD-like symptoms but not with ASD risk. 
Having an English-speaking parent compared with a non– 
English-speaking parent (change, −19.3%; 95% CI, −26.2% to 
−10.5%) was associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms. Ma- 
ternal age and child sex were not significantly associated with 
ASD risk or symptoms. The E-value for the observed associa- 
tion between significant variables and ASD risk ranged from 
4.08 to 6.21 for ASD risk, indicating that the findings could be 
explained away by an unmeasured confounder associated with 
both the individual variable and ASD risk if it had an OR of 4.08 
or greater but that weaker confounding would not do so. The 
E-values for significant risk factors for ASD-like symptoms were 
smaller, ranging from 1.25 to 1.78 (eTable 3 in the Supple- 
ment). 

Experiential Exposures 
The present study is unique in assessing association of early 
experiential exposures with ASD risk and ASD-like symp- 
toms by M-CHAT scores at 2 years of age. A retrospective 
study10 found that 2-year-old children with ASD had an ear- 
lier age of screen viewing (beginning at 6 months) and had more 
than 4 hours of daily screen viewing on average during the early 
years. Given the limited nature of the screen information (view- 
ing of television and/or videos [yes or no]) at 12 months in the 
present study, the association with increased ASD-like symp- 
toms, although modest, is notable. Others have similarly re- 
ported concerns regarding negative social and cognitive out- 
comes associated with screen viewing in children with ASD.30 
Higher screen exposure in young children interferes with so- 
cial learning,16 is associated with altered brain processing,15 and 
theoretically could promote visual brain hyperconnectivity.31 
In siblings of children with ASD who go on to develop ASD, 
overgrowth of the visually related brain areas at 6 to 12 months 
of age is one of the earliest findings.32 However, children pre- 
disposed to ASD may have a preference for screens, or par- 
ents of children already displaying ASD symptoms may be more 
reliant on screens to soothe a child with self-regulation issues.33 
Other factors that affect early screen use are mothers’ own 
screen time and their beliefs regarding children’s television 
time.34 
We found daily parent-child play, compared with less than 
daily, to be associated with fewer ASD-like symptoms. Al- 
though this association was also modest, it is important to con- 
sider the potential mitigating effect of more parent-child play 
on a child’s social development, particularly as it relates to ASD. 
In typically developing children, parent-child interaction cor- 
relates with brain development,35 and parent-child play– 
based intervention in toddlers with ASD is associated with im- 
provement in ASD symptoms.36 However, the association 
between parent-child play and ASD-like symptoms could be 
driven by the behavior of children who are beginning to de- 
velop ASD symptoms because they may be more difficult to 
engage socially. Assessing early social experiences more 
broadly and at an earlier age (eg, 6 months) before a child be- 
gins to exhibit ASD symptoms or brain manifestations would 
help to better establish the directionality of an association be- 
tween social experiences and ASD symptoms in early child- 
hood. 
Demographic and Perinatal Factors 
The present study found lower family income to be associ- 
ated with both greater ASD risk on the M-CHAT screen and 
greater ASD-like symptoms. Some US studies have reported a 
higher prevalence of ASD among families with higher 
incomes,6,37 whereas studies performed in countries with uni- 
versal health care reported lower family income associated with 
greater ASD prevalence.7 These differences may reflect a di- 
agnosis bias or limited access to specialists for those with fewer 
resources in countries without universal health care.7 
An association between immigrant status of the mother 
and higher rates of ASD in the child has been previously 
reported.5 By using non–English speaking as a proxy for care- 
givers’ immigrant status, we found a similar association with 
ASD-like symptoms. In addition, we found greater ASD risk and 
ASD-like symptoms to be present among Hispanic children 
compared with non-Hispanic white children. One study found 
that minority children have a higher initial rate of positive 
screening than white children on the M-CHAT-R and a lower 
rate of positive screening at follow-up but a similar rate of ASD 
diagnosis.38 Historically, lower prevalence rates of ASD have 
been reported in Hispanic children compared with black chil- 
dren, who have had lower rates than non-Hispanic white chil- 
dren, but these differences are narrowing.1 Nonetheless, higher 
rates of ASD in Hispanic and African American or black chil- 
dren compared to non-Hispanic white children have previ- 
ously been reported.8 







Preterm birth was associated with ASD risk and ASD-like 
symptoms at 2 years of age in line with prior research.3 The 
present study did not show any association of maternal age 
with children’s ASD risk or ASD-like symptoms once other risk 
factors were covaried. Greater ASD risk in the offspring of both 
the oldest and youngest groups of mothers4,39 and no asso- 
ciation of maternal age with ASD risk40 have been reported. 
Differences in age groupings across studies may partially ex- 
plain these inconsistent findings. We did not find a signifi- 
cant difference between sexes in either outcome. This find- 
ing may be partially owing to our outcomes being based on a 
symptom questionnaire rather than diagnosis because girls 
with a similar level of ASD symptoms as boys are less likely to 
receive a diagnosis, and the higher language ability of girls may 
partially mask the diagnosis.41,42 
Limitations 
The present study has several limitations. First, analyses were 
limited by the available data from the NCS. Although ASD- 
like symptoms as reported primarily by caregivers on the 
M-CHAT suggest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis, there are 
significant false-positive results on initial screening that can 
be differentially affected by factors such as race/ethnicity and 
parental educational attainment.38 In addition, the cohort had 
a self-selection bias determined by parent interest in complet- 
ing the M-CHAT. Future prospective research on experiential 
risk factors would benefit from use of an actual ASD diagno- 
sis. Second, the assessments of screen exposure and caregiver- 
child interactions were based on single items that do not fully 
capture the quantity, type, and quality of screen exposure or 
parent-child interaction. Assessment of screen exposure at an 
even earlier age that includes exposure time to all types of 
screens and the content and context of viewing could pro- 
vide a more accurate estimate of the association between 
screen exposure and ASD. Optimally, the reading and play data 
would also include more comprehensive assessments across 
multiple ages. The current experiential factors data were based 
on caregiver self-report. Use of a daily diary or recording de- 
vice to detect daily activity regarding caregiver-child joint ac- 
tivities and screen exposure may provide more accurate data. 
Third, the finding that some exposure factors were associ- 
ated with ASD-like symptoms but not ASD risk raises the con- 
cern that the significant difference in ASD-like symptoms driv- 
ing this association could potentially be at the lower level of 
symptoms, possibly representing a variance in ASD-like symp- 
toms in the typical population. Last, based on our reported 
E-values, a relatively small amount of confounding by vari- 
ables not included in our regression models could affect the 
findings. 

This study is unique in prospectively finding that child screen 
viewing at 12 months of age was associated with greater ASD- 
like symptoms, whereas more parent play with the child at 12 
months of age was associated with fewer ASD-like symp- 
toms. Although modest in our findings, this outcome is an im- 
portant area of research because these factors are potentially 
modifiable through parental education. We suggest that pe- 
diatricians thoroughly educate parents regarding the Ameri- 
can Academy of Pediatrics recommendations to avoid screen 
viewing in children younger than 18 months.43 We also found 
prematurity, minority race/ethnicity, and lower family in- 
come to be associated with greater ASD risk and ASD-like symp- 
toms on the M-CHAT, adding to the literature regarding peri- 
natal and demographic risk factors. We suggest the need for 
future studies that assess experiential factors early in life and 
later autism diagnosis to further assess the possible role of 
modifiable risk and protective factors among children at risk 
for ASD. Earlier assessment of modifiable experiential fac- 
tors, such as screen viewing, playing with a child, and other 
indicators of social interaction, as well as consideration of gene- 
factor interactions and the use of brain imaging studies, would 
further assess the extent to which such factors could present 
an increased risk or protective role in ASD.
