ABSTRACT 
Objective: Early years of childhood form the basis of intelligence, personality, social behaviour, and capacity to learn 
and nurture oneself as an adult. Our objective was to find out the effects of screen time on behavior of pre-schoolers, 
which could provide scientific grounds to the control of digital screen time. 
Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted in four private preschools of Islamabad from June -November 2021. A 
sample size of 200 children ages three-five years were selected through multistage random sampling using a parental 
questionnaire. Children were grouped based on daily screen time of ≤60 minutes or >60 minutes. Analysis was made 
based on the Child behavior checklist for ages eighteen months-five years results. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 
found to be 0.925. It was analyzed using SPSS version 22. Chi-square test, independent sample t-test and multi linear 
regression were applied to determine the association and significance levels between the variables. 
Results: Study results indicate increased screen time was statistically significant with child’s age, education level and 
employment status of mothers. It was observed that pre-schoolers with screen time of > 60 minutes tend to suffer 
more from withdrawal syndrome (11.94±3.91, p = 0.014) sleep problems (10.97±3.20, p = 0.010) and Autism spectrum 
problems (17.66±5.89, p = 0.047) as compared to pre-schoolers with screen time ≤60 minutes. Strongest predictor of 
outcome variable was found to be mothers education level (ß = 21.53). 
Conclusion: Study findings revealed that excessive screen time has deleterious effect and is associated with behavioural 
problems of pre-schoolers.

pre-schoolers is defined as three-five years by centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.2 It is recommended 
by American Academy of Paediatrics to limit screen 
time for children aged two-five years to one hour/day.3 
Children’s screen time is increasing, and they start using 
it in earlier years of life. 
 These new trends are concerning because excessive 
screen time in early childhood is associated with 
adverse physical, psychosocial, and cognitive outcomes.4 
Evidence shows that behavior formed during the 
preschool years are stable and can be tracked into late 
childhood.5 Research findings link high screen time with 
irritability, negative mood, cognitive and socioemotional 
development, consequently leading to poor educational 
performance. Another negative impact is on sleep 
quality.6 
In a recent systematic review, moderately strong 
evidence was found between screen time and depressive 
symptoms and weak associations were found between 
screen time and behavior problems, anxiety, hyperactivity, 
inattention, and poor sleep.7 A survey conducted on 1200 
families in U.S, found out 45% children preferred indoor 
activities like watching screens or playing games on 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

devices (43%) as compared to indoor screen-free activity 
like playing with a sibling/friend (26%) or playing alone 
(16%)8 (Fig.1). 
 Studies are more focused on the effects of addictive 
use of digital media on schoolers, but rarely on pre- 
schoolers.6 The major problem regarding this concern 
is that worldwide research has been conducted in this 
regard especially in last five years but unfortunately very 
few studies have been done so far in Pakistan and the 
topic has not been explored in detail. Therefore, studying 
this issue is important to assess the effect of screen time 
on behavior of pre-schoolers in Islamabad. 
 This research is significant in finding the effects of 
screen time on behavior of pre-schoolers. This research 
will further motivate and provide guidelines for parents 
and for kindergarten teachers as well to help decrease 
pre-schoolers screen time and engage them in other 
healthy activities. 

It was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted 
in four private preschools of Islamabad from June 
-November 2021 with a sample size of 200 calculated 
by using formula N=z2 (p × q)/e2. Data was collected 
through multistage random sampling equally divided 
with respect to gender and schools (50 each) from private 
preschools of Islamabad. 
 The independent variable of the study was screen time 
 
of pre-schoolers. The tool used to assess screen time of 
pre-schoolers was SCREENS-Q.9 It is a parent-reported 
standardized comprehensive questionnaire tool to assess 
children’s screen media habits at home. 
 The questionnaire used to assess behavior of pre- 
from CHILD BEHAVIOR 
schoolers was adapted 
CHECKLIST FOR AGES 1½-5 (CBCL/1.5-5), consisting of 
99 items assessed on three - point Likert scale.10 Children’s 
behavior was divided into eight categories, including 
Emotionally Reactive, Anxious/Depressed, Aggressive 
Behavior, Attention Problems, Somatic Complaints, 
Withdrawal Symptom, Sleep Problems and Other 
Problems. The outcome variable of study was behavior 
of pre-schoolers which was kept quantitative. The socio 
demographic variables taken were all qualitative in 
nature, which included age, gender, education level of 
children and parents, primary care giver and employment 
status of parents. Cronbach’s alpha was found to be 0.925. 
Data entry and statistical analysis were done using SPSS 
software version 22. 
 The items forming the outcome variables were reported 
in mean and standard deviation. Socio-demographic 
characteristics and screen time were analyzed using 
chi-square analysis. To compare screen time and CBCL 
Independent samples t-test was used with a p-value 
less than or equal to 0.05 was considered as statistically 
significant. Multiple linear regression was done to check 
for predictors. 



 The study was approved by Ethical Review Committee 
of Pakistan Institute of Ophthalmology, Al-Shifa Trust 
Eye Hospital Rawalpindi (Reference No: ERC-11/AST 
-21) dated 1st June 2021. Informed consent was obtained 
from the parents/ guardians of the respondents in 
written form. 

 Out of 200 participants, 88(44.0%) were five years 
old. Among the participants 100 (50%) were male and 
100(50%) were females. Regarding the education level 
of the children, most of the pre-schoolers were studying 
in early years one, 83 (41.5%). Education level of fathers 
showed, 188(94%) had completed high school or higher 
education. Similarly, education level of mothers had 
shown 188(94%) had completed high school or higher. 
186(93%) parents were primary care givers, employment 
status of fathers had shown that 193(96.5%) were 
employed, 118(59.0%). 
 For 
independent variable, screen time of pre- 
schoolers, the number of screen media devices present 
in the household, 89(44.5%) had one laptop and had

80(40%) one tablet. Two smart phones were present in 
89(44.5%) of participants household. 102(51.0%) had 
one television. Within the past two months, 62(31%) had 
used tablet and 108(54%) had used smart phone every 
day, 119(59.5%) had watched television every day. 
Devices owned by the participants were 33(16.5%) had 
smart phones, 36(18%) of participants had television. 
70(35%) of participants had used screen media devices 
daily, in connection with preschool related activities. 
 On weekdays, within the past two months, 59(29.5%) 
pre-schoolers had spent 30-59 minutes watching 
entertainment programs, 44(22.0%) had spent 30- 
59 minutes playing games on screen media devices, 
57(28.5%) had spent 1-29 minutes on preschool related 
activities. On weekend days, within the past two months, 
54(27.0%) pre-schoolers had spent 30-59 minutes watching 
entertainment programs, 47(23.5%) had spent 1-29 
minutes playing games on screen media devices, 49(24.5%) 
had spent 1-29 minutes on preschool related task. On 
weekdays, within the past two months, 54(27.0%) parents 
had spent 30-59 minutes on entertainment programs, 
1- 29 minutes were spent on video calls by 
58(29.0%) parents, surfing web was 1-29 minutes

were divided into two groups based on screen time of 
less than or over 60 minutes per day. (Table-II) 
 Multiple linear regression conducted to find out 
predictors for the outcome variable. Socio demographic 
characteristics, screen time of child and parents were 
checked during preliminary analysis. (Table-III) 

 This research was aimed to study the effect of screen 
time on behavior of pre-schoolers and to provide 
guidelines for pre-schoolers screen time. The observation 
related to age of child that is five years old having screen 
time > 60 minutes (n=47,23.5%, p = 0.002) agrees with 
previous study that as the child age increases so does 
their screen time.11 Similarly, as education level of pre- 
schoolers is having significant association with screen 
time (n=29,14.5%, p = 0.036). Another finding of present 
study was maternal education level, that was found to be 
the strongest predictor (ß = 21.53). Maternal education is 
also found to be significant in another study conducted 
in Greece on pre-schoolers to determine the factors 
associated with television viewing.12 
 The current study has also shown significant 
association between screen 
time of pre-schoolers 
and employment status of mothers, (n=40, 20.0%, 
p=0.025). There was statistically significant association 
between children and parents screen time ≤60 minutes. 
(n=109, 54.5%, P = 0.001), another study reported that 
parental television viewing time is most important 
determinant of children television viewing time reason.12 
This research was conducted in urban areas of Islamabad, 
rural areas were not included, people living in rural 
areas of Pakistan don’t have good access to screen media 
devices, due to low socioeconomic status and mainly rural 
areas doesn’t have any internet infrastructure. According 
to the Global Information Society Watch, internet usage 
in rural areas of Pakistan is likely to be less than eight 
percent.13 
In current research, those pre-schoolers were included 
who had an access and were inclined towards watching 
screen media devices. Another study reported that lower 
socioeconomic households were consistently meeting the 
screen time guidelines at each time point.14 Pre-schoolers 
studying in public schools were found to have limited 
access to screen media devices. This was the reason public 
preschools were not included in the current study.15 
 Present study identifies that exposing preschooler to 
screen time >60 minutes increases the risk of developing 
withdrawn syndrome (11.94±3.91, p=0.014) and autism 
spectrum problems (17.66±5.89, p=0.047). A study 
conducted at kindergartens of China,6 has also reported 
the association between exposure to screen time in 
early life and the presence of autistic-like behaviours 
among preschool children. According to another study 
conducted in Pakistan on school going children found 
significant association between long-term smartphone 
usage with behavioural and psychological problems.16 
 Another study has mentioned that Television is most 
watched screen-based device among children.17 This 
finding is similar with present research results, where 
 


television is the device that was most watched by pre- 
schoolers (n=119, 59.5%). Screen time is negatively 
associated with the development of sleep problems, 
depression and anxiety as mentioned in the same 
research.17 Another study conducted in Pakistan on 
young children, found that increased screen time is 
associated with aggressive behavior and anger.18 A rapid 
systematic review on psychological burden of quarantine 
in children and adolescents done during the COVID-19 
pandemic also reported restlessness, irritability, anxiety, 
clinginess, and inattention with increased screen time in 
children during quarantine.19 
In this research sleep quality of pre-schoolers is 
significantly associated with screen time >60 minutes 
to a randomized 
(10.97±3.20, p=0.010). According 
control study, conducted in Taiwan, when the screen 
time of children in experimental group was significantly 
reduced, they presented with improved sleep quality and 
attention score.20 
 
Strength: The information this study adds to the medical 
literature is that Education level of pre-schoolers is having 
significant association with screen time. Current study 
has also shown significant association with mother’s 
employment status and screen time of pre-schoolers. This 
study identifies that exposing preschooler to screen time 
>60 minutes increases the risk of developing withdrawal 
syndrome. This study has provided statistically significant 
evidence that excessive screen time has a deleterious 
effect and is associated with behavioral problems of 
preschoolers. Clinicians when evaluating children for 
emotional and behavioral problems must also think of its 
relationship with screen time so that development and 
growth of children are not affected adversely. 
Limitations: Only private preschools were included in 
the study, to enhance the generalizability of the findings, 
future studies should consider a greater number of 
preschools, public as well as private. Effect of screen 
time on language development of children could not be 
researched as well. 

 Study findings have revealed that excessive screen 
time has a deleterious effect and is associated with 
behavioural problems of pre-schoolers. Limiting screen 
time at early ages is important because it helps to keep 
them healthy both psychologically and physically and set 
up good habits. Parents must also think about their child’s 
screen time that requires parents’ active engagement and 
constant attention so that development and growth of 
their children are not affected adversely.
