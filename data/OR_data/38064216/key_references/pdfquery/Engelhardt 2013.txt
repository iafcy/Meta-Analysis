WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD) or attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for sleep disturbances and 
excessive media use. However, the relationship between media 
use and sleep in children with ASD or ADHD has not been studied. 
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In-room access to screen-based media 
and video game hours were associated with less sleep among 
boys with ASD. The relationships between media use and sleep 
were much more pronounced among boys with ASD than among 
boys with ADHD or typical development. 
abstract 
OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationships between media 
use (television, computer, and video games) and sleep among boys with 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with attention- 
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or with typical development (TD). 
METHODS: Participants included parents of boys with ASD (n = 49), ADHD 
(n = 38), or TD (n = 41) (ages 8–17 years). Questionnaires assessed daily 
hours of media use, bedroom access to media, and average sleep hours 
per night. 
RESULTS: Bedroom media access was associated with less time spent 
sleeping per night, irrespective of diagnostic group. Bedroom access to 
a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced 
sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Mul- 
tivariate models showed that, 
in addition to bedroom access, the 
amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated 
with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the re- 
lationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep 
was mediated by hours of video game play. 
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that media-related variables 
may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances 
in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize 
the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals 
with ASD. Overall, the current ﬁndings suggest that screen-based media 
time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may 
be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in 
children with ASD. Pediatrics 2013;132:1081–1089 






Children with neurodevelopmental dis- 
orders are at increased risk for a vari- 
ety of sleep-related disturbances.1 Sleep 
problems are common among chil- 
dren with autism spectrum disorders 
(ASDs), with prevalence rates ranging 
from 50% to 80%,2–5 and include high 
rates of delayed sleep onset and night 
waking.6,7 Children with attention-deﬁcit/ 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also ex- 
perience difﬁculties with sleep, includ- 
ing bedtime resistance and increased 
difﬁculty falling asleep.8 Sleep prob- 
lems are more common among chil- 
dren with ASD or ADHD than among 
typically developing (TD) children9–11 
and can have detrimental effects on 
daytime functioning for both children 
and their families.12–14 
The etiologies of sleep problems in 
individuals with ASD or ADHD are multi- 
faceted, including, for example, disrup- 
tions in circadian rhythms and melatonin 
regulation.7,8 
Because these biological processes are 
primarily inﬂuenced by the light/dark 
cycle,15 children with ASD or ADHD may 
be particularly susceptible to sleep- 
related environmental 
factors that 
emit bright light, such as computer or 
television screens.16 
Screen-based media use is one well- 
established environmental correlate of 
sleep problems in TD children.16 Indeed, 
in-room access to a TV, computer, or 
electronic games has been shown to be 
associated with less total sleep in pre- 
vious studies.17–20 Similarly, children 
who spend more time using these me- 
dia sleep less,17,21–23 
leading some 
researchers to speculate that bedroom 
access to screen-based media may have 
an indirect effect on sleep.16 However, to 
the best of our knowledge, no study has 
speciﬁcally tested this indirect effect 
hypothesis, nor has any study examined 
how media use relates to sleep among 
individuals with ASD or ADHD. 
Screen-based media use may be a par- 
ticularly important variable to consider 
as it relates to sleep in children with ASD 
and ADHD. Compared with TD children, 
children with ASD or ADHD spend more 
time playing video games and watching 
TV,24–27 exhibit higher rates of prob- 
lematic game use,28–30 and have more 
difﬁculty disengaging from screen- 
based media.31 This increased use 
and preoccupation with screen-based 
media, coupled with the potential in- 
ﬂuence of bright screens on melatonin 
production and circadian rhythms, 
might place individuals with ASD or 
ADHD at greater risk for media-related 
sleep problems than TD children. 
The purpose of the current study was to 
examine the relationships between 
bedroom media access, average media 
exposure, and average time spent 
sleeping. The ﬁrst hypothesis was that 
bedroom access (and average expo- 
sure) to screen-based media would be 
associated with less time spent sleep- 
ing. Consistent with research indicating 
that individuals with ASD and ADHD are 
at increased risk for sleep problems and 
problems disengaging from screen- 
based media, our second hypothesis 
wasthattherelationshipsbetweenmedia 
use and sleep would be more pro- 
nounced in the ASD and ADHD groups 
(relative to the TD group). Finally, con- 
sistent with research on media use and 
sleep in the general population,16 we 
speciﬁcally tested the hypothesis that 
in-room access to screen-based media 
would have an indirect effect on total 
sleep time through average media 
hours. 


Parents of boys with ASD, ADHD, or TD 
wererecruitedforparticipationinastudy 
on screen-based media use. Data from 
boys taking melatonin (n = 14) were re- 
moved before analyses. Thus, the ﬁnal 
sample consisted of 128 boys (ASD = 49, 
ADHD = 38, TD = 41) ranging in age from 8 
to 17 years (mean 6 SD: 11.8 6 2.5 
years). The majority of the boys were 
white (85%). Most participants earned 
more than $41 000 per year (63%) and 
were currently married (71%). Some 
participants also indicated that their 
child was taking medications associated 
with insomnia (18%; eg, stimulants) or 
drowsiness (28%; eg, a1 agonists) (see 
Table 1 for demographic characteristics 
by group). 
Boys in the ASD group all had a previous 
diagnosis of ASD, including autistic dis- 
order (42.9%), Asperger’s disorder (26.5%), 
or pervasive developmental disorder 
not otherwise speciﬁed (30.6%). They 
were recruited through an academic 
medical center specializing in the 
treatment and diagnosis of individuals 
with ASD. The standard diagnostic 
process includes evaluation by a phy- 
sician and/or a psychologist and stan- 
dardized diagnostic tools, such as the 
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule32 
and/or Autism Diagnostic Interview– 
Revised.33 Three boys with ASD had an 
IQ of #70, and only 2 were reported 
by parents to have no current use of 
phrase speech. 
Boys with ADHD all had a previous di- 
agnosis of ADHD and were recruited 
through a behavioral and developmental 
pediatrics clinic at an academic medical 
center. 
Boys in the TD group were recruited by 
word of mouth and with the use of ﬂyers 
placed in community locations and in 
local general pediatric ofﬁces. They had 
no previous diagnosis of ASD, ADHD, 
or other developmental disorder (as re- 
ported by their parents); were not tak- 
ing medications for developmental or 
behavioral problems; and did not score 
above clinical cutoffs on the diagnostic 
screening measures described below.

Current ASD symptoms (past 3 months) 
were measured by using the Social

Parents respond to 40 “yes” or “no” 
items, yielding a composite score rang- 
ing from 0 to 39. The SCQ has adequate

using a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 
3 (very often). The Vanderbilt Attention- 
Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent 
Rating Scale has shown adequate re- 
liability in previous research,38 as was 
the case here (Cronbach’s a ranged 
from 0.87 to 0.93 across groups), and 
has been used in previous research 
examining ASD samples.39 
In-Room Access to Screen-Based 
Media 
ADHD symptoms were measured by 
using the 18-item ADHD Total score 
Parents responded to 3 separate ques- 
tions indicating whether their child had 
in-room access to a (1) TV, (2) computer, 
or (3) video game system. 
Average Hours Spent Watching TV and 
Playing Video Games per Day 
Parents indicated the number of hours 
per average weekday and per average 
weekend day their child spent watching 
TV and playing video games (on a com- 
puter or dedicated game system). The 
average number of hours per day (for 
each activity) was calculated by mul- 
tiplying the weekend and weekday re- 
sponses by 2 and 5, respectively, and 
then dividing the sum of this total by 7, 
consistent with previous research.26,30 
Sleep Hours 
Parents were asked “How many hours 
does your child sleep per night?” 

To test our ﬁrst hypothesis, the bivariate 
associations between in-room media 
access and sleep, and the associations 
between daily hours of media and sleep, 
were analyzed separately. Our second 
hypothesis that the relationship be- 
tween these variables differed as 
a function of diagnostic group was 
tested by using general linear models 
(GLMs). Sleep hours served as the de- 
pendent variable; diagnostic group, 
media variable, and group 3 media 
variable interaction terms served as 
independent variables. All GLMs con- 
trolled for the following variables 
(which will not be mentioned further): 
marital status, income, use of medi- 
cations associated with insomnia or 
drowsiness, and age. Our hypothesis 
that the association between in-room 
access to screen-based media and 
time spent sleeping would be mediated 
by the daily hours spent with that 
particular media was tested by using 2 
linear equations.40 Mediation analyses 
were conducted for average TV and 
video game hours separately by group. 







Only boys with complete data on the 
variables included in a speciﬁc analysis 
were retained for that analysis. As 
a result, different degrees of freedom 
were observed across the models 
reported below. Table 2 shows the zero- 
order relationships between all con- 
tinuous variables. All reported means 
depict least square estimates. 

Groups differed on parental marital 
status, total family income, and use of 
medications associated with insomnia 
or drowsiness and on SCQ and ADHD 
Total scores but did not differ on age, 
number of siblings, or race (see Table 1 
for sample characteristics by group). 
The ASD group had higher SCQ scores 
than both the ADHD and TD groups 
(Cohen’s ds = 1.2 and 2.0, respectively); 
the ADHD group had higher SCQ scores 
than the TD group (d = 0.71). The ASD 
and ADHD groups had higher ADHD 
Total scores than the TD group (ds = 2.1 
and 2.4, respectively); 
the ASD and 
ADHD groups did not differ on ADHD 
Total scores. 
A GLM showed that the average number 
of hours spent sleeping per night did 
not differ between the ASD, ADHD, or TD 
groups. The ASD group spent more time 
watching TV and playing video games 
per day than the TD group (ds = 0.54 and 
0.80, respectively); the ADHD group did 
not differ from the ASD or TD group on 
these measures. 

Boys with an in-room TV spent less time 
sleeping per night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6 
1.1 hours) than boys without an in- 
room TV (mean 6 SD: 9.0 6 0.9 
hours; F[1,121] = 16.9, P , .001, d = 
0.70). However, the average amount of 
time spent watching TV per day was 
unrelated to the number of hours spent

Boys with an in-room computer spent 
less time sleeping per night (mean 6 
SD: 7.9 6 1.2 hours) than boys without 
an in-room computer (mean 6 SD: 8.7 6 
1.0 hours; F[1,121] = 9.9, P = .002, d = 
0.72), and boys with an in-room video 
game system slept fewer hours per 
night (mean 6 SD: 8.3 6 1.1 hours) 
than boys without an in-room system 
(mean 6 SD: 8.8 6 1.0 hours; F[1,121] = 
7.2, P , .01, d = 0.48). Additionally, the 
amount of time spent playing video 
games per day was negatively associ- 
ated with the number of hours spent 
sleeping per night (r = 20.50, P , 
.0001). 
Hypothesis 2: Group Differences in 
the Relations Between Media Use 
and Sleep 
The relationship between having an in- 
room TV and sleep was moderated by 
group (F[2,112] = 3.8, P = .03) (see 
Fig 1). Post-hoc mean comparisons 
using Tukey’s adjustment showed that 
the association between having an in- 
room TV and sleep was pronounced 
among the ASD group (t = 4.2, P , .001, 
d = 0.78), but not among the ADHD 
group (t = 0.55, P = .99) or the TD group 
(t = 0.35, P = 1.0). Group diagnosis did 
not moderate the relationship between 
the average amount of 
time spent 
watching TV per day and time spent 
sleeping (F[2,109] = 0.93, P = .40). The 
relationship between having an in- 
room computer and sleep also was 
moderated by group (F[2,112] = 5.2, 
P , .01) (see Fig 2). Post hoc mean 
comparisons using Tukey’s adjustment 
suggests that the association between 
an in-room computer and sleep was 
large in the ASD group (t = 3.7, P , .01, 
d = 1.0) but negligible in the ADHD (t = 
0.64, P = .99) and the TD (t = 0.19, P = 
1.0) groups. The relationship between 
in-room video game access and sleep 
was found to be similar across groups 
(F[2,112] = 1.0, P = .36). The relation- 
ship between sleep and time spent 





medications associated with insomnia 
or drowsiness. Table 3 depicts all model 
results by group. Only the signiﬁcant 
results are discussed. In the ASD group, 
age and average video game hours per 
day were negatively associated with 
sleep, and boys with in-room access to 
a TV slept less than boys without in- 
room access to a TV. No predictors 
were signiﬁcant in the ADHD group. In 
the TD group, age was the only signiﬁ- 
cant predictor, such that older boys 
slept less per night than younger boys. 
Hypothesis 3: Indirect Effects 
(Mediation) of In-Room Media 
Access on Sleep 
In the ASD group, in-room access to 
video games (ie, access to a computer 
or dedicated game system) was asso- 
ciated with daily video game hours (P , 
.0001), and daily video game hours 
were associated with less sleep after 
accounting for the association be- 
tween in-room game access and sleep 
(P , .0001; see Fig 4A). The 95% conﬁ- 
dence interval for the magnitude of this 
indirect effect ranged from 20.42 to 2 
1.50, suggesting signiﬁcant mediation 
(see Fig 4B). Notably, although in-room 
access to a video game was associated 
with less sleep (P , .001) in a simple 
linear regression, 
this relationship 
disappeared (P = .52) after controlling 
for daily video game hours. That is, 
among boys with ASD, the variance in 
sleep hours accounted for by in-room 
access to a game system and/or com- 
puter is largely transmitted through 
average hours spent playing video 
games per day. All other models testing 
for mediation were nonsigniﬁcant and 
are not discussed. 

This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge, 
to examine how access and exposure 
to media relate to sleep among boys 
with ASD, ADHD, or TD. Results showed 
that in-room access to a video game

playing video games per day differed by 
group (F[2,108] = 3.5, P = .03). This in- 
teraction was probed by inspecting the 
bivariate correlations between sleep 
hours and average video game hours 
played per day as a function of group 
(a scatterplot depicting the nature of 
this interaction is shown in Fig 3). 
These analyses showed that the re- 
lationship between sleep and average 
video game hours per day among boys 
with ASD was large (r = 20.70, P , .001). 
This same pattern, although smaller, 
held among boys with ADHD (r = 20.35, 
P = .04) but was nonexistent in the TD 
group (r = 20.10, P = .56). 
Separate GLMs were also conducted 
within diagnostic group to determine the 
extent to which each of these media- 
related variables accounted for vari- 
ability in sleep, the outcome variable, 
while also controlling for age and

consistent with previous research.17,19 
Interestingly, in-room access to a com- 
puter or TV was signiﬁcantly related to 
less sleep among boys with ASD but not 
among those with ADHD or TD. Average 
video game exposure per day was also 
associated with less time spent sleep- 
ing in the ASD and ADHD groups but not 
in the TD group. Among boys with ASD, 
multivariate regression models exam- 
ining the unique contribution of media- 
related variables to sleep revealed that 
in-room TVs and average video game

that in-room access to video games 
had an indirect effect on time spent 
sleeping among boys with ASD. 
Although the current results indicate that 
media-related sleep effects are markedly 
greater among children with ASD, the 
reasons for this ﬁnding are unclear. 
Perhaps the most intuitive explanation is 
that exposure to video games, particu- 
larly at night, intrudes on the amount of 
time that could be spent sleeping, oth- 
erwise known as the displacement hy- 
pothesis.16 Because children with ASD 
have more trouble disengaging from 
screen-based media,31 it may be more 
likely that these media would contribute 
to bedtime resistance and delayed sleep 
onset for this group. Another possibility 
is that exposure to brightly lit screens 
may disrupt melatonin production,41–45 
which could have a particularly detri- 
mental effect on sleep quality in children 
with ASD because they are already at 
risk for abnormally low melatonin con- 
centrations.42–44 Alternatively, media- 
related physiologic arousal may in- 
terfere with sleep onset. For example, 
video game play has been shown to in- 
crease physiologic arousal,46 which 
could be especially problematic if games 
are played immediately before bedtime. 
Given that children with ASD are at risk 
for autonomic hyperarousal,47,48 and 
that hyperarousal has been linked to 
insomnia in the general population,49,50 
these potential physiologic effects may 
be especially pronounced for children 
with ASD. 
Sleep-related disturbances are a clini- 
cally important issue for children with 
neurodevelopmental disorders and their 
families. For example, sleep problems 
can exacerbate and worsen repetitive 
and stereotypic behaviors,51 inattention 
and hyperactivity, and other problem- 
atic daytime behaviors.52–54 Sleep prob- 
lems can also interfere with learning 





and cognition,55 contributing to wors- 
ening functional impairment. Evidence 
also suggests that problems with sleep 
can adversely affect family function- 
the data 
ing.56,57 Although much of 
reported on the relationship between 
sleep problems and outcomes have 
inter- 
been correlational, 
that efforts 
vention studies suggest 
aimed at treating sleep problems can 
help mitigate daytime behavioral prob- 
lems in children with ASD.58,59 


Our study provides important pre- 
liminary information about the relations 
between screen-based media and sleep 
in children with ASD and ADHD. However, 
limitations should be noted. 
several 
First, our measure of sleep consisted of 
a simple parent-reported estimate of 
average nighttime hours of sleep. Future 
research should include more compre- 
hensive standardized sleep measures, 
including multidimensional tools that 
assess different features of sleep, such 
assleep onset, bedtime resistance, sleep 
duration, night waking, and parasom- 
nias.60 Additionally, the use of multiple 
informants, sleep diaries, or objective 
measures (eg, actigraphy) may also be 
helpful.61

An additional limitation of the current 
study is that we were unable to accu- 
rately assess the timing of screen-based 
media use. As a result, although we 
suspect that much of the reductions in 
total sleep time in the current study are 
related to nighttime (versus daytime) 
media use, similar to previous re- 
search,62 we cannot deﬁnitively say that 
this is the case. Therefore, future studies 
in individuals with ASD or ADHD should 
include measures that better approxi- 
mate prebedtime media exposure.62 
Additionally, experimental designs63 may 
be especially helpful in investigating the 
effect of screen-based media on both 
sleep and daytime behavior in children 
with ASD or ADHD. Such studies may 
involve randomized assignment into 
presleep media exposure versus no 
exposure groups to investigate within- 
and between-subject effects. These 
study designs would allow for the most 
direct testing of hypothesized processes 
(eg, displacement, hyperarousal, mela- 
tonin interference) by which media ex- 
posure may affect sleep and behavioral 
outcomes. 
Finally, although diagnostic screening 
instruments and information about 
previous diagnoses were collected, 
comprehensive diagnostic measures 
were not administered as part of the 
current study. Future research on me- 
dia use and sleep in children with ASD 
and ADHD should include gold standard 
diagnostic tools to further examine the 
relationships between these variables 
among well-characterized samples. 

The current ﬁndings suggest that the 
associations between media exposure 
and sleep are more pronounced among 
boys with ASD than among boys with 
ADHD or TD and suggest that in-room 
access to screen-based media and 
time spent playing video games may 
place individuals with ASD at increased 
risk for sleep problems. These ﬁndings 
highlight the importance of considering 
screen-basedmediauseinbothresearch 
and assessment of sleep problems in 
children with ASD. Autism specialists 
and primary care physicians should 
routinely assess screen-based media 
habits when addressing sleep prob- 
lems in children ASD, because this may 
represent an important intervention 
target for improving sleep.

FLIGHT TO THE CITY: We live in a beautiful rural area of Vermont. The views of the 
meadows, mountains, and farms are gorgeous. However, maintaining the yard 
and animals is a lot of work. We cannot simply walk a few blocks or even a few 
miles to a restaurant, and buying milk involves a two mile bike ride or walk. As the 
children leave the nest, my wife and I keep thinking about returning to the city. 
Evidently we are not alone in our thoughts. 
As reported in The Wall Street Journal (August 9, 2013), baby boomers are 
ﬂocking to cities. Hip urban neighborhoods are the new hot spot – not only for the 
young with money, but the middle-aged as well. Baby boomers have been mi- 
grating to the cities since the early 1990s. The movement slowed during the re- 
cession, but has picked up speed again. Based on online real estate brokerage 
data, over the past decade, more than a million baby boomers have moved within 
ﬁve miles of the downtown of the 50 largest cities in the US. 
The reasons for the migration are myriad. Cities are now safer and cleaner, 
offering immediate access to restaurants, theater, movies, concert venues, and 
shops. Often, the commute can be on foot or via public transportation. With children 
out of the house, baby boomers do not have to worry about schools or having 
enough space for all the children and their friends. Many baby boomers like the 
ethnic and age diversity of the city, preferring not to stay in the same spot with the 
same acquaintances forever. One problem with the migration is that the cost to live 
in these trendy areas continues to rise as baby boomers are competing for 
a limited number of condominiums with other baby boomers and young adults. 
While I do not expect we will move anytime soon, as I ride the two miles to buy some 
groceries, I can certainly understand the appeal of city living.
