Abstract 
Research problem 
Advances in technology have ensured its inevitable integration in our life. Children, being at a vulnerable 
age period of development, are spending more time on electronic devices. Some studies reported negative 
effects on sleep, physical health such as obesity and vision problems, and behavioral changes such as 
aggressive behavior with exposure to violent media content. 

We will study the effect of using electronic devices on communication skills in children in Saudi Arabia. Our 
findings can be used to raise awareness on this matter. 

The aim of our study is to examine the association between screen time and social communication skills 
among children of four years to six years of age in Saudi Arabia. 

A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the relationship between social skills development and 
screen time by using a validated Arabic version of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). The 
sample in this study consists of 308 children from four to six years of age. 

The results showed that the hours spent using the electronic device were significantly associated with having 
an SCQ score ≥ 15 (P < 0.05). A high SCQ score was prevalent in 19.7% (n = 31) of children who spent >3 
hours using an electronic device compared to 10.2% (n = 5) and 7.84% (n = 8) of children who spent an hour 
or <2 hours using electronic devices, respectively. 

Our study highlighted a significant association between the daily hours spent on devices and having an SCQ 
score above 15, which suggests a deficit in social skill development and having autism spectrum disorder- 
like symptoms.

Introduction 
Advances in technology have ensured its inevitable integration in our life. Children, being at a vulnerable 
age period of development, are spending more time on electronic devices. Some studies have reported 
negative effects on sleep, physical health such as obesity and vision problems, and behavioral changes such 
as aggressive behavior with exposure to violent media content [1-3]. However, the benefits of using 
electronic devices are undeniable. To list a few, electronic devices have facilitated social communication 
among children in this period of repetitive lockdowns and restricted outdoor activities. In addition, it has 
revolutionized learning as children have easy access to educational content [3]. Hence, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics has made age-specific recommendations for media use by children that balance its 
risks and benefits. 






 


of age for a duration not exceeding one hour a day. Children above 5 years can watch alone while adhering to 
clear restrictions on screen time and program types that are left to the caregiver to set, avoiding negative 
effects on the child’s sleep, behavior, or other aspects of health [4]. Similarly, the World Health Organization 
recommends that children of 4‒6 years of age should not exceed one hour of screen time in a day [5]. The 
Saudi Ministry of Health makes the same recommendations as the American Academy of Pediatrics 
guidelines [5]. 
Healthcare professionals are interested in tracking developmental milestones in children, which can be 
divided into the following domains: motor skills, social/emotional, language/communication, and cognitive 
domains. In regard to social development, children of 4‒6 years of age are expected to show interest in other 
children, play in groups, desire being liked by friends, and understand the concept of cooperation and 
apology [6]. In contrast, ignoring other children, being excessively shy, and failing to recognize others’ 
feelings are considered red flags of developmental delay for ages 4, 5, and 6 years, respectively [7]. 
In regard to language and communication development, children of 4‒6 years of age are expected to be able 
to tell stories and describe events [6]. If children aged 4, 5, and 6 years fail to answer simple questions, 
rhyme, and tell clear stories, respectively, they have probably missed a milestone [7]. We postulate that 
those milestones can be disturbed by increased screen time. Using the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventor, a 
study found that increased screen time is associated with lower social skills in preschool children 
[8]. Another study among preschool children found that increased screen time was associated with lower 
prosocial skills in boys but higher prosocial skills in girls [9]. 
Moreover, another study conducted among preschoolers in China indicated that the risk of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD)-like symptoms increases remarkably in preschoolers whose screen time is >2 hours a day [10]. 
Another study found that early age of screen exposure increases the incidence of autistic behaviors among 
preschoolers [11]. A study in Japan showed that the average use of mobile phones was 24 hours per week 
[12]. 
A few studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia to identify the most used devices and determine the exposure 
to these devices. The most used devices are the television, followed by mobile phones and tablets then 
followed by Computers, In addition children use electronic devices for >4 hours per day [13]. Moreover, there 
is another study that shows that smartphones are the most common devices used by children (mean usage of 
28.5±27 hours per week), followed by tablets (7.5±15 hours per week) and laptops (3±7.4 hours per week). The 
median duration of use of all the devices together was 35 hours per week [14]. 
An interesting finding by a study shows that higher-quality screen exposure has been linked to better 
language skills, whereas higher-quantity screen exposure, introduced early in development, has been linked 
to lower language skills [15]. There are not enough data on the association between screen time exposure 
and ASD-like symptoms such as delay in language development, unusual social interactions, odd play 
patterns, and unusual communication patterns [16]. 
Our study aimed to examine the association between screen time and social communication skills among 
children of 4‒6 years of age in Saudi Arabia and identify the factors associated with high SCQ scores. 
Materials And Methods 
A cross-sectional survey design was conducted to examine the relationship between social skills 
development and screen time using a validated Arabic version of the Social Communication Questionnaire 
(SCQ) [17]. The sample in this study consists of 308 children aged 4‒6 years. Data were collected in two 
steps: first, the researchers shared a form through different social media platforms to collect personal 
information and contact data of interested participants. Three hundred and eight participants showed 
interest in participating in this study and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) was sent to them. 
The inclusion criteria were children aged 4‒6 years. The exclusion criteria were non-Arabic-speakers and 
children with developmental disorders or cognitive delay. Also the aim of this study was to study the 
association between screen time and social communication skills among children of four years to six years of 
age in Saudi Arabia. 

The Social Communication Questionnaire consists of 40 items. It is a parent-reported scale that can be used 
to screen for symptoms associated with ASD. We used a validated Arabic version of SCQ with a Cronbach’s 
alpha coefficient of 0.916, showing high reliability. It also showed high sensitivity and specificity of 0.796 
and 0.966, respectively. The 40 items are dichotomous, with only ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as possible answers. Item 1 is 
only used to assess whether the child can speak with short phrases or sentences, while Items 2 through 40 
are used for the actual scoring. Items 2, 9, and 19 through 40 are negatively worded wherein individuals are 
awarded 1 for response option no and 0 for yes. This reduces the need to reverse the scores. For the other 
items (i.e., Items 3 to 8 and 10 to 18), a score of 1 is awarded if the answer is yes and 0 otherwise. 



Statistical analysis was performed using R v 3.6.3. Counts and percentages were used to summarize the 
categorical variables. The means ± standard deviation or the median/interquartile ranges were used to 
summarize the distribution of normal and non-normal continuous variables, respectively. The chi-square 
test was used to investigate the association between categorical variables. Linear regression was used to 
assess the factors associated with higher total SCQ scores. Hypothesis testing was performed at 5% level of 
significance. 
Results 
Descriptive statistics 
The study survey was completed by the caregivers of 308 children (39.6% females and 60.4% males). 
Approximately half of the respondents were mothers (57.5%) and 17.5% were fathers of the children. The 
questionnaire was completed by brothers/sisters and aunts in 12.3% and 12.7% of the cases. Respondents 
aged 4, 5, and 6 years represented 34.7%, 26.3%, and 39% of the study sample, respectively. The majority of 
the parents for the included children lived in the same house (91.9%). The remaining parents were either 
separated (6.17%) or widowed (1.95%) (Table 1). 


























 


 

 


 


 


 

 



 

 



 


 


 


 


 


 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 












Regarding the education level of the caregivers, 63.3% of the respondents had completed university 
education, 21.4% had a postgraduate degree, and 8.44% of the respondents had completed only high school. 
Tablets and iPads were the main devices used by 40.3% of the children. Mobile phones and televisions were 
the main devices used by 26% and 26.6% of the children, respectively. Approximately half of the children 
had a personal device (43.5%); less than one quarter shared devices with the family (20.1%); and 36.4% did 
not have a personal device. One-half of the respondents (51%) spent more than three hours using the 
electronic device daily; one-third used it for two hours daily (33.1%); and 15.9% used it for an hour or less 
daily (Table 1). 
The results showed that 20.4% of the children had problems with social chat, and 20.1% could not 
understand non-verbal communication. One-third of the respondents (34.1%) were not interested in peers; 
a similar number did not have a best friend (32.1%); and 40.3% did not use gestures to draw attention. Only 
7.7% of the children had problems with active communication, and only 7.1% did not have a normal range of 
facial expressions (Figure 1). 


 



 

 



 



 
 
 
 
 


created words; and 35% used verbal rituals. Moreover, 51.9% of the children had an unusual intensive 
interest in things (Figure 2). 
The average SCQ score was 9.26 ± 5.19, with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 30, respectively. The 
distribution was fairly normal. A total of 44 (14.3%) respondents had a high SCQ score, defined as a score 
≥15. The chi-square test was used to examine the factors associated with high SCQ scores. These factors 
included the sex and age of the child, hours spent using electronic devices, ownership of a personal device, 
and the type of device used (Figure 3). 






The results showed that the hours spent using the electronic device were significantly associated with having 
an SCQ score ≥ 15 (P < 0.05). A high SCQ score was prevalent in 19.7% (n = 31) of children who spent >3 
hours using the electronic device compared to 10.2% (n = 5) and 7.84% (n = 8) of children who spent an hour 
or less and 2 hours using the electronic device, respectively. The marital status and education of the 
caregiver showed a significant association with a high SCQ score, although the association was significant at 
the 10% level only. The age and gender of the child were not significantly associated with an SCQ score ≥ 
15 (Table 2). 


Linear regression (Table 3) was used to examine the factors associated with high SCQ scores (as a continuous 
variable). So the linear regression analysis showed that gender was significantly associated with the average

SCQ score (B = 1.37, P < 0.05), indicating that the average SCQ score is higher by 1.37 points in males than 
females. Age did not show any significant association with the SCQ score. The time spent using the 
electronic device was significantly associated with the average SCQ score (B = 1.3, P < 0.05), which indicates 
that the average SCQ score is higher by 1.3 points in respondents who spent ≥3 hours daily using the 
electronic device than respondents who used the electronic device for <3 hours daily (Table 3). 
Discussion 
This study aimed to investigate and provide a new insight into the relationship between prolonged 
electronic device exposure and autism-like symptoms based on the assumption that excessive use of 
electronics may lead to ASD-like symptoms. A self-administered questionnaire containing the Social 
Communication Questionnaire scale (SCQ) was used for preschool children, and other variables added 
including a question about the hours spent on devices by children. 
The results indicate that most of the children used electronic devices for >3 hours daily. Surprisingly, the 
study highlighted a significant association between the daily hours spent on devices and having an SCQ 
score above 15, which suggests that children using electronic devices for >3 hours daily may suffer from 
ASD-like symptoms, indicating the need for further comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the 
diagnosis. Additionally, the results show that the average SCQ score is higher in participants using the 
electronic devices for >3 hours even if they did not reach the cut-off point of an SCQ score = 15. However, 
the type of association - causation or coincidence - has not yet been established. 






































 







 
 


 
 


















 
 









 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 




A cohort study of 2152 children was conducted to determine the association between screen 
time exposure in the first 18 months of life and the development of ASD-like symptoms using the Modified 
Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at two years. This study showed that screen time exposure early 
in life can be associated with ASD-like symptoms [18]. Interestingly, previous studies concluded that ASD 
children have a remarkable attraction to screen viewing at a younger age compared to their healthy peers. 
This is explained by their nature of having less social leisure [19] and preference for computing activity over 
social network browsing because it is very demanding for them to be socially engaged [20]. 
Moreover, previous research has proven that the severity of ASD symptoms is proportionate to screen time, 
clearly recognized in atypical sensory responsiveness and greater susceptibility to developmental delay, 
specifically in the language domain [21]. Simultaneously, the reverse casualty must be considered. Our data 
failed to show a significant relationship between an SCQ score above 15 and the marital status and 
education of the caregiver or the age and gender of the child. Contrary to our expectations, although the 
majority of the participants’ caregivers was well educated and expected to be aware of the risk of 
overexposure, most of the children had personal devices, with the tablet being the most common. Therefore, 
it is crucial to emphasize the risk and benefits of these electronic gadgets. 
In line with our hypothesis, a large-scale study conducted in Korea on toddler children to determine the 
effect of screen time on language development through multiple interviews and questionnaires found that 
language delay is proportional to screen time, with a 2.7 times greater risk for those who spend 2 hours of 
watching television [22]. The reliability of this data is impacted by several factors. 

First, data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic when all schools and kindergartens had shifted to 
virtual classes and activities. Second, this study was subject to reporter bias as it relies on caregiver recall. 
Third, our study was limited to caregiver who uses social media. 
Conclusions 
This study has shown that there is a significant association between daily hours spent on devices especially 
three hours and more and having an SCQ score above 15, which may suggest a possible ASD-like symptoms. 
However, the type of association has not yet been established. Our findings can be used to raise awareness 
on this matter and help set guidelines on the use of media for children. Future studies are required to assess 
association.
