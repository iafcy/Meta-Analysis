Abstract 
Although electronic technology currently plays an integral role for most youth, there are growing concerns of its excessive 
and compulsive use. This study documents patterns and impact of electronics use in individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder compared to typically developing peers. Participants included 172 parents of typically developing individuals 
and 139 parents of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, ranging in age from 6 to 21 years. Parents 
completed an online survey of demographics and the frequency, duration, and problematic patterns of electronics use in 
their youth and young adults. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder were reported to use certain electronics more 
often in the last month and on an average day, and had greater compulsive Internet and video game use than individuals 
without autism spectrum disorder. Across both samples, males used video games more often than females. Compared 
to parents of individuals without autism spectrum disorder, parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder were 
significantly more likely to report that electronics use was currently having a negative impact. The implications of 
problematic electronics use for individuals with autism spectrum disorder are discussed.

Electronic technology currently plays an integral role in 
the lives of youth around the world (Durkin et al., 2010; 
Madell and Muncer, 2004). The vast majority of youth 
spend a considerable amount of time engaged in electronics 
use, playing video games, using computer applications, 
and carrying cell phones (Madell and Muncer, 2004; 
Willoughby, 2008; Witt et al., 2011), and there is research 
on positive and negative characteristics associated with 
these activities (Green and Bavelier, 2007). There has also 
been an increasing emphasis on electronics use in youth 
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Mazurek, 2013; 
Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013a, 2013b; Mazurek and 
Wenstrup, 2013). Understanding the frequency, type, and 
impacts of electronics use for individuals with ASD is 
important for ensuring that policies and programs are in 
place to maximize the benefits and address any problems 
associated with its use. 
Parents and caregivers report that individuals with ASD 
spend more time on electronic screen media (which 
includes video game use) compared to any other leisure 
activity (Shane and Albert, 2008). Approximately 41% of 
parents participating in the US National Longitudinal 
Transition Study-2 reported that their child with ASD 
(aged 13–17 years) spent most of his or her free time play- 
ing video games (Mazurek et al., 2012), and parents of 
boys with ASD reported that their sons spent more time 
playing video games per day (on average 2.1 h/day) than 
typically developing boys (on average 1.2 h/day) (Mazurek 
and Engelhardt, 2013b). In the general population, gender 
differences are observed in the use of video games, 
with males spending more time on video game playing 
(16.4 h/week) than females (9.2 h/week) (Gentile, 2009; 
Willoughby, 2008; Witt et al., 2011).

Many individuals with ASD are particularly drawn to 
video games and other screen-based entertainment, and 
spend a considerable amount of time engaged in these 
activities (Mineo et al., 2009; Shane and Albert, 2008).

There may be some key differences in the type of elec- 
tronics use between those with and without ASD. In a survey 
of 91 adolescents with ASD and their parents, 98% of 
youth reported that they used a computer on any given day 
for an average of 4.9 h (Kuo et al., 2014). With regard to 
social electronics use, though, children with ASD spend 
significantly less time using email, Facebook, or texting 
than their typically developing siblings (Mazurek and 
Wenstrup, 2013). In a small sample of 35 adolescents with 
Asperger syndrome, Durkin et al. (2010) reported that 
60% used a cell phone, compared to 94% of a matched 
typically developing sample. Compared to the comparison 
group, individuals with ASD were less likely to value calling 
peers and were more likely to use mobile phones for games 
than their peers. 

There is growing concern about the impact prolonged elec- 
tronics use may have on youth both with and without ASD. 
Studies have highlighted addictive characteristics associated 
with Internet use, such as withdrawal when Internet use 
is impossible, inability to manage time spent online, and 
conflicts about Internet use (Chou et al., 2005; Kerkhof 
et al., 2011; Meerkerk et al., 2009). Problematic Internet use 
(also known as compulsive Internet use) is characterized: 
by continued use of the Internet despite the intention to stop, 
Internet use dominating a person’s cognitions and behaviors, 
unpleasant emotions when Internet is impossible, the use of 
Internet to escape from negative feelings, and Internet use 
which results in conflict with others or with oneself. (Meerkerk 
et al., 2009: 3) 
In adults, problematic Internet use is associated with feelings 
of loneliness (Morahan-Martin and Schumacher, 2000), 
depressive feelings (Van den Eijnden et al., 2008), and 
diminished relationship quality (Kerkhof et al., 2011). The 
addictive potential of Internet applications, combined with 
the impulsive and premature adolescent brain, means that 
adolescents may be particularly susceptible to problematic 
Internet use (Van den Eijnden et al., 2010). 
Problematic video game use has also emerged as a 
major concern for adolescents, with characteristics simi- 
lar to other forms of dependency. Youth have been found 
to steal money to play or buy games, skip school to play, 
ignore academic tasks and social activities to play games, 
become irritable if unable to play, and report playing for 
longer than intended (Griffiths and Hunt, 1998; Griffiths 
and Meredith, 2009). Online gaming, in particular, may 
be even more problematic than games that are offline, 
combining the issues surrounding both video game use 
and Internet use (Griffiths et al., 2004). Grüsser et al. 
(2006) found that in a sample of 7069 game players 
(M = 21.11 years, standard deviation (SD) = 6.35), one out 
of nine met at least three diagnostic criteria of gaming 
addiction based on the dependence syndrome outlined 
by the World Health Organization: “craving, tolerance, 
withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, neglect of other 
activities, and other negative consequences” (Griffiths and 
Meredith, 2009: 248). 
Individuals with ASD may be particularly susceptible 
to problematic electronics use (including both problem- 
atic Internet and video game use), and research and 
anecdotal evidence suggest that problematic electronics 
use is associated with social, behavioral, and academic 
challenges in families of children with ASD. Like many 
typically developing individuals with problematic 
Internet use (Caplan, 2003), individuals with ASD are 
noted to prefer online communication over face-to-face 
interaction (Benford, 2008; Mazurek and Wenstrup, 
2013) and have a propensity toward computer-mediated 
communication (Burke et al., 2010). One recent study 
found an association between ASD symptoms and com- 
pulsive Internet use in a non-clinical adult sample 
(Finkenauer et al., 2012). A second study found that boys 
with ASD (n = 56) had more problematic video game use 
compared to typically developing boys (n = 41) (Mazurek 
and Engelhardt, 2013b). Individuals with ASD are more 
likely to report having difficulty disengaging from playing 
video games, feeling upset when not able to play, getting 
angry when interrupted from games, and playing longer 
than intended compared to their typically developing 
siblings (Mazurek and Wenstrup, 2013). Furthermore, 
problematic video game use was predictive of opposi- 
tional behavior in boys with ASD (Engelhardt and 
Mazurek, 2014). 

We are just beginning to understand the phenomenon of 
electronics use for individuals with ASD. The existing 
research indicates that individuals with ASD are actively 
engaging in electronics; however, most studies have exam- 
ined general electronics use, so we know little about the 
pattern of electronics use across the electronic devices 
(e.g. tablets) and electronic activities (e.g. video games, 
Internet, social activities, and general computing) now 
available. Few studies have included male and female par- 
ticipants with ASD, along with a typically developing 
comparison group, so we do not know how this electronics 
use differs by gender in individuals with ASD, compared 
to same age peers. Furthermore, research has yet to explore 
the issue of problematic Internet use along with problem- 
atic video game use in youth with ASD and the impact of 
such use on youth and their families. This study explores 
the experience of electronics use (age of use, duration and 
frequency, interference, or compulsion) across a host of 
different electronics types, by gender and compared to a 
typically developing comparison group. This is also the 
first study to examine the reported impact of electronics 
use for individuals with ASD and their families.

Based on previous research that examined rates of elec- 
tronics use (Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013b), we hypoth- 
esized that individuals with ASD would begin using 
electronics at a younger age and have higher rates of elec- 
tronics use (both frequency and duration) than same-aged 
individuals without ASD, with non-social activities being 
more common than social ones. We also hypothesized that 
individuals with ASD would have higher rates of problem- 
atic Internet and video game use than individuals without 
ASD. Finally, we predicted that parents of individuals with 
ASD would be more likely to report that electronics use 
negatively impacted their child’s life and their family life 
compared to parents of individuals without ASD. 


Participants originally included 195 parents of typically 
developing youth and 149 parents of youth diagnosed with 
ASD between 6 and 21 years of age. All parents completed 
the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) about 
their son or daughter to determine eligibility for the study 
(Berument et al., 1999), which has strong diagnostic validity 
(Berument et al., 1999). Based on previous research and 
recommendations from the developers, this study used the 
clinical cutoff of 12 to increase sensitivity (Corsello et al., 
2007; Zablotsky et al., 2012); individuals in the comparison 
group were included if they had an SCQ score lower than 
12 (23 participants were excluded out of the 195), and 
individuals in the ASD sample had to have a score of 12 or 
greater (10 were excluded out of the 149). Previous research 
has validated the use of parent reports of professional ASD 
diagnoses in Internet-based research, especially when

combined with reliable screening measures (Daniels et al., 
2012). 
The final sample included 172 parents of typically 
developing children (M = 11.72, SD = 3.61) and 139 parents 
of children with an ASD diagnosis (M =12.25, SD = 3.97). 
There was no difference in the age of youth in the two 
samples, t(309) = −1.22, p = 0.22, or in levels of family 
income between groups, U = 11,701, z = −0.11, and p = 0.92 
(See Table 1). As shown in Table 1, there were also no 
significant differences between the two samples on gender, 
nationality, marital status, and minority status. Reported 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(4th ed., text rev.) diagnoses for the ASD group included 
autism (51.8%, n = 72), Asperger syndrome (36.0%, n = 50), 
and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speci- 
fied (PDD-NOS; 10.8% n = 10), with one individual who 
had a pending diagnosis but had an SCQ score above the 
clinical cutoff. The vast majority of individuals in both 
groups were reported by parents to be able to talk using 
short phrases or sentences, although fewer in the ASD 
group compared to the comparison group (92.1% vs 
99.1%, respectively), χ2 = 11.14, p = 0.001. 

Convenience and snowball sampling were employed to 
recruit parents of children with an ASD diagnosis using 
several Canadian and US Asperger syndrome and ASD 
organizations. Emails were sent to these organizations ask- 
ing whether our recruitment flyer could be emailed to indi- 
viduals on their listserve, posted on their website, and/or 
displayed onsite. Our recruitment flyer explained that we 
knew that electronics use was associated with advantages 
and possible concerns and that we wanted to understand 


 
 
 
 



the benefits and the problems of electronics use. The 
recruitment flyer also included a link to the consent form 
and survey. Qualtrics panel management, whose panel is 
for research purposes only, was employed to email parents 
of children without an ASD diagnosis. Qualtrics emailed 
invitations to their participant lists, ensuring a representa- 
tive sample of new and old members, until the comparison 
group reflected the distribution of our ASD sample in 
terms of age, gender, and country (Canada and the United 
States). After giving informed consent, parents completed 
online measures of demographics, electronics use, and 
social interaction. The survey took approximately 20 min 
to complete. Surveys were completed between October 
2012 and May 2013. The survey was approved by the uni- 
versity research ethics board. 

Electronics use. Parents were asked whether their child 
knew how to use a number of electronic devices (lap top 
computer, desk top computer, iphone or other smart phone, 
and ipad/ipod/tablet) and electronic activities (play video 
games on a computer, play video games on a console, play 
video games on a portable gaming system, surf the web, 
use a search engine, watch videos, create a web page, 
download music files, create documents for school, save 
or edit images/graphics, use a photo editing program, use 
social networking sites, talk on a cell phone, text mes- 
sage on a cell phone, instant message with friends, visit a 
chat room, send and receive emails), similar to Witt et al. 
(2011). Activity items were totaled to create four subscales: 
video games (i.e. play video games on a computer, play 
video games on a console, play video games on a portable 
gaming system); Internet (i.e. surf the web, use a search 
engine, watch videos, create a web page, download music 
files); social (i.e. use social networking sites, talk on a cell 
phone, text message on a cell phone, instant message with 
friends, visit a chat room, send and receive emails); and 
general computing (i.e. create documents for school, save 
or edit images/graphics, use a photo editing program). Par- 
ents were then asked, using a 12-point Likert scale ranging 
from 1 (less than 4 years old) to 12 (older than 14 years 
old), the age at which their child started using each of the 
electronic devices and activities that were endorsed (that 
the youth knew how to use or do). Parents were also asked 
how often in the last month (i.e. frequency) their child used 
the electronic devices and activities on a 7-point Likert 
scale, ranging from 1 (less than once a month) to 7 (daily) and 
about the amount of time on an average day (i.e. duration) 
that their child used the electronic devices and activities 
on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (less than 30 min) 
to 6 (more than 3 h). Since parents of youth and young 
adults are unlikely to know the precise number of hours 
their child uses electronics, Likert scales were used to bet- 
ter capture the general trends of electronics use. 
Impacts of electronics use. Parents were asked whether 
their child’s electronics use was currently causing prob- 
lems for them or their child in any way (yes/no). If the 
parents responded yes, they were asked to select all of 
the relevant ways in which electronics use was currently 
causing programs (i.e. significantly impacting child’s 
social life in a negative way, significantly impacting 
child’s education in a negative way, and/or significantly 
impacting their family life in a negative way), with 
higher total scores reflecting more negative impact. Parents 
were also asked whether their child’s electronics use 
caused problems for them or their child in the past, which 
were not currently causing problems (yes/no). If parents 
responded yes, they were asked to select all the relevant 
ways that electronics use caused problems for them or 
their child in the past, which were not currently causing 
problems (i.e. significantly impacted child’s social life 
in a negative way, significantly impacted child’s educa- 
tion in a negative way, significantly impacted family life 
in a negative way), with total scores reflecting greater 
past impact. 
Problematic Internet use. Problematic Internet use was 
assessed using the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS; 
Meerkerk et al., 2009). The CIUS consisted of 14 items 
that assess compulsive Internet use (e.g. “I find it difficult 
to stop using the Internet”). The items were adapted for 
caregiver reporting, and rated on a 5-point Likert scale 
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The scale has 
shown good factorial stability over time and across differ- 
ent samples. The CIUS was reported to have high internal 
reliability (α = 0.88) and good validity (Meerkerk et al., 
2009). In this study, the internal consistency for the CIUS 
was α = 0.94. 
Problematic video game use. Problematic video game use 
was measured by replacing “Internet” with “video game” 
in the CIUS. In research, problematic video game is consid- 
ered a specific problem, separate from problematic Internet 
use (e.g. Mazurek and Engelhardt, 2013a; Meerkerk et al., 
2009). In this study, the internal consistency for problematic 
video game use was α = 0.96. 

Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were con- 
ducted with diagnosis and gender as between-subject 
factors to examine potential differences in ability to use 
electronics, age at which youth began using electronics, 
frequency and duration of electronics use, as well as 
impacts of electronics use. All statistical analyses were 
carried out with SPSS 21.0 software, using two-tailed 
tests with α = 0.05. Missing data were handled using pair- 
wise deletion.

As shown in Table 2, two-way ANOVAs indicated no 
diagnosis by gender interactions for the total number of 
electronic devices or activities that youth knew how to use. 
Individuals with ASD were reported to be able to use sig- 
nificantly more electronic devices (M = 3.82, SD = 1.04) 
than the comparison group (M = 3.42, SD = 1.13), although 
the effect size was small. There were significant main 
effects of both diagnosis and gender for the ability to play 
video games, with the comparison group having the ability 
to play significantly more video game type activities 
(M = 2.75, SD = 0.60) compared to individuals with ASD 
(M = 2.35, SD = 0.99) and males having the ability to 
play significantly more video game activities (M=2.63, 
SD=0.75) than females (M = 2.41, SD = 0.99), with a small 
effect size. The main effect of diagnosis, but not gender, 
was significant for social activities, with individuals with 
ASD using electronics for fewer social activities (M = 2.07, 
SD = 1.99) than the comparison group (M = 3.39, SD = 2.17). 
No main effects were significant for Internet activities and 
general computing activities. Among individuals with 
ASD, SCQ symptom severity was significantly correlated 
with the number of electronic activities that they knew 
how to use, r = −0.19, p = 0.03, although the size of the cor- 
relation was small. 

As shown in Table 3, there were no significant interactions 
and no main effects for age at which individuals began 
using electronic devices, video games, Internet, or general 
computing activities. Individuals with ASD were signifi- 
cantly older (M = 8.76, SD = 3.09) when they began using 
electronics for social activities compared to the compari- 
son group (M = 8.07, SD = 2.88). 

As shown in Table 4, there were no diagnosis by gender 
interactions for the frequency or duration of electronics 
use. Individuals with ASD were reported to spend signifi- 
cantly more time using electronic devices (M = 5.67, 
SD = 1.12) than individuals without ASD (M = 5.33, 
SD = 1.23) in the previous month, with no gender differ- 
ences observed. Similarly, individuals with ASD spent 
more time using Internet and general computing activities 
(M = 6.14, SD = 1.02; M = 5.29, SD = 1.28, respectively) 
compared to the individuals without ASD (M = 5.54, 
SD = 1.29; M = 4.65, SD = 1.56). There was a significant 
gender effect for video game use, with males spending sig- 
nificantly more time playing video games (M = 5.74, 
SD = 1.12) than females (M = 5.07, SD = 1.25) in the last 
month, and no main effect for diagnosis. No differences 
emerged with regard to the frequency of social activity use. 
As shown in Table 4, none of the diagnosis by gender 
interactions were significant for the duration of electronics 
use on an average day. Males were found to spend more 
time playing video games (M = 2.88; SD = 0.97) than 
females (M = 2.40, SD = 0.76), and individuals with ASD 
spent more time on the Internet (M = 2.95, SD = 1.09) com- 
pared to individuals without ASD (M = 2.50, SD = 0.95). 
No differences emerged for the duration of social activities 
and general computing.

As shown in Table 5, there were significant main effects of 
diagnosis for CIUS video game use and Internet use, and 
no interactions. Individuals with ASD had higher levels of 
compulsive video game and Internet use (M = 2.50, 
SD = 1.04; M = 2.47; SD = 0.92, respectively) compared to 
the 
individuals without ASD (M = 1.81, SD = 0.74; 
M = 1.85; SD = 0.72). Males had higher levels of compul- 
sive video game use (M = 2.17, SD = 0.95) compared to 
females (M = 1.74, SD = 0.79). As shown in Table 6, par- 
ents of individuals with ASD were significantly more 
likely to report that electronics use was currently impact- 
ing their son or daughter’s life in a negative way than par- 
ents of the comparison group. They were also more likely 
to report that electronics use had impacted their life in the 
past (but not currently) than parents of the comparison 
group. No gender differences or interactions emerged with 
regard to impact. 

While other studies have examined problematic video 
game use in youth with ASD, this study is the first to 
examine the frequency and duration of a number of differ- 
ent categories of electronic devices and activities with a 
comparison group of individuals without ASD, taking into 
account potential differences in gender. This is also the 
first article to investigate both problematic Internet and 
video game use and its impact on the lives of North 
American children with ASD and their families compared 
to a comparison group. Parents of individuals with ASD 
reported that their youth and young adults were able to use 
a greater number of electronic devices, however did not 
engage in as many video game and social activities, as the 
comparison sample. Individuals with ASD were signifi- 
cantly older when they began using electronics for social 
activities, and spent more time using the Internet and 
on general computing activities, than the comparison 
sample. 
These results are consistent in many respects with pre- 
vious research. In a large, representative sample of youth 
from the United States, youth with ASD had higher rates of 
non-social media use (i.e. television and video games) and 
lower rates of social media use (i.e. email and chat room 
participation) than other disability groups (learning disa- 
bilities, speech/language impairments, and intellectual dis- 
abilities) (Mazurek et al., 2012). Similarly, Mazurek and 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Wenstrup (2013) found that compared to typically devel- 
oping siblings, children with ASD spent more time watching 
television and playing video games and less time using 
social media or socially interactive video games. Television 
and electronics use may be an attractive activity because it 
requires little effort, and provides a break for individuals 
who, because of the nature of their difficulties, have trou- 
ble engaging in activities that are cognitively or socially 
demanding (Mazurek et al., 2012). Given that individuals 
with ASD have difficulty with social interaction and have 
fewer friendships compared to individuals without ASD, 
the finding that individuals spend more time on non-social 
electronics use may not be surprising, but is particularly 
problematic, as it creates yet another context where individu- 
als with ASD fail to experience practice and competence 
with social contexts. 
Our work extends what is known about problematic 
electronics use in individuals with ASD. Mazurek and 
Engelhardt (2013b) found that boys with ASD had higher 
rates of problematic video game use compared to boys 
without ASD, while another study found that children with 
ASD had higher levels of problematic video game use 
compared to their typically developing siblings (Mazurek 
and Wenstrup, 2013). The results from our study indicate 
that the compulsive behavior appears to be present with 
other electronics beyond video game use, suggesting a 
broader concern. Mazurek and Engelhardt (2013b) found 
that core ASD symptoms were not related to hours of video 
game play or problematic video game use; however, 
another study found a connection between symptoms of 
ASD and compulsive Internet use in a non-clinical adult 
sample (Finkenauer et al., 2012), making it unclear how 
deficits in social communication and restricted patterns of 
behavior influence risk. Individuals with ASD may be 
more prone to problematic electronics use because of other 
characteristics associated with the disorder. For instance, 
deficits in impulse control and response inhibition are 
connected with a diagnosis of ASD (Corbett et al., 2009) 
and with problematic video game play (Mazurek and 
Engelhardt, 2013b). A link has also been found between 
inattention and playing video games for more than one 
hour per day (Chan and Rabinowitz, 2006). More research 
is needed to examine the connection between these execu- 
tive functioning deficits and problematic electronics use for 
individuals with ASD. 
Parents of individuals with ASD were significantly 
more likely to report that electronics use negatively 
impacted their child’s life compared to parents of individuals 
without ASD. For typically developing individuals, prob- 
lematic video game use has been associated with poorer 
school performance (Gentile, 2009) and high Internet use 
has been linked with poorer relationships with mothers 
and peers (Sanders et al., 2000). For individuals with 
ASD, the negative impacts of playing electronics may be 
compounded by the social and academic difficulties they 
already face due to the nature of their difficulties. When 
individuals with ASD are engaging in problematic elec- 
tronics use, they have even fewer opportunities to develop 
social, academic, and occupational skills, which may be 
associated with more negative impacts for their families, 
who are already multiply stressed (Lecavalier et al., 2006). 
While a number of positive experiences have been noted 
about electronics use in individuals with ASD, particularly 
as a teaching or communication device (e.g. Burton et al., 
2013), the current research also suggests that caregivers 
and clinicians should be aware of early signs of interference 
or compulsions related to these activities, particularly 
because parents are reporting negative impacts. 
A clear pattern of gender differences was found for 
video game involvement, but not for any other type of 
electronics activity. Across groups, males had the ability to 
play significantly more video game activities and spent 
more time on video games in the last month and on an 
average day compared to females. Males also had higher 
rates of problematic video game use than females. These 
findings are consistent with the gender differences that are 
found in the general population (Gentile, 2009; Witt et al., 
2011; Willoughby, 2008). These findings suggest that boys 
with ASD are particularly vulnerable to problematic elec- 
tronics use. 

One of the main limitations of this study was that it relied 
on parent reports, similar to other research on electronics 
use and ASD (e.g. Mazurek et al., 2012; Mazurek and 
Engelhardt, 2013a). Another limitation of the study was 
the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to determine an 
autism diagnosis. Although not a gold standard assess- 
ment, we did use the SCQ, which has strong diagnostic 
validity, to confirm the ASD diagnosis reported by parents, 
similar to other survey studies (e.g. Zablotsky et al., 2012). 
Furthermore, parent report of a child’s ASD diagnosis has 
been shown to be valid indicator of child diagnosis 
(Daniels et al., 2012). Convenience sampling also presents 
with the possibility of a sample bias, as parents of individu- 
als with ASD were recruited through ASD organizations in 
Canada and the United States, and these parents may have 
children with higher levels of support needs compared to 
parents of children with ASD who are not involved in 
these organizations. Parents of both typically developing 
children and those with ASD who were concerned about 
problematic computer use may also have been more likely 
to participate in our study. Our use of online surveys may 
have excluded parents who did not have access to computers 
or the Internet, who had less free time due to high parenting 
demands, or who had lower literacy levels. While our two 
samples were matched on certain characteristics (e.g. age 





and geographic location), they were not matched on verbal 
or cognitive ability. 
Certainly, a major strength of the study was its com- 
prehensive nature and the use of a typically developing 
comparison group to contextualize the pattern of ASD 
use and provide a broader understanding of what might 
be expected in the general population. We examined 
frequency and duration of electronics use across a 
broad array of activities and types, problematic use in 
both video game, Internet, and other electronics, and 
are the first to explore the potential negative impacts on 
the child and the family. Future research can build on 
this work by making use of multiple sources of infor- 
mation about electronics use, including both parent 
report and self-report, direct observation, and diaries. 
Having a comparison group that is matched on develop- 
mental level would be helpful. It would also be useful 
to longitudinally examine the predictors and outcomes 
of problematic electronics to understand trajectories 
over time. 

The results confirm the central role that electronics 
play in the lives of youth with and without ASD, 
although for youth with ASD, it is less likely used for 
social reasons. Given the propensity for electronics 
among individuals with ASD, incorporating electronics 
into interventions may help to increase engagement, 
motivation, and reinforcement (Mazurek and Wenstrup, 
2013), if done in a strategic way that enhances engage- 
ment rather than serving an isolating role. These results 
also suggest that individuals with ASD may be at a 
particularly high risk for problems related to electronics 
use, including excessive and problematic video game 
and Internet use, calling for further attention into ways 
of helping individuals use electronics in a healthy way. 
Given that electronics use has a significant negative 
impact on families of individuals with ASD, more 
research is needed to examine how families can make 
informed decisions about introducing electronics and 
how they can implement strategies for monitoring its 
use. Research should also investigate how to support 
families when they are facing problematic electronics 
use. The current findings highlight the need for increased 
awareness and assessment of problematic electronics 
use for individuals with ASD.
