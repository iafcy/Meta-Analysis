ABSTRACT 
Screen time is becoming increasingly common in daily life. Early 
and excessive screen use has raised growing concerns for children’s 
neuropsychological development. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the association between exposure to screen time in early 
life and the presence of autistic-like behaviors among preschool 
children. 29,461 child-caregiver dyads at kindergartens in Longhua 
New District of Shenzhen, China, were enrolled in this cross- 
sectional study. Information concerning socio-demographic char- 
acteristics, frequency and duration of children’s electronic screen 
exposure for each year since birth, and autistic-like behaviors (mea- 
sured by the Autism Behavior Checklist) were collected using a self- 
administered structured questionnaire completed by the primary 
caregivers. A series of logistic regression models assessed the asso- 
ciation between screen time and autistic-like behaviors. Results 
indicated that younger initial age, longer daily screen time and 
longer cumulative years of screen exposure since birth were asso- 
ciated with the presence of autistic-like behaviors at preschool age. 
The risk was enhanced with the increase of both daily screen time 
and cumulative years of screen exposure during preschool period. 
Moreover, the cross-over analysis indicated that the first three years 
following birth might be a sensitive period for children when screen 
exposure increases the risk of experiencing autistic-like behaviors. 
In conclusion, our study implied that screen exposure in early life 
might increase the occurrence of autistic-like behaviors among 
preschoolers. These findings support the need for early interven- 
tions into preschoolers’ screen use, however longitudinal studies 
are necessary to further confirm the causal relationship between 
early screen time and the incidence of later autistic-like behaviors 
among preschool children. 



Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by 
impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behavioral patterns 
(Marty & Segal, 2015). With a global prevalence of approximately 1% (Elsabbagh et al., 
2012), lifelong impairments of ASD create substantial functional and economic burdens 
for individuals, families and the society (Buescher et al., 2014; Lord et al., 2018). Recently, 
a genetic overlap was confirmed between clinical ASD and sub-threshold autistic-like 
behaviors (Bralten et al., 2018), and it has been suggested that the severity of autistic-like 
behaviors is continuously distributed from mild to severe within the general population 
(Suzuki et al., 2018; Waterhouse et al., 1996). This reflects the identification of con- 
tinuums in impairments on other cognitive and social abilities (Constantino & Todd, 
2003; Gokcen et al., 2014; Haraguchi et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2013). A clinical diagnosis 
of ASD is difficult to confirm until children are aged 4–5 years (Zwaigenbaum & Penner, 
2018). However, early autistic-like behaviors such as eye fixations decline and avoidant 
responses to touch, can be identified in infanthood or toddlerhood, with early identifica- 
tion and intervention facilitating improved prognosis (Mammen et al., 2015; Yoon & 
Vouloumanos, 2014). Therefore, the exploration of risk factors for the onset of autistic- 
like behaviors among the general population is important. 
To date, there has been wide recognition that ASD and autistic-like behaviors are both 
genetic and environmental in origin (Bolte et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2014). Emerging 
research suggests that early environmental factors can play an important role in the 
onset of autistic-like behaviors (Bolte et al., 2019; Slobodin et al., 2019). One important 
environmental factor appears to be children’s screen time, which may cause disparities in 
early neuropsychological development (Lissak, 2018; Stiglic & Viner, 2019). For instance, 
longer duration and younger initial age of screen viewing have been found among clinical 
ASD children compared with typically developing children (Chonchaiya et al., 2011; 
Must et al., 2014). Interestingly, several cases have been reported where young children 
with autistic-like behaviors were re-assessed as non-autistic after a few months of screen 
removal and increases in social interaction (Harle, 2019; Numata-Uematsu et al., 2018). 
However, to our knowledge, little attention has been given to investigating the influence 
of early screen exposure during the first few years of early life upon children’s neurop- 
sychological development (Slobodin et al., 2019). Given that the newborn brain under- 
goes dramatic growth and development with considerable plasticity in the initial years of 
life (Wen et al., 2019), this period has proved to be critical for neurodevelopment and 
behavior establishment (Jones et al., 2013). As such, due to the increasing access to and 
younger initial age of screen exposure (Kaur et al., 2019), we sought to explore whether 
electronic screen exposure in early life, especially in postnatal three years, was related to 
autistic-like behaviors in preschool children. 


The participants of the study were recruited from the 2017 survey of the Longhua Child 
Cohort Study (LCCS). The LCCS was a population-based child cohort study among 
preschool children in Longhua District in Shenzhen, China, which aimed to investigate 


the relationships between a range of family and school variables and their psycho- 
behavioral development of young children. After excluding the children with missing 
data, 29,461 child-caregiver pairs were included for analysis. Ethical approval was 
obtained from the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-sen 
University (ethics clearance No.: 2015–016), and all participants gave full informed 
written consent to participate in the study. 

Data were collected from a structured questionnaire completed by the children’s primary 
caregiver. The questionnaire acquired information about parents’ socio-demographic 
characteristics (including age at child’s birth, education level, family monthly income, 
and marital status), frequency and duration of children’s electronic screen exposure in 
each year, children’s general information (such as gender, birth date), and autistic-like 
behaviors. 

Exposure to electronic screens each year since the child’s birth was assessed retrospec- 
tively by caregivers based on the same set of questions above (see Table 1). Variables 
including initial age of screen exposure, daily average screen time and cumulative years of 
screen exposure were calculated to describe the screen exposure. 

Children’s autistic-like behaviors were assessed using the Autism Behavior Checklist 
(ABC) (Bravo Oro et al., 2014; Krug et al., 1980). This is a widely used scale for screening 
autistic children in research and clinical practice. The Chinese version of ABC was 
introduced into China by Yang et al. (1993), with an interrater reliability of 0.785, and 
a test–retest reliability of 0.789 in Chinese children. The scale consists of five subscales 
including sensory, relating, body and object use, language, and social and self-help skills. 
The 57 items are distributed randomly on the checklist with a weighted score from 1 to 4,

Questions 
Q1.1 Did your child watch television at age 0–1 years? 





electronic devices (e.g. mobile phone, tablet, video games, etc.) per day at age 
0–1 years? 
Options 
0 = ‘no’ 
1 = ‘yes’ 
1 = ‘< 30 min’ 
2 = ‘30–60 min’ 
3 = ‘60–90 min’ 
4 = ‘90–120 min’ 
5 = ‘> 120 min’ 
0 = ‘no’ 
1 = ‘yes’ 
1 = ‘< 30 min’ 
2 = ‘30–60 min’ 
3 = ‘60–90 min’ 
4 = ‘90–120 min’ 
5 = ‘> 120 min’ 


and scores of each subscale are added up to obtain the overall score. The Cronbach alpha 
for the total score in this study was 0.904. A previous study in China recommended the 
cut-offs of score≥31 and score≥62 for screening and diagnosis of ASD respectively (Yang 
et al., 1993). Considering that the survey was conducted in mainstream kindergartens, 
and in order to increase the sensitivity of the scale without missing the borderline cases 
with autistic-like behaviors, a score of 31 was selected as the cut-off in our study for 
identifying children with autistic-like behaviors. 

The following confounding covariates were included in the analysis: child’s age and 
gender, parents’ age at child’s birth, parents’ education level, family monthly income and 
parental marital status. 

For continuous variables, we reported their means and standard deviation (SD), and 
for categorical variables, numbers and proportions were presented. Chi-square tests 
and Student’s t-tests were applied to compare the socio-demographic characteristics 
between children with and without autistic-like behaviors. To examine the associations 
between exposure to electronic screens (i.e. exposure to electronic screen or not, daily 
average screen time and initial age of screen exposure) and autistic-like behaviors, 
a series of logistic regression models were run after adjusting for the aforementioned 
covariates. Moreover, we conducted further analyses to probe into the sensitive period 
and cumulative effect between exposure to electronic screen and autistic-like beha- 
viors. Firstly, children were categorized into eight subgroups depending on different 
permutations and combinations of exposure (Yes) versus no exposure (No) in 
each year, over a three-year period following birth. The possibility of sensitive periods 
was investigated by using logistic regression to examine the likelihood of the presence 
of autistic-like behaviors for each of these eight subgroups. Secondly, children were 
divided into three subgroups according to daily average screen time (<60, 60–120, 
>120 minutes), and logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between 
cumulative years of screen exposure and autistic-like behaviors within each subgroup. 
The results were presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed test with p < .05. Data management and 
statistical analysis were carried out using SPSS (version 25.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL, USA).

Table 3 presents the associations between electronic screen exposure and autistic- 
like behaviors in the regression models after controlling for the covariates. 
Compared with children without screen exposure, those who had ever had exposure 
to electronic screens had a higher risk of autistic-like behaviors (AOR = 1.61, 95% 
CI = 1.18–2.21). More specifically, children with average screen 
times of 
60–120 minutes (AOR = 1.60, 95%CI = 1.16–2.22) or >120 minutes (AOR = 2.42, 
95%CI = 1.73–3.40) per day were significantly more likely to exhibit autistic-like 
behaviors than those with average screen times of less than 60 minutes per day. 
A higher risk of autistic-like behaviors was also found among those exposed to 
electronic screens initially during the 0-1-year-old period (AOR = 2.13, 95% 
CI = 1.54–2.94), compared with those who had never been exposed to an electronic 
screen.

Associations between electronic screen exposure postnatal 0 to 3 years and 
autistic-like behaviors 
Table 4 illustrates the likelihood of the presence of autistic-like behaviors for seven 
combinations of screen exposure during aged 0–1, 1–2 and 2–3 years. Children 
who exposed to electronic screens in the postnatal third year only, or in any 
combination of two or three years all exhibited a statistically significant higher risk 
of autistic-like behaviors, compared with those without any screen exposure post- 
natal 0 to 3 years (with adjusted ORs ranging from 1.46 to 2.46). See more details

Associations of daily average screen time and cumulative years of screen exposure 
with autistic-like behaviors 
As shown in Table 5, among subgroups with the same cumulative years of screen 
exposure (i.e. 3, 4, 5 or more), the risk of developing autistic-like behaviors enhanced 
with the increase of daily average screen time. Moreover, compared with the reference 
group of those who had no screen exposure, the likelihood of a child exhibiting autistic- 
like behaviors was significantly higher when a child had an average daily screen time of 
less than 60 minutes a day and had been exposed to electronic screens for 2 years 
(AOR = 1.51, 95%CI = 1.16–1.96); when the child had an average daily screen time 
between 60 and 120 minutes and had been exposed to electronic screens for 4 years 
(AOR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.14–2.34) or over 4 years (AOR = 2.10, 95%CI = 1.44–3.05); and 
when the child had an average daily screen time of over 120 minutes and had been 
exposed to electronic screens for 3 years (AOR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.19–2.88), 4 years 
(AOR = 2.66, 95%CI = 1.80–3.93) and over 4 years (AOR = 2.73, 95%CI = 1.82–4.10). 

There is emerging evidence that electronic screen exposure has an impact upon 
various indicators of preschoolers’ neuropsychological development. For example, 
several previous studies suggested that early screen exposure among infants was 
correlated with subsequent low communication scores (Duch et al., 2013) and 


language delay (Zimmerman et al., 2007), while other studies showed that children 
with screen exposure during early life had lower cognitive development (Aishworiya 
et al., 2019; Tomopoulos et al., 2010). In addition, early television exposure has been 
associated with children’s attentional problems (Christakis et al., 2004; Hermawati 
et al., 2018; Tamana et al., 2019). Similarly, a study by Mistry et al. (2007) reported 
that sustained television exposure starting from 30 to 33 months of age was related 
to subsequent behavioral outcomes at age 5.5 years. Likewise, Chonchaiya et al. 
(2011) reported that children with ASD began to watch television significantly 
earlier than controls, and there is evidence that intensive early screen exposure 
may be a causal factor for the development of symptoms of autistic spectrum 
disorder (Harle, 2019; Hermawati et al., 2018). Our study builds upon this body 
of literature by revealing that electronic screens exposure in early life, especially 
from 0 to 3 years old, is significantly correlated with the presence of autistic-like 
behaviors among preschool children. Additionally, our results showed that the 
strength of this association is enhanced with the increase of daily screen time in 
the period of age 0–1, 1–2 and 2–3 years as well as the increase of cumulative years 
of screen exposure when the daily average screen time is over 60 minutes a day. 
When exposure during a certain period results in a stronger impact on subse- 
quent disease risk than it would at other times, this period is regarded as a sensitive 
period for exposure (Ben-Shlomo et al., 2014; Braveman & Barclay, 2009). 
Intriguingly, as shown in Table 2, compared to those never exposed to electronic 
screen, preschoolers initially exposed to electronic screen from aged 0 to 1 
(AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.54 ~ 2.94) had a significantly increased risk of autistic- 
like behaviors, while those initially exposed to electronic screens from aged 1 to 2 
(AOR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.94 ~ 1.94) as well as aged 2 to 3 (AOR = 1.37, 95% 
CI = 0.96 ~ 1.97) increased the risk of autistic-like behaviors with marginal 
significance, but those initially exposed to electronic screen after aged 3 years 
displayed no significant risk of autistic-like behaviours. Moreover, the cross-over 
analysis (Table 4) showed that screen exposure in the postnatal third year only, or 
in any combination with two or three years out of the postnatal three years 
translated into a higher risk of preschool autistic-like behaviors. However, screen 
exposure only in the postnatal first or second year was not significantly associated 
with the higher risk of preschool autistic-like behaviors, which might be due to 
small sample size in the two subgroups. In line with our findings, previous observa- 
tional studies in humans showed that exposure to fast-paced television in the first 
3 years of life was linked to subsequent attentional deficits in later childhood 
(D. A. Christakis et al., 2018). These findings might be explained by the fact that 
the first few years of life are the most crucial to brain function developments 
(D. A. Christakis et al., 2018), which support the American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommendation that children under 18 months should avoid screen exposure 
(Guram & Heinz, 2018). Similarly, the World Health Organization (Guidelines on 
Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour and Sleep for Children under 5 Years of Age, 
2019), the Italian (Bozzola et al., 2018) as well as the Canadian Paediatric Society 
(2017) have suggested the guideline that screen time for children younger than 
2 years is not advocated. Taken together, it is hypothesized that the postnatal three 
years might be the sensitive period in early life for screen exposure increasing the 


risk of preschool autistic-like behaviors. Our findings, if adequately confirmed in 
further studies, can help to strengthen and improve these recommendations. 
Several potential mechanisms on adverse associations between electronic screen 
exposure in early life and autistic-like behaviors have been proposed. First, experiments 
have showed that the role of live social interaction in early speech and language learning 
cannot be replaced by exposing to social interactions using screen-based media (Kuhl, 
2007; Kuhl et al., 2003, 1991). Similarly, children who spend more time on electronic 
screens have reduced audible language (D. Christakis et al., 2009), conversation 
(Mendelsohn et al., 2008), and social interactions with caregivers and peers (Gerhold 
et al., 2002). This is problematic given that all of these experiences are critical to the 
development of young children’s social skills (Zhao et al., 2018). Second, the engagement 
in social media has been shown to result in irregular bedtime and shorter night-time 
sleep durations (Thompson & Christakis, 2005; Wu et al., 2017). In addition, blue light 
from screens suppresses the rise of melatonin secretion, lengthening sleep latency and 
impairing morning alertness (Chang et al., 2015). Poor sleep has been shown to be a risk 
factor for behavioral problems and psychological symptoms, and specifically for ASD 
behaviors (Vandendriessche et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2017). Third, specific characteristics of 
media exposure such as rapid screen changes resulting in excessive non-normative 
stimulation have been hypothesized to have direct, adverse effects on the developing 
brain (D. A. Christakis, 2009). Moreover, audio-visual output from screen media com- 
petes with social audio-visual processing of infants and therefore has a negative impact 
on the development of the social brain and higher cognitive pathways (Heffler & 
Oestreicher, 2016). Finally, increased screen time has been linked to lower integrity of 
the brain white matter tracts which supported language and literacy skills among pre- 
school children (Hutton et al., 2019). 
This study examined the association between electronic screen exposure in early 
life and the presence of autistic-like behaviors in large sample size of Chinese 
preschool children, which also explored the cumulative effect and the sensitive 
period of screen exposure in novelty, but despite this strength, several limitations 
deserve comment. First, as a cross-sectional study, the design precluded us drawing 
any strong conclusions on causal inferences, and longitudinal research is warranted 
to further verify assumption of causality. Second, the data collected about electronic 
screen exposure were retrospective and relied on parent-reported measures, which 
might be prone to recall bias and the interpretation requires caution and caveats. 
Measurement for screen time would be more accurate recording by electronic 
devices used by children. Third, the current study merely assessed the effect of 
screen time, omitting information on the content and context during screen time, 
which may mediate the effect incurred by screen exposure (Christakis, 2009; Zhao 
et al., 2018). Fourth, the family history of mental health problems, acting as a risk 
factor of ASD, was not available in our dataset and was not controlled for in the 
analyses, which may be a potential confounder of the findings. 
In conclusion, our study found that a younger age of initial electronic screen 
viewing, longer daily screen time and longer cumulative screen time in preschool 
period are associated with increased risk of autistic-like behaviors. The present study 
offered preliminary guidance for the supervision of preschoolers’ electronic screen 
use, but longitudinal studies are necessary to assess causality. The findings do 


support more attention being paid to the boundaries on acceptable levels of daily 
screen time in order to offset the adverse consequences due to excessive or improper 
screen use among preschool children.
