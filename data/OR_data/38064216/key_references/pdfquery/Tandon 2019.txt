With ADHD

Background: Children with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for poor health and obesity. The 
authors describe obesity-related movement behaviors in children with ADHD, determine higher risk groups, and compare with 
children with other disorders. Methods: Physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen time of children with ADHD (aged 6–18 y) 
were compared with recommendations and with behaviors of children with autism, asthma, and a normative group using 2011 
National Survey of Child Health data. Results: Approximately one-third of children with ADHD participated in daily PA and half 
in sports in the past year. Older children with ADHD were less likely to get daily PA, get enough sleep, and limit screen time to 
<2 hours per day. Obese children had lower odds of daily PA. Children who had lower socioeconomic status, or severe ADHD, 
had lower odds of sports participation. Children with ADHD had 50% lower odds of sports participation than children with 
asthma. Conclusions: Children with ADHD did not engage in recommended amounts of PA, sleep, and screen time. Children 
with ADHD who are older, poor, obese, and/or with more severe symptoms are at higher risk for suboptimal movement 
behaviors. These domains represent novel treatment targets in ADHD youth. 

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most 
prevalent neurodevelopment disorder in childhood affecting 11% 
of school-aged children1 and associated with wide-ranging impair- 
ments,2 including academic underachievement, social problems, 
substance abuse, and negative health outcomes including lower life 
expectancy.3,4 Childhood ADHD has been associated with pediat- 
ric obesity and may be a risk factor for adult obesity.5–7 Although it 
is often assumed that children with ADHD are sufﬁciently or even 
highly (hyper) active, youth with ADHD may not be engaging in 
optimal movement behaviors for health.8 Thus, there is accumu- 
lating support for the importance of all components of the move- 
ment continuum (sleep, sedentary time, and physical activity [PA]) 
for obesity, general health, and neurocognitive development.9–11 
Physical activity is a modiﬁable health behavior and associated 
with sports participation in children.12 However, children with 
ADHD may encounter unique challenges to participating in PA and 
sports, including increased rates of noncompliant and disruptive 
behaviors.13 This is concerning because engaging in PA (through 
sports or otherwise) is associated with numerous physical and 
mental health beneﬁts14 and has been found to enhance brain 
development and cognition.15–17 Indeed, several studies have 
documented the beneﬁts of PA for children with ADHD, including 
reductions in ADHD symptoms, improved social-emotional func- 
tioning, and academic achievement.18–20 PA also has been found to 
improve executive functions (EF), which are deﬁned as cognitive 
processes that govern self-regulation, problem solving, and inhibi- 
tion of impulses.21 EF are found to be impaired in children with 
ADHD, and EF deﬁcits underlie behavioral symptoms of ADHD

such as impulsivity and distractibility22,23 as well as numerous 
health-risk behaviors.24 PA is found to improve EF including 
sustained attention and response inhibition in children with 
ADHD, which may beneﬁt overall 
functioning and healthy 
behaviors.25 
Sedentary activities, such as screen time and sleep, are also 
associated with obesity.26 Moreover, excessive screen time is 
associated with negative cognitive and mental health outcomes, 
including inattention, 
internalizing problems, and low self- 
esteem.27,28 In addition, approximately 70% of youth with ADHD 
have bedtime resistance and sleep-onset difﬁculties.29 The regula- 
tion of arousal and sleep also plays a restorative role in brain 
functioning11 and is linked to poor executive functioning. Parents 
of children with ADHD may have difﬁculty in fostering healthy 
sleep habits and limiting sedentary behaviors such as screen time, 
for various reasons including the fact that they may have ADHD 
themselves.30 
Previous studies using nationally representative samples from 
2003 to 2007 have documented poor obesity–related health beha- 
viors in children with ADHD.5,8 We sought to describe obesity- 
related movement behaviors in a more recently obtained nationally 
representative sample of children with ADHD, to determine risk 
factors for suboptimal health behaviors, and to compare outcomes 
to those of children with other neurodevelopmental or medical 
conditions. We hypothesized that children with ADHD, on aver- 
age, would attain less PA and sleep and more screen time than is 
recommended. We also wanted to explore how the health behaviors 
of children with ADHD compare with those of children with other 
chronic health conditions to examine whether ADHD is speciﬁ- 
cally associated with differences in movement behaviors. Thus, we 
compare health behaviors in a sample with ADHD to those of 
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, another neurode- 
velopmental diagnosis) and asthma (a common and chronic physi- 
cal health diagnosis) as well as a normative sample with none of 
these diagnoses. 






The National Survey of Child Health is a population-based, 
nationally representative sample of US children.31 Interviews 
were conducted by telephone (including cell phones) with a parent 
or guardian of the sampled child in the household. This study was 
deemed exempt by the Seattle Children’s Hospital Institutional 
Review Board. 

We conducted analyses of the 2011 cohort, which is the most recent 
time period for which data are available. This study focused on 
school-age children aged 6–18 years with a parent-reported diag- 
nosis of 1 of 3 target conditions (ADHD, ASD, and asthma) or none 
of the target conditions (normative control). 
Analyses were adjusted for survey design factors including cluster 
sampling (PID), stratiﬁcation (STATE, SAMPLE), and unequal 
probability weighting (NSCHWT). Categorical and ordinal re- 
sponses were summarized by weighted percentages, and continu- 
ous measures were summarized by weighted means and SEs. 
Diagnosis was entered into a series of multivariable logistic 
regression models predicting each health behavior among children 
with ADHD compared with children with ASD, asthma, or none of 
these conditions. Based on a priori hypotheses, models were adjusted 
for age (continuous), sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (free/ 
reduced lunch eligibility), condition severity, overweight (≥85th–94th 
percentile)/obese (≥95th percentile) status, and ADHD medication 
use. Odds ratios and associated 95% conﬁdence intervals are reported. 
Analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false 
discovery rate method. Analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) with signiﬁcance level α = .05. 
Diagnosis 
Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, ASD, and asthma diagno- 
ses were determined based on parent report that a health care 
provider had told them that their child had the condition and that 
their child had the condition at the time of the survey. Parents 
categorized the condition as mild, moderate, or severe, and for 
children with ADHD, current use of medications was ascertained. 

Parents were asked to report on participation in organized sports, 
PA, sleep, and media use (average weekday use of television, 
computers, other media use, not for schoolwork). Responses were 
dichotomized to align them with American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommendations regarding engaging in these health behaviors.32 
Measures of PA and sleep sufﬁciency were dichotomized (every 
day vs less often). Total media use, in hours, was calculated as the 
sum of individual questions and dichotomized (<2 h/d vs ≥2 h/d, 
per the recommendation for this age). Additional questions related 
to media use included family rules and limits and presence of 
television in the bedroom. See Table 1 for additional details on the 
measures. 
Sociodemograhpics 
Parents reported demographic factors including the child’s age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, primary household language, maternal education, and 
eligibility for free/reduced lunch. Parents reported the child’s height 
and weight that were used to determine a body mass index. 


Demographic and descriptive characteristics by condition are 
presented in Table 2. The average age of children in all 4 groups 
was between 11 and 12 years old. Two-thirds of children with 
ADHD reported being eligible for free/reduced lunch. Thirty-two 
percent of children with ADHD were reported to be overweight or 
obese, and 70% of children were reported to currently be using 
medication for ADHD. 
Descriptive data for movement behaviors by condition are 
presented in Table 3. Across all conditions, less than one-third of 
children were reported to get at least 20 minutes of PA daily. 
Across all conditions, children exceeded the recommended 2 hours 
of screen time per day when television and computer/other device 
were combined and about half had televisions in their bedroom. 
The large majority of parents across the groups reported having 
limits on screen time and monitoring screen content. 
In Table 4, for children with ADHD, we summarize the odds 
ratios for factors associated with meeting recommendations for the 
various movement behaviors. Children who were older had lower 
odds of participating in daily PA, getting enough sleep, and 
limiting screen time to less than 2 hours per day. In unadjusted 
analyses, girls with ADHD had signiﬁcantly lower odds of engag- 
ing in daily PA and getting enough sleep than boys with ADHD. 
Children who were obese, poor, or with more severe ADHD had 
lower odds of sports participation. When adjusting for multiple 
comparisons, some previously statistically signiﬁcant results, nota- 
bly those related to sex, race, and medication use, were no longer 
signiﬁcant.

Table 5 highlights the covariate-adjusted odds of children with 
ADHD participating in the various movement behaviors compared 
with children in the other 3 groups. Children with ADHD had half 
the odds of sports participation compared with children with 
asthma and 7 times the odds of sports participation compared with 
children with ASD. When compared with the normative group, 
children with ADHD had statistically signiﬁcant lower odds (odds 
ratio = 0.3; 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.1–1.0) of obtaining enough 
sleep every day. There were no changes to the results after 
adjusting for multiple comparisons. 

Children with ADHD did not, on average, engage in recom- 
mended amounts of PA, sleep, and screen time. In particular, 
children with ADHD who were older, poor, obese, or more 
severely affected had lower odds of engaging optimally in certain 
movement behaviors. This study found that although children 
with ADHD were 7 times more likely to participate in sports than 
children with ASD, they had half the odds of sports participation 
compared with similar age peers with asthma. These ﬁndings are 
consistent with previous studies that found that children with 
ADHD are at high risk for insufﬁcient PA, excessive sedentary 
behaviors, and increased risk of obesity.5,8 The present study 
extends ﬁndings by utilizing more recent data that coincided with 
the marked increase in use of smart phones and Internet access in 
US families. In addition, this study compares the health behaviors 
of youth with ADHD with those with other disorders that have the 
potential to impair PA, including another neurodevelopmental 
disorder (ASD) and a common chronic pediatric medical condi- 
tion (asthma). As children with ADHD are at high risk for obesity 
and poor health, supporting healthy movement behaviors in this 
group has the potential to promote executive functioning, general 
health, and well-being.4 
Only half of children with ADHD reported participating in 
sports in the previous year. Children with more severe ADHD and 
lower socioeconomic status had lower odds of sports participation, 
which is concerning as these children are also at higher risk for 
psychiatric comorbidities and health disparities. These groups of 
children likely face additional barriers to accessing sports oppor- 
tunities, including cost and difﬁculties in ﬁnding programs that can 
support children with behavioral challenges. Interestingly, despite 
low sports participation, children with severe ADHD or low SES 
were not found to be at lower odds for daily PA. It could be that 
these children are engaging in nonsport PA (at or outside of 
school), which may have an appropriate strategy to assuring they

are engaging in sufﬁcient PA. Alternatively, given that parent- 
reported PA is subject to reporting, recall, and social desirability 
biases and that the question only asked about 20 minutes per day 
versus the recommended 60 minutes per day, it is likely that fewer 
children are actually meeting recommendations. Regardless, hav- 
ing school-based and community resources for PA that are inclu- 
sive of children with ADHD could help with disparities in access. 
Of note, obese children with ADHD had lower odds of both sports 
participation and daily PA, highlighting them as a group in need of 
additional support and resources for leading active lifestyles. 
In the entire sample, a third of children engaged in PA on less 
than 4 days per week. Such ﬁndings highlight the need to promote 
PA in all children, but especially those with chronic health con- 
ditions. Although children with ADHD had 7 times greater odds of 
sports participation than children with ASD, they had 50% lower 
odds than children with asthma. Although children with ASD face 
unique challenges to full participation in PA and sports, speciﬁc 
strategies should focus on promoting PA for this population. 
Children with ADHD and asthma arguably should be able to 
achieve full participation with adequate management. It is striking 
that a behavioral condition such as ADHD appears to be a greater 
barrier to sports participation than a physical health condition and 
indicates that there may be undertreatment of ADHD behaviors that 
interfere with group participation, especially in key high-risk groups. 
Children with ADHD were also found to have high amounts of 
screen time. This ﬁnding was noted despite high rates of parents 
reporting screen time limits and monitoring of screen time content. 
Previous studies have identiﬁed problematic video game use in 
children with ADHD, including them being less likely than controls 
to stop playing of their own accord.33,34 As children with ADHD are 
often not compliant with parental requests, parents of them may 
have difﬁculty in limiting and/or monitoring screen time. Also, 
although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends media- 
free bedrooms,35 more than half of children with ADHD were 
reported to have televisions in their bedroom. Given the increasing 
ubiquity of handheld digital devices in recent years, this question 
asking about televisions is likely underestimating the prevalence of 
access to screen devices in bedrooms. Also concerning, screen time 
may displace PA, sports participation, and other healthy behaviors 
that are beneﬁcial for the development of social skills and self- 
esteem.10 As of yet, there has been little effort to establish structured 
intervention strategies to help parents limit screen time in their 
children with ADHD. 
Children with ADHD displayed fewer nights with adequate 
sleep compared with the normative group. Children with neuro- 
developmental disorders, including ADHD, are at increased risk 
for sleep disturbances36 and would beneﬁt from interventions to 
promote healthier sleep behaviors.37 Such treatments may have 
particular beneﬁt given that inadequate sleep adversely affects self- 
regulation, irritability, and executive functions that are impaired 
for children with ADHD, and these impairments are reversed with 
adequate sleep duration.38 Furthermore, some children could 
dually beneﬁt from strategies that focus on decreasing problematic 
media use (ie, screens in bedrooms, late night screen time) to also 
improve sleep, as studies have documented associations between 
problematic screen use and sleep problems.39,40 
There are some limitations to this study that should be 
considered. This study was based on parent-reported information 
(including their child’s diagnosis of ADHD, ASD, or asthma) and 
therefore may be subject to recall and social desirability biases. 
However, 70% of the ADHD sample were taking stimulant med- 
ications, indicating that most children had been medically evalu- 
ated. As not all children with ADHD are diagnosed, the obtained 
results are a conservative test of those whose parents identiﬁed their

child with ADHD, and there may be important socioeconomic or 
other differences between children who are diagnosed and those 
who are not. Replication is needed where diagnoses are conﬁrmed. 
Furthermore, it is likely that our analyses overestimate positive 
health behaviors and underestimate negative ones. Arguably, the 
question about sports participation may have more face validity 



than questions about amounts of PA, sleep, or screen time. Body 
mass index was also calculated based on parent reported weight 
and height, which has considerable limitations.41 Also, the way we 
categorized the 4 groups does not account for children who may 
have more than 1 condition. This also means that children in the 
“normative” group may have other conditions besides ADHD, 
ASD, and asthma. Other unmeasured factors may exist that are 
unaccounted for in our analyses. However, the large sample size 
and complex sampling frame meant to capture a nationally repre- 
sentative group strengthen our conclusions and make the data more 
generalizable. 
Longitudinal studies with information on medication formu- 
lation and dosing are needed to evaluate whether children with 
ADHD may be more likely to participate in sports when effectively 
treated, including beyond the school day to include times when 
sports participation is possible.5 In addition, evidence-based behav- 
ioral treatments may also reduce barriers to sports and PA partici- 
pation and provide families with strategies to better manage 
problematic screen and sleep behaviors. There may also be a 
systemic need to establish and study sports programs with structure 
to create successful experiences for children with ADHD and 
to explore interventions with other PA formats (eg, individual 
physical activities, family routines involving PA, activity/ﬁtness 
trackers42). 
Despite their strong association with ADHD, quality of life, and 
functioning, health behaviors are not regularly assessed or addressed 
during the routine evaluation and treatment of ADHD.43 This study 
presents a compelling argument for the continued examination of 
movement behavior interventions as a prevention or intervention or 
augmentation strategy for ADHD44 due to the clear beneﬁts increas- 
ing positive health behaviors, and the increased risk for poor out- 
comes in children with ADHD. In addition, suboptimal PA, high 
screen time, and inadequate sleep may co-occur in many children 
with ADHD. Interventions to support multiple healthy movement 
behaviors for children with ADHD have the potential for long-term 
beneﬁts in this high-risk population. 

Children with ADHD exhibit suboptimal movement behaviors 
related to sports participation, sleep, and screen time that may 
contribute to long-term health risks associated with ADHD. These 
domains represent novel treatment targets to support health and 
functioning in children with ADHD.
