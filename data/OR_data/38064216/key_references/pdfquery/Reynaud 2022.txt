Abstract 
COVID-related lockdown led to a radical modification of daily activities and rou- 
tines which are known to affect sleep. Compared to the general population, partic- 
ipants with autism may be particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of 
lockdown on sleep, given their intrinsic inflexible adherence to routines and the 
high overall prevalence of sleep disturbances in this population. The study is a 
French nation-wide online survey assessing sleep–wake rhythms and behaviors 
known to affect sleep (daily screen time, daylight exposure, and physical activity), 
before and during COVID-related lockdown. Respondents were 207 adults with 
autism (56% female) and 1652 adults of the general population (77% female), with 
a mean age 35.3 years (SD 11.3). Before lockdown, the adults with autism dis- 
played on average later bedtime and waking hours, lower sleep quality, more eve- 
less exposure to daylight, and less exercise (all p < 0.01). 
ning screen time, 
Lockdown affected all studied measures of sleep and related exposures in a similar 
way in both groups: poorer self-rated sleep quality as well as a less regular and 
delayed sleep–wake rhythm, longer screen time in the evening and less exposure 
to daylight (all p < 0.001). Adults with autism displayed significantly higher levels 
of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and less favorable daily routines 
known to regulate sleep. While the effect of confinement on sleep and sleep 
related behaviors was similar in both groups, the results highlight that the pre- 
existing shift in circadian rhythms and lifestyles in adults with ASD further deteri- 
orated during lockdown. 
Lay abstract: COVID-related lockdown led to a radical modification of daily 
activities and routines known to affect sleep. In a sample of 1800 adults, we 
observed that, before lockdown, participants with autism displayed significantly 
higher levels of sleep disturbances and less favorable daily routines known to reg- 
ulate sleep, compared to the general population. While the deleterious effect of 
lockdown on sleep was similar in both groups, pre-existing difficulties in adults 
with autism reached worrying levels during lockdown.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
affected countries worldwide with the introduction of 
various strategies aiming to contain the outbreak. In 









France, the first wave of infection made a fast break- 
through with, on March 15, 2020, 6378 confirmed cases 
Publique 
including 
France, 2020). A first period of strict total lockdown was 
implemented on French territory from March 17 to May 
11 2020. Similar to other countries, measures included 
mandatory remote work except for specified essential 
workers, closure of schools and non-essential stores, and 
restrictions on time (<1 h/day) and distance (perimeter of 
1 km) of trips outside the home. 
Unsurprisingly, the first studies on the repercussions 
of lockdown showed that the disruption of life routines, 
the stress induced by the pandemic and the associated 
consequences (economic, socio-professional, family, etc.), 
led to significant disturbances in general mental health, 
and particularly in anxiety and depression symptoms 
(Gualano et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020; Marelli 
et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020; Wang 
et al., 2020). Although lockdown affects society as a 
whole, the repercussions in adults with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) are likely to differ. 
ASD is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder, with 
prevalences estimated between 1.1% (Brugha et al., 2016) 
and 2.2% (Dietz et al., 2020) in adults. It is characterized 
by the presence from childhood of social communication 
deficits associated with restricted, repetitive, and stereo- 
typical behaviors and interests, responsible for major 
functional limitations in everyday life (American Psychi- 
atric Association, 2013). Insistence on sameness is an 
important sign of autism, including an inflexible adher- 
ence to routines or 
ritualized patterns of behavior 
(e.g., extreme distress at small changes and need for pre- 
dictable daily rituals). As a result, sudden drastic changes 
in daily routine dictated by the lockdown strategies might 
be expected to have a greater impact on people on the 
autism spectrum. An alternative hypothesis is that the 
decrease in social interactions resulting from lockdown 
might be experienced as a relief and reduce stress in this 
population. In a study including about 600 adults with 
autism and 400 controls across three European countries, 
found some positive changes 
Oomen et al. 
reported by adults with autism, such as reduced sensory 
and social overload with, however, an increase in depres- 
sion and anxiety symptoms, which was significantly 
greater in adults with autism than controls. Interestingly, 
they also found that although adults with autism felt they 
had to make fewer changes in their daily routines than 
controls, they felt more stressed about those changes. Pel- 
licano et al. (2021) found similar results in their qualita- 
tive study. On the one hand, adults with autism expressed 
some positive outcomes, such as “a release from the 
demands of conventional social challenges” during lock- 
down, however they reported at the same time negative 
effects with “a deep sense of social loss; and a deteriora- 
tion of mental health.” 

Aside from mental health issues, the negative impact 
of population confinement may also include an effect on 







sleep and circadian rhythms. The master biological clock, 
located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, orchestrates the 
endogenous sleep–wake cycle of a period close to 24 h, 
called the circadian sleep–wake rhythm. This rhythm 
determines propensities towards wakefulness or sleep and 
is entrained by external cues (also called “Zeitgebers,” 
(Stephenson 
meaning 
et al., 2012) and internal cues (clock genes and neurohor- 
(Lalanne et al., 2021; 
mones 
Reppert & Weaver, 2002). Circadian sleep–wake rhythm 
disorders occur in cases of misalignment between the 
endogenous rhythm and external environment. The light/ 
dark cycle is the most important Zeitgeber, although 
others exist, such as physical activity and social interac- 
tions. Light modulates the circadian rhythm through two 
distinct mechanisms: “(1) the acute suppression of mela- 
tonin in response to light exposure and (2) the ability of 
light 
(Blume 
et al., 2019). The effect of light on circadian rhythm and 
sleep is dependent on the timing, the intensity, and the 
wavelength of the light. While the exposure to natural 
daylight in the morning advances the circadian phase and 
has been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce sleep 
latency (Figueiro et al., 2017), an evening exposure to 
blue light (overly emitted by computers and smart-phone 
screens) lowers and delays melatonin secretion (Cajochen 
et al., 2011) and modifies sleep architecture (Münch 
et al., 2006). As the COVID-19 lockdown affected work 
and leisure routines, there were probable knock-on effects 
on key Zeitgebers, such as daylight exposure and physical 
activity, in turn affecting the organization and position of 
the sleep–wake cycle, and thus sleep duration and sleep 
quality. Indeed, most studies on the subject report a del- 
ayed rhythm and reduced sleep quality during lockdown, 
although discrepancies have been reported. An Italian 
online cross-sectional study of 1310 adults compared 
sleep quality, duration, and timing before lockdown and 
during the second week of lockdown. The results showed 
a delay in sleep–wake rhythms, an increase in time spent 
in bed and lower sleep quality (Cellini et al., 2020). 
Another Italian study of 400 adults found later bedtimes 
and wake-up times during lockdown, as well as a worsen- 
ing of sleep quality and an increase in all insomnia symp- 
toms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index: sleep 
initiation, sleep maintenance, and early morning awaken- 
ing (Marelli et al., 2020). An Argentinian online study 
(Leone et al., 2020) with 1021 participants found delayed 
sleep onset and wake time during lockdown but only on 
weekdays, with a greater effect on wake time compared 
to sleep onset. However, an online European study of 
435 adults in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland from 
mid-March to end of April 2020 by Blume et al. (2020) 
found a reduction of the mismatch between external 
(social) and internal (biological) sleep–wake timing, an 
increase in sleep duration, but also a small reduction of 
sleep quality. These studies were all performed in the gen- 
eral population, and the effects of lockdown on sleep 


may be more pronounced in vulnerable populations such 
as people with neuro-developmental disorders, given the 
high prevalence of sleep disturbances as a co-occurring 
range of symptoms (Shelton & Malow, 2021). 
Sleep disturbances are very common in ASD, affect- 
ing 50–80% of the concerned population in their lifetime 
(Ballester et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2014). Recent systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses show shorter sleep duration, 
lower sleep efficiency associated with longer sleep onset 
latency, and overall lower sleep quality compared to con- 
trols (Carmassi et al., 2019; Morgan et al., 2020). Differ- 
ences have also been found in sleep architecture, with 
increased duration of stage 1 sleep and decreased non- 
REM sleep and slow-wave sleep (Limoges et al., 2005). 
Circadian sleep–wake disturbances have also been 
reported; studies based on actigraphy found that com- 
pared to neurotypical participants, participants with 
ASD had lower circadian rhythm amplitudes (Hare 
et al., 2006) and a higher prevalence of non 24-h sleep– 
wake rhythm (Baker & Richdale, 2017); studies based on 
melatonin and its metabolite reported lower secretion in 
general, especially in the hour before usual sleep time 
(Melke et al., 2008; Tordjman et al., 2012). The increased 
prevalence of sleep disturbances in ASD may be due to 
variations in clock genes and melatonin pathway genes 
(Yang et al., 2016) leading to abnormal melatonin pro- 
duction and secretion (Melke et al., 2008; Pagan 
et al., 2017). However behavioral modifications in partic- 
ipants with autism may also lead to inappropriate light 
exposure patterns, 
(Coutelle 
et al., 2021), and difficulties integrating social cues linked 
to daily rhythms and sleep timing (Ballester et al., 2020). 
Therefore, lockdown strategies may have led to greater 
sleep–wake disturbances in adults with autism compared 
to those in the general population. 



We conducted an observational cross-sectional study to 
assess sleep–wake rhythms and related behaviors before 
and during COVID-related lockdown in adults with 
autism compared to adults from the general population, 
referred to below as the comparison group. 



The comparison group data were extracted from a 
French nation-wide survey, conducted by the “Morphée” 
Network (Hartley et al., 2020). In parallel, adults with a 
pre-established diagnosis of ASD were recruited via ASD 
expert centers nationwide. ASD expert centers ensure a 
diagnosis made by certified practitioners using the Diag- 
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 
IV-TR, Bell, 1994 or DSM-5 criteria according to the 
year 
Psychiatric 
Association, 2013) and the Autism Diagnostic Observa- 
tion Scale (Lord et al., 2000). The eligibility criteria were: 
age 18 or older, and capable of completing the online 
questionnaire independently. Participants received an 
email inviting them to participate in a web-based study 
using the same questionnaire as for the general popula- 
tion (Hartley et al., 2020). Participants provided consent 
in response to the first question of the form. The study 
“Comité d’éthique pour 
was approved by the 
la 
recherche” (CER) of 
the University of Strasbourg 
(Unistra/CER/2020-07). 


One small Turkish study assessed the relationship 
between chronotype, sleep, and autism symptom severity 
in 46 children with autism during lockdown (Türko(cid:1)glu 
et al., 2020). Their results showed that children with 
autism reported more “eveningness” chronotype, sleep 
problems, and autism symptom scores during the lock- 
down period than before. They also showed that sleep 
problems mediated the relationship between chronotype 
and autism symptoms in that population. However, to 
the best of our knowledge, the effects of lockdown on 
sleep and chronotype have not been studied in adults 
with autism. 
The aim of our study was to explore the effect of lock- 
down on sleep and circadian rhythms in adults with 
autism compared to the general population. Based on the 
scientific literature, we predicted (i) higher levels of sleep– 
wake rhythms disturbances and lower sleep quality and 
sleep regularity in the ASD group compared to the gen- 
eral population, and (ii) a differential impact of lockdown 
on sleep quality parameters and related behaviors (daily 
screen time, daylight exposure, and physical activity), in 
adults with autism compared to the general population. 
The full questionnaire is available in the Supplementary 
material, in the original version (French) and an English 
translation. The time taken to fill the online question- 
naire was estimated to be less than 10 min. It included 
20 questions, four dealing with demographics and hous- 
ing characteristics, five regarding circadian sleep–wake 
rhythms and three about related behaviors (exposure to 
daylight, screen time, and physical activity). Questions 
regarding circadian sleep–wake rhythms and related 
behaviors were asked twice, before and during lockdown. 
Questions regarding demographic and housing char- 
acteristics were: age, sex, type of housing (house, apart- 
ment, with, or without outside space) and living 
arrangements (alone, with a partner, with one, or more 
children, with extended family). 
Questions regarding the characteristics of sleep and 
circadian rhythms before and during lockdown were 
“quality of sleep” (Likert scale, scores from 0 to 10), 
“bedtime” (clock time range), “wake-up time” (clock time 
range), “day-to-day regularity of wake-up time” (varying 
less than an hour, between 1 and 2 h, more than 2 h), 
“weekly amount of physical activity,” “daily exposure to 


light” (in hours), “daily exposure to screens 
natural 
(smartphone, TV, tablet, etc.) in the evening” (in hours). 
The mid-point of sleep (also called mid-sleep time), a 
proxy 
(Kantermann & 
Burgess, 2017), was defined as the time point halfway 
between bedtime and wake-up time. 





Intragroup differences before and during lockdown were 
tested using the Mantel–Haenszel test for qualitative vari- 
ables and Wilcoxon rank test for quantitative variables. 
Intergroup (ASD vs. comparison group) differences in 
sleep and related variables before lockdown and during 
lockdown were explored using logistic regression (with 
group as the dependent variable), adjusted for sex and 
age. For all categorical independent variables, the refer- 
ence category was defined as the most prevalent in the 
comparison group at T0 (before lockdown). Finally, 
intergroup differences between before and during 
lockdown (more, less, or equal sleep duration, regular 
wake-up time, screen duration, exercise frequency, and 
day-light exposure; as well as earlier, later or equal bed 
and wake-up time) were studied using logistic regression, 
adjusted for age, and sex. 


Population demographics are described in Table 1. The 
study included 1859 adults, comprising 207 adults with 
autism (44.0% men), and 1652 participants of the general 
population (22.9% men). There was a significant overrepre- 
sentation of men in the ASD group compared to the com- 
parison group (p < 0.001), and mean age was equivalent 
(34.5 (SD 10.3) years in the ASD group and 35.4 (SD 11.4) 
years in the comparison group). The type of housing was 
similar between groups; however, living arrangements were 
quite different, with 41.1% of the ASD group versus 14.6% 
of the comparison group being confined with extended 
family, and only 15.5% of the ASD group versus 38.7% of 
the comparison group being confined with their wife/ 
husband and/or their underage children. 
Before lockdown comparison between ASD and 
the general population (intergroup comparison) 
Before lockdown, adults with autism had longer sleep 
duration (β 0.43 CI95% [0.29; 0.56]) but poorer sleep 
quality than the comparison group (β (cid:1)0.30 CI95% 
[(cid:1)0.38; (cid:1)0.23]. They also had on average a later circa- 
dian rhythm (mid-point of sleep β 0.29 CI95% [0.16; 
0.43]), but extremely early bedtime (between 21:00 and 
22:00) was also more frequent 
in participants with 
autism, indicating a nonlinear association, with an over- 
representation of participants with autism at both 
extremes of the chronotype spectrum. In addition, wak- 
ing times were less regular in adults with autism than in 
the comparison group: Odds ratio (OR) of varying wake- 
time by 1 h 1.68 CI95% [1.20; 2.34], OR of varying wake- 
time by 2 h 2.56 CI95% [1.65; 4.06], p < 0.01). Behavior 
was also different: compared to the comparison group, 
participants with autism had longer screen time during 
the evening, did less exercise and had a shorter daily 
exposure to light (Table 2). All results were adjusted for 
age and sex.

Effect of lockdown, in ASD and the general 
population (intragroup before/after comparison) 
All studied measures of sleep were significantly affected 
by the lockdown in both groups (Table 2). Compared to 
pre-lockdown, both the comparison group and partici- 
pants with autism had poorer self-rated sleep quality as 
well as less regular and delayed sleep–wake rhythm, with 
later bed and wake-up time resulting in a delayed mid- 
point of sleep (all p < 0.001). However, modification in 
linear, with an increase of 
sleep duration was not 
extremes (less than 6 h and more than 10 h) in both 
groups. Behavioral measures were also affected by the 
lockdown, with longer screen time in the evening, and 
less exposure to daylight. In both groups, there was an 
increase of participants not doing any exercise but also 
an increase of participants exercising every day. 
Lockdown affected sleep in a similar way in both 
groups, with an equivalent difference before and during 
lockdown in sleep duration, bedtime, wake-up time, and 
overall sleep quality (Table 3). Regarding behavioral 
measures, the comparison group was more likely to 
increase the frequency of physical activity and daylight 
exposure (see Figure 1). They were also more likely to 
increase evening screen time exposure. This could be 
explained by the fact adults with autism already had a 
very high screen exposure before lockdown, with 37% 
spending 3 h or more in front of a screen in the evening; 
there was thus less opportunity for them to increase even 
further this exposure, resulting in a ceiling effect.. 
During lockdown comparison between ASD and 
the general population (intergroup comparison) 
Adults with autism presented the same differences with 
the comparison group noted prior to lockdown, with lon- 
ger sleep duration, poorer sleep quality more irregular 
wake-times than the comparison group. Average bedtime 
and wake-up time remained later, resulting in a later 
mid-point of sleep (see Figure 2), although extremely 
early bedtimes, between 21:00 and 22:00, were still more 
present in participants with autism. Adults with autism 
also maintained worse sleep–wake rhythm related behav- 
iors with less physical activity, less daylight exposure, 
and more screen time, although the “less than an hour” 
exposure to screen time was more frequent in the ASD 
group (Table 2, all p < 0.001). 

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first 
attempt to investigate the impact of lockdown strategies 
on sleep and circadian rhythms in an adult population 
with autism compared to a large sample of the general 
population. Our study shows that adults with autism had

pre-existing sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances 
before the lockdown period, compared to the comparison 
group, including a phase shift with later bedtime and 
waking hours, and a longer sleep duration but lower sleep 
quality. In both groups, 
lockdown affected not only 
sleep, with poorer self-rated sleep quality, less regular 
and more delayed sleep–wake rhythms but also related 
behavioral measures, notably exposure to natural and 
artificial light, with longer screen time in the evening and 
less exposure to daylight. Though the effect of lockdown 
was similar in both groups, our results highlight that the 
pre-existing shift in circadian rhythms and lifestyles in 
adults with autism in relation to the general population 
was further amplified by lockdown. 

Our data before lockdown show that adults with autism 
had a longer sleep duration but a poorer sleep quality 
than the general population. Those results partially 
match with the existing literature, which is generally 
scarcer for adults than for children with autism. A recent 
meta-analysis found that adults with autism had a higher 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, meaning a poorer sleep 
quality, a longer total time spent in bed, and a higher 
sleep onset latency than controls; but no differences were 
found in total sleep time (Morgan et al., 2020). In their 
study based on polysomnography, Limoges et al. (2005) 
also found lower sleep quality (lower sleep efficiency, 


in adults with high functioning ASD and without co- 
occurring anxiety or depression diagnosis compared to 
neurotypical adults using actigraphy. 
Regarding sleep–wake rhythm, the ASD group dis- 
played less regular sleep patterns and, on average, a later 
circadian phase 
(later bedtime and wake-up time 
resulting in a later mid-point of sleep). However, this 
association is not linear, with an overrepresentation of 
both extremely early and extremely late bedtime in the 
ASD group. Our results are in line with the current litera- 
ture reporting circadian rhythm disturbances in ASD, 
but with no clear direction of the phase shift. Hare 
et al. (2006) observed in their actigraphic study a lower 
relative amplitude, lower inter-daily stability and greater 
variability in sleep measures. On average, mean phase 
markers were equivalent in both groups but with variabil- 
ity in the ASD group indicating the presence of both 
phase 
and 
phase 
Richdale (2017) found that adults with ASD were more 
likely to meet diagnosis criteria (based on actigraphy and 
sleep diary) for circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorder, 
with a significant proportion displaying delayed sleep– 
wake phase disorder, but also a non-significant propor- 
tion with advanced sleep–wake rhythms. In their study 
assessing circadian phase based on dim-light melatonin 
onset, Baker et al. (2017) observed no mean difference in 
circadian phase but advances and delays in individual 
profiles. In their meta-analysis, Morgan et al. (2020) did 
not find significant differences between the ASD and con- 
trol populations in bedtime (weekend or weekday) and 
wake-up time (weekend or weekday). As previously 
suggested by Baker and Richdale (2017), it is likely that 
sub-groups of sleep phenotype and etiology exist within

ASD. Null findings could be explained by the presence of 
both extremes (i.e., very early and very late chronotypes) 
simultaneously in the ASD population, as the process of 
averaging the extremes would cancel the difference with a 
more normally distributed sleep duration in the general 
population. 
The lower sleep quality and disturbed circadian 
rhythm found in participants with autism prior to lock- 
down could be partially explained by behaviors likely to 
negatively influence sleep and circadian rhythm. Partici- 
pants with autism did indeed display longer screen times 
during the evening, less frequent physical exercise and a 
shorter daily exposure to light 
than the comparison 
group. These results are in line with the literature describ- 
ing a more sedentary behavior in children with autism 
compared to their neurotypical peers (Jones et al., 2017), 
and although the literature is much more sparse, concor- 
dant results are found for adults with autism (Coutelle 
et al., 2021; Weir et al., 2021). In addition to these exter- 
nal factors, the irregular sleep–wake patterns or circadian 
rhythm sleep–wake disorders in ASD are also likely to be 
intrinsic 
to ASD pathophysiological mechanisms 
(Lorsung et al., 2021). As detailed in the Lorsung 
et al. (2021), studies have reported polymorphisms in 
genes that regulate circadian timing (called clock genes, 
Yang et al., 2016) as well as abnormal secretion of circa- 
dian 
(Melke 
et al., 2008), serotonin (Melke et al., 2008) and cortisol 
(Corbett et al., 2006). 



As expected, both the comparison group and ASD 
groups were impacted by lockdown, with poorer self- 
rated sleep quality, less regular and delayed sleep–wake 
rhythm, and a delayed mid-point of sleep compared to 
before lockdown. These results are in line with the exis- 
ting literature on the effect of 
lockdown in various 
populations’ 
sleep patterns. For example, Gualano 
et al. (2020) found that 42.2% of the 1515 participants of 
their Italian online survey had sleep disturbances during 
the last 14 days of lockdown and, among them, 17.4% 
reported moderate/severe insomnia. Another study found 
later bedtime hour, sleep onset latency, and wake-up time 
during lockdown compared to before in 400 participants, 
with a worsened sleep quality and an increase of insom- 
nia symptoms (Marelli et al., 2020). Blume et al. (2020) 
found similar results, with an increase in sleep duration 
and a decrease in sleep quality A delayed chronotype 
during lockdown was also found in Argentina by Leone 
et al. (2020) with later going to sleep and waking up times 
on weekdays, resulting in a longer weekday sleep dura- 
tion during the lockdown, without an impact on sleep 
quality. 
Contrary to our initial hypothesis, participants with 
autism were not more impacted by lockdown than the 
general population in terms of differences in sleep pat- 
terns; in fact, both populations were equally affected. 
Indeed, the magnitude of the difference between before 
and during lockdown in sleep duration, bedtime, wake- 
up time, and overall sleep quality proved to be equivalent 
in participants with autism and the general population. 
But as significant sleep disturbances were present prior to 
lockdown in adults with autism compared to the general 
population, these difficulties worsened significantly dur- 
ing lockdown. We note that though sleep worsened, some 
aspects of lockdown may have been positive for some 
adults with autism, such as a relief from social demands 
(Oomen et al., 2021; Pellicano et al., 2021). 

Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. First, our 
sample of adults with autism is not representative of the 
general population of adults with autism, since the ability 
to take an online survey requires a preserved intelligence, 
which excludes de facto a population with moderate to 
severe intellectual deficiency. The comparison group 
wasn’t representative of the general population either, 
especially regarding the sex ratio (77% women). Female 
preponderance happens to be common in online surveys 
where participation is based on a voluntary commitment; 
recent online surveys regarding COVID-19 (Sulistyawati 
et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) as well as surveys con- 
ducted within the ASD population (Scattoni et al., 2021) 
have reported similar imbalance towards women. Sec- 
ond, due to the time-sensitive aspect of the research and 
lockdown circumstances, all data were self-reported. We 
were unable to conduct face-to-face interviews and collect 
objective measures. Results are thus to be interpreted 
rather as a perception of sleep than actual sleep. Lugo 
et al. (2020) report in their meta-analysis regarding sleep 
in adults with autism that subjective measures match 
those found in actigraphy studies, but not those of poly- 
somnography. Also, in order to limit response burden, 
the questionnaire was designed to minimize completion 
time (Hartley et al., 2020). Thus, data regarding socio- 
demographic features of the population are scarce and 
we did not use validated questionnaires, which were 
deemed too lengthy to assess sleep and circadian rhythm. 
Third, we did not screen for other co-occurring condi- 
tions which are quite frequent in ASD, notably those that 
may have impacted sleep and sleep–wake rhythms 
(e.g., anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, 
for review: Hossain et al., 2020). For example, a longer 
sleep duration may be associated with depression, while 
anxiety can lead to lower sleep quality or in dysregulated 
bedtime and waketime. As anxiety and depression symp- 
toms appear to be associated with lockdown in ASD 
(Oomen et al., 2021; Pellicano et al., 2021) and the gen- 
eral population (Gualano et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020; 
Marelli et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Benros, 2020; Wang 


et al., 2020) and are linked to sleep (Altena et al., 2016), 
it will be important to take those variables into account 
in future studies. Fourth, participants reported retrospec- 
tively on sleep and wake behavior “before lockdown,” 
leading to a potential recall bias. Finally, we did not ver- 
ify if our participants experienced a disruption in their 
health care provision. The reallocation of medical staff 
towards COVID-19 units restricted the access to health 
and psychiatric care for most people, which may have 
indirectly impacted sleep quality. As co-occurring medi- 
cal and psychiatric conditions are more prevalent in peo- 
ple with autism (Lai et al., 2014, 2019), this population 
would be, like other psychiatric populations, more vul- 
nerable 
(Hao 
et al., 2020; Lazzari et al., 2020; Talevi et al., 2020; 
Vindegaard & Benros, 2020). 




Studies in children with autism and their families have 
shown that lockdown led to an increase in behavioral 
issues and autism symptoms (Asbury et al., 2020; Colizzi 
et al., 2020), but also a worsening of quality of life linked 
(Manning et al., 2020). 
to higher 
Maintaining functioning mental health services during 
future lockdowns, especially for vulnerable populations, 
should be a priority for governments and may require 
innovative solutions. Telemedicine may represent an 
opportunity to maintain services, as some therapies and 
healthcare support are adaptable to new technologies 
(e.g., teleconsultation services and health care apps) some 
of which target sleep (Aji et al., 2021) (e.g., online cogni- 
tive and behavioral therapy for insomnia). 

Our study has shed new light on circadian sleep–wake 
rhythms in adults with autism before and during the 
COVID-related lockdown. Lockdown had a negative 
impact on sleep–wake rhythms and related behaviors of 
both adults with autism and the general population. 
While adults with autism displayed significantly higher 
levels of sleep disturbances before lockdown, including 
delayed sleep phase, more irregular sleep–wake rhythms, 
and more behaviors known to affect sleep and circadian 
rhythms (lower daylight exposure, lower levels of physi- 
cal activity, and higher screen time) compared to the gen- 
eral population, 
lockdown affected sleep in both 
populations in similar ways, leading to even higher sleep 
disturbances in the ASD population. Given the known 
vulnerability of this population, innovative support strat- 
egies should be sought in case of future lockdowns.
