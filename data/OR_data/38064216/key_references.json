            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nScreen time in early childhood has been associated with children's prosocial and behavioral skills; however, the directionality of this relationship is unclear. We aimed to determine the direction of the relationship between screen time, social skills, and nonsocial behavioral traits in young children.\n## METHODS\nThis was a population-based, prospective cohort study with data across 5 time points. We examined the reciprocal relationships between caregiver-reported children's screen time at 12, 18, 24, 36, and 54 months and social behaviors collected using the Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment at 12 months; the Quantitative Checklist for Autism at 18, 24, and 36 months; and the Social Responsiveness Scale at 54 months. Cross-lagged path models were used for analysis.\n## RESULTS\nA multiple imputation data set and complete data from 229 participants were included in the analyses. Screen time at 12, 18, and 36 months predicted nonsocial behavioral traits at 54 months. Cross-lagged path models showed a clear direction from increased screen time at earlier time points to both poorer social skills and atypical behaviors at later time points (Akaike information criterion 18936.55, Bayesian information criterion 19210.73, root mean square error of approximation 0.037, and comparative fit index 0.943). Social skills or behavioral traits at a younger age did not predict later screen time at any of the time points.\n## CONCLUSION\nScreen time in early childhood has lagged influences on social skills and nonsocial behaviors; the reverse relationship is not found. Close monitoring of social behaviors may be warranted in the setting of excessive screen time during early childhood.\n",

            "abstract": "Research problem Advances in technology have ensured its inevitable integration in our life. Children, being at a vulnerable age period of development, are spending more time on electronic devices. Some studies reported negative effects on sleep, physical health such as obesity and vision problems, and behavioral changes such as aggressive behavior with exposure to violent media content. Research significance We will study the effect of using electronic devices on communication skills in children in Saudi Arabia. Our findings can be used to raise awareness on this matter. Research objectives The aim of our study is to examine the association between screen time and social communication skills among children of four years to six years of age in Saudi Arabia. Research methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the relationship between social skills development and screen time by using a validated Arabic version of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). The sample in this study consists of 308 children from four to six years of age. Research results The results showed that the hours spent using the electronic device were significantly associated with having an SCQ score \u2265 15 (P < 0.05). A high SCQ score was prevalent in 19.7% (n = 31) of children who spent >3 hours using an electronic device compared to 10.2% (n = 5) and 7.84% (n = 8) of children who spent an hour or <2 hours using electronic devices, respectively. Conclusion Our study highlighted a significant association between the daily hours spent on devices and having an SCQ score above 15, which suggests a deficit in social skill development and having autism spectrum disorder-like symptoms.\n",

            "abstract": "Screen time is becoming increasingly common in daily life. Early and excessive screen use has raised growing concerns for children's neuropsychological development. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between exposure to screen time in early life and the presence of autistic-like behaviors among preschool children. 29,461 child-caregiver dyads at kindergartens in Longhua New District of Shenzhen, China, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Information concerning socio-demographic characteristics, frequency and duration of children's electronic screen exposure for each year since birth, and autistic-like behaviors (measured by the Autism Behavior Checklist) were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire completed by the primary caregivers. A series of logistic regression models assessed the association between screen time and autistic-like behaviors. Results indicated that younger initial age, longer daily screen time and longer cumulative years of screen exposure since birth were associated with the presence of autistic-like behaviors at preschool age. The risk was enhanced with the increase of both daily screen time and cumulative years of screen exposure during preschool period. Moreover, the cross-over analysis indicated that the first three years following birth might be a sensitive period for children when screen exposure increases the risk of experiencing autistic-like behaviors. In conclusion, our study implied that screen exposure in early life might increase the occurrence of autistic-like behaviors among preschoolers. These findings support the need for early interventions into preschoolers' screen use, however longitudinal studies are necessary to further confirm the causal relationship between early screen time and the incidence of later autistic-like behaviors among preschool children.\n",

Method: One hundred ninety-three Chinese children with ASD were recruited. We collected the demographic and screen time data using a questionnaire. The ASD core symptoms and developmental quotient (DQ) were measured by the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2), Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese Language Edition (GDS-C), and Chinese Children's Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire (CPCIS). Then, we analyzed the correlations between the screen time of children with ASD and the ABC, CARS, ADOS, GDS-C DQs, and CPCIS scores. Linear regression was used to analyze the risk factors that affect screen time. Results: The children's average daily screen time was 2.64 \u00b1 2.24 h. Forty eight percent children were exposed to two or more types of electronic devices. Their favorite activity of screen time was watching cartoons. Only 34% children spent screen time accompanied by parents and with communication. 50.26% children had no screen time before sleeping. The screen time of children with ASD had a negative correlation with the GDS-C CQ (r = -0.234, P = 0.001) and the CPCIS score (r = -0.180, P = 0.012) and a positive correlation with the CARS score (r = 0.192, P = 0.009). A low father's education level (P = 0.010), less restriction of the child's screen time by the guardian (P = 0.001), greater caregiver screen time (P < 0.001), the use of the screen as a tool for child rearing (P = 0.001), and the child's ownership of independent electronic equipment (P = 0.027) are risk factors for long screen time in children with ASD. Conclusion: The screen time of children with ASD in China is higher than the recommended standard, and the current situation is serious. The screen time of ASD children is related to their autism symptoms, DQ and parent-child interaction. Low paternal education levels, less restriction of children's screen time by guardians, greater guardian screen time, the use of screens in child rearing, and children's ownership of independent electronic equipment can lead to an increase in children's screen time. These findings may have implications for family intervention strategies.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the screen time of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their autistic symptoms and development quotients (DQs). Methods: We compared the screen time of 101 children with ASD and 57 typically developing (TD) children. Then, we performed a correlation analysis to determine the correlations between the screen time and the ASD-related scale scores and developmental quotients of the Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS) of ASD children. We further divided the ASD group into subgroups according to the screen time and age and then separately conducted the above correlation analyses by subgroup. Result: The results showed that the screen time of the children with ASD was longer than that of the TD children (3.34 \u00b1 2.64 h vs. 0.91 \u00b1 0.93 h). The screen time of the children with ASD was positively correlated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score (r = 0.242, P = 0.021) and \"taste, smell and touch\" item of CARS(r = 0.304, P = 0.005), and negatively correlated with the language DQ of the GDS (r = -0.236, P = 0.047). The subgroup analysis showed that in the longer screen time subgroup of ASD children, the screen time was positively correlated with the CARS score (r = 0.355, P = 0.026) and negatively correlated with the DQs of all domains of the GDS (P < 0.05). In addition, in the younger age group of ASD children, the screen time was positively correlated with the CARS score (r = 0.314, P = 0.021) and negatively correlated with the DQs of all domains of the GDS, except for the personal-social behavior domain (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with TD children, children with ASD have a longer screen time. The screen time is related to autism-like symptoms and the DQs of children with ASD. The longer the screen time, the more severe the symptoms of ASD (especially sensory symptoms), and the more obvious the developmental delay, especially in ASD children with a longer screen time and younger age, particularly in the language domain.",

Bedroom access to a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Multivariate models showed that, in addition to bedroom access, the amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the relationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep was mediated by hours of video game play.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe current results suggest that media-related variables may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals with ASD. Overall, the current findings suggest that screen-based media time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in children with ASD.\n",

To our knowledge, no previous research investigated concern and considerations of parents/caregivers of children with autism in Qatar or the Arabic speaking Middle Eastern region.\n## METHODS\nCaregivers of a child who was between the age of 3 to 17 years old at the time of the study and who was diagnosed with ASD (Autistic Group or AG) were recruited from the two main developmental pediatric and children rehabilitation clinics in Qatar. The control group (non-autism group, or NAG) was represented by caregivers of a non-autistic child between the age of 3 to 17 years old at the time of the study and who were visiting a family clinic of a primary health care facility for routine medical check-up. Data collected from both groups included related to the child (e.g. the child's date of birth, his/her relation to the caregiver, number of siblings, number of hours of sleep in a day, number of hours spent watching television or videos prior to age 3, time spent indoors prior to age 3, absenteeism from school, and use of a nanny to care for the child) and to the caregiver (education level, profession, level of consanguinity using the phylogram method). In addition to these questions, caregivers in the AG were asked specific questions around maternal concern and considerations in respect to the future of their children and the specialized services they receive.\n## RESULTS\nChildren in the autism group spent more time indoors, watching television, or sleeping than children in the non-autism group. Only around 40% of caregivers in the autism group said they would encourage their child to get married and become a parent when s/he grows up. A number of caregivers of children with autism frequently utilize specialized rehabilitation services; others did express their needs for these services and made comments about having to wait a long time before they were provided with some of the services. Religious faith helped caregivers in accepting having a child with autism. General health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between the caregivers of the two groups, although mental health was consistently poorer in the autism group of caregivers.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe study draws attention to the concerns of the families of children with autism and their expectations about the future of their children. The findings can be used by policy makers in planning services to support these families in Qatar.\n",

Prenatal and perinatal factors were also studied. The diagnosis of ASD was based on the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) diagnostic tool and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria. Variables which were biologically relevant and has a P value of <\u00a00.05 in the univariate analysis were analyzed by logistic regression to obtain the adjusted effect measures.\n## RESULTS\nChildren with ASD were exposed to digital media at an earlier age and spent significantly more time with digital media and less time with their mothers, compared to typically developed children. Exposure to digital media before 21 mo was associated with risk of ASD and the risk increased when mothers spent less than 6.5\u00a0h per day with the baby. Family history of epilepsy and developmental delay, maternal stress during the antenatal period, and absence of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 mo were significantly more in children with ASD.\n## CONCLUSION\nThere are significant differences in the early life social experience and digital-media exposure in children with ASD compared to typically developed counterparts. Given the reported rise in prevalence of ASD, these findings stress the need for further prospective studies to explore these potentially modifiable risk factors.\n",

This study included children born to women recruited between January 2011 and March 2014, and data were analyzed in December 2020. The study was conducted by the Japan Environment and Children's Study Group in collaboration with 15 regional centers across Japan.\n## EXPOSURES\nScreen time at 1 year of age.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe outcome variable, children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age, was assessed using a questionnaire administered to mothers of the participating children.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. The prevalence of children with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age was 392 per 100\u202f000 (0.4%), and boys were 3 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than were girls. Logistic regression analysis showed that among boys, when \"no screen\" was the reference, the adjusted odds ratios were as follows: less than 1 hour, odds ratio, 1.38 (95 % CI, 0.71-2.69; P\u2009=\u2009.35), 1 hour to less than 2 hours, odds ratio, 2.16 (95 % CI, 1.13-4.14; P\u2009=\u2009.02), 2 hours to less than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.48 (95% CI, 1.83-6.65; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and more than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.02 (95% CI, 1.44-6.34; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Among girls, however, there was no association between autism spectrum disorder and screen time.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong boys, longer screen time at 1 year of age was significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age.

For children with neurodevelopmental conditions, increased screen use could exacerbate emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBDs) by interfering with sleep quantity and quality.\n## AIMS\nThis study examined the possible mediating role of sleep in the relationship between screen use and EBDs in preschool children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) clinically referred to a child development center in Singapore.\n## METHODS\nA screen use questionnaire developed for the purposes of the present study, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were completed by 367 caregivers of 2- to 5-year-old children with NDDs (39.5% autism spectrum disorder; 36.8% speech-language disorders; 23.7% others).\n## RESULTS\nAverage daily screen use duration was 3.98 hours, with 93.9% exceeding 1 hour of screen time daily. 57.7% of children had screen devices in their bedrooms, while 52% commenced screen use at the age of 18 months or earlier. Sleep problems fully mediated the relationship between the number of bedroom screen devices and children's EBDs, as well as between the age of first screen use and EBDs, but not between hours of screen use and EBDs. Controlling for age, developmental level, and family income, children who started using screens earlier than 18 months and who had screen devices in their bedrooms had significantly more sleep problems and EBDs than those without.\n## CONCLUSION\nChildren with neurodevelopmental conditions may have more difficulties disengaging from screen devices in their bedrooms, and an earlier age of screen exposure may contribute to more chronic disruption of sleep.\n",

To test our hypothesis that social interaction anxiety and loneliness mediate the relation between autistic traits and excessive smartphone use, we recruited a sample of 1103 college students and asked them to complete an assessment that measured the degrees of autistic traits, social interaction anxiety, loneliness, and excessive smartphone use. The results showed significant correlations among these variables. More autistic traits, which are correlated with higher levels of social interaction anxiety and higher levels of loneliness, were found to be associated with excessive smartphone use. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for screening for excessive smartphone use among college students who demonstrate autistic traits. Social interaction anxiety and loneliness show great potential in screening for excessive smartphone use among college students with high levels of autistic traits.

Both the ASD and ADHD groups had greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBoys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video game use among children with ASD.

Compared to the general population, participants with autism may be particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of lockdown on sleep, given their intrinsic inflexible adherence to routines and the high overall prevalence of sleep disturbances in this population. The study is a French nation-wide online survey assessing sleep-wake rhythms and behaviors known to affect sleep (daily screen time, daylight exposure, and physical activity), before and during COVID-related lockdown. Respondents were 207 adults with autism (56% female) and 1652 adults of the general population (77% female), with a mean age 35.3\u2009years (SD 11.3). Before lockdown, the adults with autism displayed on average later bedtime and waking hours, lower sleep quality, more evening screen time, less exposure to daylight, and less exercise (all p\u2009<\u20090.01). Lockdown affected all studied measures of sleep and related exposures in a similar way in both groups: poorer self-rated sleep quality as well as a less regular and delayed sleep-wake rhythm, longer screen time in the evening and less exposure to daylight (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Adults with autism displayed significantly higher levels of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and less favorable daily routines known to regulate sleep.

In a sample of 1800 adults, we observed that, before lockdown, participants with autism displayed significantly higher levels of sleep disturbances and less favorable daily routines known to regulate sleep, compared to the general population. While the deleterious effect of lockdown on sleep was similar in both groups, pre-existing difficulties in adults with autism reached worrying levels during lockdown.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nEarly years of childhood form the basis of intelligence, personality, social behaviour, and capacity to learn and nurture oneself as an adult. Our objective was to find out the effects of screen time on behavior of pre-schoolers, which could provide scientific grounds to the control of digital screen time.\n## METHOD\nA cross sectional survey was conducted in four private preschools of Islamabad from June -November 2021. A sample size of 200 children ages three-five years were selected through multistage random sampling using a parental questionnaire. Children were grouped based on daily screen time of \u226460 minutes or >60 minutes. Analysis was made based on the Child behavior checklist for ages eighteen months-five years results. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was found to be 0.925. It was analyzed using SPSS version 22. Chi-square test, independent sample t-test and multi linear regression were applied to determine the association and significance levels between the variables.\n## RESULTS\nStudy results indicate increased screen time was statistically significant with child's age, education level and employment status of mothers. It was observed that pre-schoolers with screen time of > 60 minutes tend to suffer more from withdrawal syndrome (11.94\u00b13.91, p = 0.014) sleep problems (10.97\u00b13.20, p = 0.010) and Autism spectrum problems (17.66\u00b15.89, p = 0.047) as compared to pre-schoolers with screen time \u226460 minutes. Strongest predictor of outcome variable was found to be mothers education level (\u00df = 21.53).\n## CONCLUSION\nStudy findings revealed that excessive screen time has deleterious effect and is associated with behavioural problems of pre-schoolers.\n",

            "abstract": "Background: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for poor health and obesity. The authors describe obesity-related movement behaviors in children with ADHD, determine higher risk groups, and compare with children with other disorders. Methods: Physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen time of children with ADHD (aged 6-18 y) were compared with recommendations and with behaviors of children with autism, asthma, and a normative group using 2011 National Survey of Child Health data. Results: Approximately one-third of children with ADHD participated in daily PA and half in sports in the past year. Older children with ADHD were less likely to get daily PA, get enough sleep, and limit screen time to <2 hours per day. Obese children had lower odds of daily PA. Children who had lower socioeconomic status, or severe ADHD, had lower odds of sports participation. Children with ADHD had 50% lower odds of sports participation than children with asthma. Conclusions: Children with ADHD did not engage in recommended amounts of PA, sleep, and screen time. Children with ADHD who are older, poor, obese, and/or with more severe symptoms are at higher risk for suboptimal movement behaviors. These domains represent novel treatment targets in ADHD youth.",

            "abstract": "Social media holds promise as a technology to facilitate social engagement, but may displace offline social activities. Adolescents with ASD are well suited to capitalize on the unique features of social media, which requires less decoding of complex social information. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in 44 adolescents with ASD, and 56 clinical comparison controls. Social media use was significantly associated with high friendship quality in adolescents with ASD, which was moderated by the adolescents' anxiety levels. No associations were founds between social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in the controls. Social media may be a way for adolescents with ASD without significant anxiety to improve the quality of their friendships.\n",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships between screen time (ST), nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems in a sample of preschool children in China. A sample of 8900 children aged 3-6\u00a0years was enrolled from 35 kindergartens, in four cities, in two provinces, in China to evaluate the relationships between ST, nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems. Children's ST and nighttime sleep duration were assessed by questionnaires completed by parents or guardians. Behavioural problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Clancy Autism Behaviour Scale (CABS). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the associations between ST, nighttime sleep duration, and behavioural problems. The total SDQ and CABS scores were higher in children with ST \u22652\u00a0h/day and sleep duration <9.15\u00a0h/day (a P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all). After adjusting for potential confounders, children with ST \u22652\u00a0h/day had a significantly increased risk of having total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial problems, as well as behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Similar results were found in children with sleep duration <9.15\u00a0h/day. No significantly increased risk of emotional symptoms was observed for short sleep duration. Preschool children with more ST and short nighttime sleep duration were significantly more likely to have behavioural problems. These results may contribute to a better understanding of prevention and intervention for psychosocial problems in children.\n",

            "abstract": "Video games are popular and ubiquitous aspects of human culture, but their relationships to psychological and neurophysiological traits have yet to be analyzed in social-evolutionary frameworks. We examined the relationships of video game usage, motivations, and preferences with autistic and schizotypal traits and two aspects of neurophysiology, reaction time and targeting time. Participants completed the Autism Quotient, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, a Video Game Usage Questionnaire, and two neurophysiological tasks. We tested in particular the hypotheses, motivated by theory and previous work, that: (1) participants with higher autism scores would play video games more, and participants with higher schizotypy scores would play video games less; and (2) autism and positive schizotypy would be associated with opposite patterns of video game use, preferences and motivations. Females, but not males, with higher autism scores played more video games, and exhibited evidence of relatively male-typical video game genre preferences and motivations. By contrast, positive schizotypy was associated with reduced video game use in both genders, for several measures of game use frequency. In line with previous findings, males played video game more than females did overall, preferred action video games, and exhibited faster reaction and targeting times. Females preferred Puzzle and Social Simulation games. Faster reaction and targeting times were associated with gaming motives related to skill development and building behavior. These findings show that gaming use and patterns reflect aspects of psychology, and gender, related to social cognition and imagination, as well as aspects of neurophysiology. More generally, the results suggest that video game use is notably affected by levels of autistic and schizotypal traits, and that video games may provide an evolutionarily novel medium for imaginative play in which immersive play experiences can be decoupled from social interaction.\n",

We aimed to study the sleep status and the occurrence of sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 1-3 years, and to provide reference for guiding early comprehensive intervention for ASD children from the perspective of sleep.\n## METHODS\nFrom January 1 to December 31, 2021, 74 ASD children who met the diagnostic criteria of \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-V)\" served as case group while 84 typically-developing children of the same sex and age served as control group. An original Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire was adopted to compare the sleep status of children in the two groups and to conduct statistical analysis on related factors.\n## RESULTS\nThe incidence of sleep problems in the case group (78.4%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (34.5%) (\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe incidence of sleep problems in ASD children aged 1-3 years is also high, mainly manifested in late bedtime, difficulty falling asleep, frequent night awakenings and less sleep duration. Both sleep patterns and screen exposure can impact their sleep. In the early comprehensive intervention of ASD children, it is necessary to pay full heed to their sleep status and take timely intervention measures in order to improve the quality of life for the ASD children and their families.\n",

Data retrieved from families such as concerns at the time of referal and characteristics that comprised use of electronics were recorded. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Behavior Checklist was administered by the clinician to evaluate the symptom severity of ASD. Furthermore, the Ankara Development and Screening Inventory were applied to the children to evaluate the general developmental level. ## Results: ASD was generally diagnosed around 36th month and parents of these children were found to have suspected of something going wrong regarding developmental characteristics of their children approximately 14 months prior formal diagnosis. Age at index use of electronics was smaller and screen time was higher in children with ASD. It has also been found that families most frequently were referred to the clinician due to problems in communication. Discussion: Our findings suggest children with ASD might be more prone to problematic use of electronics. Smaller index age for initiating use of electronic devices might predominantly affect socioemotional processes negatively. The clinicians should evaluate screen characteristics in these children. Lastly, It is important to encourage parents to report concerns to clinicians for early detection of ASD.",

            "abstract": "When compared to typically developing children, children with developmental delays (DD) are at especially high risk for poor health outcomes. Several interpersonal factors, including caregiver behaviors, have been examined in relation to typically developing preschool children\u2019s health. Limited research has examined these associations in the DD population. The following preliminary study sought to provide a preliminary evaluation of the associations between caregiver health behaviors and health behaviors of preschool-aged children with DD in a sample of 77 families. Surveys and interviews were completed with caregivers to assess sociodemographic variables, child adaptive behavior and autism symptoms, and family lifestyle and health behaviors. This study included the following research questions: (1) Are family sociodemographic variables (i.e., caregiver education, household income, caregiver race/ethnicity) associated with caregiver health behaviors (i.e., caregiver eating habits and physical activity)? (2) Are caregiver health behaviors (i.e., caregiver eating habits and physical activity) associated with child heath behaviors (i.e., child unhealthy eating, physical activity, and screen time)? (3) Does child developmental functioning (i.e., adaptive behavior and autism symptoms) moderate the association between caregiver health behaviors and child health behaviors? Study results for the first research question indicated neither caregiver race, caregiver education, nor household income, were meaningfully associated with caregiver health behaviors. The second research question revealed that 1) caregiver health behaviors were negatively associated with child unhealthy eating habits and positively child physical activity, but not meaningfully associated with child screen time. Results for research question three demonstrated that 1) the relation between caregiver health behaviors and child unhealthy eating was moderated by child adaptive behavior and 2) the relation between caregiver health behaviors and child unhealthy eating was moderated by child ASD symptomatology, 3) neither child adaptive behaviorfunctioning nor child ASD symptomatology moderated the association between caregiver health behaviors and child physical activity or caregiver health behaviors and child screen time. The results of this study have implications for the development of interventions for families of children with developmental delays.",
