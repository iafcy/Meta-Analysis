            "abstract": "Participation in regular physical activity has significant physical, psychological, and social benefits, including the prevention and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The primary aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of theeCoFit physical activity intervention on depression and anxiety symptoms among adults at risk of, or diagnosed with, T2D. The primary outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7. The secondary aim was to test for the potential mediators for the intervention effect on mental health. The 20-week intervention was evaluated using a two-arm randomised controlled trial with await list control group. The intervention included two phases: Phase 1 integrated group face-to-face sessions and the use of the eCoFit smartphone application (app); and Phase 2 that included the use of the app only. Participants (n = 84) were assessed at baseline and 10- and 20-weeks post-baseline. Social support, self-efficacy, nature-relatedness, and perceived sleep quality were examined as potential mechanisms for the intervention effects on mental health. A significant interaction for depression severity was observed at 20-weeks (-1.76, CI -3.48, -05, p= .044, d= -0.35). There were no significant intervention effects for anxiety or any of the potential mechanisms."

This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NFB in alleviating pain and pain-associated symptoms in chronic pain patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      MEDLINE, PUBMED, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched using the strategy: (\"Neurofeedback\" OR \"EEG Biofeedback\" OR \"fMRI Biofeedback\") AND (\"Pain\" or \"Chronic Pain\"). Clinical trials reporting changes in pain following electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) NFB in chronic pain patients were included. Only Randomized-controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCT) and case series were included. Effect size was pooled for all RCTs in a meta-analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-one studies were included. Reduction in pain following NFB was reported by one high-quality RCT, five of six low-quality RCT or NRCT and 13 of 14 case-series. Pain reduction reported by studies ranged from 6% to 82%, with 10 studies reporting a clinically significant reduction in pain of >30%. The overall effect size was medium (cohen's d -0.76, 95% confidence interval -1.31 to -0.20). Studies were highly heterogeneous (Q [df = 5] = 18.46, p = .002, I2 = 73%). Improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue and sleep were also seen in some studies. Common side-effects included headache, nausea and drowsiness. These generally did not lead to withdrawal of therapy except in one study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Neurofeedback is a safe and effective therapy with promising but largely low-quality evidence supporting its use in chronic pain. Further high-quality trials comparing different protocols is warranted to determine the most efficacious way to deliver NFB.\n    \n\n\n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      Neurofeedback is a novel neuromodulatory approach which can be used to reduce the severity of pain and pain-associated symptoms such as sleep disturbances, mood disturbances, fatigue and anxiety in a number of chronic pain conditions. It has a potential to provide integrative non-pharmacological management for chronic pain patients with pain refractory to pharmacological agents with high side-effect profiles. Further high-quality double-blinded randomized sham-controlled trials are needed in order to fully explore the potential of this therapy."

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize (1) the range of presenting problems to which the UP has been applied with adult patients, and (2) the settings in which the protocol has been used, as well as any modifications made to it. Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a literature search of PsychInfo, PubMed, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and Web of Science. The 77 studies included in this review indicated the UP has been applied to a wide range of presenting problems including anxiety, depressive, bipolar, traumatic-stressor, substance use, eating, borderline personality, insomnia, and physical health disorders. Additionally, the UP has been applied to non-diagnosable problems such as non-suicidal self-injury, subclinical presentations, and sexual minority stress. The strongest base of evidence for the UP is among Caucasian females in the United States with anxiety-related or depressive disorders. Numerous adaptions of the UP were present in the literature. Overall, results suggest the UP can be flexibly applied to a range of diagnostic presentations. However, many studies reviewed were preliminary and further research is needed."

There are differences in subcortical brain structures between patients with MDD and healthy controls, but the specific impact of childhood adversity on such structures in MDD remains unclear. Thus, aim of the present study was to investigate whether childhood adversity is associated with subcortical volumes and how it interacts with a diagnosis of MDD and sex. Within the ENIGMA-MDD network, nine university partner sites, which assessed childhood adversity and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with MDD and controls, took part in the current joint mega-analysis. In this largest effort world-wide to identify subcortical brain structure differences related to childhood adversity, 3036 participants were analyzed for subcortical brain volumes using FreeSurfer. A significant interaction was evident between childhood adversity, MDD diagnosis, sex, and region. Increased exposure to childhood adversity was associated with smaller caudate volumes in females independent of MDD. All subcategories of childhood adversity were negatively associated with caudate volumes in females - in particular emotional neglect and physical neglect (independently from age, ICV, imaging site and MDD diagnosis). There was no interaction effect between childhood adversity and MDD diagnosis on subcortical brain volumes. Childhood adversity is one of the contributors to brain structural abnormalities. It is associated with subcortical brain abnormalities that are relevant to psychiatric disorders such as depression."

The purpose of this study was to survey subscribers to Calm, a popular mindfulness meditation app, to explore perceived improvements in sleep and mental health, evaluate what components of the app were associated with improvements in sleep and mental health, and determine whether improvements differed based on sleep quality. Calm subscribers who had used a sleep-related component in the last 90 days completed a Web-based investigator-developed survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The survey included questions about using Calm for sleep, sleep disturbances, mental health diagnoses (i.e., anxiety, depression, PTSD) and perceived impacts of the app. Participants reported on the extent to which they felt that using Calm had improved their sleep and mental health. Most participants reported sleep disturbance, and almost half reported a mental health diagnosis. The majority of participants reported that using Calm helped them fall asleep, stay asleep, and get restful sleep. All sleep components were associated with perceived improvements in sleep disturbance. Severity of sleep disturbance moderated relationships between using Calm components and reporting improved sleep. Among subscribers with mental health diagnoses, most reported that Calm helped improve symptoms. Perceived improvement in anxiety and depression was associated with using Calm's meditation components but not Sleep Stories or music/soundscapes. Severity of sleep disturbance did not moderate relationships between using Calm components and reporting mental health improvements. Given the accessibility of app-based meditation, research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of meditation apps to improve sleep disturbance. While some sleep content may be helpful for sleep, more research is needed to test what specific content affects mental health."

This study explored physiological correlates of eye movements during EMDR in relation to current hypotheses; distraction, conditioning, orienting response activation, and REM-like mechanisms. During EMDR therapy, fingertip temperature, heart rate, skin conductance, expiratory carbon dioxide level, and blood pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, were measured in male subjects with PTSD. The ratio between the low and high frequency components of the heart rate power spectrum (LF/HF) were computed as measures of autonomic balance. Respiratory rate was calculated from the carbon dioxide trace. Stimulation shifted the autonomic balance as indicated by decreases in heart rate, skin conductance and LF/HF-ratio, and an increased finger temperature. The breathing frequency and end-tidal carbon dioxide increased; oxygen saturation decreased during eye movements. In conclusion, eye movements during EMDR activate cholinergic and inhibit sympathetic systems. The reactivity has similarities with the pattern during REM-sleep."

Self-report assessments of sleep (Sleep Condition Indicator [SCI], Insomnia Severity Scale, and Web- or app-based sleep diaries), anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale [RCADS]), and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [MFQ]) were completed at baseline and post intervention.

There are unique issues about HD treatments and schedules that disrupt regular sleep/wake routines and possibly contribute to the high severity of insomnia. Despite evidence for broad-ranging health effects of insomnia, very few clinical trials have tested the efficacy of treatments for HD patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a recommended first-line therapy but largely inaccessible to HD patients in the United States, partly because they commit considerable amounts of time to thrice-weekly dialysis treatments. Another important reason could be the logistical and reimbursement challenges associated with providing behavioral health care at the dialysis center. CBT-I delivered by telehealth can overcome barriers to access, but its efficacy has never been rigorously tested for these patients. Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for insomnia; however, some drugs presently used are unsafe as they are associated with a higher risk for death for HD patients (benzodiazepines and zolpidem-like drugs).

Unfortunately, while adaptive interventions are being developed and tested to improve care, information describing the components of adaptive interventions is often not published in sufficient detail to facilitate replication and improvement of these interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To contribute to and support the improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions, we provide a detailed description of the expert system for adaptively delivering content and facilitating clinical care communication for LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Information from empirically supported psychotherapies for bipolar disorder, health psychology behavior change theories, and chronic disease self-management models was combined with user-centered design data and psychiatrist feedback to guide the development of the expert system.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Decision points determining the timing of intervention option adaptation were selected to occur daily and weekly based on self-report data for medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and wellness levels. These data were selected for use as the tailoring variables determining which intervention options to deliver when and to whom. Decision rules linking delivery of options and tailoring variable thresholds were developed based on existing literature regarding bipolar disorder clinical status and psychiatrist feedback. To address the need for treatment adaptation with varying clinical statuses, decision rules for a clinical status state machine were developed using self-reported wellness rating data. Clinical status from this state machine was incorporated into hierarchal decision tables that select content for delivery to users and alerts to providers. The majority of the adaptive content addresses sleep duration, medication adherence, managing signs and symptoms, building and utilizing support, and keeping a regular routine, as well as determinants underlying engagement in these target behaviors as follows: attitudes and perceptions, knowledge, support, evaluation, and planning. However, when problems with early warning signs, symptoms, and transitions to more acute clinical states are detected, the decision rules shift the adaptive content to focus on managing signs and symptoms, and engaging with psychiatric providers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Adaptive mental health technologies have the potential to enhance the self-management of mental health disorders. The need for individuals with bipolar disorder to engage in the management of multiple target behaviors and to address changes in clinical status highlights the importance of detailed reporting of adaptive intervention components to allow replication and improvement of adaptive mental health technologies for complex mental health problems."

            "title": "Audiologist-Supported Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus in the United States: A Pilot Trial.",
            "abstract": "Background Patients often report that living with a condition such as tinnitus can be debilitating, worrying, and frustrating. Efficient ways to foster management strategies for individuals with tinnitus and promoting tinnitus self-efficacy are needed. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus shows promise as an evidence-based intervention in Europe, but is not available in the United States. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an ICBT intervention for tinnitus in the United States. Method This study reports the Phase 1 trial intended to support implementation of a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing ICBT to a weekly monitoring group. As a pilot study, a single-group pretest-posttest design was used to determine outcome potential, recruitment strategy, retention, and adherence rates of ICBT for tinnitus. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress. Secondary outcome measures included measures of anxiety, depression, insomnia, tinnitus cognitions, hearing-related difficulties, and quality of life. Results Of the 42 screened participants, nine did not meet the inclusion criteria and six withdrew. There were 27 participants who completed the intervention, with a mean age of 55.48 (± 9.9) years. Feasibility was established, as a large pretest-posttest effect size of d = 1.6 was found for tinnitus severity. Large pretest-posttest effect sizes were also found for tinnitus cognitions and hearing-related effects, and a medium effect was found for insomnia and quality of life. Treatment adherence varied with a retention rate of 85% (n = 23) at post-intervention assessment and 67% (n = 18) for the follow-up assessment. Conclusions This pilot study supported the feasibility of ICBT for tinnitus in the United States. Ways of improving intervention retention and recruitment rates need to be explored in future ICBT studies. Protocol refinements that were identified will be implemented prior to further RCTs to investigate the efficacy of ICBT for tinnitus in the United States.

Two rapid-acting antidepressant strategies, low-dose ketamine (KT) and sleep deprivation (SD) therapies, dramatically reduce depressive symptoms within 24 hours in a subset of major depressive disorder patients. However, it is unknown whether they exert their actions through shared regulatory mechanisms. To address this question, we performed comparative transcriptomics analyses to identify candidate genes and relevant pathways common to KT and SD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used the forced swim test, a standardized behavioral approach to measure antidepressant-like activity of KT and SD.

            "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction and insomnia are common side effects of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment, but the link between these symptoms has not been explored. We explore here the association between various sexual parameters and insomnia symptoms in PCa patients. Data were collected via an online survey with recruitment through various PCa organizations. One hundred and forty two patients (age = 67.3 ± 8.9 years) completed the survey. The majority were in a relationship (84.6%), of Caucasian ethnicity (83.1%), and 33% had previously received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Control variables-age, number of comorbidities, past ADT use, body mass index, depression, anxiety, fatigue and daytime sleepiness-explained 58.2% of the variance for insomnia symptoms. Including orgasm difficulty in the models accounted for an additional 2.1% in the variance in insomnia symptoms. Conversely, the control variables listed above together with insomnia symptoms predicted 37.7% of the overall variance in orgasm difficulty in PCa patients. These data suggest that sexual rehabilitation programs for PCa patients should assess insomnia symptoms, and therapies to improve sexual function or sleep quality may be beneficial in both functions given the relationship between sleep and orgasm functions in this population."

Research into BD has been driven by a strongly medical model conception, with a focus upon pathology and dysfunction. Little research to date has focused upon strategies used to maintain or regain wellness in BD. Here, we present results from a qualitative study of self-management strategies used by a Canadian sample of 'high-functioning' individuals with BD. The aims of the present paper are two-fold: (1) To provide a description of the self-management strategies identified as effective by this sample of high functioning individuals and 2) to explore these results from a clinical perspective.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      High functioning (determined as a score of either 1 or 2 on the objectively-rated Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning) individuals with BD type I or II (N = 33) completed quantitative scales to assess depression, mania, psychosocial functioning and quality of life, and underwent either an individual interview or focus group about the self-management strategies they used to maintain or regain wellness.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The specific self-management strategies that individuals enacted are contained within the following categories: (1) sleep, diet, rest and exercise; (2) ongoing monitoring; (3) reflective and meditative practices; (4) understanding BD and educating others; (5) connecting to others and (6) enacting a plan. These strategies are discussed in the context of current treatment interventions and research findings, offering clinicians a broad range of potential techniques or tools to assist with their efforts to support individuals with BD in maintaining or regaining wellness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The strategies adopted by a sample of people coping well with their BD show remarkable overlap with the targets of existing adjunctive psychosocial interventions for BD.

A large number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle, are modifiable. Psychologists and other behavioral scientists and practitioners are engaged in not only understanding the mechanistic links between behaviors and cardiovascular health but also developing effective interventions for improving health. The purpose of this special issue is to highlight some of the more innovative psychological research in cardiovascular health promotion, disease prevention, and management. Articles included in this issue focus on 2 primary areas. First, cutting-edge research on the current state of knowledge of modifiable health behaviors and their impact on cardiovascular health include articles on e-cigarette use as a putative risk factor, psychological factors involved in adherence to medications, the role of sleep in cardiovascular health, and innovative approaches to enhancing the treatment and recovery of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Second, outstanding research identifying the mechanisms by which psychological factors such as stress, depression, and anxiety impact cardiovascular disease include an overview of the current state of science examining psychological comorbidities that can accompany cardiovascular disease and influence outcomes, discussion of the neurocognitive processes that connect stress appraisal with biological functioning and diseases processes, and the role of genetics on behavioral interventions and clinical decision-making in the context of behavioral weight loss treatments. Our goal with these innovative articles is to stimulate additional advances in cardiovascular behavioral medicine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)."

The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this."

            "title": "Gender-Specific Differences in Patients With Chronic Tinnitus-Baseline Characteristics and Treatment Effects.",
            "abstract": "Whilst some studies have identified gender-specific differences, there is no consensus about gender-specific determinants for prevalence rates or concomitant symptoms of chronic tinnitus such as depression or anxiety. However, gender-associated differences in psychological response profiles and coping strategies may differentially affect tinnitus chronification and treatment success rates. Thus, understanding gender-associated differences may facilitate a more detailed identification of symptom profiles, heighten treatment response rates, and help to create access for vulnerable populations that are potentially less visible in clinical settings. Our research questions are: RQ1: how do male and female tinnitus patients differ regarding tinnitus-related distress, depression severity, and treatment response, RQ2: to what extent are answers to questionnaires administered at baseline associated with gender, and RQ3: which baseline questionnaire items are associated with tinnitus distress, depression, and treatment response, while relating to one gender only? In this work, we present a data analysis workflow to investigate gender-specific differences in N = 1,628 patients with chronic tinnitus (828 female, 800 male) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physiotherapy, auditory attention training, and information counseling components. For this purpose, we extracted 181 variables from 7 self-report questionnaires on socio-demographics, tinnitus-related distress, tinnitus frequency, loudness, localization, and quality as well as physical and mental health status. Our workflow comprises (i) training machine learning models, (ii) a comprehensive evaluation including hyperparameter optimization, and (iii) post-learning steps to identify predictive variables. We found that female patients reported higher levels of tinnitus-related distress, depression and response to treatment (RQ1). Female patients indicated higher levels of tension, stress, and psychological coping strategies rates. By contrast, male patients reported higher levels of bodily pain associated with chronic tinnitus whilst judging their overall health as better (RQ2). Variables measuring depression, sleep problems, tinnitus frequency, and loudness were associated with tinnitus-related distress in both genders and indicators of mental health and subjective stress were found to be associated with depression in both genders (RQ3). Our results suggest that gender-associated differences in symptomatology and treatment response profiles suggest clinical and conceptual needs for differential diagnostics, case conceptualization and treatment pathways."

Hallmark features of NOWS include weight loss, severe irritability, respiratory problems, and sleep fragmentation. Mouse models provide an opportunity to identify brain mechanisms that contribute to NOWS. Neonatal outbred Swiss Webster Cartworth Farms White (CFW) mice were administered morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, an approximation of the third trimester of human gestation. Female and male mice underwent behavioral testing on P7 and P14 to determine the impact of opioid exposure on anxiety and pain sensitivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and daily body weights were also recorded. Brainstems containing pons and medulla were collected during morphine withdrawal on P14 for RNA sequencing. Morphine induced weight loss from P2 to P14, which persisted during adolescence (P21) and adulthood (P50). USVs markedly increased at P7 in females, emerging earlier than males. On P7 and P14, both morphine-exposed female and male mice displayed hyperalgesia on the hot plate and tail-flick assays, with females showing greater hyperalgesia than males. Morphine-exposed mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field arena on P21. Transcriptome analysis of the brainstem, an area implicated in opioid withdrawal and NOWS, identified pathways enriched for noradrenergic signaling in females and males. We also found sex-specific pathways related to mitochondrial function and neurodevelopment in females and circadian entrainment in males. Sex-specific transcriptomic neuroadaptations implicate unique neurobiological mechanisms underlying NOWS-like behaviors."

To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The trial recruitment started in May 2020.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      It is reported that nursing is one of the most vulnerable jobs for developing depression. While they may not be clinically diagnosed as depressed, nurses often suffer from depression and anxiety symptoms, which can lead to a low level of patient care. However, there is no rigorous evidence base for determining an effective prevention strategy for these symptoms in nurses. After reviewing previous literature, we chose a strategy of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for this purpose. We aim to explore the effectiveness of these intervention options for junior nurses working in hospital wards in Japan.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A factorial-design multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted. A total of 120 nurses without a managerial position, who work for general hospitals and gave informed consent, have been randomly allocated to a stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet, and to omega-3 fatty acids or identical placebo pills. The stress management program has been developed according to mindfulness cognitive therapy and consists of four 30-minute individual sessions conducted using a detailed manual. These sessions are conducted by nurses with a managerial position. Participants allocated to the omega-3 fatty acid groups are provided with 1,200 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 600 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid for 90 days. The primary outcome is the change in the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), determined by a blinded rater via the telephone at week 26. Secondary outcomes include the change in HADS score at 13 and 52 weeks; presence of a major depressive episode; severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and presenteeism; utility scores and adverse events at 13, 26 and 52 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      An effective preventive intervention may not only lead to the maintenance of a healthy mental state in nurses, but also to better quality of care for inpatients.

Both interventions have proved to be efficacious in the short-term but there is no study assessing their comparative effectiveness nor their long-term effects. For the first time, this study will also evaluate the cost-utility (6-month time-horizon) and the effects on immune-inflammatory biomarkers and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels of both interventions. The objectives of this 6-month, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) are 1) to examine the effectiveness and cost-utility of adding FIBRO-On or FIBRO-Out to Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) for individuals with fibromyalgia (FM); 2) to identify pre-post differences in blood biomarker levels in the three study arms and 3) to analyze the role of process variables as mediators of 6-month follow-up clinical outcomes. Methods and analysis: Participants will be 225 individuals with FM recruited at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU vs. TAU + FIBRO-On vs. TAU + FIBRO-Out. A comprehensive assessment to collect functional impairment, pain, fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, central sensitization, physical function, sleep quality, perceived cognitive dysfunction, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, psychological inflexibility in pain and pain knowledge will be conducted pre-intervention, at 6 weeks, post-intervention (12 weeks), and at 6-month follow-up. Changes in immune-inflammatory biomarkers [i.e., IL-6, CXCL8, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-10, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor will be evaluated in 40 participants in each treatment arm (total n = 120) at pre- and post-treatment. Quality of life and direct and indirect costs will be evaluated at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects regression models using restricted maximum likelihood, mediational models and a full economic evaluation applying bootstrapping techniques, acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses will be computed.

            "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based \"phytomedicines\" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles."

            "abstract": "A mobile app could be a powerful medium for providing individual support for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as facilitating therapy adherence. Little is known about factors that may explain the acceptance and uptake of such applications. This study, therefore, examines factors from an extended version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model to explain variation between people's behavioral intention to use a CBT for insomnia (CBT-I) app and their use-behavior. The model includes eight aspects of behavioral intention: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, self-efficacy, trust, hedonic motivation, anxiety, and facilitating conditions, and investigates further the influence of the behavioral intention and facilitating conditions on app-usage behavior. Data were gathered from a field trial involving people (n = 89) with relatively mild insomnia using a CBT-I app. The analysis applied the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling method. The results found that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, self-efficacy, trust, and facilitating conditions all explained part of the variation in behavioral intention, but not beyond the explanation provided by hedonic motivation, which accounted for R2 = 0.61. Both behavioral intention and facilitating conditions could explain the use-behavior (R2 = 0.32). We anticipate that the findings will help researchers and developers to focus on: (1) users' positive feelings about the app as this was an indicator of their acceptance of the mobile app and usage; and (2) the availability of resources and support as this also correlated with the technology use."

Six semi-structured focus group interviews (N = 31) were analysed using a qualitative thematic analysis.Results: Interview data were transcribed into 424 sentences and 60 codes were extracted. Thirty-four initial themes emerged, which were transformed into 3 themes and 10 subthemes. The three primary themes were (1) positive experiences, (2) negative experiences, and (3) suggested modifications. The positive subthemes were (1a) therapists, (1b) togetherness, (1c) use of strategies reduced symptoms, and (1d) acceptance. The negative subthemes were (2a) persistent symptoms, (2b) program too condensed, and (2c) attendance obstacles. The suggested modifications were (3a) lengthen program, (3b) multi-dimensional learning, and (3c) multi-modal delivery options.Conclusion: The experiences and suggestions identified in this study strengthen the foundation to advance therapeutic program development for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression. Future CBT-I programs for older adults may be improved by increasing the length of therapy (e.g. 8 sessions to 12 sessions), adding multi-dimensional learning opportunities (e.g. visual/audio/mentorship), and offering various modes of treatment delivery (e.g. group, individual, internet, telephone)."

The symptoms of PD are characterized not only by motor alterations but also by a spectrum of nonmotor symptoms. Some of these are psychiatric manifestations such as sleep disorders; depression; cognitive difficulties that can evolve into dementia; and symptoms of psychosis, which include hallucinations, illusions, and delusions. Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) occurs in 18-50% of patients with PD.

We assessed what characterizes those users who connected a wearable device to the program to estimate sleep diary variables, and whether connecting a wearable device affected insomnia symptom improvement, related well-being, and program interaction. In total, 3551 users (63% female, mean age 44.50 ± 14.78 years) of a dCBT program who completed a post-therapy survey, including 378 users (10.6%) who used a device, were selected. Within-subject, pre-therapy to post-therapy, the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI, 7 Items) was used to assess insomnia. Two-item measures (depression, anxiety) and single item measures (perceived stress, life satisfaction, work productivity) of well-being were analyzed, in addition to program interaction. For all participants, insomnia symptoms significantly improved following dCBT (t(3504) = 83.33, p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.45), as did depression and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, life satisfaction and work productivity. Those who did not connect a device reported better sleep and less affected work productivity (all p < .001) than those who did connect a device at baseline and post-treatment; nevertheless treatment effects were largely similar for the two groups. Those who connected a device interacted more with additional program components. In conclusion, improvements in insomnia after completing dCBT are similar in persons choosing to wear a wearable device to estimate sleep and persons completing a subjective sleep diary. Potentially, use of wearable devices can facilitate treatment for those who struggle to complete daily diaries."

Recently we demonstrated that motivational support moderately improved the effects of Internet-delivered treatment for insomnia. In the present study, we tested whether depressive symptoms at baseline moderate the effect of support on Internet-delivered treatment for insomnia. We performed a multilevel intention-to-treat analysis on 262 participants in a randomized controlled trial. We found that baseline depressive symptoms moderated the effect of support on sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep onset latency (but not on wake after sleep onset, number of nightly awakenings, or the Insomnia Severity Index). This means that for these variables, people with high levels of depressive symptoms benefit from support, whereas people with low levels of depressive symptoms improve regardless of support. The data show that baseline depression severity plays an important role in the way Internet treatments need to be delivered. These findings open up opportunities to personalize the support offered in Internet-delivered treatments."

            "abstract": "A brief parent-assisted treatment for children's nighttime fears is described. Five children, ages 4-5 years, and their parents participated in the study, which was designed as a multiple baseline across-subjects experiment. The children were taught relaxation skills, pleasant imagery, and self-instructions to reduce anxiety; the parents were trained to positively reinforce compliance and reductions in their children's fearful behavior. Nightly ratings of the children's bedtime behavior (e.g., crying spells, getting out of bed, the time it took to fall asleep) were completed by the parents. Relative to baseline scores, the mean reduction in fearful behaviors at the end of the 3-week treatment phase was 40%. Six weeks later, it increased to 48%. Telephone interviews with the parents at a 6-month follow-up suggested continued improvement. Pre- and post-ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist showed significant improvement in the children's behavior at the end of treatment, as well as at a 6-week follow-up. This suggests that the beneficial effects of the intervention went beyond the presenting problem. The results of this study extend the generalizability of previous research to a younger population of nighttime fear sufferers."

He has not had a family physician since leaving the military 2 years ago. His Military Occupation Classification had been infantry. He explains that he had been deployed to war zones and that during a firefight several years earlier an enemy weapon exploded nearby, killing a fellow soldier and wounding others. He does not recall being injured, but remembers feeling a thump and that his \"computer had to reboot.\" This was followed by headaches and a few days of ringing in his ears. He also suffered a concussion during a military hockey game. He was assessed and treated for persistent headaches in the service and recalls that results of a head computed tomography scan were negative. Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) granted him a disability award for posttraumatic headache and provided certain treatment benefits. He took medication for the headaches. Following transition to civilian life he had difficulty holding jobs, but had been reluctant to seek help. He saw stories on television about blast-induced minor traumatic brain injury in Iraq and Afghanistan, and wonders if he \"has MTBI.\" Findings from his physical examination, bloodwork, and Mini Mental State Examination are normal, but his Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 24, suggesting possible cognitive impairment. The physician organizes follow-up appointments and a neurology consultation. After reading about Canada's military-aware operational stress injury (OSI) clinics in a medical journal, he refers the Veteran to a VAC district office for access to mental health assessment."

The burden associated with these highly comorbid conditions requires an innovative approach to treatment. There have been significant advancements in the field of cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) over recent years. CBT-I has evolved from targeting homogenous insomnia samples to now showing promising results for comorbid insomnia. CBT-I is not only effective at treating comorbid insomnia, but can also have a positive impact on depression severity. Despite these important clinical developments, limited research has explored whether modifying CBT-I programmes to specifically target comorbid depression could improve outcomes for older populations.

We investigated the effects of pulsatile administration of GHRH (4x50 microgram, at hourly intervals between 2200 and 0100 h) on the sleep EEG (2300-0700 h) in patients with depression (16 females, 19 males, age range 19-76 years) and matched controls (20 females, 20 males). In patients compared with controls, NREM sleep and in particular stage 2 sleep was greatly decreased at baseline. GHRH treatment enhanced NREM sleep, and in particular stage 2 sleep in men, regardless of diagnosis, while decreasing it in women (F=6.0 and 7.1, p<0.05). In controls, aging was associated with a decrease in NREM sleep, including both SWS and stage 2 sleep (r= -0.45 r= -0.39, p<0.05), while in patients only SWS declined with age (r= -0.49, p<0.05). The significant decrease in NREM sleep including stage 2 sleep in patients with depression and elderly control subjects is compatible with the suggested role of sleep continuity and stage 2 sleep in cognitive functioning. GHRH promoted NREM sleep, stage 2 sleep and sleep continuity and might prove beneficial for improvement of cognitive function, at least in men. These data support the hypothesis that female gender, aging and depression are associated with a shift in the GHRH/CRH ratio towards CRH."

            "abstract": "This paper reports on a nurse's experience helping alleviate psychosomatic symptoms in a psychiatric outpatient suffering from depression. It was found that the OPD patient had been suffering from depression as well as long-time tension and pain. Between April 10th and July 24th, 2008, the author employed holistic nursing assessment and collected data through both observation and interview. Three major care problems were identified, including ineffective individual coping, chronic pain, and sleep disturbance. Focusing nursing care on relaxation techniques and biofeedback, the author discussed the problems with the patient and then implemented relaxation training and biofeedback training sessions as well as nursing care plans, which averaged 45~60 minutes per time for 8 times. Sessions included interviews, relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscular relaxation, meditative relaxation, meditation, music and abdominal breathing) and visual feedback measured by a biofeedback device with a thermistor sensor. During sessions, the patient was clearly motivated to change and participated actively. Furthermore, the patient not only became gradually aware of both the inner feeling of relaxation and etiology of psychosomatic symptoms, but also learned relaxation strategies for coping with life stressors. After therapy, the patient's self-control over relaxation had improved considerably and care problems were resolved satisfactorily. Also, the patient could increasingly incorporate relaxation into daily life routines."

            "abstract": "Cognitive behavioural therapy self-help is an effective intervention for a range of common mental health difficulties. However the extent to which effectiveness may vary by type of support--guided, minimal contact, self-administered--has not been extensively considered. This review identifies the impact of support on the effectiveness of written cognitive behavioural self-help and further explores the extent to which effectiveness varies across mental health condition by type of support provided. Randomised controlled trials were identified by searching relevant bibliographic databases, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and expert contact. 38 studies were included in the meta-analysis yielding a statistically significant overall mean effect size (Hedges' g=-0.49). Overall effect size did not significantly differ by type of support (Q=0.85, df=2, p=0.65) (guided: Hedges' g=-0.53; minimal contact: Hedges' g=-0.55; self-administered: Hedges' g=-0.42). For guided and self-administered types of support, planned comparisons revealed a trend for effect size to vary by mental health condition and for guided CBT self-help the modality of support was significant (Q=6.32, df=2, p=0.04), with the largest effect size associated with telephone delivery (Hedges' g=-0.91). Additional moderator analysis was undertaken for depression given the number of available studies. Regardless of higher baseline levels of severity the effect size for minimal contact was greater than for guided support. Greater consideration should be given to the potential that type of support may be related to the effectiveness of written cognitive behavioural self-help and that this may vary across mental health condition. Findings from this systematic review make several recommendations to inform future research."

On the other hand, sleep is a physiological process of vital importance for health. Its main value lies in restoring the natural balance between neuronal centers. Among its associated behavioral characteristics are spontaneous movements and eye movements. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects that occur during application of reflexology and that are not described in the literature. This is a descriptive observational study with a quantitative methodology. Abivariate anlysis has been conductec through chi-square test or Anova as apropiate. A total of 111 clients of a therapy center in Tarragona have participated in the study. They were assigned into four groups (musculoskeletal, stress, anxiety, mantenance). Reflexology was administered and observered the manifestations that occured during the session. The findings have identified four categories of effects, of which there was no previous reference. These effects can be related to any of the stages of sleep. This study shows that reflexology promotes its application for different effects, such as eye movements and spontaneous movements. These data reveal the need to investigate these effects and their impact on health as well as their possible relationship with sleep."

Participants were randomised into either a) Intervention group (receiving a theoretically underpinned multi-component program including free exercise equipment at home, access to smartphone web-app, and an online forum); or b) Control group (usual routine). Primary outcomes were program feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior, sleep, diet, determinants of physical activity, and mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms), measured at baseline and follow-up (12-weeks), with self-reported physical activity, sedentary behaviour and depressive symptoms also measured at weeks 4 and 8.

            "abstract": "The concept of 'idiopathic' Parkinson's disease (PD) as a single entity has been challenged with the identification of several clinical subtypes, pathogenic genes and putative causative environmental agents. In addition to classic motor symptoms, non-motor manifestations (such as rapid eye movement sleep disorder, anosmia, constipation and depression) appear at prodromic/premotor stage and evolve, along with cognitive impairment and dysautonomia, as the disease progresses, often dominating the advanced stages of the disease. The key molecular pathogenic mechanisms include α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impairment of protein clearance (associated with deficient ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal systems), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The involvement of dopaminergic as well as noradrenergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic and adenosine pathways provide insights into the rich and variable clinical phenomenology associated with PD and the possibility of alternative therapeutic approaches beyond traditional dopamine replacement therapies.One of the biggest challenges in the development of potential neuroprotective therapies has been the lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of progression. Immunotherapies such as the use of vaccination or monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated, toxic α-synuclein.as well as anti-aggregation or protein clearance strategies are currently investigated in clinical trials. The application of glucagon-like peptide one receptor agonists, specific PD gene target agents (such as GBA or LRRK2 modifiers) and other potential disease modifying drugs provide cautious optimism that more effective therapies are on the horizon. Emerging therapies, such as new symptomatic drugs, innovative drug delivery systems and novel surgical interventions give hope to patients with PD about their future outcomes and prognosis."

            "abstract": "Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment are frequent complaints of depressed patients under standard antidepressant medication. Therefore, additional therapies are required which specifically focus on the improvement of these deficits without exerting major side effects. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) has been shown to improve cognitive abilities in elderly subjects and in patients with disorders of the dementia spectrum. Animal studies surmise that EGb may reduce CRH activity, which is substantially related to depressive mood and behavior, predominantly cognition and sleep. An open non-randomized pilot study has been conducted to investigate the effects of ginkgo biloba extract (EGb Li 1370) on cognitive performance and sleep regulation in depressed inpatients. 16 patients were treated with a trimipramine (T)-monotherapy (200 mg) for six weeks. In eight of the 16 patients, an adjunct EGb therapy (240 mg/d) was applied for four weeks after a baseline week, the other eight patients remained on trimipramine monotherapy (200 mg) during the entire study. Polysomnography, cognitive psychomotor performance and psychopathology were assessed at baseline, after short-term and long-term adjunct EGb treatment, and after one week of ginkgo discontinuation (at the respective evaluation times in the eight patients on T-monotherapy). This report focuses on the results of EGb on sleep EEG pattern. EGb significantly improved sleep pattern by an increase of sleep efficiency and a reduction of awakenings. In addition, sleep stage 1 and REM-density were reduced, while stage 2 was increased. Non-REM sleep, predominantly slow wave sleep in the first sleep cycle, was significantly enhanced compared to trimipramine monotherapy. Discontinuation of EGb reversed most of these effects. Based on the animal data, these results suggest that EGb may improve sleep continuity and enhance Non-REM sleep due to a weakening of tonic CRH-activity. The compensation of the deficient Non-REM component in depression by the EGb application may provide a new additional treatment strategy, especially in the treatment of the depressive syndrome with sleep disturbance."

Methods: We conducted a subanalysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT, NCT02827799) whose primary aim was to test the effects of CBT-I on insomnia. We randomized 51 patients with stable Class II-IV HF to CBT-I (n = 30) or attention control (n = 21).

We measured day and nighttime urinary free cortisol, melatonin sulfate, epinephrine, and norepinephrine at baseline, and two weeks after CBT-I and computed general linear models and partial correlations. Results: CBT-I had no effects on the biomarkers, but there were statistically significant negative cross-sectional correlations between the ratio of day and night urinary free cortisol and sleep disturbance, anxiety, fatigue, depression, and negative sleep cognitions. Increases in the ratio between day and night cortisol were associated with statistically significant improvements in fatigue, depression, sleep duration, and sleep-related cognitions.

Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and.

Clinically reliable improvement was reported by 48% of those undergoing the main parts of the treatment, whereas 5% of the participants reported a clinically significant deterioration. However, a large proportion of patients showed no clinically reliable change. In summary, the study identified large treatment effects, but also highlighted room for improvement in the usability of the treatment."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) refer to a group of synthetic stimulants including amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and related substances. ATS are highly addictive and prolonged use may result in a series of mental and physical symptoms including anxiety, confusion, insomnia, mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, paranoia, hallucinations and delusion.Currently there is no widely accepted treatment for ATS-use disorder. However, cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) is the first-choice treatment. The effectiveness of CBT for other substance-use disorders (e.g. alcohol-, opioid- and cocaine-use disorders) has been well documented and as such this basic treatment approach has been applied to the ATS-use disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatment for people with ATS-use disorder for reducing ATS use compared to other types of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, 12-step facilitation, no intervention or treatment as usual.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We identified randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs comparing CBT for ATS-use disorders with other types of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, 12 step facilitation or no intervention. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase and five other databases up to July 2018. In addition, we examined reference lists of eligible studies and other systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Eligibility criteria consisted of RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing CBT versus other types of interventions with adult ATS users (aged 18 years or older) diagnosed by any explicit diagnostic system. Primary outcomes included abstinence rate and other indicators of drug-using behaviours.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Only two studies met the eligibility criteria. Both studies were at low risk of selection bias and reporting bias. In one study, almost half of participants in the intervention group dropped out and this study was at high risk of attrition bias. The studies compared a single session of brief CBT or a web-based CBT to a waiting-list control (total sample size across studies of 129). Results were mixed across the studies. For the single-session brief CBT study, two out of five measures of drug use produced significant results, percentage of abstinent days in 90 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.11) and dependence symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.59, 95% CI-1.16 to-0.02). Little confidence could be placed in the results from this study give the small sample size (25 participants per group) and corresponding large CIs around the observed effects. For the web-based CBT, there was no significant difference across different outcomes. Neither study reported adverse effects. The meta-analytic mean across these two trials for drug use was not significant (SMD -0.28, 95% CI-0.69 to 0.14). In summary, overall quality of evidence was low and there was insufficient evidence to conclude that CBT is effective, or ineffective, at treating ATS use.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently, there is not enough evidence to establish the efficacy of CBT for ATS-use disorders because of a paucity of high-quality research in this area."

The purpose of the study is to compare hypnotic medication versus placebo as an add-on treatment to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as a means of reducing suicidal ideation in depressed adult outpatients with insomnia and suicidal ideation. The safety features of the study follow the 2001 National Institutes of Health guidelines for studies that include patients at risk of suicide.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 584 potential participants have undergone telephone screening; 67% of these failed the phone screen, most often due to an absence of expressed suicidal ideation (26% of the telephone screen fails). A total of 115 people appeared for a face-to-face baseline assessment, and 40 of these had completed a taper off of their ineffective psychotropic medications before the baseline assessments. In all, 64% of those who completed baseline assessments failed to proceed to randomization, most commonly because of no clinically significant suicidal ideation (51% of those excluded at baseline). One participant was offered and accepted voluntary psychiatric hospitalization in lieu of study participation. Thus far, 40 participants have been randomized into the study and 88.7% of scheduled visits have been attended, with 93.8% adherence to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 91.6% adherence to the randomized hypnotic versus placebo.

            "abstract": "Benzodiazepines have a broad spectrum of clinical applications including sedation, anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsive therapy. At the cellular level, benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors; they increase the efficacy of inhibition in neuronal networks by prolonging the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This mechanism of action predicts that benzodiazepines reduce the frequency of inhibition-driven network oscillations, consistent with observations from human and animal EEG. However, most of existing data are restricted to frequency bands below ∼30 Hz. Recent data suggest that faster cortical network rhythms are critically involved in several behavioral and cognitive tasks. We therefore analyzed diazepam effects on a large range of cortical network oscillations in freely moving mice, including theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz) oscillations. We also investigated diazepam effects over the coupling between theta phase and the amplitude fast oscillations. We report that diazepam causes a global slowing of oscillatory activity in all frequency domains. Oscillation power was changed differently for each frequency domain, with characteristic differences between active wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Cross-frequency coupling strength, in contrast, was mostly unaffected by diazepam. Such state- and frequency-dependent actions of benzodiazepines on cortical network oscillations may be relevant for their specific cognitive effects. They also underline the strong interaction between local network oscillations and global brain states."

Male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years with residual ES associated with OSA/HS were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive armodafinil 150 or 250 mg or placebo PO QD for 12 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline and study weeks 4, 8, and 12 and included the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) to determine wakefulness, the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) to determine improvement in clinical condition, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to determine patient-estimated wakefulness, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) to determine global fatigue, and the Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment battery. To distinguish between earlier and later effects, sleep latencies, assessed using the MWT, were averaged across the first 4 (9 and 11 AM, and 1 and 3 PM) and last 3 (3, 5, and 7 PM) tests.

At the final visit, the mean (SD) change from baseline in MWT sleep latency across the morning and afternoon was significantly greater in the armodafinil combined group compared with the placebo group (+1.9 [7.3] vs 1.7 [8.6] minutes; P < 0.001). Also at the final visit, the proportions of patients who showed at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C, and the mean (SD) changes from baseline in ESS and BFI scores, were significantly greater in the armodafinil group compared with those in the placebo group (72% vs 37%, -5.5 [5.0] vs -3.3 [4.7], and -1.2 [2.2] vs -0.6 [2.0], respectively; P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively). No significant effects on nighttime sleep, as assessed using polysomnography, were found with armodafinil. AEs reported in the armodafinil combined and placebo groups were headache, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, and dizziness. Serious AEs (ulcerative colitis, migraine, worsening of Axis II and mood disorder, and duodenal ulcer) were reported in 4 (1.5%) patients receiving armodafinil and were considered by the investigator not or unlikely to be drug related.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition.

When the grief process lasts longer than 6 months, the person is in risk of developing Complicated Grief Disorder (CGD). The CGD is related to serious health consequences. To reduce the probability of developing CGD a preventive intervention could be applied. In developing countries like Mexico, the psychological services are scarce, self-applied interventions could provide support to solve this problem and reduce the health impact even after the pandemic has already finished. Aims: To design and implement a self-applied intervention composed of 12 modules focused on the decrease of the risk of developing CGD, and increasing the life quality, and as a secondary objective to reduce the symptomatology of anxiety, depression, and increase of sleep quality. The Intervention Duelo COVID (Grief COVID) follows the principles of User Experience (UX) and is designed according to the needs and desires of a sample of the objective participants, to increase the adherence to the self-applied intervention, considered one of the main weaknesses of online interventions. Methods: A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted from the 22nd of December of 2020 to the first of June 2021. The participants will be assigned to an intervention with elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness and Positive Psychology. The control group will be a wait-list condition, that will receive the intervention 1.5-2 months after the pre-measurement were taken.

            "abstract": "The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug- and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement."

            "abstract": "## IMPORTANCE\nDigital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) is a scalable and effective intervention for treating insomnia. Most people with insomnia, however, seek help because of the daytime consequences of poor sleep, which adversely affects quality of life.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the effect of dCBT for insomnia on functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life and to determine whether a reduction in insomnia symptoms was a mediating factor.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis online, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized trial comparing dCBT for insomnia with sleep hygiene education (SHE) evaluated 1711 participants with self-reported symptoms of insomnia. Participants were recruited between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2016, and dCBT was delivered using web and/or mobile channels plus treatment as usual; SHE comprised a website and a downloadable booklet plus treatment as usual. Online assessments took place at 0 (baseline), 4 (midtreatment), 8 (posttreatment), and 24 (follow-up) weeks. Programs were completed within 12 weeks after inclusion.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nPrimary outcomes were scores on self-reported measures of functional health (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System: Global Health Scale; range, 10-50; higher scores indicate better health); psychological well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; range, 14-70; higher scores indicate greater well-being); and sleep-related quality of life (Glasgow Sleep Impact Index; range, 1-100; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Secondary outcomes comprised mood, fatigue, sleepiness, cognitive failures, work productivity, and relationship satisfaction. Insomnia was assessed with the Sleep Condition Indicator (range: 0-32; higher scores indicate better sleep).\n## RESULTS\nOf the 1711 participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 1329 (77.7%) were female, mean (SD) age was 48.0 (13.8) years, and 1558 (91.1%) were white. Use of dCBT was associated with a small improvement in functional health compared with SHE (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 0.90 [0.40-1.40]; week 8, 1.76 [1.24-2.28]; week 24, 1.76 [1.22-2.30]) and psychological well-being (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 1.04 [0.28-1.80]; week 8, 2.68 [1.89-3.47]; week 24, 2.95 [2.13-3.76]), and with a large improvement in sleep-related quality of life (at week 4, -8.76 [-11.83 to -5.69]; week 8, -17.60 [-20.81 to -14.39]; week 24, -18.72 [-22.04 to -15.41]) (all P < .01). A large improvement in insomnia mediated these outcomes (range mediated, 45.5%-84.0%).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nUse of dCBT is effective in improving functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life in people reporting insomnia symptoms. A reduction in insomnia symptoms mediates these improvements. These results confirm that dCBT improves both daytime and nighttime aspects of insomnia, strengthening existing recommendations of CBT as the treatment of choice for insomnia.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nisrctn.org identifier: ISRCTN60530898.\n"

            "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a recurrent and moderate disorder that occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and quickly resolves after menstruation, is characterized by somatic and emotional discomfort that can be severe enough to impair daily activities. Current therapeutic drugs for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not very satisfying. As a critical pineal hormone, melatonin has increasingly been suggested to modulate PMS symptoms. In this review, we update the latest progress on PMS-induced sleep disturbance, mood changes, and cognitive impairment and provide possible pathways by which melatonin attenuates these symptoms. Moreover, we focus on the role of melatonin in PMS molecular mechanisms. Herein, we show that melatonin can regulate ovarian estrogen and progesterone, of which cyclic fluctuations contribute to PMS pathogenesis. Melatonin also modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor system in PMS. Interpreting the role of melatonin in PMS is not only informative to clarify PMS etiology but also instructive to melatonin and its receptor agonist application to promote female health. As a safe interaction, melatonin treatment can be effective in alleviating symptoms of PMS. However, symptoms such as sleep disturbance, depressive mood, cognitive impairment are not specific and can be easily misdiagnosed. Connections between melatonin receptor, ovarian steroid dysfunction, and PMS are not consistent among past studies. Before final conclusions are drawn, more well-organized and rigorous studies are recommended."

This is a challenge for the society as regular psychological services cannot be offered to the same extent as before the pandemic. In addition to the requirement of social distancing, there is a need to adjust psychological treatment components like exposure to avoid increasing the spread of the infection. Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has an established evidence base for a range of psychiatric problems and has been suggested as one possible approach to deal with the situation. This study aimed to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial during the summer of 2020 with a broad focus on psychological distress and a treatment approach that tailors the intervention based on symptom profile and preferences. Methods: Following the advertisement and interview, we included 52 participants with elevated levels of psychological distress. They were randomly allocated to either a 7-week-long individually tailored ICBT (n = 26) or a wait-list control condition (n = 26). Measures of depression and quality of life were used as primary outcomes. We also included secondary outcome measures of anxiety, insomnia, trauma, stress, anger, and alcohol use. For screening, we used the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS). Results: Overall moderate to large between-group effects were found at post-treatment in favor of the treatment on measures of both depression [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Cohens d = 0.63; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): d = 0.62] and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item scale (GAD-7); d = 0.82]. This was also observed for stress symptoms [Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14); d = 1.04]. No effects were seen on measures of quality of life, insomnia, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and anger. There was an effect on alcohol use [Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT); d = 0.54], which was not of clinical relevance. Conclusion: Individually tailored ICBT shows initial promise as a way to reduce psychological problems in association with the COVID-19 pandemic. A possible limitation was that the trial was conducted when the effects of the pandemic were decreasing and when fewer people were affected by the restrictions (e.g., the summer of 2020)."

Mirtazapine increases noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission, as measured by on-line microdialysis and by enhancement of noradrenergic locus ceruleus and serotonergic raphe nucleus cell firing. Mirtazapine has a low affinity for 5-HT1A receptors but shows 5-HT1A-agonistic-like effects in a conditioned taste aversion test and by causing lower lip retraction in rats. Mirtazapine therefore causes enhancement of 5-HT1-mediated transmission. Other studies show that both 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors are specifically blocked. The enhancement of both noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission probably underlies the therapeutic activity of mirtazapine.

It is a technique that measures a subject's EEG signal, processes it in real time, with the goal to enable a behavioral modification by modulating brain activity. The most common application of the NF technology is in epilepsies, migraine, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, affective disorders, and psychotic disorders. Few studies have investigated the use of NF in context of psychosomatic illnesses. Little is known about the use in cancer patients or postcancer survivors despite the high number of this patient group.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We here provide a systematic review of the use and effect of NF on symptoms and burden in cancer patients and long-term cancer survivors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In conducting this systematic review, we followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our search resulted in only 3 experimental studies, 1 observational study, and 2 case reports. Given the heterogeneity of the intervention systems and protocols, no meta-analysis was conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Altogether, there is initial evidence that NF is a complementary, drug-free, and noninvasive therapy that has the potential to ameliorate symptoms in this patient group, such as pain, fatigue, depression, and sleep. Further studies are highly needed."

Wake therapy (sleep deprivation) has an established antidepressant effect with onset of action within hours. Deterioration on the following night's sleep is, however, common, and we used daily light therapy and sleep time stabilisation as a preventive measure. In particular, we evaluated the day-to-day acute effect of and tolerance to sleep deprivation and examined predictors of response.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients were assessed at psychiatric inpatient wards.

Both reduce quality of life of PD patients and cause caregiver burden. This review aims to provide a survey of possible therapeutic options for treatment of motor and non motor symptoms of PD and to discuss their relation to each other. MAO-B-Inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, dopamine agonists and levodopa with its various application modes mainly improve the dopamine associated motor symptoms in PD. This armentarium of PD drugs only partially influences the onset and occurrence of non motor symptoms. These PD features predominantly result from non dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Autonomic features, such as seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, orthostatic syndrome, salivation, bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, sleep disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction with impaired execution and impulse control may appear. Drug therapy of these non motor symptoms complicates long-term PD drug therapy due to possible occurrence of drug interactions, - side effects, and altered pharmacokinetic behaviour of applied compounds. Dopamine substituting compounds themselves may contribute to onset of these non motor symptoms. This complicates the differentiation from the disease process itself and influences therapeutic options, which are often limited because of additional morbidity with necessary concomitant drug therapy."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Pathological nighttime fears in children have been little studied. However, this disorder is commonly encountered in medical consultations and is discomforting and dysfunctional for both the child and the family. Most nighttime fears are part and parcel of normal development, and emanate from increasingly sophisticated cognitive development in the growing child. Thus, most children report a variety of coping strategies generally helpful in reducing their anxiety, which resolves spontaneously in the growing child. Nevertheless, in about 10% of children, nighttime fears are related to one or more anxiety disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Then, it is estimated that severe nighttime fears and sleep problems occur in 20-30% of children. This problem is not transient and has to be treated. This study aims to review clinical features of nighttime fears and possible treatments for these patients and their families.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Two databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched combining the search terms: nighttime fears AND children. English and French languages were imposed. There were no publication date or publication status limitations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pathological nighttime fears are responsible for emotional (crying, panic, tantrums at bedtime, loss of confidence, self-disparaging negative statements, and feeling of social embarrassment) and behavioral (wandering alone in the house at night, calls for parental or sibling comfort, bed sharing with parents or siblings, light source at night, refusal to go to the toilet alone at night) disturbances. This leads to a poor quality of sleep interfering with school learning, and also affects social development and family functioning. A full assessment has to be made to eliminate organic causes, have a baseline functioning, and search for comorbid anxiety diseases. The treatments which have proved effective are some cognitive-behavioral techniques: systematic desensitization (with relaxation or emotive imagery), reinforcement (gain of points and techniques of self statement), and cognitive techniques (reinforcing self-statements, reducing the aversive aspects of being in the dark, involving reality-testing statements, and active control are preferred in children older than 6 years, whereas the \"anti-monster letter\" and the techniques using a doll are preferred in children under 6 years old). The modelling technique seems to be appropriate at any age.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We have explained the clinical features of pathological nighttime fears and the way to assess this disease, and we have pointed out the treatments whose effectiveness has been evaluated in this indication."

One of the newest members of this family is the 5-HT(7) receptor. Increasing investigations on this receptor are currently undertaken to highlight its physiological and physiopathological significance. With the development of selective 5-HT(7) receptor ligands, preclinical studies have started to elucidate the functions of this receptor subtype in more details. Hence, growing body of evidence suggests that the 5-HT(7) receptor is involved in biological processes such as circadian rhythm and thermoregulation, in addition to disorders in which disturbances of the latter are considered to be an important contributing factor. Moreover, preclinical data support the use of 5-HT(7) receptor antagonism as a promising mechanism for the treatment of several dysfunctions such as cognitive deficits and, importantly, have also unveiled anxiolytic and antidepressant-like properties. In this review, we will report major advances in the discovery of 5-HT(7) receptor roles, with special emphasis on the potential application of their antagonists as novel anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs."

            "abstract": "Background: Depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance are common problems that greatly affect quality of life for many myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. App-based mindfulness meditation is a feasible nonpharmacologic approach for managing symptoms. However, previous research has not considered how patients' overall mental health may influence their responsiveness to these interventions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory, secondary analysis of the effects of a smartphone meditation app, Calm, on depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance in MPN patients based on patients' baseline levels of Global Mental Health (GMH). Methods: Participants (N = 80) were a subset of MPN patients from a larger feasibility study. Patients were enrolled into an intervention (use Calm for 10 minutes daily for 4 weeks) or educational control group. Results: In multilevel models, there were significant 3-way interactions between time, group, and baseline GMH for depression and anxiety symptoms, with participants in the meditation intervention who reported the poorest baseline GMH experiencing the greatest reduction in symptoms over time. For both intervention and control participants, poorer initial GMH was associated with increases in sleep disturbance symptoms over time. Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation apps, such as Calm, may be effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in MPN patients, particularly for those experiencing mental health difficulties. Given the need for accessible tools to self-manage chronic cancer-related symptoms, especially strong negative emotions, these findings warrant larger efficacy studies to determine the effects of app-based meditation for alleviating depression and anxiety in cancer populations."

Since evidence shows a strong clinical and genetic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder, we investigated whether a polygenic susceptibility to major depression is associated with response to lithium treatment in patients with BD. Weighted polygenic scores (PGSs) were computed for major depression (MD) at different GWAS p value thresholds using genetic data obtained from 2586 bipolar patients who received lithium treatment and took part in the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen) study. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies in MD (135,458 cases and 344,901 controls) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) were used for PGS weighting. Response to lithium treatment was defined by continuous scores and categorical outcome (responders versus non-responders) using measurements on the Alda scale. Associations between PGSs of MD and lithium treatment response were assessed using a linear and binary logistic regression modeling for the continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. The analysis was performed for the entire cohort, and for European and Asian sub-samples. The PGSs for MD were significantly associated with lithium treatment response in multi-ethnic, European or Asian populations, at various p value thresholds. Bipolar patients with a low polygenic load for MD were more likely to respond well to lithium, compared to those patients with high polygenic load [lowest vs highest PGS quartiles, multi-ethnic sample: OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.18-2.01) and European sample: OR = 1.75 (95% CI: 1.30-2.36)]. While our analysis in the Asian sample found equivalent effect size in the same direction: OR = 1.71 (95% CI: 0.61-4.90), this was not statistically significant. Using PGS decile comparison, we found a similar trend of association between a high genetic loading for MD and lower response to lithium.

CBT for insomnia is being applied to good effect with adults with mental health difficulties but there are few studies examining its applicability to adolescents within mental health services.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We carried out a case series analysis (n = 15) looking at the feasibility, accessibility and impact of a low-intensity sleep intervention for young people (14-25 years) being seen by a secondary care Youth Mental Health team in the UK. The intervention was based on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) approaches and involved six individual sessions delivered on a weekly basis by a graduate psychologist. Routine outcome measures were used to monitor insomnia, psychological distress and functioning with assessments at baseline, session 3, session 6 and at 4 weeks after end of intervention. All participants scored in the clinical range for insomnia at the start of the study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      High uptake, attendance and measure completion rates were observed. Large effect sizes were observed for insomnia, psychological distress and functioning. Twelve of the fifteen participants (80%) no longer scored above threshold for insomnia at follow-up. All seven under-18s no longer met threshold for clinical 'caseness' on the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) at follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The findings suggest that the intervention was well accepted by young people and feasible to apply within a secondary care setting. Strong effect sizes are encouraging but are probably inflated by the small sample size, uncontrolled design and unblinded assessments."

            "title": "EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses.",
            "abstract": "Chronic diseases and illnesses associated with non-specific symptoms are on the rise. In addition to chronic stress in social and work environments, physical and chemical exposures at home, at work, and during leisure activities are causal or contributing environmental stressors that deserve attention by the general practitioner as well as by all other members of the health care community. It seems necessary now to take \"new exposures\" like electromagnetic fields (EMF) into account. Physicians are increasingly confronted with health problems from unidentified causes. Studies, empirical observations, and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. Individual susceptibility and environmental factors are frequently neglected. New wireless technologies and applications have been introduced without any certainty about their health effects, raising new challenges for medicine and society. For instance, the issue of so-called non-thermal effects and potential long-term effects of low-dose exposure were scarcely investigated prior to the introduction of these technologies. Common electromagnetic field or EMF sources: Radio-frequency radiation (RF) (3 MHz to 300 GHz) is emitted from radio and TV broadcast antennas, Wi-Fi access points, routers, and clients (e.g. smartphones, tablets), cordless and mobile phones including their base stations, and Bluetooth devices. Extremely low frequency electric (ELF EF) and magnetic fields (ELF MF) (3 Hz to 3 kHz) are emitted from electrical wiring, lamps, and appliances. Very low frequency electric (VLF EF) and magnetic fields (VLF MF) (3 kHz to 3 MHz) are emitted, due to harmonic voltage and current distortions, from electrical wiring, lamps (e.g. compact fluorescent lamps), and electronic devices. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and male infertility. On the other hand, the emerging electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities, disability administrators and case workers, politicians, as well as courts of law. We recommend treating EHS clinically as part of the group of chronic multisystem illnesses (CMI), but still recognizing that the underlying cause remains the environment. In the beginning, EHS symptoms occur only occasionally, but over time they may increase in frequency and severity. Common EHS symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, a lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms. A comprehensive medical history, which should include all symptoms and their occurrences in spatial and temporal terms and in the context of EMF exposures, is the key to making the diagnosis. The EMF exposure is usually assessed by EMF measurements at home and at work. Certain types of EMF exposure can be assessed by asking about common EMF sources. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure, that is, reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). If a detrimental EMF exposure is reduced sufficiently, the body has a chance to recover and EHS symptoms will be reduced or even disappear. Many examples have shown that such measures can prove effective. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the broad range of other environmental factors that contribute to the total body burden should also be addressed. Anything that supports homeostasis will increase a person's resilience against disease and thus against the adverse effects of EMF exposure. There is increasing evidence that EMF exposure has a major impact on the oxidative and nitrosative regulation capacity in affected individuals. This concept also may explain why the level of susceptibility to EMF can change and why the range of symptoms reported in the context of EMF exposures is so large. Based on our current understanding, a treatment approach that minimizes the adverse effects of peroxynitrite - as has been increasingly used in the treatment of multisystem illnesses - works best. This EMF Guideline gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding EMF-related health risks and provides recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and accessibility measures of EHS to improve and restore individual health outcomes as well as for the development of strategies for prevention."

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with psychotic experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We searched 13 databases for studies of psychological interventions for adults with psychotic experiences, but not psychotic disorders. Our outcomes were the proportion of participants remitting from psychotic experiences (primary); changes in positive and negative psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, functioning, distress, and quality of life; and economic outcomes (secondary).

In general, there was no strong evidence for the superiority of any one intervention. Five studies reported on our primary outcome, though only two reports provided randomised controlled trial evidence that psychological intervention (specifically, cognitive behavioural therapy) promoted remission from psychotic experiences. For secondary outcomes, we could only meta-analyse trials of cognitive behavioural therapy. We found that cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than treatment as usual for reducing distress (pooled standardised mean difference: -0.24; 95% confidence interval = [-0.37, -0.10]), but no more effective than the control treatment for improving any other outcome. Individual reports indicated that cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, sleep cognitive behavioural therapy, systemic therapy, cognitive remediation therapy, and supportive treatments improved at least one clinical or functional outcome. Four reports included economic evaluations, which suggested cognitive behavioural therapy may be cost-effective compared with treatment as usual.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our meta-analytic findings were primarily null, with the exception that cognitive behavioural therapy may reduce the distress associated with psychotic experiences. Our analyses were limited by scarcity of studies, small samples and variable study quality.

Patients who did not achieve remission during a pre-trial with venlafaxine extended-release (150-300 mg/day) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the addition of aripiprazole (target dose 10 mg [maximum 15 mg] daily) daily or placebo for 12 weeks.

Results showed that between 25% and 39% of the sample referred to clinically significant levels of distress. In addition, women showed higher levels of distress, negative affect, perception of pain, and cognitive reappraisal and lower levels of emotional suppression and sleep quality than men. A history of psychopathology, being younger, living alone or in a flat was associated with higher distress. Finally, the variables most strongly related to distress were negative and positive affect, levels of pain, sleep quality, and emotional suppression. Our results highlight the important role of emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and loneliness and the impact of being a woman and younger in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unique users in each program included 347 for depression; 325 for stress, anxiety, and worry; 203 for social anxiety; and 76 for insomnia. Paired t tests (two-tailed) compared the average level of change over time on a standardized measure of clinical symptoms appropriate to each program. Cohen d statistical effect sizes were calculated for each program. Potential moderator factors (age, gender, preliminary comprehensive assessment, number of lessons, duration, live coach support, and live teammate support) were tested together in repeated measures analysis of variance models with covariates in the full sample. Follow-up survey data (n=136) were also collected to explore user satisfaction and outcomes.

Seventeen male patients (age range 7 to 13.4 years; mean 10.4) participated in an open clinical trial consisting of a baseline placebo period (4 weeks), bupropion therapy (8 weeks), and post-drug placebo (2 weeks). Evaluations included clinical assessments, parents, teachers, and self-ratings; cognitive tests and blood level measurements of bupropion. Fifteen patients received a daily maximum of 150 mg, one received 100 mg and one 50 mg. Clinical global improvement with bupropion therapy was marked in 5 patients, moderate in 7, mild in 2, and none in 3. The Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale indicated improvements of hyperactivity, withdrawal, anxiety, hostility/uncooperativeness, sleep disorder, antisocial behaviour, neuroticism, depression and eating disturbance. Parents' Questionnaires indicated significant improvements of conduct disorder, anxiety, hyperactivity, muscle tension and psychosomaticism. While no single cognitive test showed significant improvement, all nine tests changed in the positive direction. Adverse effects were infrequent, transient and mild. There were no clinically significant changes of the laboratory values and vital signs. Two weeks following bupropion discontinuation, clinical global improvement was maintained in 8 patients, 7 showed relapses, while 2 remained unimproved. Analyses of computerized EEG revealed that degree of clinical improvement was indexed by baseline EEG parameters and that there were significant bupropion effects on EEG measures. Double-blind trials of bupropion are recommended in child psychiatry disorders."

            "abstract": "Although older monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective in the treatment of depressive disorders, they are underutilized in clinical practice due to main concerns about interaction with tyramine-containing food, and side effects. Efforts to address these safety issues led to the development of a transdermal formulation of selegiline, called selegiline transdermal system (STS). STS has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression. Transdermal administration of selegiline bypasses gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism. Therefore, STS permits inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and MAO-B enzymes in the brain while preserving the activity of MAO-A in the gastrointestinal system, thereby minimizing the risk of possible interactions with tyramine-rich foods. Tyramine challenge tests have confirmed that dietary modifications are not required with the 6 mg STS. The FDA has required dietary modifications with the 9 mg and 12 mg STS. Compared to oral administration, transdermal selegiline leads to sustained (minimal peak-trough fluctuations) plasma concentrations of the parent compound, increasing the amount of drug delivered to the brain. The efficacy of STS has been established in several short-term and one long-term randomized controlled trials. In clinical trials, application site reactions and insomnia were observed more frequently with STS than placebo. Rates of orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction and weight gain were comparable between STS and placebo. STS is a new generation of MAOI with superior safety profile to older MAOIs. It increases the pharmacological options available to treat depressive disorders and may benefit patients with major depression with atypical features and resistant depression. It is important for health-care professionals to be informed about the properties of STS."

            "abstract": "Two cases are presented in detail and two in summary fashion to illustrate a technique that can frequently be used instead of systematic desensitization to reduce the time needed to treat simple phobias. This method combines techniques developed by Strategic Therapy and Critical Incident Debriefing. Symptoms that the patient experiences as out of control are prescribed by the therapist and then normalized. For example, a 26-year-old woman with a fear of social situations learns that it is not unusual for people to feel somewhat awkward and anxious as they try to reestablish themselves with friends after being away from them for a long period of time. Therapy taught her to accept rather than fight her initial anxiety in these situation. Another client with claustrophobia was taught to imagine himself getting anxious and telling himself, \"yes, this is exactly what I expect. I am going to get anxious, and my anxiety will increase, but it isn't going to get higher than a '5' (on a 1-10 scale), and I can handle that.\" When these interventions are successful, the anxiety initially experienced in a phobic situation as a signal for panic is reinterpreted in new situations as expectable. This reframing renders the anxiety manageable. The treatment of two additional patients is briefly presented to further illustrate the application of this approach. Their phobias included a fear of sweating in public and a fear of sleep."

Treatment for depression during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years with depression will be randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive four sessions of brief CBT in 8 weeks. Participants will be evaluated by assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured. Our primary outcome is the change in maternal prenatal depression from baseline to posttreatment (8 weeks).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The potential of digital technology to deliver mental health interventions has been increasingly recognized worldwide. There is a growing literature on interventions using smartphone applications to promote mental health, both with or without the intermediation of a mental health professional. Our study adds to the literature by testing whether an app providing an intervention package, including CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition, physical activity, and social support, can promote maternal and child health and well-being. In particular, we aim to treat depression, for which the use of digital technologies is still scarce. Smartphone applications designed to treat maternal depression are especially relevant because of the potential to circumvent barriers that prevent pregnant women from accessing mental health care.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04495166 .

In addition, the principal psychiatric diagnoses, medical illnesses, and detailed drug history over recent 1 year were retrieved from the computerized records.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twelve hundred thirty-five subjects completed the phase 1 interview. The estimated prevalence of the lifetime diagnoses of sleepwalking, SRED, SRI, sleep violence, and RSBD-like disorder were 8.5%, 4.0%, 21.0%, 3.6%, and 5.8%, respectively, while the 1-year prevalence of these conditions were 2.9%, 2.4%, 8.8%, 2.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. These conditions were associated with depression and a constellation of sleep disturbances. Specific combinations of psychotropics were found to pose risk in particular parasomnias: sedative antidepressants and nonbenzodiazapine hypnotics in sleepwalking, regular zolpidem and antidepressants in SRED, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in RSBD-like disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Sleepwalking, SRED, RSBD-like disorder, and SRI were common and underrecognized among the psychiatric population in this study. Their occurrences were likely contributed by interacting effect of mental illnesses, sleep disturbances, and specific psychotropic medications. Further prospective study is warranted for clarification of the etiology and clinical management of these potentially dangerous and \"hidden\" parasomnias."

            "abstract": "The COVID pandemic is now leading to the emergence of a secondary mental health pandemic. Clients with psychosis are at increased risk of poorer medium- and long-term psychosocial and clinical outcomes. In response to the pressing need to flexibly deliver high-quality care to individuals with psychosis, this brief report proposes high yield cognitive behavioral techniques for psychosis (HY-CBt-p) facilitated by task sharing and digital enhancements. HY-CBt-p is delivered over fewer sessions than formulation-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp), can be learned by a range of providers, and includes techniques such as developing a normalizing explanation; techniques to reduce anxiety, depression, and insomnia, which perpetuate psychotic symptoms; self-monitoring; reality testing; and wellness planning. Previous research suggests that effect sizes will be lower than that of 16-session formulation-driven CBTp, but additional research is needed to test the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and comparative effectiveness of different forms of remote-delivered CBTp."

Therapeutic fasting, following an established protocol, is safe and well tolerated. We aim in this article to explore the biological mechanisms activated during fasting that could have an effect on brain function with particular focus on mood (we do not discuss here the mechanisms regulating eating behavior) and to provide a comprehensive review on the potential positive impact of therapeutic fasting on mood. We explored Medline, Web of Science and PsycInfo according to the PRISMA criteria (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis). The initial research paradigm was: [(fasting OR caloric restriction) AND (mental health OR depressive disorders OR mood OR anxiety)]. Many neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain fasting effects on mood, such as changes in neurotransmitters, quality of sleep, and synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Many clinical observations relate an early (between day 2 and day 7) effect of fasting on depressive symptoms with an improvement in mood, alertness and a sense of tranquility reported by patients. The persistence of mood improvement over time remains to be determined."

Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes.

The master biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controls daily rhythms of core body temperature, rest-activity cycle, physiological and behavioral functions, psychomotor functions and mood in humans. The clock genes are involved in the generation of the circadian rhythms and the biological clock is synchronized to solar day by direct photic inputs. Various circadian rhythm abnormalities have been demonstrated in mood disorders such as unipolar depression, bipolar depression and seasonal affective disorder. Hypotheses involving circadian rhythm abnormalities related to the etiology of mood disorders have been raised. The resulting circadian rhythm changes can be measured and evaluated that these techniques can be used to identify subtypes of mood disorders associated with circadian rhythm changes. The data obtained from chronobiological studies reveal methods that manipulate circadian rhythms. The effects of light and melatonin on circadian rhythms are determined by these studies. Chronobiological research has been applied to the psychiatric clinic and light therapy has been used as a chronotherapeutic in the treatment of mood disorders. On the other hand, chronotherapeutic approaches with effects on circadian rhythms such as sleep deprivation therapy have been used in the treatment of mood disorders too. As a good example of translational psychiatry, chronobiological studies have been projected in the psychiatry clinic. It may be possible, the data obtained from the basic sciences are used in the diagnosis of mood disorders and in the treatment of psychiatric disorders as chronotherapeutic techniques. Developments in the field of chronobiology and data obtained from chronotherapeutics may enable the development of evidence-based diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry."

            "abstract": "Until recently, neuroscience has given sleep research and discovery of better treatments of sleep disturbances little attention, despite the fact that disturbed sleep has overwhelming impact on human health. Sleep is a complex phenomenon in which specific psychological, electrophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, immunological and genetic factors are involved. The brain as both the generator and main object of sleep is obviously of particular interest, which makes a neuroscience-driven view the most promising approach to evaluate clinical implications and applications of sleep research. Polysomnography as the gold standard of sleep research, complemented by brain imaging, neuroendocrine testing, genomics and other laboratory measures can help to create composite biomarkers that allow maximizing the effects of individualized therapies while minimizing adverse effects. Here we review the current state of the neuroscience of sleep, sleep disorders and sleep therapeutics and will give some leads to promote the discovery and development of sleep medicines that are better than those we have today."

The objectives of this study were to compare the characteristics of patients who have pain-related insomnia with those reporting primary insomnia and to identify psychological factors that predict pain-related insomnia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Chronic pain patients with concomitant insomnia (n=137; Pain-related Insomnia Group) completed a selection of questionnaires that measure sleep patterns, psychological attributes, and cognitive-behavioral processes associated with the persistence of insomnia. Their responses were compared with those of primary insomnia patients (n=33; Primary Insomnia Group), using 3 sets of multivariate analyses of covariance that took account of demographic differences. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of insomnia severity among the chronic pain patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Pain-related Insomnia Group did not differ from the Primary Insomnia Group in their pattern and severity of sleep disturbance. The 2 groups were largely comparable in terms of their psychological characteristics, except that the Primary Insomnia Group was distinguishable from the Pain-related Insomnia Group by their greater tendency to worry. Patients in the Pain-related Insomnia Group reported levels of sleep-related anxiety and presleep somatic arousal that matched with those reported by patients in the Primary Insomnia Group. However, relative to patients in the Pain-related Insomnia Group, those in the Primary Insomnia Group reported more dysfunctional sleep beliefs and presleep cognitive arousal. In addition to pain intensity, depression, and presleep cognitive arousal were significant predictors of insomnia severity within the Pain-related Insomnia Group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There are more similarities than differences between the 2 types of insomnia. Besides pain, mood, and presleep, thought processes also seem to have a role in the manifestation of pain-related insomnia. It is suggested that hybrid treatments that seek to simultaneously address factors across these domains may represent more effective treatments than 1-dimensional interventions."

The objective of this study was to describe the subjective sleep complaints of individuals with COPD along with their attributions as to the cause of these symptoms, and their treatment preferences for insomnia. Three focus groups were conducted (N=18) with participants who have moderate to severe COPD. Focus group data were transcribed, compared and contrasted to identify themes of attribution. Participants reported difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and daytime sleepiness. They attributed their sleep problems primarily to their pulmonary symptoms, but also poor air quality (thick humid air) and death anxiety when awake during the night. There was no clear preference for type of treatment to remedy this problem (medication, cognitive therapy), although they indicated that traveling to the clinic was difficult and should be avoided as much as possible. These data suggest that environmental manipulation to improve air quality (eg, air conditioning) and modifications to reduce death anxiety could be beneficial to persons with COPD.

Twenty-four student veterans (Meanage = 32.7) with symptoms of depression were randomly assigned either to a treatment group receiving six weekly sessions of ePST or to a minimal contact control group (MCC). Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression scale at baseline and then weekly through post-ePST or post-MCC. PTSD and insomnia questionnaires were also completed at baseline and posttreatment. A linear mixed model regression showed a statistically significant Group (ePST vs. MCC) × Time (pretreatment through posttreatment) interaction for depression, with the ePST showing substantial improvements in depressive symptoms over the 6-week period. Significant improvements were also seen in PTSD and insomnia symptoms. Results suggest that ePST can effectively treat depression, PTSD, and insomnia symptoms in student military veterans and may be a viable alternative for those who are not able to access live therapy. Future work should examine the durability of treatment effects and utility for more severe depression and suicide prevention."

Research with adults has demonstrated that Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) can improve both sleep and mental health. However, research with adolescents is lacking, and we know little about whether CBTi would have similar effects on this younger population.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper summarizes the protocol of a study to assess the feasibility of adding supported Web-based CBTi to the usual care of young people aged 14-17 years attending specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is an open trial where we will recruit young people (N=50) aged 14-17 years attending specialist CAMHS with primary or comorbid symptoms of insomnia. In addition to their usual care, young people will be provided with Sleepio, a 6-session, Web-based CBTi self-help program for insomnia. Sleepio teaches a range of techniques including sleep hygiene, relaxation training, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and cognitive techniques that participants will be helped to apply through brief, weekly telephone support calls. Questionnaires and interviews will be completed at baseline and postintervention (8-10 weeks) and will assess sleep, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and acceptability of Sleepio and telephone support.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Recruitment started in May 2018 and continued until the end of October 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study will provide preliminary evidence about whether supported Web-based CBTi is acceptable to young people with mental health problems and about the postintervention effects on sleep and symptoms of anxiety and depression.

With the dearth of clinical psychologists embedded in audiology services and the cessation of training for hearing therapists in the UK, it is left to audiologists to meet the psychological needs of many patients with tinnitus. However, there is no universally standardized training or manualized intervention specifically for audiologists across the whole UK public healthcare system and similar systems elsewhere across the world.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary aim of this scoping review was to catalog the components of psychological therapies for people with tinnitus, which have been used or tested by psychologists, so that they might inform the development of a standardized audiologist-delivered psychological intervention. Secondary aims of this article were to identify the types of psychological therapy for people with tinnitus, who were reported but not tested in any clinical trial, as well as the job roles of clinicians who delivered psychological therapy for people with tinnitus in the literature.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      The authors searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; ISRCTN; ClinicalTrials.gov; IC-TRP; and Google Scholar. In addition, the authors searched the gray literature including conference abstracts, dissertations, and editorials. No records were excluded on the basis of controls used, outcomes reached, timing, setting, or study design (except for reviews-of the search results. Records were included in which a psychological therapy intervention was reported to address adults (≤18 years) tinnitus-related distress. No restrictive criteria were placed upon the term tinnitus. Records were excluded in which the intervention included biofeedback, habituation, hypnosis, or relaxation as necessary parts of the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 5043 records were retrieved of which 64 were retained. Twenty-five themes of components that have been included within a psychological therapy were identified, including tinnitus education, psychoeducation, evaluation treatment rationale, treatment planning, problem-solving behavioral intervention, thought identification, thought challenging, worry time, emotions, social comparison, interpersonal skills, self-concept, lifestyle advice, acceptance and defusion, mindfulness, attention, relaxation, sleep, sound enrichment, comorbidity, treatment reflection, relapse prevention, and common therapeutic skills. The most frequently reported psychological therapies were cognitive behavioral therapy, tinnitus education, and internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy. No records reported that an audiologist delivered any of these psychological therapies in the context of an empirical trial in which their role was clearly delineated from that of other clinicians.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Scoping review methodology does not attempt to appraise the quality of evidence or synthesize the included records. Further research should therefore determine the relative importance of these different components of psychological therapies from the perspective of the patient and the clinician."

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system to 26 weeks of monotherapy with fixed-dose oral cariprazine (3 mg, 4·5 mg [target dose], or 6 mg per day) or risperidone (3 mg, 4 mg [target dose], or 6 mg per day); previous medication was discontinued over 2 weeks. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 26 or end of treatment on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factor score for negative symptoms (PANSS-FSNS) analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population of patients who had follow-up assessments within 5 days after last receipt of study drugs with a mixed-effects model for repeated measures.

Mean daily doses were 4·2 mg (SD 0·6) for cariprazine and 3·8 mg (0·4) for risperidone. Treatment-emergent adverse events (eg, insomnia, akathisia, worsening of schizophrenia, headache, anxiety) were reported in 123 (54%) patients treated with cariprazine and 131 (57%) patients treated with risperidone. Use of cariprazine led to a greater least squares mean change in PANSS-FSNS from baseline to week 26 than did risperidone (-8·90 points for cariprazine vs -7·44 points for risperidone; least squares mean difference -1·46, 95% CI -2·39 to -0·53; p=0·0022; effect size 0·31).

The burden of psychological disease, its impact and contributing factors in patients with AATD are largely unknown. This study determined the prevalence of depression and anxiety in AATD and its clinical impact. All subjects with PiZZ/PiZnull (n = 635) and PiSZ (n = 111) genotypes within the AATD registry who had sufficient data to calculate pulmonary physiological and health status (HS) decline were grouped as those with or without a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on physiological, demographic and HS parameters. Depression and/or anxiety was present in 16.4% overall in both PiSZ and PiZZ/PiZnull cohorts and was associated with lower baseline pulmonary function and worse HS. In the multivariable analysis of the PiZZ/PiZnull cohort, a greater average decline in FEV1% predicted was observed in those with depression and/or anxiety than those without (-1.53 SD ± 2.26 per year, -0.99 ± 1.79, respectively; p = 0.03) but there was no difference in HS decline (p = 0.33). No differences were seen in the PiSZ cohort. Dyspnoea (mMRC score) was generally worse in those with depression and/or anxiety than those without. Comorbidity burden did not differ between those with or without depression and/or anxiety. Disease severity and progression may be contributing to the prevalence of psychological factors in PiZZ/PiZnull patients. Patients who are declining rapidly should be actively monitored for psychological co-morbidity and treated by cognitive or pharmacological means.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1991904 ."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Recent work suggests a link between a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor, anxiety sensitivity (AS), and sleep disturbance. Although research has indicated that AS is malleable through brief interventions, no studies have yet examined whether interventions targeting AS will reduce symptoms of insomnia. Considering this gap in previous research, the current study tested the direct and indirect effects of a brief, computerized intervention targeting AS on self-reported insomnia symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Community participants (N = 97) were randomized into either the AS intervention (consisting of psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure) or a health information control condition, and they were assessed at baseline and at 1-month follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Findings indicated that symptoms of insomnia were related to AS and its subfactors at baseline and follow-up.

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that 9% of the elderly would need psychotherapeutic treatment, only 1% of the applications for such treatment were initiated by the elderly. Older people often lack the ability to verbalize their emotional problems, which is an obvious prerogative for expressing the wish for psychotherapy. However elderly people tend to indulge in childhood memories, and therefore would be excellent candidates for psychoanalytic-orientated treatment. Because objective time is not a factor in subconscious life, older people can suffer from unsolved intrapsychic-, intra- and intergenerational conflicts and trauma reactivations. Without considering these psychological conflicts, the most important fields for psychotherapeutic intervention in the elderly are depression, mild cognitive impairment, incipient demential syndromes, and the impairment of psychosocial competence resulting from these conditions; caregiver-related therapy also plays an important role. For those between 65 and 75 years of age, the indications for psychotherapy are similar to those of younger adults: first of all depression, anxiety-syndromes, insomnia and suicidal attempts. For those over 75 years old, isolation, polymorbidity, preservation of autonomy and self-determination, and the fear of loosing autonomy and becoming care-dependent are the most important indications for psychotherapy. A feature common to all psychotherapeutic schools is that they try to overcome disturbances, to reduce emotional pain, to preserve, establish and improve psychosocial competency and the activities of daily living. Psychotherapy in a narrow sense is indicated when the psychic structure, the mental flexibility and the motivational state are quite good and if differentiated verbal interactions are possible. In a broader sense, psychotherapy stands for actional and training aspects, and integral environmental and socio-therapeutic treatment so that autonomy and quality of life can be properly improved. This definition of psychotherapy makes it obvious that demented and care-dependent patients are potential candidates for psychotherapy."

            "abstract": "Arousal affects cognition, emotion, and behavior and has been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Although environmental conditions substantially contribute to the level of arousal, stable interindividual characteristics are well-established and a genetic basis has been suggested. Here we investigated the molecular genetics of brain arousal in the resting state by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We selected N = 1877 participants from the population-based LIFE-Adult cohort. Participants underwent a 20-min eyes-closed resting state EEG, which was analyzed using the computerized VIGALL 2.1 (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig). At the SNP-level, GWAS analyses revealed no genome-wide significant locus (p < 5E-8), although seven loci were suggestive (p < 1E-6). The strongest hit was an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of TMEM159 (lead-SNP: rs79472635, p = 5.49E-8). Importantly, at the gene-level, GWAS analyses revealed significant evidence for TMEM159 (p = 0.013, Bonferroni-corrected). By mapping our SNPs to the GWAS results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we found that all corresponding markers of TMEM159 showed nominally significant associations with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; 0.006 ≤ p ≤ 0.011). More specifically, variants associated with high arousal levels have previously been linked to an increased risk for MDD. In line with this, the MetaXcan database suggests increased expression levels of TMEM159 in MDD, as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Alzheimer's Disease. Furthermore, our pathway analyses provided evidence for a role of sodium/calcium exchangers in resting state arousal. In conclusion, the present GWAS identifies TMEM159 as a novel candidate gene which may modulate the risk for psychiatric disorders through arousal mechanisms. Our results also encourage the elaboration of the previously reported interrelations between ion-channel modulators, sleep-wake behavior, and psychiatric disorders."

            "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep that lasts for at least one month and is accompanied by significant impairment in daytime functioning including fatigue, irritability, and/or difficulty concentrating. It is one of the most common complaints reported by individuals with cancer, especially around the time of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Yet it is often unrecognized and untreated, leading to adverse health consequences and increased healthcare costs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been recommended as the gold standard for treating insomnia among individuals with cancer. Multiple studies have tested and proven the efficacy and effectiveness of CBT-I among individuals with cancer. However, only one study has investigated the efficacy of CBT-I in individuals newly diagnosed with cancer who are undergoing cancer treatment. Moreover, previous studies have been limited by their focus on largely homogenous samples of White, well-educated women with breast cancer. The dissemination of CBT-I among individuals with cancer is greatly limited by the lack of available providers and resources needed to implement the standard face-to-face treatment. One strategy to address this shortage has been to abbreviate standard CBT-I into low-intensity modalities that require fewer resources and can be self-administered on the Internet. The current study sought to examine the feasibility and acceptability, as well as the efficacy of one such program, an online low-intensity CBT-I intervention, Sleeping Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi), supplemented with clinician support, in a sample of individuals newly diagnosed with heterogeneous malignancies who were undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation. Results yielded support for the feasibility and acceptability of addressing individuals’ insomnia with a low-intensity CBT-I intervention while they are undergoing cancer treatment. With regard to sleep, there were significant treatment effects observed on a global measure of insomnia severity and on subjective sleep consolidation. There were also significant treatment effects for depressive symptoms. Findings are discussed in the context of study limitations and for the purpose of expanding the literature on disseminating CBT-I early in the cancer care trajectory."

            "abstract": "Pediatric obesity is increasing worldwide and disproportionately affects the economically and socially disadvantaged. Obese children are at risk of developing the (dys)metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Those with diabetes may have mixed features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pediatric obesity is the result of persistent adverse changes in food intake, lifestyle, and energy expenditure. It may be because of underlying a genetic syndrome or a conduct disorder. Children living in urban settings often lack safe, affordable, and accessible recreational facilities. Tight educational schedules mean less free time, while computer games and television have become preferred recreational activities. More families are eating out or eating take-out meals and processed foods at home because of pressures of work and time constraints. Consumer advertising targeted at children and the ready availability of vending machines encourage unwise food choices. Some children eat excessively because they are depressed, anxious, sad, or lonely. Often families and obese children are aware of the need for healthy eating and exercise but are unable to translate knowledge into weight loss. Population-based measures such as public education, school meal reforms, child-safe exercise friendly environments, and school-based and community-based exercise programs have been shown to be successful to varying degrees, but there remain individuals who will need special help to overcome obesity. Overeating (e.g. binge eating) may be a manifestation of disordered coping behavior but may also be because of defects in the neural and hormonal control of appetite and satiety. New pharmacological approaches are targeting these areas. We need a coordinated approach involving government, communities, and healthcare providers to provide a continuum of population-based interventions, focused screening, and personalized multidisciplinary interventions for the obese child and family."

There is concern that people may not be receiving appropriate treatment for their depression because of uncertainty regarding which antidepressant or class works best, and the perceived risk of exacerbating seizures. This review aimed to address these issues, and inform clinical practice and future research. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 12, 2014.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms and the effect on seizure recurrence, in people with epilepsy and depression.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      For this update, we searched CRS Web, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2021). We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry in October 2019, but were unable to update it because it was inaccessible. There were no language restrictions.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), investigating children or adults with epilepsy, who were treated with an antidepressant and compared to placebo, comparative antidepressant, psychotherapy, or no treatment for depressive symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcomes were changes in depression scores (proportion with a greater than 50% improvement, mean difference, and proportion who achieved complete remission) and change in seizure frequency (mean difference, proportion with a seizure recurrence, or episode of status epilepticus). Secondary outcomes included the number of participants who withdrew from the study and reasons for withdrawal, quality of life, cognitive functioning, and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data for each included study. We then cross-checked the data extraction. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs, and the ROBINS-I for NRSIs. We presented binary outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or 99% CIs for specific adverse events. We presented continuous outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies in the review (four RCTs and six NRSIs), with 626 participants with epilepsy and depression, examining the effects of antidepressants. One RCT was a multi-centre study comparing an antidepressant with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The other three RCTs were single-centre studies comparing an antidepressant with an active control, placebo, or no treatment. The NRSIs reported on outcomes mainly in participants with focal epilepsy before and after treatment for depression with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); one NRSI compared SSRIs to CBT. We rated one RCT at low risk of bias, three RCTs at unclear risk of bias, and all six NRSIs at serious risk of bias. We were unable to conduct any meta-analysis of RCT data due to heterogeneity of treatment comparisons. We judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to very low across comparisons, because single studies contributed limited outcome data, and because of risk of bias, particularly for NRSIs, which did not adjust for confounding variables. More than 50% improvement in depressive symptoms ranged from 43% to 82% in RCTs, and from 24% to 97% in NRSIs, depending on the antidepressant given. Venlafaxine improved depressive symptoms by more than 50% compared to no treatment (mean difference (MD) -7.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) -11.52 to -3.66; 1 study, 64 participants; low-certainty evidence); the results between other comparisons were inconclusive. Two studies comparing SSRIs to CBT reported inconclusive results for the proportion of participants who achieved complete remission of depressive symptoms. Seizure frequency data did not suggest an increased risk of seizures with antidepressants compared to control treatments or baseline. Two studies measured quality of life; antidepressants did not appear to improve quality of life over control. No studies reported on cognitive functioning. Two RCTs and one NRSI reported comparative data on adverse events; antidepressants did not appear to increase the severity or number of adverse events compared to controls. The NSRIs reported higher rates of withdrawals due to adverse events than lack of efficacy. Reported adverse events for antidepressants included nausea, dizziness, sedation, headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms associated with epilepsy is still very limited. Rates of response to antidepressants were highly variable. There is low certainty evidence from one small RCT (64 participants) that venlafaxine may improve depressive symptoms more than no treatment; this evidence is limited to treatment between 8 and 16 weeks, and does not inform longer-term effects. Moderate to low evidence suggests neither an increase nor exacerbation of seizures with SSRIs. There are no available comparative data to inform the choice of antidepressant drug or classes of drug for efficacy or safety for treating people with epilepsy and depression. RCTs of antidepressants utilising interventions from other treatment classes besides SSRIs, in large samples of patients with epilepsy and depression, are needed to better inform treatment policy. Future studies should assess interventions across a longer treatment duration to account for delayed onset of action, sustainability of treatment responses, and to provide a better understanding of the impact on seizure control."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      There are no clear guidelines on how to treat posttraumatic headache (PTH) or post-concussive symptoms (PCS). However, behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation are Level-A evidence-based treatments for headache prevention. To understand how to develop and study further mind-body interventions (MBIs) and behavioral therapies for PTH and PCS, we developed the following question using the PICO framework: Are behavioral therapies and MBIs effective for treating PTH and PCS?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a systematic search of 3 databases (Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) for behavioral interventions and MBIs with the subject headings and keywords for PTH, concussion, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized controlled trials, (2) the majority of the intervention had to be behavioral or mind-body therapy focused, (3) the majority of the participants (>50%) had to have had a mild TBI (not a moderate or severe TBI), (4) published in a peer-reviewed publication, and (5) meeting pre-specified primary and/or secondary outcomes. Primary outcome(s): whether there was a significant change in concussion symptom severity (yes/no) based on the symptom severity checklist/scale used, whether there was a 50% reduction in headache days and/or disability; secondary outcome(s): sleep variables, cognitive complaints, depression, and anxiety. The search identified 917 individual studies. Two independent reviewers screened citations and full-text articles independently. Nineteen articles were pulled for full article review. Seven articles met the final inclusion criteria. The systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017070072).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, there was vast heterogeneity across the studies, making it difficult to fully assess efficacy. The heterogeneity ranged from differences in patient populations, the timing of when the interventions were initiated, the types of intervention implemented, and the measures used to assess outcomes. Seven studies were identified as meeting final inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 1108 adult participants ranging from 18 to 80. Sixty-nine percent were male. Of the 7 studies, 3 were focused on military staff (retired and active). Time post-injury for inclusion into the studies varied from 48 hours post-injury to more than 2 years post-injury. One of the 7 studies did not include time post-TBI in the inclusion criteria. Two studies recruited patients who had visited their emergency departments, 4 of the studies recruited subjects through outpatient referrals, and 1 study recruited patients who had been in a prior traffic accident with resulting chronic PTH directly from a headache center. Group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions and telephonic counseling or communication were common intervention methods used in the studies, with group CBT being used in 2 of the studies and telephonic counseling being used in 3. Other intervention methods used included individual CBT, cognitive training, psychoeducation, and computer-based and/or therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Many of the interventions offered vastly different methods of delivery of intervention and doses of intervention. Many of the negative studies were done after an extended duration post-injury (>1-year posttraumatic brain injury [TBI]). In addition, the participants were lumped together regardless of their pre-concussion comorbidities, their mechanism of injury, their symptoms, and the duration from injury to the start of the intervention. The mass heterogeneity found between the studies led to inconclusive findings. Thus, there are various considerations for the design of the intervention for future behavioral/MBI studies for PTH and concussion that must be addressed before the leading question of this review may be effectively answered."

However, treatment effects may vary across different patient subpopulations. In contrast to demonstrating one treatment is superior to another on the average sense, one is often more concerned with the question that, for a particular patient, or a group of patients with similar characteristics, which treatment strategy is most appropriate to achieve a desired outcome. Various interaction tests have been proposed to detect treatment effect heterogeneity; however, they typically examine covariates one at a time, do not offer an integrated approach that incorporates all available information, and can greatly increase the chance of a false positive finding when the number of covariates is large. We propose a new permutation test for the null hypothesis of no interaction effects for any covariate. The proposed test allows us to consider the interaction effects of many covariates simultaneously without having to group subjects into subsets based on pre-specified criteria and applies generally to randomized clinical trials of multiple treatments. The test provides an attractive alternative to the standard likelihood ratio test, especially when the number of covariates is large. We illustrate the proposed methods using a dataset from the Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study."

            "abstract": "A 50 year-old woman presented in January of 1995 with a prolonged history of symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and was classified at the time with a remitting-progressive course. Her chief symptoms included slurring of speech, impairment of vision with intermittent diplopia, difficulties with gait and balance with spastic-ataxic gait, mental depression, insomnia, fatigue, impaired cognitive functions notably poor short term memory and recurrent urinary tract and sinus infections. An MRI scan showed multiple nodular demyelinating lesions scattered in the subcortical white matter and periventricularly of both cerebral hemispheres. Over the following 18 months, while receiving three treatment sessions per week with picotesla electro-magnetic fields (EMFs) which were applied extracranially, she showed a significant recovery in both physical and mental symptoms and additionally experienced decreased susceptibility to infections. In addition, the course of her disease appeared to have stabilized as opposed to the preceding 5 years during which time she experienced insidious, steady deterioration in her functioning. Despite this remarkable clinical recovery through the application of EMFs, and MRI scan obtained at the same diagnostic center 18 months after initiation of treatment with EMFs showed no changes in the number and size of the demyelinating plaques. These findings demonstrate lack of a correlation between recovery of symptoms and the number and extent of demyelinating plaques on MRI scan. It has been known since the days of Charcot in the latter half of the 19th century that in MS there is a great disparity between the histopathological changes of the disease and neurologic deficits. This report enhances the notion that demyelination may reflect an epiphenomenon of the disease."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively reduces both insomnia and depression severity, and can be delivered digitally. This could substantially increase the accessibility to CBT-I, which could reduce the health disparities related to insomnia; however, the efficacy of digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) across a range of demographic groups has not yet been adequately examined.

In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear-level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co-morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. Hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices (amplification and sound generation within one device) are a component of many tinnitus management programmes and together with information and advice are a first line of management in audiology departments for someone who has tinnitus.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of sound therapy (using amplification devices and/or sound generators) for tinnitus in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved hearing aids, sound generators or combination hearing aids and compared them to waiting list control, placebo or education/information only with no device. We also included studies comparing hearing aids to sound generators, combination hearing aids to hearing aids, and combination hearing aids to sound generators.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity as measured as a global score on multi-item tinnitus questionnaire and significant adverse effects as indicated by an increase in self-reported tinnitus loudness. Our secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health-related quality of life and adverse effects associated with wearing the device such as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or ear infections. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      This review included eight studies (with a total of 590 participants). Seven studies investigated the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies were parallel-group RCTs and one had a cross-over design. In general, risk of bias was unclear due to lack of detail about sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was also little or no use of blinding.No data for our outcomes were available for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). Data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) were also few, with limited potential for data pooling.Hearing aid only versus sound generator device onlyOne study compared patients fitted with sound generators versus those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at 3, 6 or 12 months (low-quality evidence). The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity.Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid onlyThree studies compared combination hearing aids with hearing aids and measured tinnitus symptom severity using the THI or Tinnitus Functional Index. When we pooled the data we found no difference between them (standardised mean difference -0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.52 to 0.22; three studies; 114 participants) (low-quality evidence). The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity.Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.None of the studies measured the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health-related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor the newly developed core outcomes tinnitus intrusiveness, ability to ignore, concentration, quality of sleep and sense of control.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is no evidence to support the superiority of sound therapy for tinnitus over waiting list control, placebo or education/information with no device. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of any of the sound therapy options (hearing aid, sound generator or combination hearing aid) over each other. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, was low. Using a combination device, hearing aid or sound generator might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity.Future research into the effectiveness of sound therapy in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient-centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Excessive fatigue and insomnia are common among shift workers and can lead to negative effects such as reduced work performance, processing errors, accidents at work, absenteeism, reduced quality of life, and symptoms of depression. Moreover, work in rotating shifts can be a risk factor for different somatic and psychiatric diseases and may contribute to poor health, especially in elder adults and women. This review aims to show non-pharmacological preventive measures against fatigue and insomnia in shift workers.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Computerized literature searches in MedLine and in the Cochrane Library were performed with the following key words: shift work disorder, fatigue, insomnia, shift work, measures, treatment, therapy, strategies and coping. The search was limited to non-pharmacological studies that were conducted on human subjects and published as English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals since 1970. Additional studies were identified through the reference sections of relevant articles. Eighteen articles on fatigue in shift workers, including six original research articles with a total sample size of 3504 probands consisting of industrial workers, office employees, aircraft maintenance engineers, and non-shift workers working in simulated shifts, were analyzed, as well as seven articles on insomnia, including an original research article with a sample size of 26 media workers. Also, 4 reviews on shift work disorder were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Main:\n        \n      \n      The occurrence of fatigue and insomnia in shift workers associated with a working period is described as shift work disorder. Estimations on the prevalence of shift work disorder in shift workers vary between 5 % and about 20 %; about one in three shift workers is affected by insomnia and up to 90 % of shift workers report regular fatigue and sleepiness at the workplace. We concluded that there is a necessity for treatments to improve the sleep quality of the shift working population. The most common non-pharmacological recommendations to improve sleep quality and to reduce insomnia and fatigue were scheduling, bright light exposure, napping, psychoeducation for sleep hygiene, and cognitive-behavioral measures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Some important preventive coping strategies for fatigue associated with shift work such as napping and exposure to bright light have already been investigated and are generally approved. A few studies also provide good evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral techniques in the treatment of chronic primary and comorbid insomnia. These coping strategies summarized in this paper should be considered in the workplace health promotion programs of each work environment to improve working conditions for shift workers and to save money."

            "abstract": "Agomelatine, an agonist of melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptors and a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor antagonist, is widely applied in treating depression and insomnia symptoms in several neurogenerative diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect of agomelatine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is less known. In this study, a total of 30 mice were randomly divided into three groups, namely, wild type (WT), APP/PS1, and agomelatine (50 mg/kg). After 30 days, the Morris water maze was performed to test the cognitive ability of mice. Then, all mice were sacrificed, and the hippocampus tissues were collected for ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. In this study, we found that agomelatine attenuated spatial memory deficit, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Further study demonstrated that agomelatine treatment upregulated the protein expression of DHCR24 and downregulated P-Akt, P-mTOR, p-p70s6k, Hes1, and Notch1 expression. In summary, our results identified that agomelatine could improve cognitive impairment and ameliorate AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice via activating DHCR24 signaling and inhibiting Akt/mTOR and Hes1/Notch1 signaling pathway. Agomelatine may become a promising drug candidate in the therapy of AD."

The aim of this project was to develop a smartphone app that delivers CBT-I to young people to improve sleep.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To inform the development of the app, young people (N=21) aged between 12 and 16 years attended one of the 3 focus groups (each with 4-10 participants). These focus groups were conducted at different stages of the development process such that the process could be iterative. Participants were asked the reasons why they might use an app to help them sleep, the kinds of features or functions that they would like to see in such an app, and any concerns they may have in using the app. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Of the issues discussed by the participants, the researchers selected themes associated with content, functionality, and accessibility and user experience to examine, as these were most informative for the app design process.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In terms of content, young people were interested in receiving information about recommended sleep guidelines and personalized information for their age group. They reported that keeping a sleep diary was acceptable, but they should be able to complete it flexibly, in their own time. They reported mixed views about the use of the phone's accelerometer. Young people felt that the functionality of the app should include elements of game playing if they were to remain engaged with the app. Flexibility of use and personalized features were also desirable, and there were mixed views about the schedule of notifications and reminders. Participants reported that for the app to be accessible and usable, it should be from a trusted developer, have engaging aesthetics, have a layout that is easy to navigate, not rely on Internet coverage, and preferably be free. Participants felt that being able to conceal the purpose of the app from peers was an advantage and were willing to provide personal information to use the app if the purpose and use of that information was made clear. Overall, participants endorsed the use of the app for sleep problems among their age group and reported motivation to use it.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The Sleep Ninja is a fully-automated app that delivers CBT-I to young people, incorporating the features and information that young people reported they would expect from this app. A pilot study testing the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Sleep Ninja is now underway."

            "abstract": "Sleep disturbance is common among young people, with consequences for academic, emotional and behavioural development. Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is efficacious, yet it is costly and not available to many who need it. Digitally-delivered CBT-I (eCBT-I) has the potential to overcome these barriers. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify studies which report on the efficacy or effectiveness of eCBT-I for young people with sleep disturbance. Electronic databases were systematically searched and three studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies used the same online intervention for adolescents with insomnia symptoms, while the other was conducted in a college sample of individuals who opted into a stress-management study. Results showed that eCBT-I improved sleep efficiency, sleep quality, sleep-onset latency and total sleep time with effect sizes ranging from 0.17-1.30 (Cohen's d). This suggests that eCBT-I is a promising intervention for young people, but more studies are needed to verify the conditions under which it is most effective."

CRH and CRH-related peptides and their receptors are present in the central nervous system and in a wide variety of peripheral tissues, including the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems, and have been associated with the pathophysiology of many disease states. These observations have led to the development of several CRH receptor type-selective antagonists, which have been used experimentally to elucidate the role of CRH and related peptides in physiological and disease processes, such as anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, addictive behavior, inflammatory and allergic disorders, neurological diseases and pre-term labor. Because of the complex network of multiple CRH receptor subtypes and their tissue- and agonist-specific signaling diversity, antagonists need to be developed that can target specific CRH receptor isoform-driven signaling pathways."

However, insomnia disorder in adolescence is poorly characterized, under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, and the reason for the female preponderance for insomnia that emerges after puberty is largely unknown. Insomnia disorder goes beyond an individual complaint of poor sleep or a sleep state misperception, and there is emerging evidence supporting the association of insomnia symptoms in adolescents with alterations in several bio-systems including functional cortical alterations and systemic inflammation. Insomnia disorder is associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders, and is an independent risk factor for suicidality and substance use in adolescents, raising the possibility that treating insomnia symptoms in early adolescence may reduce risk for these adverse outcomes. Cognitive behavioral treatments have proven efficacy for adolescent insomnia and online methods seem to offer promising cost-effective options.

It causes severe health issues, such as sore muscles, low concentration, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. The less availability of predictive solutions specifically for individuals suffering from GAD can become an imperative reason for health and psychological adversity. The proposed solution aims to monitor health, behavioral and environmental parameters of the individual to predict health adversity caused by GAD. Initially, Weighted-Naïve Bayes (W-NB) classifier is utilized to predict irregular health events by classifying the captured data at the fog layer. The proposed two-phased decision-making process helps to optimize the distribution of required medical services by determining the scale of vulnerability. Furthermore, the utility of the framework is increased by calculating health vulnerability index using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) on the cloud. The presented work addresses the concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of anomalies followed by time sensitive two-phased alert generation procedure. To approve the performance of irregular event identification and health severity prediction, the framework has been conveyed in a living room for 30 days in which almost 15 individuals by the age of 68 to 78 years have been continuously monitored. The calculated outcomes represent the monitoring efficiency of the proposed framework over the policies of manual monitoring."

Adverse effects of therapies were very uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence base for improving sleep quality and related outcomes for adults and children with CKD is sparse. Relaxation techniques and exercise had uncertain effects on sleep outcomes. Acupressure may improve sleep latency and duration, although these findings are based on few studies. The effects of acupressure were not confirmed in studies in which sham acupressure was used as the control. Given the very low certainly evidence, future research will very likely change the evidence base. Based on the importance of symptom management to patients, caregivers and clinicians, future studies of sleep interventions among people with CKD should be a priority."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Computerized or online cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) are increasingly being developed to deliver insomnia therapy (CBT-i). They seek to address the difficulty of delivering an evidence-based technology to a large number of patients at low cost. Previous online applications have shown significant but variable improvements in sleep efficiency and a decrease in insomnia severity when compared with control groups. The best online methodology remains debated, and there are no such applications currently available within the UK National Health Service.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Evaluation of treatment outcomes in 75 participants with insomnia disorder using an open-access, novel, interactive online therapy. Rigorous screening was first undertaken to exclude those with probable sleep apnea, restless legs, circadian rhythm disorder, or significant anxiety or depression prior to commencing therapy. A modern interactive video-based website was used to encourage compliance by personalizing therapy based on response.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition with recurring episodes that often lead to suffering, decreased functioning, and sick leave. Pharmacotherapy in the form of mood stabilizers is widely available, but does not eliminate the risk of a new depressive or (hypo)manic episode. One way to reduce the risk of future episodes is to combine pharmacological treatment with individual or group psychological interventions. However, access to such interventions is often limited due to a shortage of trained therapists. In unipolar depression there is now robust evidence of the effectiveness of Internet-based psychological interventions, usually comprising psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Internet-based interventions for persons suffering from bipolar disorder could increase access to psychological treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of an Internet-based intervention, as well as its effect on residual depressive symptoms in persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II (BP-II). The most important outcomes were depressive symptoms, treatment adherence, and whether the patient perceived the intervention as helpful.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 7 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II at a Swedish psychiatric outpatient clinic were offered the opportunity to participate. Of the 7 patients, 3 (43%) dropped out before treatment began, and 4 (57%) were treated by means of an online, Internet-based intervention based on CBT (iCBT). The intervention was primarily aimed at psychoeducation, treatment of residual depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, and improved sleep. All patients had ongoing pharmacological treatment at recruitment and established contact with a psychiatrist. The duration of BP-II among the treated patients was between 6 and 31 years. A single-subject design was used and the results of the 4 participating patients were presented individually.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Initiating treatment was perceived as too demanding under current life circumstances for 3 patients who consequently dropped out during baseline assessment. Self-ratings using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-rated (MADRS-S) showed symptom reduction in 3 (75%) of the 4 treated cases during iCBT. In the evaluation of the treatment, 2 patients reported that they perceived that the treatment had reduced symptoms a little, 1 that it had reduced symptoms very much, and 1 not at all. Treatment adherence (ie, module completion) was fairly high in 3 cases. In general, the modules were perceived as fairly helpful or very helpful by the patients. In one case, there was a reliable change-according to the Reliable Change Index-in self-rated symptoms of depression and perseverative thinking.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The treatment seemed to have acceptable feasibility.

Anxiety and worry are often accompanied by additional symptoms like restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension and disturbed sleep. GAD is usually treated with medications and/or psychotherapy. In particular, the two most promising treatments seem to be cognitive therapy and applied relaxation. In this study we integrated these approaches through the use of a biofeedback enhanced virtual reality (VR) system used both for relaxation and controlled exposure. Moreover, this experience is strengthened by the use of a mobile phone that allows patients to perform the virtual experience even in an outpatient setting. This paper describe the results of a controlled trial (NCT00602212) involving 20 GAD patients randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) the VR and Mobile group (VRMB) including biofeedback; (2) the VR and Mobile group (VRM) without biofeedback; (3) the waiting list (WL) group. The clinical data underlined that (a) VR can be used also in the treatment of GAD; (b) in a VR treatment, patients take advantage of a mobile device that delivers in an outpatient setting guided experiences, similar to the one experienced in VR."

Such sleep difficulties are a problem in their own right, but increasingly it is being recognised that they may also be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Our focus is upon the relationship between insomnia and psychotic experiences, such as paranoia and hallucinations. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms in the general population and have been linked to disrupted sleep. These psychotic-like experiences raise the risk of development of a clinical disorder. Our aim is to reduce insomnia in a large general population group, and examine the effect on paranoia and hallucinations at the age when mental health problems typically emerge. The primary hypotheses are that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia will reduce insomnia and also levels of paranoia and hallucinations. The theoretical links will be substantiated by a planned mediation analysis. Improvements in a number of other mental health outcomes are also predicted.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      We will carry out a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 2,614 students with insomnia in universities across the UK.

            "abstract": "The prevalence of patients suffering from mental disorders is substantially increasing in recent years and represents a major burden to society. The underlying causes and neuronal circuits affected are complex and difficult to unravel. Frequent disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorder share links to the habenular neural circuit. This conserved neurotransmitter system relays cognitive information between different brain areas steering behaviors ranging from fear and anxiety to reward, sleep, and social behaviors. Advances in the field using the zebrafish model organism have uncovered major genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of the habenular neural circuit. Some of the identified genes involved in regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling have previously been suggested as risk genes of human mental disorders. Hence, these studies on habenular genetics contribute to a better understanding of brain diseases. We are here summarizing how the gained knowledge on the mechanisms underlying habenular neural circuit development can be used to introduce defined manipulations into the system to study the functional behavioral consequences. We further give an overview of existing behavior assays to address phenotypes related to mental disorders and critically discuss the power but also the limits of the zebrafish model for identifying suitable targets to develop therapies."

Because these patients require follow-up in the outpatient setting, family physicians should be prepared to provide ongoing care and screening for post-ICU complications. Risk factors for complications after ICU discharge include previous ICU admissions, preexisting mental illness, greater number of comorbidities, and prolonged mechanical ventilation or higher opioid exposure while in the ICU. Early nutritional support and mobilization in the ICU decrease the risk of complications. After ICU discharge, patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cognitive impairment using standardized screening tools. Physicians should also inquire about weakness, fatigue, neuropathy, and functional impairment and perform a targeted physical examination and laboratory evaluation as indicated; treatment depends on the underlying cause. Exercise regimens are beneficial for reducing several post-ICU complications. Patients who were treated for COVID-19 in the ICU may require additional instruction on reducing the risk of virus transmission.

Deficits in neurocognitive function may be caused by the tumor itself, treatment (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy), or other complicating factors (e.g., seizures, fatigue, mood disturbance) and can have a profound effect on functional independence and quality of life. Assessment of neurocognitive function is an important part of comprehensive care of patients with brain tumors. In the neuro-oncology clinic, assessment may include cognitive screening tools and inquiry into subjective cognitive function. Neuropsychological assessment is an important adjunct to identify cognitive symptoms and can be used as an opportunity to intervene through transformative feedback and treatment planning. Preventative measures can be taken to reduce cognitive side effects of treatment, such as awake craniotomies with intraoperative mapping during neurosurgery or prophylactic measures during radiation therapy (e.g., hippocampal avoidance, neuroprotectant treatment with memantine). Rehabilitative therapies, including cognitive rehabilitation and computerized cognitive exercise, are options for managing cognitive problems in an individualized manner. Pharmacotherapy, including use of stimulant medications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, has shown benefits for patients with brain tumors when tailored to an individual's cognitive profile. Identification and management of co-occurring issues, such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression, can also improve neurocognitive function. There are promising therapies under development that may provide new options for treatment in the future.

The treatment arms consisted of 10 weekly internet-delivered modules with 15 min of telephone support per week. At pre, post, and follow-up, participants completed measures of insomnia severity, sleep diaries, functional impairment, anxiety, depression, quality of life, adverse events, satisfaction and perception of content, workload, and activity in treatment. Measures of completed exercises, modules, therapist support, and platform logins were also measured at posttreatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Moderate to large effect sizes for both CT and BT outperformed the WL on the majority of outcomes, with significant differences in favor of both therapy groups.

Providing such long term care can be a source of significant stress, with many carers experiencing sleep difficulty, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and other symptoms of psychological strain. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most widely used psychological treatments in clinical use today, with applications across the full range of clinical conditions. It has been previously used in the management of other carer groups. The present study sought to evaluate the efficacy of CBT in treating psychological distress in a group of Parkinson's disease carers.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A total of 30 carers scoring at caseness level on the 28 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) were randomised to receive either a course of 12-14 sessions of CBT or to a no-treatment control group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Although some change was observed in both groups, significantly greater improvement on the GHQ-28 was observed after three months in the CBT treated group. Similar findings were observed in measures of caregiver strain and subjective burden, with the benefits being maintained over a subsequent three month follow up period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results offer preliminary support to the value of a CBT approach in the management of psychological morbidity in Parkinson's disease carers. Further larger scale research is needed in the future to examine the generalisability of the findings to a broader range of carers, assess the longer term impact on outcome in carers and those with Parkinson's disease, and explore how CBT can be best delivered in the most cost effective manner."

Young's Internet Addiction Test was used to assess participants' PIU. Students scoring 40 or higher on the Internet Addiction Test were classified as showing PIU in this study. The associations between PIU and lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise habits, weekday study time, and sleep time) and health-related symptoms (depressive symptoms and orthostatic dysregulation [OD] symptoms) were studied by logistic regression analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Over the 3 years, the prevalence of PIU was 19.9% in 2014, 15.9% in 2015, and 17.7% in 2016 without significant change.

Efficacious methods of intervention that are patient-centered and adaptable to a mobile and often difficult-to-reach population would be useful in improving quality of life. This article describes a new protocol developed as part of a randomized clinical trial of a telephone-mediated program for SMs with mTBI. The 12-session program combines problem solving training (PST) with embedded modules targeting depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headache. The rationale and development of this behavioral intervention for implementation with persons with multiple co-morbidities is described along with the proposed analysis of results. In particular, we provide details regarding the creation of a treatment that is manualized yet flexible enough to address a wide variety of problems and symptoms within a standard framework. The methods involved in enrolling and retaining an often hard-to-study population are also highlighted."

Since treatment with pT EMF has involved PD patients who were treated with dopaminergic agents at the time they received EMF there may have been a synergistic interaction between dopaminergic drugs and EMF. The present communication concerns a 49-year-old male Parkinsonian patient with stage 3 disability on the Hoehn and Yahr scale (1967) who, in response to brief extracranial applications of pT EMF, demonstrated a marked improvement in motor, depressive symptomatology and cognitive functions and was classified as stage 1 several weeks later. This case is remarkable in that the patient did not receive treatment with dopaminergic drugs prior to or during the course of EMF therapy. It suggests that (a) pT range EMF may be efficacious as a monotherapy for PD and should be considered also as a treatment modality for de novo diagnosed patients, and (b) application of these EMF improves Parkinsonism by a mechanism which involves, among others, augmentation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission."

Conversely, chronobiological treatments utilise zeitgebers for circadian rhythms such as light to improve mood and stabilise sleep, and manipulations of sleep timing and duration as rapid antidepressant modalities. Although sleep deprivation (\"wake therapy\") can act within hours, and its mood-elevating effects be maintained by regular morning light administration/medication/earlier sleep, it has not entered the regular guidelines for treating affective disorders as a first-line treatment. The hindrances to using chronotherapeutics may lie in their lack of patentability, few sponsors to carry out large multi-centre trials, non-reimbursement by medical insurance and their perceived difficulty or exotic \"alternative\" nature. Future use can be promoted by new technology (single-sample phase measurements, phone apps, movement and sleep trackers) that provides ambulatory documentation over long periods and feedback to therapist and patient. Light combinations with cognitive behavioural therapy and sleep hygiene practice may speed up and also maintain response. The urgent need for new antidepressants should hopefully lead to reconsideration and implementation of these non-pharmacological methods, as well as further clinical trials. We review the putative neurochemical mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation and light therapy, and current knowledge linking clocks and sleep with affective disorders: neurotransmitter switching, stress and cortico-limbic reactivity, clock genes, cortical neuroplasticity, connectomics and neuroinflammation. Despite the complexity of multi-system mechanisms, more insight will lead to fine tuning and better application of circadian and sleep-related treatments of depression."

Patients with chronic pain demonstrate attentional biases towards pain-related information. The therapeutic benefits of modifying attentional biases by implicitly training attention away from pain-related information towards neutral information have been supported in a small number of published studies. Limited research however has explored the efficacy of modifying pain-related biases via the internet. This protocol describes a randomised, double-blind, internet-delivered attentional bias modification intervention, aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on reducing pain interference. Secondary outcomes are pain intensity, state and trait anxiety, depression, pain-related fear, and sleep impairment. This study will also explore the effects of training intensity on these outcomes, along with participants' perceptions about the therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The study is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial with four arms exploring the efficacy of online attentional bias modification training versus placebo training theorised to offer no specific therapeutic benefit. Participants with chronic musculoskeletal pain will be randomised to one of four groups: (1) 10-session attentional modification group; (2) 10-session placebo training group; (3) 18-session attentional modification group; or (4) 18-session placebo training group. In the attentional modification groups, the probe-classification version of the visual-probe task will be used to implicitly train attention away from threatening information towards neutral information. Following the intervention, participants will complete a short interview exploring their perceptions about the online training.

Trauma may induce a chronic state of hyperarousal, resulting in problems such as anxiety, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder. Mind-body practices, such as relaxation breathing and mindfulness meditation, help to reduce arousal and may reduce the likelihood of such psychological distress. To better understand resilience-building practices, we are conducting the Biofeedback-Assisted Resilience Training (BART) study to evaluate whether the practice of slow, paced breathing with or without heart rate variability biofeedback can be effectively learned via a smartphone app to enhance psychological resilience.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our objective was to conduct a limited, interim review of user interactions and study data on use of the BART resilience training app and demonstrate analyses of real-time sensor-streaming data.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed the BART app to provide paced breathing resilience training, with or without heart rate variability biofeedback, via a self-managed 6-week protocol.

To evaluate the app, a population of military personnel, veterans, and civilian first responders used the app for 6 weeks of resilience training. We analyzed app usage and heart rate variability measures during rest, cognitive stress, and paced breathing. Currently released for the BART research study, the BART app is being used to collect self-reported survey and heart rate sensor data for comparative evaluation of paced breathing relaxation training with and without heart rate variability biofeedback.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      To date, we have analyzed the results of 328 participants who began using the BART app for 6 weeks of stress relaxation training via a self-managed protocol.

Yet, poor sleep has historically been neglected as a specific treatment target in mental health programmes (Freeman, Sheaves, Waite, Harvey, & Harrison, 2020).\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      All patients over a 12-month period entering the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service endorsing a 'poor sleep' questionnaire item at assessment, were offered a self-guided digital sleep intervention, Sleepio, in addition to routine care. Sleepio is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Propensity score matching established a non-Sleepio control group matched on demographic and baseline clinical measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients who signed up to Sleepio (n = 510) achieved significantly better outcomes on core clinical metrics (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WSAS) than controls. IAPT recovery rates1 (on PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were 64.7%, versus 58% in the control group. Duration of clinical contact time was marginally elevated overall in the Sleepio group but by less than 1 h CONCLUSIONS: Significant clinical benefit was associated with the introduction of an evidence-based digital sleep intervention alongside other mental health interventions for depression and anxiety. Widespread deployment was achieved with immediate availability, minimal additional clinical time or staff training. This approach provides a feasible and highly scalable model for improving mental health outcomes in clinical services."

            "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in many patients and causes high morbidity and mortality. Because TRD subjects are particularly difficult to study especially longitudinally, biological data remain very limited. In a preliminary study to judge feasibility and power, 25 TRD patients were referred from specialty psychiatric practices. All were severely and chronically depressed and mostly had comorbid psychiatric disorders as is typical in TRD. Nine patients were able to complete all required components of the protocol that included diagnostic interview; rating scales; clinical magnetic resonance imaging; medication washout; treatment with maximally tolerated olanzapine-fluoxetine combination for 8 weeks; and pre- and post-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This drug combination is an accepted standard of treatment for TRD. Dropouts arose from worsening depression, insomnia, and anxiety. One patient remitted; three responded. A priori regions of interest included the amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC; Brodmann area BA25). Responders showed decreased metabolism with treatment in the right amygdala that correlated with clinical response; no significant changes in BA25; better response to treatment the higher the baseline BA25 metabolism; and decreased right ventromedial prefrontal metabolism (VMPFC; broader than BA25) with treatment which did not correlate with depression scores. The baseline metabolism of all individuals showed heterogeneous patterns when compared to a normative metabolic database. Although preliminary given the sample size, this study highlights several issues important for future work: marked dropout rate in this study design; need for large sample size for adequate power; baseline metabolic heterogeneity of TRD requiring careful subject characterization for future studies of interventions; relationship of amygdala activity decreases with response; and the relationship between baseline sgACC and VMPFC activity with response. Successful treatment of TRD with olanzapine-fluoxetine combination shows changes in cerebral metabolism like those seen in treatment-responsive major depression."

            "abstract": "Understanding the nature and influence of specific risk profiles is increasingly important for health behavior promotion. The purpose of this article is to document the value of two factors-anxiety sensitivity (AS) and working memory capacity (WMC)-for enhancing risk for the initiation and/or maintenance of a range of negative health behaviors. AS is a distress-related risk factor that potentiates avoidance/coping motivations for negative health behaviors. Stress provides the conditions for negative somatic and affective states, and AS amplifies the aversiveness of these experiences and correspondingly hinders adaptive functioning. In contrast, low WMC is hypothesized to exert its effect by decreasing the capacity to filter out current temptations, attenuating a focus on longer-term goals and impairing the application of relevant coping skills at times of stress. In this review, we provide conceptual models for the separate roles of high AS and low WMC in negative health behaviors, review the influence of these factors on specific health behavior exemplars (eating behaviors/obesity, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and sleep promotion), provide preliminary evidence for their value as independent treatment targets for health-behavior promotion, and encourage specific research directions in relation to these variables."

Unfortunately, vast inter-individual differences in dose requirements complicate their effective and safe clinical use. Mechanisms underlying such differences are incompletely understood, are likely multifactorial, and include genetic and environmental contributions. While accumulating evidence suggests that variants of several genes account for some of the observed response variance, the relative contribution of these factors remains unknown. This study used a twin paradigm to provide a global estimate of the genetic and environmental contributions to inter-individual differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic opioid effects. Eighty one monozygotic and 31 dizygotic twin pairs successfully underwent a computer-controlled infusion with the μ-opioid agonist alfentanil in a single occasion, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study design. Pain sensitivity and analgesic effects were assessed with experimental heat and cold pressor pain models along with important covariates including demographic factors, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Significant heritability was detected for cold pressor pain tolerance and opioid-mediated elevations in heat and cold pressor pain thresholds. Genetic effects accounted for 12-60% of the observed response variance. Significant familial effects accounting for 24-32% of observed variance were detected for heat and cold pressor pain thresholds and opioid-mediated elevation in cold pressor pain tolerance. Significant covariates included age, gender, race, education, and anxiety. Results provide a strong rationale for more detailed molecular genetic studies to elucidate mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic opioid responses.

Treatment effectiveness research for sex addiction is currently underdeveloped, and interventions are generally based on the guidelines for treating other behavioral (as well as chemical) addictions. Consequently, there is a need to clinically evaluate tailored treatments that target the specific symptoms of sex addiction. It has been proposed that second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) may be an appropriate treatment for sex addiction because in addition to helping individuals increase perceptual distance from craving for desired objects and experiences, some SG-MBIs specifically contain meditations intended to undermine attachment to sex and/or the human body. The current study conducts the first clinical investigation into the utility of mindfulness for treating sex addiction. Case presentation An in-depth clinical case study was conducted involving an adult male suffering from sex addiction that underwent treatment utilizing an SG-MBI known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT). Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress. The MAT intervention also led to improvements in sleep quality, job satisfaction, and non-attachment to self and experiences. Salutary outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Discussion and conclusion The current study extends the literature exploring the applications of mindfulness for treating behavioral addiction, and findings indicate that further clinical investigation into the role of mindfulness for treating sex addiction is warranted."

Between March and August 2017, the discrete choice experiment was fielded to 403 treatment-experienced persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enrolled from 2 infectious diseases clinics in the southern United States and a national online panel. Participants completed 16 choice tasks, each comparing 3 treatment options. Preferences were analyzed using mixed and latent class logit models.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Most participants were male (68%) and older (interquartile range: 42-58 years), and had substantial treatment experience (interquartile range: 7-21 years). In mixed logit analyses, all attributes were associated with preferences. Side and long-term effects were most important, with evidence of substantial preference heterogeneity. Latent class analysis identified 5 preference classes. For classes 1 (40%), 2 (24%), and 3 (21%), side effects were most important, followed by long-term effects. For class 4 (10%), dosing was most important. Class 5 (4%) was largely indifferent to ART characteristics.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overall, treatment-experienced persons living with HIV valued minimizing side effects and long-term toxicities over dosing and administration characteristics. Preferences varied widely, highlighting the need to elicit individual patient preferences in models of shared antiretroviral decision making."

The recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Access to trained therapists, however, is limited. Rather than face-to-face CBT, several researchers have studied internet-delivered computerised CBT (ICBT). This paper describes the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate effectiveness and feasibility of our newly developed five-step ICBT as an adjunct to usual care (UC) compared with UC alone for patients with insomnia who remain symptomatic following hypnotics.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      This proposed exploratory RCT comprises two parallel groups (ICBT+UC and UC alone) consisting of 15 participants each (n=30) diagnosed with insomnia who remain symptomatic after pharmacotherapy. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of six intervention weeks. The primary outcome of insomnia severity will be the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at week 6. Secondary outcomes include sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency extracted from PSQI, current feeling of refreshment and perceived soundness of sleep measured using visual analogue scale, number of awakenings, anxiety by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, depression by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and quality of life by Euro Qol-5D.

Both conditions will be delivered online by a web platform. All participants allocated to the non-treatment control group will be offered ABM training once the study is complete. The primary outcome will be the attentional bias indices of vigilance and disengagement and self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep onset latency and pre-sleep cognitive arousal. Attentional bias and insomnia symptoms will be assessed at baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (2 days after the final training session: day 9). Insomnia symptoms will be again assessed at follow-up (day 16).

Although compensatory strategies are frequently suggested, no restorative interventions have yet been identified. This study examined the feasibility of EEG biofeedback (\"neurofeedback\") and its potential effectiveness in reducing PCCI as well as the fatigue, sleep disturbance, and psychological symptoms that frequently accompany PCCI.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      This was a 6-month prospective study with a waitlist control period followed by an active intervention.

Initially, the sample demonstrated significant dysfunction on all measures compared with general population norms. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed strongly significant improvements (P < .001) on all 4 cognitive measures (perceived cognitive impairment, comments from others, perceived cognitive abilities, and impact on quality of life [QOL]), the fatigue scale, and the 4 psychological scales (somatization, depression, anxiety and global severity index) as well as on 3 of 8 sleep scales (quality, daytime dysfunction, and global). Two of the other sleep scales (latency and disturbance) were significant at P < .01, and 1 (use of medication) at P < .05; 2 were not significant. Improvements were generally linear across the course of training, and were maintained at the follow-up testing. At the follow-up testing, the sample no longer differed significantly from normative populations on 3 of the 4 FACT-Cog measures (impairment, impact on QOL, and comments), FACIT-Fatigue, PSQI sleep quality and habitual efficiency, or any of the BSI-18 measures of psychological disturbance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Data from this limited study suggest that EEG biofeedback has potential for reducing the negative cognitive and emotional sequelae of cancer treatment as well as improving fatigue and sleep patterns."

An increasing body of evidence supports melatonin as the safest choice for children with NDDs. Benzodiazepines are not recommended in children and should only be used for transient insomnia, especially if daytime anxiety is present. Only few studies have been carried out in children's and adolescents' zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone, with contrasting results. Limited evidence supports the use of alpha-agonists such as clonidine to improve sleep onset latency, especially in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder subjects.

Pharmacological treatments did not demonstrate any effect on cognition compared with cognitive rehabilitation (CR). However, if CR programs offer promising results on cognition, they are less consistent concerning mood and quality of life (QoL). In this context, we designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative computerized CR program, conducted at home, on QoL. Secondary objectives will estimate the improvement, or the stabilization over time, of patients' cognitive performances and their emotional affects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty MS patients (relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive forms) who have cognitive impairment will be recruited for the trial (called SEPIA-NCT03471338) and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Patients randomly assigned in the experimental group will perform a home-based CR program with psychological support during eight consecutive weeks. CR will be based on computerized cognitive exercises from the PRESCO® software developed by HAPPYneuron©. Training sessions (three sessions of 45 min per week) will consist of short exercises evaluating a broad range of cognitive domains and will be personalized for each patient (tracking tool and supervised guidance). The control group, designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention, will receive only psychological support consisting of various issues related to MS, such as everyday cognitive-related difficulties or management of emotions. QoL, assessed by the MUSIQOL (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality Of Life) questionnaire, will be evaluated three times (at baseline and after 1 week and 25 weeks after home-based intervention) as well as secondary outcomes measuring self-esteem, cognition, depression, anxiety, metacognition, fatigue, and sleep quality.

Although the available antidepressants are effective and well tolerated, they also have many limitations. Therapeutic advances in developing a new drug's ultimate relation between MDD and chronobiology, which targets the circadian rhythm, led to a renewed focus on psychiatric disorders. In order to provide a critical analysis about antidepressant properties of agomelatine, a detailed PubMed (Medline), Scopus (Embase), Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and PsycInfo search was performed using the following keywords: melatonin analog, agomelatine, safety, efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, circadian rhythm, sleep disorders, neuroplasticity, MDD, bipolar disorder, anhedonia, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and mood disorders. Agomelatine is a unique melatonin analog with antidepressant properties and a large therapeutic index that improves clinical safety. Published articles revealed that agomelatine is a melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) agonist and 5HT2C receptor antagonist. The effects receptors' on melatonin receptors enable the resynchronization of irregular circadian rhythms with beneficial effects on sleep architectures. In this way, agomelatine is accredited for its unique mode of action, which helps to exert antidepressant effects and resynchronize the sleep-wake cycle. To sum up, an agomelatine has not only antidepressant properties but also has anxiolytic effects."

A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (sd) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome. These findings highlight the importance of planning for appropriate post-ICU care to diagnose and treat this population."

            "abstract": "Several hundred peer-reviewed studies in the past 20 years have shown that the relaxation response and mind-body interventions are clinically effective in the treatment of many health problems that are caused or made worse by stress. Recent studies show that mind-body interventions may improve prognosis in coronary heart disease and can enhance immune functioning. It is hypothesized that mind-body interventions reduce sympathetic nervous system activation and increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, and thereby restore homeostasis. Researchers have also concluded that cognitive therapy is as effective, and possibly more effective than antidepressant medication in the treatment of major depression. This report provides an overview of some studies that have shown a beneficial role of the relaxation response and cognitive restructuring in the treatment of headaches, insomnia, and cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date suggest that mind-body interventions are effective and can also provide cost savings in patient treatment. It is also clear, however, that mind-body therapies are not panaceas, and should be used in conjunction with standard medical care."

Previous studies investigating the neural underpinnings of OSAS failed to provide consistent results both on the cerebral substrates underlying cognitive deficits and on the effect of treatment on these anomalies. The aims of the study were a) to investigate whether never-treated OSA patients demonstrated differences in brain activation compared to healthy controls during a cognitive task; and b) to investigate whether any improvements in cognitive functioning found in OSA patients after treatment reflected a change in the underlying cerebral activity.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      OSA patients and healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning.

            "abstract": "Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia. However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the cognitive model of insomnia. Identification of modifiable mechanisms by which the treatment works may guide efforts to further improve the efficacy of insomnia treatment. The current study therefore has two aims: (1) to replicate the finding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to either online CBT for insomnia (n = 36) or a waiting-list control group (n = 27). Baseline and posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically significant effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures, sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors mediated the effects of treatment on insomnia severity and sleep efficiency. Together, these findings corroborate the efficacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for insomnia may specifically be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments."

The multi-faced character of AD requires new drug solutions based on substances that incorporate a wide range of activities. Antioxidants, AChE/BChE inhibitors, BACE1, or anti-amyloid platelet aggregation substances are most desirable because they improve cognition with minimal side effects. Plant secondary metabolites, used in traditional medicine and pharmacy, are promising. Among these are the monoterpenes-low-molecular compounds with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, analgesic, sedative, as well as other biological properties. The presented review focuses on the pathophysiology of AD and a selected group of anti-neurodegenerative monoterpenes and monoterpenoids for which possible mechanisms of action have been explained.

To date, the most thoroughly studied non-pharmacological approaches to managing FM are those with a focus on changing patient activities and beliefs that affect the illness. These interventions are intended to facilitate enduring improvement in pain and functional status. Lifestyle-oriented treatments include patient education, aerobic or other physical exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These interventions in FM can be delivered in medical or behavioral health care settings by trained professionals, through patient-oriented treatment manuals, or via remote-access technologies. Non-pharmacological treatments, in particular exercise and CBT, have yielded effect sizes and cost-benefit ratios comparable to medications. This paper describes lifestyle-oriented non-pharmacological treatments for FM and highlights selected literature reviews of these interventions. In addition, behavioral and practical issues are addressed that may affect these non-pharmacological treatments, including patient expectations, participant burden, and treatment availability. Recommendations are made to facilitate these interventions and potentially improve outcomes. In particular, the increasing availability of convenient home-based mobile technologies to deliver these non-pharmacological treatments is described."

While no particular evidence has been reported that describes the relationship between oxidative stress and the molecular mechanisms behind Parkinson's disease development, animal model studies has shown that oxidative stress induction could modulate Parkinson's disease symptomatology. Despite the inability to perfectly replicate human disease in animals and despite that Parkinson's disease has not been reported in any animal species, animal modeling is one of the most important tools in understanding the complex mechanisms of human disorders. In this way, this study is aimed at detailing this particular relationship and describing the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease in animal models, focusing on the potential advantages and disadvantages of zebrafish in this context. The information relevant to this topic was gathered using major scientific database research (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus) based on related keywords and inclusion criteria. Thus, it was observed that oxidative stress possesses an important role in Parkinson's disease as shown by numerous animal model studies, many of which are based on rodent experimental models. However, an emerging impact of the zebrafish model was observed in the research of Parkinson's disease pathological mechanisms with regard to disease development factors and the cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and comorbidities (such as depression, hyposmia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive deficits) and also with regard to the pharmacological potential of antioxidant molecules in Parkinson's disease treatment."

A self-administered, non-pharmacologic intervention such as Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) may be ideal in this population, but psycho-social characteristics (e.g., high depression rates) and cultural norms (e.g., suspicion of technology) necessitate a pilot study. We evaluated the effectiveness of Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) on insomnia severity, sleep quality, perceived stress, depression symptoms, and sleep aid use in Appalachian women ages 45 +.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      Forty-six women enrolled; 38 completed the six-week intervention in 2018 (mean age 55 years).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We employed a single group, pre/post-test, mixed-methods design.

The goal of this study was to characterize changes over time in the natural history of this syndrome in a large population. We reviewed the medical records of the 53 patients who were born prior to 2000 and seen at the Angelman Syndrome Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital to assess neurological, sleep, behavioral, gastrointestinal, orthopedic, and ophthalmologic functioning. The average age of this cohort was 24 years. Active seizures were present in 35%, nonepileptic myoclonus in 42%, and clinically significant tremors in 55%. Anxiety was present in 57%, increasing to 71% in those ages 26-43 years. In terms of sleep, 56% reported 8 hr of sleep or more, although 43% reported frequent nocturnal awakenings. Gastrointestinal issues remain problematic with 81% having constipation and 53% gastroesophageal reflux. The majority lived in a parent's home and remained independently mobile, though scoliosis was reportedly present in 30%, and 20% had reported low bone density/osteoporosis. The results of this study suggest that the prevalence of active seizures may decrease in adulthood but that the prevalence of movement disorders such as tremor and nonepileptic myoclonus may increase. Anxiety increases significantly as individuals age while defiant behaviors appear to decrease. Sleep dysfunction typically improves as compared to childhood but remains a significant issue for many adults. Other areas that require monitoring into adulthood include gastrointestinal dysfunction, and orthopedic/mobility issues, such as reported scoliosis and bone density, and ophthalmologic disorders."

CBT-I has been recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia; whether it is also effective for comorbidity of insomnia and depression is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of CBT-I for insomnia comorbid with depression. Data Sources. Seven electronic databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, China Science Technology Journal Database, SinoMed Database, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, as well as grey literature, were searched from the beginning of each database to July 1, 2019. Study Eligibility Criteria. Randomized controlled trials that compared CBT-I to no treatment or hypnotics (zopiclone, estazolam, and benzodiazepine agonist) for insomnia comorbid with depression and reported both insomnia scales and depression scales. Study Assessment and Synthesis Methods. Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook was used for evaluating the risk of bias of included studies. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Online GRADEpro was used to assess the quality of evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The pooled data showed that CBT-I was superior to no treatment for insomnia, while it was unsure whether CBT-I was better than no treatment for depression.

Using the concepts of whole/part relationships, level and emergent property, and self-regulation and disregulation, it is proposed that all behavioral therapies involve psychobiological processes, and therefore, indirectly impinge on physical health. It is argued that the distinction between behavior and biology is one of level, and, therefore, behavioral therapies are ultimately biobehavioral therapies having biobehavioral consequences. It is proposed that contrary to traditional reductionistic logic, modern advances in biology are providing strong justification for the importance of including psychological methods in treating diseases manifested at the biological level. Various clinical examples are used to demonstrate how systems theory can be applied to differential diagnosis and treatment, computing cost/benefit ratios of different treatments, and conducting comprehensive clinical research and evaluation. Assessing the interaction of biological, psychological, and social treatment modalities becomes the hallmark of responsible patient care. Implications of the systems conception of behavioral medicine for collaboration among health care providers, the training of future clinicians in different disciplines, and policy decisions regarding the larger social consequences of health care are considered."

A discriminant index score (based on reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and decreased sleep efficiency) was found to: 1) reliably discriminate between depressed inpatients, depressed outpatients, and controls; 2) show good test-retest reliability; and 3) identify a subset of depressed outpatients who were older, manifested a broader array of EEG sleep disturbances, and were less responsive to CBT or IPT. Posttreatment studies of patients indicated that normal sleep profiles were relatively stable, whereas abnormal profiles tended to normalize.

Despite the expanded research and application of OT services using telehealth (TH) to promote clients' health and well-being, studies on OT services using TH for cancer survivors are rare. This study aimed to review the TH approaches in the scope of OT and the outcome of factors affecting occupational engagement in adult cancer survivors. (2) Materials and Methods: This systematic review performed a literature search of five databases (Medline Complete, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science) using a combination of keywords and cross-referencing. Studies were included if they described a TH intervention within the scope of OT practice to improve occupational engagement. (3) Results: Fifteen studies (12 randomized controlled trials, three quasiexperimental studies) were reviewed. Physical activity had a positive effect on physical and cognitive function. Symptom self-management showed positive effects on the relief of symptom burden. Psychosocial interventions, which included cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, mind-body training, reduced sleep disturbance, and improved physical activity. Lifestyle behavior change interventions improved participation in moderate-intensity physical activity and diet quality. In addition, these interventions reduced cancer-related symptoms such as pain, depression, fatigue, distress, and improved quality of life.

Working in a combat zone is such a situation. Alternative means of improving sleep are clearly needed for Service Members. We report a case involving a medical provider who was serving in a military, emergency-services facility in Iraq, and who presented with anxiety, depressed mood, and insomnia. Symptoms were sub-threshold for major depressive disorder or acute stress disorder. Mood and anxiety symptoms responded to traditional therapy techniques, but problems with insomnia remained. The patient was given a portable biofeedback device that employs an infrared sensor photoplethysmograph to measure heart rate variability (HRV) from peripheral finger pulse. One week later, sleep was significantly improved. Symptom improvement lasted to at least 6 weeks while in theater. One year later, a check-in with the patient revealed that after returning home, he had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD symptoms had resolved after 6 months of psychopharmacology and cognitive behavioral therapy. These results indicate that biofeedback may be a useful means of improving sleep in a combat zone, but that such improvements may not necessarily prevent the development of more serious symptoms later.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Complex traumatic events associated with armed conflict, forcible displacement, childhood sexual abuse, and domestic violence are increasingly prevalent. People exposed to complex traumatic events are at risk of not only posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also other mental health comorbidities. Whereas evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatments are effective for single-event PTSD, it is not known if people who have experienced complex traumatic events can benefit and tolerate these commonly available treatments. Furthermore, it is not known which components of psychological interventions are most effective for managing PTSD in this population. We performed a systematic review and component network meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological interventions for managing mental health problems in people exposed to complex traumatic events.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of psychological and pharmacological treatments for PTSD symptoms in people exposed to complex traumatic events, published up to 25 October 2019. We adopted a nondiagnostic approach and included studies of adults who have experienced complex trauma. Complex-trauma subgroups included veterans; childhood sexual abuse; war-affected; refugees; and domestic violence. The primary outcome was reduction in PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, sleep quality, and positive and negative affect. We included 116 studies, of which 50 were conducted in hospital settings, 24 were delivered in community settings, seven were delivered in military clinics for veterans or active military personnel, five were conducted in refugee camps, four used remote delivery via web-based or telephone platforms, four were conducted in specialist trauma clinics, two were delivered in home settings, and two were delivered in primary care clinics; clinical setting was not reported in 17 studies. Ninety-four RCTs, for a total of 6,158 participants, were included in meta-analyses across the primary and secondary outcomes; 18 RCTs for a total of 933 participants were included in the component network meta-analysis. The mean age of participants in the included RCTs was 42.6 ± 9.3 years, and 42% were male. Nine non-RCTs were included. The mean age of participants in the non-RCTs was 40.6 ± 9.4 years, and 47% were male. The average length of follow-up across all included studies at posttreatment for the primary outcome was 11.5 weeks. The pairwise meta-analysis showed that psychological interventions reduce PTSD symptoms more than inactive control (k = 46; n = 3,389; standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.02 to -0.63) and active control (k-9; n = 662; SMD = -0.35, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.14) at posttreatment and also compared with inactive control at 6-month follow-up (k = 10; n = 738; SMD = -0.45, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.08). Psychological interventions reduced depressive symptoms (k = 31; n = 2,075; SMD = -0.87, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.63; I2 = 82.7%, p = 0.000) and anxiety (k = 15; n = 1,395; SMD = -1.03, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.61; p = 0.000) at posttreatment compared with inactive control. Sleep quality was significantly improved at posttreatment by psychological interventions compared with inactive control (k = 3; n = 111; SMD = -1.00, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.51; p = 0.245). There were no significant differences between psychological interventions and inactive control group at posttreatment for quality of life (k = 6; n = 401; SMD = 0.33, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.66; p = 0.021). Antipsychotic medicine (k = 5; n = 364; SMD = -0.45; -0.85 to -0.05; p = 0.085) and prazosin (k = 3; n = 110; SMD = -0.52; -1.03 to -0.02; p = 0.182) were effective in reducing PTSD symptoms. Phase-based psychological interventions that included skills-based strategies along with trauma-focused strategies were the most promising interventions for emotional dysregulation and interpersonal problems. Compared with pharmacological interventions, we observed that psychological interventions were associated with greater reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms and improved sleep quality. Sensitivity analysis showed that psychological interventions were acceptable with lower dropout, even in studies rated at low risk of attrition bias. Trauma-focused psychological interventions were superior to non-trauma-focused interventions across trauma subgroups for PTSD symptoms, but effects among veterans and war-affected populations were significantly reduced. The network meta-analysis showed that multicomponent interventions that included cognitive restructuring and imaginal exposure were the most effective for reducing PTSD symptoms (k = 17; n = 1,077; mean difference = -37.95, 95% CI -60.84 to -15.16). Our use of a non-diagnostic inclusion strategy may have overlooked certain complex-trauma populations with severe and enduring mental health comorbidities. Additionally, the relative contribution of skills-based intervention components was not feasibly evaluated in the network meta-analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we observed that trauma-focused psychological interventions are effective for managing mental health problems and comorbidities in people exposed to complex trauma. Multicomponent interventions, which can include phase-based approaches, were the most effective treatment package for managing PTSD in complex trauma. Establishing optimal ways to deliver multicomponent psychological interventions for people exposed to complex traumatic events is a research and clinical priority."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Nearly 30% of children are affected by chronic pain which puts a significant burden on the child's family and society with estimated cost of over $19.5 billion each year. Children and adolescent's quality of life is often impacted leading to physical disability, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, school stress or decreased performance, insomnia, and fatigue. The purposes of this paper are to: 1) provide an overview of chronic pain in children and adolescents; 2) describe findings from a quality improvement project that assessed the prevalence of negative mood, quality of life, functional disability, and coping with pain in teens with chronic pain, and 3) discuss screening, assessment and evidence-based management of co-morbid chronic pain and mental health problems in children and teens.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Findings for a quality improvement project indicated that 16.8% of the adolescents scored high risk for depression, which was higher than the national average. Approximately 57% of adolescents were screened as high risk on the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL™). One in four adolescents showed poor functioning on the Functional Disability Inventory and nearly one-third of the adolescents reported poor coping with pain on the Pain Coping Questionnaire. This project indicates that adolescents with chronic pain are at high risk for mental health problems. The outcomes suggest the mental health needs of adolescents with chronic pain need to be identified and addressed to help improve outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Children and youth with chronic pain need to be routinely screened and assessed for mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or CBT-skills building for children and youth with anxiety and depressive disorders has been widely studied and are helpful for children with chronic pain include psychoeducation, which helps the child to learn age and developmental specific information on chronic pain. Evidence-based manualized and internet-based CBT programs should be scaled rapidly to decrease depression and anxiety in children and youth with chronic pain."

            "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and other neuronal populations. The worldwide prevalence of PD is over 7 million and has been increasing more rapidly than many other neurodegenerative disorders. PD symptoms can be broadly divided into motor (slowness, stiffness, tremor) and non-motor symptoms (such as depression, dementia, psychosis, orthostatic hypotension). Patients can also have prodromal symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and constipation. The diagnosis of PD is mainly clinical, but dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Dopamine based therapies are used for the treatment of motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms are treated with other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (depression/anxiety), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (dementia), and atypical antipsychotics (psychosis). Patients with motor fluctuations or uncontrolled tremor, benefit from deep brain stimulation. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for uncontrolled motor fluctuations. Rehabilitative therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy are important during all stages of the disease. Management of PD is complex but there have been significant advancements in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms over the past few years. This review discusses the updates in the medical and surgical management of PD."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Poor sleep is common for children during cancer treatment, but there is limited understanding of the nature of children's sleep throughout the treatment trajectory. The current exploratory study used an explanatory sequential mixed method approach to examine quantitative associations among sleep problems in children with cancer, parental behavior, and children's sleep hygiene, with follow-up qualitative characterizations of children's sleep across cancer treatment stages.\n    \n\n\n          Procedure:\n        \n      \n      Eighty parents of children with cancer (aged 2-10 years; in active treatment, maintenance treatment, or off treatment) completed an online survey querying the child's sleep quality (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children-Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep subscale) and behaviors (Child Sleep Hygiene Scale) and sleep-related parenting behaviors (Parental Sleep Strategies). A subsample (n = 17 parents) participated in qualitative interviews to better characterize the processes of children's sleep and parents' sleep-related behaviors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Children's sleep quality, sleep hygiene, or parental sleep strategies were not significantly different by cancer treatment groups. Greater sleep disturbance in children was associated with their parents' tendency to accommodate the child's bedtime requests. Qualitatively, cancer treatment-related anxiety in both children and parents influence the onset of these disruptive sleep behaviors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Parents' sleep-related behaviors affect children's sleep during cancer treatment. Parents' accommodation may start during active treatment to alleviate cancer-related challenges, and these behaviors may continue into maintenance therapy and off treatment to reinforce sleep disturbance. Behavioral interventions targeting unhelpful parental behaviors may improve sleep in children with cancer during and after cancer treatment."

To date, there are no evidence-based interventions for reducing fatigue interference in metastatic breast cancer and other advanced cancer populations. In pilot studies, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown potential for reducing symptom-related suffering in cancer patients. The current Phase II trial seeks to more definitively examine the efficacy of telephone-based ACT for women with metastatic breast cancer who are experiencing fatigue interference. In this trial, 250 women are randomly assigned to either the ACT intervention or an education/support control condition. Women in both conditions attend six weekly 50-min telephone sessions. The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of telephone-based ACT on fatigue interference. Secondary outcomes include sleep interference, engagement in daily activities, and quality of life. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. This trial also examines whether increases in psychological flexibility, defined as full awareness of the present moment while persisting in behaviors aligned with personal values, account for the beneficial effect of ACT on fatigue interference. After demonstrating ACT's efficacy, the intervention can be widely disseminated to clinicians who care for metastatic breast cancer patients. Our findings will also inform future ACT trials with various cancer populations and functional outcomes."

In dementia, progressive memory loss means that abilities developed over a lifetime begin to be lost as well, contributing to the loss of self and identity. Some studies have reported that activities or interventions tailored to be meaningful to the person with dementia (defined as any activity important to the individual) are more effective in addressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and improving quality of life (QoL) than those that are not so tailored.

Thirty-four studies met the quality criteria and were included in a quantitative synthesis. A wide range of interventions were evaluated including individualized recreational activities (13 studies), reminiscence therapy (RT) (seven studies), music therapy interventions (six studies), training staff to develop individual care plans using person-centered care (PCC) or similar approaches (three studies), animal-assisted therapy (two studies), multi-sensory interventions (MSIs) (two studies) and social interaction (one study), all of which measured a number of different outcomes. Overall, and in spite of most studies being small-scale and of relatively brief duration, all interventions with the exception of Snoezelen therapy (a MSI) reported some benefits for people with dementia living in RACFs. The most frequently reported benefits were reductions in agitation (the most frequently assessed outcome), passivity and depression, improved QoL and increases in pleasure and interest. However, the majority of studies generally implemented the intervention, whether it was individualized activities, music or RT or other, in conjunction with one-to-one social interaction, and the relative importance of the intervention in comparison to one-to-one social contact for effectiveness cannot be determined from this review.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Providing meaningful or individualized tailored activities for people with dementia living in RACFs appears to be effective for a range of behavioral and psychological symptoms. The strongest evidence was for individualized activities/recreational interventions for a range of BPSD; preferred music for agitation, depression and anxiety; and RT for mood and cognitive functioning. Insufficient evidence precluded making recommendations regarding animal-assisted (dog) therapy and training staff to develop individual care plans using PCC or similar approaches, while there was no good quality evidence to show that Snoezelen was effective for any outcome. What remains unclear, however, is whether any of these interventions is more effective than the provision of one-to-one social interaction."

However, the relationship between the millisecond-precision spike timing required for STDP and the much slower timescales of behavioral learning is not well understood. Neuromodulation offers an attractive mechanism to connect these different timescales, and there is now strong experimental evidence that STDP is under neuromodulatory control by acetylcholine, monoamines, and other signaling molecules. Here, we review neuromodulation of STDP, the underlying mechanisms, functional implications, and possible involvement in brain disorders."

Randomized controlled trials have shown efficacy of self-help CBT-I, but unclear is whether excluding depressive patients boosted treatment effects.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We administered unsupported self-help CBT-I to insomnia patients with low and high depression levels. Based on the validated Centre of Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, the internet-recruited sample (N = 479) was divided into three groups: low depression scores (n = 198), mild depression scores (n = 182), and high depression scores (n = 99).

The only difference was that the high/mild depression groups had a steeper reduction in depression (d = 1.0-1.1; P < 0.001) and anxiety scores (d = 0.7-0.8; P < 0.001) than the low depression group (depression and anxiety: d = 0.3; P < 0.01), possibly due to floor effects in the latter group.

The analytic sample was restricted to the 2083 female respondents with complete data on dispositional mindfulness (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised) and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale). We determined the mean covariate-adjusted fatigue scores in each quartile of dispositional mindfulness. This relationship was examined in the overall sample and within subgroups defined by levels of four variables: depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, childhood adversity, and chronic medical conditions. The sample was 86% non-Hispanic White, and 61% had a bachelor's or more advanced degree. The mean (SD) Fatigue Severity Scale score was 3.3 (1.3). The adjusted mean fatigue score decreased significantly and in a graded manner across higher quartiles of mindfulness, with the adjusted fatigue score 1.4 points lower (95% confidence interval: -1.5, -1.2) among those in the highest quartile of dispositional mindfulness compared to the lowest. This significant graded relationship was present within each subgroup examined, and there was not a statistically significant interaction between dispositional mindfulness and any subgroup variable.

            "abstract": "Internet-administered cognitive behavior therapy is a promising new way to deliver psychological treatment. There are an increasing number of controlled trials in various fields such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders and health conditions such as headache and insomnia. Among the advantages for the field of cognitive behavior therapy is the dissemination of the treatment, being able to access treatment from a distance, and possibilities to tailor the interventions. To date, studies in which large effects have been obtained have included patient support from a clinician. Recent trials suggest that this support may come from non-clinicians and that therapist effects are minimal. Since studies also suggest that internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy can be equally effective as face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy, this is a finding that may have implications for CBT practitioners. However, there are other aspects to consider for implementation, as while clinicians may hold positive attitudes towards internet-delivered CBT a recent study suggested that patients are more skeptical and may prefer face-to-face treatment. In the present work, I argue that internet-delivered CBT may help to increase adherence to treatment protocols, that training can be facilitated by means of internet support, and that research on internet interventions can lead to new insights regarding what happens in regular CBT. Moreover, I conclude that internet-delivered CBT works best when support is provided, leaving an important role for clinicians who can incorporate internet treatment in their services. However, I also warn against disseminating internet-delivered CBT to patients for whom it is not suitable, and that clinical skills may suffer if clinicians are trained and practice mainly using the internet."

            "abstract": "Current pharmacological treatment of insomnia involves the use of sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs. Although benzodiazepines improve sleep, their multiple adverse effects hamper their application. Adverse effects include impairment of memory and cognitive functions, next-day hangover and dependence. Non-benzodiazepines are effective for initiating sleep but are not as effective as benzodiazepines for improving sleep quality or efficiency. Furthermore, their prolonged use produces adverse effects similar to those observed with benzodiazepines. Inasmuch as insomnia may be associated with decreased nocturnal melatonin, administration of melatonin is a strategy that has been increasingly used for treating insomnia. Melatonin can be effective for improving sleep quality without the adverse effects associated with hypnotic-sedatives. Ramelteon, a synthetic analog of melatonin which has a longer half life and a stronger affinity for MT1 and MT2 melatonergic receptors, has been reportedly effective for initiating and improving sleep in both adult and elderly insomniacs without showing hangover, dependence, or cognitive impairment. Insomnia is also a major complaint among patients suffering from depressive disorders and is often aggravated by conventional antidepressants especially the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, a dual action agent with affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and 5-HT2c antagonistic properties, constitutes a new approach to the treatment of major depressive disorders. Agomelatine ameliorates the symptoms of depression and improves the quality and efficiency of sleep. Taken together, the evidence indicates that MT1/MT2 receptor agonists like ramelteon or agomelatine may be valuable pharmacological tools for insomnia and for depression-associated insomnia."

Here, we summarized our previous studies to evaluate the potential of Qigong as a complementary and alternative therapy for CFS. Two randomized controlled trials were conducted (RCT1 n1=137, RCT2 n2=150). In both trials, extensive online questionnaires allowed individuals with CFS-like illness (i.e., symptoms match CFS, yet without clinical confirmation) to be identified. RCT1 included a 5-week intervention. The intervention in RCT2 was 8weeks.

Methods were slightly adjusted for RCT2, which replicated RCT1 findings, and further documented improved subjective sleep quality (P=0.008) and adiponectin levels (P<0.05). A significant dose-response relationship was founded. Thus, Qigong exercise should be recognized as a possible standalone therapy and self-management skill in CFS.

More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease.\n    \n\n\n          Observations:\n        \n      \n      Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses.

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in a decrease in the insomnia severity index by 4.3 points (95% CI: -7.1, -1.5; p = 0.017) compared to control. Total sleep time averaged 5.7 hours at baseline and increased by 20 minutes with internet-delivered therapy versus control (95% CI: 9, 31; p = 0.004). The severity of depression decreased by 2.3 points (95% CI: -2.9, -1.7; p = 0.013) in individuals who received internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy compared to control. Improvements in sleep efficiency, the insomnia severity index and depression scores with internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy were maintained from 4 to 48 weeks after post-treatment assessment. There were no statistically significant differences between sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and insomnia severity index for internet-delivered versus in-person therapy with a trained therapist.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In conclusion, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in improving sleep in adults with insomnia. Efforts should be made to educate the public and expand access to this therapy. Registration Number, Prospero: CRD42015017622."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The transition phase from inpatient to outpatient care for patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder represents a vulnerable period associated with a risk of depression worsening and suicide. Our group has recently found that the sleep-wake cycle in discharged depressive patients became irregular and exhibited a drift towards later hours, associated with worsening of depression. In contrast, an advancement of sleep phase has earlier been shown to have an antidepressant effect. Thus, methods to prevent drift of the sleep-wake cycle may be promising interventions to prevent or reduce worsening of depression after discharge.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this trial, we apply a new treatment intervention, named Circadian Reinforcement Therapy (CRT), to patients discharged from inpatient psychiatric wards. CRT consists of a specialized psychoeducation on the use of regular time signals (zeitgebers): daylight exposure, exercise, meals, and social contact. The aim is to supply stronger and correctly timed zeitgebers to the circadian system to prevent sleep drift and worsening of depression. The CRT is used in combination with an electronic self-monitoring system, the Monsenso Daybuilder System (MDB). By use of the MDB system, all patients self-monitor their sleep, depression level, and activity (from a Fitbit bracelet) daily. Participants can inspect all their data graphically on the MDB interface and will have clinician contact. The aim is to motivate patients to keep a stable sleep-wake cycle. In all, 130 patients referred to an outpatient service will be included. Depression rating is blinded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to a Standard group or a CRT group. The intervention period is 4 weeks covering the transition phase from inpatient to outpatient care. The primary outcome is score change in interviewer rated levels of depression on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. A subset of patients will be assessed with salivary Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) as a validator of circadian timing. The trial was initiated in 2016 and will end in 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If the described intervention is beneficial it could be incorporated into usual care algorithms for depressed patients to facilitate a better and safer transition to outpatient treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Posted prospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov at February 10, 2016 with identifier NCT02679768 ."

            "abstract": "As the internet has become popularized in recent years, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) has shifted from a face-to-face approach to delivery via the internet (internet-based CBT-i, ICBT-i). Several studies have investigated the effects of ICBT-i on comorbid anxiety and depression; however, the results remain inconclusive. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effects of ICBT-i on anxiety and depression. Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (throughout May 28, 2015), were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICBT-i. Data were extracted from the qualified studies and pooled together. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to assess the effects of ICBT-i on comorbid anxiety and depression. Nine records that included ten studies were ultimately qualified. The effect sizes (ESs) were -0.35 [-0.46, -0.25] for anxiety and -0.36 [-0.47, -0.26] for depression, which were stable using a between-group or within-group comparison and suggest positive effects of ICBT-i on both comorbid disorders. Although positive results were identified in this meta-analysis, additional high-quality studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Military personnel and frontline emergency workers may be exposed to events that have the potential to precipitate negative mental health outcomes such as depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Programmes have been designed to build psychological resilience before staff are deployed into the field. This review presents a synthesis of the literature on these \"pre-deployment resilience-building programmes\".\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of programmes that seek to build resilience to potentially traumatic events among military and frontline emergency service personnel prior to their deployment. These resilience programmes were compared to other interventions, treatment as usual or no intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      Studies were identified through searches of electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The initial search took place in January 2019, with an updated search completed at the end of September 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Only studies that used a randomised controlled trial (RCT)/cluster-RCT methodology were included. The programmes being evaluated must have sought to build resilience prior to exposure to trauma. Study participants must have been 18 years or older and be military personnel or frontline emergency workers.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Studies that met the inclusion criteria were assembled. Data extracted included methods, participants' details, intervention details, comparator details, and information on outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest were resilience, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and PTSD. Secondary outcomes of interest included acute stress disorder, depression, social support, coping skills, emotional flexibility, self-efficacy, social functioning, subjective levels of aggression, quality of sleep, quality of life and stress. Assessment of risk of bias was also completed. A total of 28 studies were included in a narrative synthesis of results.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      All 28 included studies compared an experimental resilience building intervention versus a control or no intervention. There was a wide range of therapeutic modalities used, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) informed programmes, biofeedback based programmes, stress-management programmes, mindfulness and relaxation programmes, neuropsychological-based programmes, and psychoeducational-informed programmes. The main outcomes are specified here, secondary outcomes such as depression, social support, coping skills, self-efficacy, subjective levels of aggression and stress are reported in text. No studies reported on the following pre-specified outcomes; acute stress disorder, emotional flexibility, social functioning, quality of sleep and quality of life. Resilience Eight studies reported resilience as an outcome. We narratively synthesised the data from these studies and our findings show that five of these interventions had success in building resilience in their respective samples. Two of the studies that reported significant results utilised a CBT approach to build resilience, while the other three successful programmes were mindfulness-based interventions. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress Our narrative synthesis of results included eight studies. Two of the eight studies produced significant reductions in symptoms of post traumatic stress compared to controls. These interventions used neuropsychological and biofeedback intervention models respectively. PTSD caseness Four studies reported PTSD caseness as an outcome. Our narrative synthesis of results suggests that evidence is mixed as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing clinical diagnosis of PTSD. One study of a neuropsychology-orientated Attention Bias Modification Training (AMBT) programme had success in reducing both symptoms of post-traumatic stress and numbers of participants receiving a diagnosis of PTSD. A stress-management programme reported that, when baseline differences in rates of pre-deployment mental health issues were controlled for, participants in the control condition were at 6.9 times the risk of a diagnosis of PTSD when compared to the intervention group. Given the diversity of intervention designs and theoretical orientations used (which included stress-management, neuropsychological and psychoeducational programmes), a definitive statement on the efficacy of pre-deployment programmes at reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and PTSD cannot be confidently offered.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While a number of evaluations of relevant programmes have been published, the quality of these evaluations limits our ability to determine if resilience-building programmes 'work' in terms of preventing negative outcomes such as depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and diagnoses of PTSD. Based on our findings we recommend that future research should: a) report pre-/post-means and standard deviation scores for scales used within respective studies, b) take the form of large, RCTs with protocols published in advance, and c) seek to measure defined psychological facets such as resilience, PTSD and stress, and measure these concepts using established psychometric tools. This will provide more certainty in future assessments of the evidence base. From a clinical implications point of view, overall there is mixed evidence that the interventions included in this review are effective at safe guarding military personnel or frontline emergency workers from experiencing negative mental health outcomes, including PTSD, following exposure to potentially traumatic events. Based on this, practitioners seeking to build resilience in their personnel need to be aware of the limitations of the evidence base. Practitioners should have modest expectations in relation to the efficacy of resilience-building programmes as a prophylactic approach to employment-related critical incident traumas."

            "abstract": "Leading causes in global health-related burden include stress, depression, anger, fatigue, insomnia, substance abuse, and increased suicidality. While all individuals are at risk, certain career fields such as military service are at an elevated risk. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is highly effective at treating mental health disorders but suffers from low compliance and high dropout rates in military environments. The current study conducted a randomized controlled trial with military personnel to assess outcomes for an asymptomatic group (n = 10) not receiving mental health treatment, a symptomatic group (n = 10) using a mHealth application capable of monitoring physiological stress via a commercial wearable alerting users to the presence of stress, guiding them through stress reduction techniques, and communicating information to providers, and a symptomatic control group (n = 10) of military personnel undergoing CBT. Fifty percent of symptomatic controls dropped out of CBT early and the group maintained baseline symptoms. In contrast, those who used the mHealth application completed therapy and showed a significant reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and anger. The results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of pairing data-driven mobile applications with CBT in vulnerable populations, leading to an improvement in therapy compliance and a reduction in symptoms compared to CBT treatment alone. Future work is focused on the inclusion of passive sensing modalities and the integration of additional data sources to provide better insights and inform clinical decisions to improve personalized support."

This data set included all acute-phase clinical trials that formed the basis of the New Drug Application (United States) or European Union submission package for duloxetine in the treatment of MDD. Two studies included continuation phases in which acute treatment responders received duloxetine or placebo for an additional 26 weeks. Safety assessments included serious adverse event reports, rates of discontinuation, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, changes in vital signs and laboratory values, and electrocardiograms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The rates of serious adverse events for duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients were 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (p = 0.282).

CBT was also superior to IRT on the GCTI (e.g., 'rehearsal and planning', d=0.62; 'sleep and sleeplessness', d=0.74). CBT vs. TAU comparisons yielded larger effects, whereas placebo effects (IRT vs. TAU) were small to moderate.

We examined this treatment gap for insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and comorbid symptoms in a sample of 622 young adult veterans through preference in symptom focus, treatment modality, and related gender differences among those screening positive for each problem. Data were collected from veteran drinkers recruited through targeted Facebook advertisements as part of a brief online alcohol intervention. Analyses demonstrated that veterans reported greater willingness to seek insomnia-focused treatment over PTSD- or depression-focused care. Notably, even when participants screened negative for insomnia, they preferred sleep-focused care to PTSD- or depression-focused care. Although one in five veterans with a positive screen would not consider care, veterans screening for both insomnia and PTSD who would consider care had a preference for in-person counseling, and those screening for both insomnia and depression had similar preferences for in-person and mobile app-based/computer self-help treatment. Marginal gender differences were found. Incorporating direct-to-consumer methods into research can help educate stakeholders about methods to expand EBPT access. Though traditional in-person counseling was often preferred, openness to app-based/computer interventions offers alternative methods to provide veterans with EBPTs."

Pain study has shifted away from focusing on the single mode of nociception to the multi-dimensional mode of sensory-affection-cognition. It is held early in traditional Chinese medicine that \"when there is a stoppage, there is a pain\" and a worsening disease Feb induce depression, which has already shown a multi-dimensional recognition about pain. Acupuncture therapy has been considered to be an effective adjuvant approach for relieving pain. In the present paper, the authors introduced applicability of acupuncture analgesia by modulating the abovementioned multi-dimensions of pain from the following 4 aspects:1) multi-dimensions of pain and related brain regions; 2) recognitions of traditional Chinese medicine about pain; 3) development of researches on acupuncture analgesia, including a) balancing activities of endogenous analgesic and algogenic substances, and triggering intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to reduce algesia, b) improving psychological symptoms of patients with depression, anxiety, insomnia, etc., c) modulating functional activities of some common brain regions (as hippocampus, anterior cingutate, frontal lobe of cerebral cortex, etc.) sharing both pain information and learning-memory processing. Hence, the authors hold that if the clinical study and application and experimental researches conducted on the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia extend towards the multi-dimensions of pain, a series of new concepts or thoughts will be brought out, thereby possibly opening a bright applicable prospect for acupuncture analgesia."

These statistically significant results were also reflected in clinically significant changes from pre- to follow-up-test.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      SWIS and WLC condition both improved in two mental health variables immediately after the training. These findings may be explained by unspecific treatment expectation effects in the WLC. Interestingly, most mental health outcomes showed significant improvements after 3 months, but not immediately after the training. These positive long-term effects of the SWIS training on mental health indicate that the transfer of strategies might simply need more time to affect the students' mental health.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      The current study was retrospectively registered at German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00014338 , registration date: 20.04.2018, enrolment of first participant: 14.04.2015)."

            "title": "Temporal organization as a therapeutic target.",
            "abstract": "Biological functions occur at many different frequencies, and each has its healthy and pathological ranges, patterns, and properties. Physiology, biochemistry, and behavior are not only organized at the morphological level in cells and organs, but separated or coordinated in time for minimal interference and optimal function. One of the most important temporal frameworks is that of the 24-hour day-night cycle, and its change in day length with season. Robust circadian rhythms are important for mental and physical well-being. Though rhythms have been long neglected as irrelevant (in spite of the high prevalence of sleep disorders in nearly every psychiatric illness), we now have tools to document rhythm disruption and, through better understanding of underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms, to develop therapeutic applications. Light as the major synchronizing agent of the biological clock is becoming a treatment option not only for winter depression but other, nonseasonal forms, as well as an adjunct in optimizing sleep-wake cycles, daytime alertness, cognition, and mood in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. Melatonin is the signal of darkness and promotes sleep onset. Manipulation of sleep (wake therapy, phase advance) has yielded the most rapid, nonpharmacological antidepressant effect known, and combinations (with light, medication) provide long-lasting response. Thus, by analogy, new molecules to augment synchronization or mimic changes occuring during night-time wakefulness may yield novel treatments. This issue on biological rhythms contains articles on a variety of different frequencies not included in the usual definition of chronobiology, but which open up interesting approaches to time and illness."

It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers.\n    \n\n\n          Trial design:\n        \n      \n      This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention and comparator:\n        \n      \n      Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet.

            "abstract": "Depression and insomnia commonly co-occur, resulting in greater morbidity for patients, and difficult diagnostic and treatment decisions for clinicians. When patients report symptoms of both depression and insomnia, it is common for medical practitioners to conceptualise the insomnia as a secondary symptom of depression. This implies that there is little purpose in treating insomnia directly, and that management of depression will improve both the depression and insomnia symptoms. In this review, we present an overview of research investigating the comorbidity and treatment approaches for patients presenting with depression and insomnia in primary care. Evidence shows that clinicians should avoid routinely conceptualising insomnia as a secondary symptom of depression. This is because insomnia symptoms: (i) often occur before mood decline and are independently associated with increased risk of future depression; (ii) commonly remain unchanged following depression treatment; and (iii) predict relapse of depression after treatment for depression only. Furthermore, compared with control, cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia improves symptoms of both depression and insomnia. It is critical that primary care clinicians dedicate specific diagnostic and treatment attention to the management of both depression (eg, psychotherapy, antidepressants) and insomnia (eg, cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia administered by trained therapists or psychologists through a mental health treatment plan referral, by online programs, or by a general practitioner or nurse) when they co-occur. These treatments may be offered concurrently or sequentially (eg, insomnia treatment followed by depression treatment, or vice versa), depending on presenting symptoms, history, lifestyle factors and other comorbidities."

Traditional face-to-face CBT is affected by factors such as location, time, and treatment cost, making the treatment impossible to implement effectively. With the continuous development of network technology, internet-based CBT (ICBT) has been widely used due to the advantages of time and location.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      It searched the China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) database (1979-Apr 2021), China Biomedical Literature Database (1994-Apr 2021), Cochrane Library (2005-Apr 2021), Medline (1948-Apr 2021), and Embase (Jan 1966-Apr 2021). Chinese and English databases were searched using the following terms: internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep problems, and sleep disorders. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata SE 12.0 software provided by the Cochrane collaboration.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 14 randomized controlled trials were included in this study. Of these, 10 described the correct random allocation method, 6 described the allocation scheme in detail, and 1 article used the blind method. Sleep onset latency after ICBT was much shorter than that of the control group [mean difference (MD): -12.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): -16.43 to -9.90, P<0.01]. Total sleep time after ICBT was much longer than that of the control group (MD: 38.67, 95% CI: 34.70-42.65, P<0.01). Sleep efficacy after ICBT was significantly higher in contrast with the control group (MD: 13.28, 95% CI: 10.49-16.06, P<0.01). Anxiety and depression levels after the ICBT were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Meta-analysis was adopted to confirm that ICBT can greatly improve the sleep parameters of patients with insomnia, and it was found to have a relieving effect on patients with anxiety and depression."

            "abstract": "Insomnia is highly prevalent among military veterans but access to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited. Thus, this study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of Insomnia Coach, a CBT-I-based, free, self-management mobile app. Fifty U.S. veterans, who were mostly male (58%) and mean age 44.5 (range = 28-55) years with moderate insomnia symptoms were randomized to Insomnia Coach (n = 25) or a wait-list control condition (n = 25) for 6 weeks. Participants completed self-report measures and sleep diaries at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up (12 weeks postrandomization), and app participants (n = 15) completed a qualitative interview at posttreatment. Findings suggest that Insomnia Coach is feasible to use, with three quarters of participants using the app through 6 weeks and engaging with active elements. For acceptability, perceptions of Insomnia Coach were very favorable based on both self-report and qualitative interview responses. Finally, for potential efficacy, at posttreatment, a larger proportion of Insomnia Coach (28%) than wait-list control participants (4%) achieved clinically significant improvement (p = .049) and there was a significant treatment effect on daytime sleep-related impairment (d = -0.6, p = .044). Additional treatment effects emerged at follow-up for insomnia severity (d = -1.1, p = .001), sleep onset latency (d = -0.6, p = .021), global sleep quality (d = -0.9, p = .002), and depression symptoms (d = -0.8, p = .012). These findings provide preliminary evidence that among veterans with moderate insomnia symptoms, a CBT-I-based self-management app is feasible, acceptable, and promising for improving insomnia severity and other sleep-related outcomes. Given the vast unmet need for insomnia treatment in the population, Insomnia Coach may provide an easily accessible, convenient public health intervention for individuals not receiving care."

The patients were evaluated using Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Visual Analogue Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. The psychoacoustic parameters of tinnitus, such as tinnitus frequency and loudness, and minimal masking levels, were determined. The patients were asked to select musical melodies that they liked. The tinnitus frequency of each patient was taken as the central frequency according to ANSI 2004. All sound files were prepared as stereo channels, with 16-bit resolution and 44,100 Hz sampling rate. The root mean square power value of the music and the band noise's average root mean square power value were equalized with the \"Amplification\" command, and 70% of the music and 30% of wide/narrow-band noise were mixed as a stereo channel by the \"Mix Paste\" command. The patients were instructed to listen to that individualized music/narrow-band noise (tinnitus signal) for 2 h during sleep for a duration of 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Tinnitus frequencies of the patients measured prior to treatment and at the second, fourth, and sixth months of follow-up were not significantly different. A statistically significant decrease was seen in tinnitus loudness, minimal masking levels, and residual inhibition during the follow-up. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores decreased significantly during follow-up, and the number of patients who complained of tinnitus decreased (p < 0.05). The Visual Analogue Scale scores significantly decreased during follow-up (p < 0.05). Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased significantly during follow-up (p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Stimulation of the auditory and limbic systems during sleep by the tinnitus signal combined with individualized musical melodies seems an alternative, effective, and cheap method in the treatment of tinnitus."

Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of \"big data\" (i.e., genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first decade of ENIGMA's activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors."

These symptoms are a severe burden for patients and caregivers and are difficult to treat partly due to comorbidities. Common sleep disorders in dementia are insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm alterations and aberrant nocturnal motor behavior. Sleep duration and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are reduced. The diagnostic assessment of sleep disorders should include an evaluation of the underlying risk factors and a detailed sleep history for which several assessment instruments are available. The therapy of sleep disorders of dementia is primarily nonpharmacological: sleep counseling, sleep hygiene regulation, relaxation and psychotherapy techniques are given priority. Pharmacological treatment often has severe side effects in this elderly, vulnerable population and can only be considered if other nonpharmacological options have been unsuccessful.

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Insomnia is prevalent among dialysis patients and affects their mortality. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is recommended, attending regular face-to-face CBTi sessions is a major challenge for patients. We evaluated the effectiveness of a self-directed computerized CBTi (cCBTi) in dialysis patients, and investigated changes in resting-state brain connectivity and inflammatory cytokines following cCBTi.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-five patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who had insomnia were screened for participation in the study, with 17 participants included in the final analyses. A self-directed cCBTi protocol accessed via tablet computer during dialysis or at home was developed and applied. Information about sleep, anxiety, depression, laboratory data, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was obtained 3-5 days before and after cCBTi.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      cCBTi improved sleep quality, and this was correlated with increased resting-state brain connectivity between the default-mode network and the premotor/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The decrement of interleukin-1β levels were correlated with improved sleep quality and increased brain connectivity after cCBTi.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our pilot study findings suggest that cCBTi is effective for dialysis patients with insomnia, and the therapeutic effects of cCBTi are related to changes in brain functional connectivity and inflammatory cytokines."

            "abstract": "Levodopa remains to be the mainstay for treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Long-term levodopa treatment bears a risk for developing levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). LID significantly overshadows patients' quality of life and therapeutic efficacy of levodopa. Pre- and post-synaptic changes in dopamine secretion and signaling, along with altered glutamate receptor expression and glutamatergic signaling in striatal neurons, and the resulting disinhibition-like changes in the corticostriatal circuitry, lead to aberrant activity of motor cortex and formation of LID. Research has highlighted the role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors especially the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) in formation of LID through potentiating of ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptors and dopamine D1/D5 receptors in direct pathway. Accordingly, MTEP and MPEP were the first mGlu5 receptor antagonists which were shown to attenuate LID in animal models through suppression of downstream signaling cascades involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and FosB/delta FosB activation, as well as modulation of prodynorphinegic, preproenkephalinergic, and GABA-ergic neurotransmission systems. Beneficial effects of other mGlu5 receptor antagonists such as AFQ056/mavoglurant and ADX48621/dipraglurant in amelioration of LID has been shown not only in animal models but also in clinical trials. Considering the presence of mGlu receptor dysregulation in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and depression, which are prodromal signs of PD, along with the neuroprotective effects of mGlu receptor antagonists, and their cognitive benefits, potential effectiveness of mGlu receptor antagonists in early prevention of PD remains to be investigated."

Sleep Medicine Reviews, 10, 215-245] propose a route into psychophysiological insomnia along the attention-intention-effort pathway which focuses on the inhibition of sleep-wake automaticity. A contributing factor to this is selective attention to sleep (alongside explicit intention to sleep and effort in the sleep engagement process). Following on from previous work on selective attention to sleep [Marchetti, L. M., Biello, S. M., Broomfield, N. M., MacMahon, K. M. A., & Espie, C. A. (2006). Who is pre-occupied with sleep?.

Attention bias for sleep related stimuli in primary insomnia and delayed sleep phase syndrome using the dot-probe task. Sleep, 29, 11] and considering the importance of monitoring both internal and external cues in the maintenance of insomnia, as highlighted in the cognitive model of insomnia [Harvey, A. G. (2002). A cognitive model of insomnia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 40, 869-893], a cognitive probe task was employed to investigate further the role of the clock as a focus of selective attention in those with primary insomnia. A 2 x 2 between participants design comparing reaction time of individuals with primary insomnia (n=22) and normal sleepers (n=22) on a modified Posner paradigm. Responses obtained from a computer task presenting times which fall within a normal sleep period were analysed. Individuals with primary insomnia demonstrated delayed disengagement to the clock (F(1,84)=6.9, p<0.05) which is taken as further support for previous research demonstrating that individuals with primary insomnia exhibit an attentional bias to sleep related stimuli. These results lend support to the attention-intention-effort model (Espie et al., 2006) and the cognitive model (Harvey, 2002) both of which recognise the importance of selective attention towards salient stimuli in the maintenance of insomnia. Possible clinical implications of attentional bias to sleep as a marker of psychopathology progression and treatment efficacy are discussed."

Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be efficacious in children and adolescents, it is generally recognized that availability and accessibility of CBT are limited.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a well-established treatment; however, the evidence is largely limited to homogenous samples. Although emerging research has indicated that CBT-I is also effective for comorbid insomnia, CBT-I has not been tested among a complex sample of older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression. Furthermore, no study has explored whether modifying CBT-I to target associated depressive symptoms could potentially enhance sleep and mood outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to report a protocol designed to test whether an advanced form of CBT for insomnia and depression (CBT-I-D) is more effective at reducing insomnia and depressive symptoms compared to a standard CBT-I and psychoeducation control group (PCG) for older adults in a community mental health setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      We aim to recruit 150 older adults with comorbid insomnia who have presented to community mental health services for depression. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated via block/cluster randomisation to one of three group therapy conditions: CBT-I, CBT-I-D, or PCG. Participants who receive CBT-I will only practice strategies designed to improve their sleep, whereas participants who receive CBT-I-D will practice additional strategies designed to also improve their mood. This trial will implement a mixed-methods design involving quantitative outcome measures and qualitative focus groups. The primary outcome measures are insomnia and depression severity, and secondary outcomes are anxiety, hopelessness, beliefs about sleep, comorbid sleep conditions, and health. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This CBT study protocol has been designed to address comorbid insomnia and depression for older adults receiving community mental health services. The proposed trial will determine whether CBT-I is more effective for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression compared to a PCG. It will also establish whether an advanced form of CBT-I-D generates greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to standard CBT-I.

Completers used the system on 86.5% of days they had the device, an average of 5.2 times a day. Approximately 62% of use of the FOCUS intervention was initiated by the participants, and 38% of use was in response to automated prompts. Baseline levels of cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, persecutory ideation, and reading level were not related to participants' use of the intervention. Approximately 90% of participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable and usable. Paired samples t tests found significant reductions in psychotic symptoms, depression, and general psychopathology, after 1 month of FOCUS use. This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the FOCUS intervention for schizophrenia and introduces a new treatment model which has promise for extending the reach of evidence-based care beyond the confines of a physical clinic using widely available technologies."

Ever since, the search for more effective, more specific and less toxic drugs continued, leading to a set of compounds currently in use against this devastating disease. Unfortunately, none of these medicines fulfill modern pharmaceutical requirements and may be considered as therapeutic ultima ratio due to the many, often severe side effects. Starting with a historic overview on drug development against HAT, we present a selection of trypanosome specific pathways and enzymes considered as highly potent druggable targets. In addition, we describe cellular mechanisms the parasite uses for differentiation and cell density regulation and present our considerations how interference with these steps, elementary for life cycle progression and infection, may lead to new aspects of drug development. Finally we refer to our recent work about CNS infection that offers novel insights in how trypanosomes hide in an immune privileged area to establish a chronic state of the disease, thereby considering new ways for drug application. Depressingly, HAT specific drug development has failed over the last 30 years to produce better suited medicine. However, unraveling of parasite-specific pathways and cellular behavior together with the ability to produce high resolution structures of essential parasite proteins by X-ray crystallography, leads us to the optimistic view that development of an ultimate drug to eradicate sleeping sickness from the globe might just be around the corner."

We identified 22 studies of group and individual-level interventions with most studies concerning grief processes within the first year. Nearly all studies evaluated emotional and psychological symptoms of loss and a small number evaluated the restoration of adaptive functioning. Four interventions addressed the treatment of complicated grief or grief with major depressive disorder. Qualitative studies explored themes of spirituality and mindfulness. There were 17 controlled studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials. Findings were eclectic, with evidence supporting mindfulness techniques in a group format for emotional and life satisfaction outcomes; an individual, function-based therapy addressing sleep to improve emotion and function; an individual, writing-based emotional expression therapy for short-term improvement in emotion and function; nortriptyline for the treatment of bereavement-related major depressive disorder; a group-based, complicated grief therapy for this condition; an internet-based CBT intervention for prolonged grief; and pharmacotherapy for cardiovascular changes during bereavement.

We noted moderate treatment effects on stress (Hedges'g=0.54), insomnia (g=0.70), and burnout (g=0.51) and small treatment effects on depression (g=0.30), anxiety (g=0.34), well-being (g=0.35), and mindfulness (g=0.42). The pooled effect on alcohol intake was small and nonsignificant. Conclusions Our results suggest that occupational e-mental health interventions are associated with significant health improvements. However, more research is required to understand which factors contribute to the variation in effectiveness of particular interventions depending on the mental health area and characteristics of participants and interventions."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of insomnia in multiple sclerosis patients with comorbid depression, associations between psychological symptoms, multiple sclerosis symptoms and insomnia, and to test effects of a 16-week protocol-based psychotherapy intervention for depression on insomnia symptoms. Participants with multiple sclerosis and depression (n = 127) were randomized to telephone administered cognitive behavioral therapy and telephone administered supportive emotion-focused therapy. Multiple sclerosis functional limitation was measured at baseline. Depression, insomnia, anxiety and quality of life were evaluated at pre treatment, mid treatment (8 weeks), and post treatment (16 weeks). Prevalence of insomnia ≥3 times per week was 78% at pre treatment and 43% at post treatment. Insomnia at baseline was associated with depression, multiple sclerosis related mood symptoms and anxiety. Middle of the night awakenings were associated with swallowing and speech problems. Improvements in insomnia were associated with improvement in depression and anxiety. Participants with residual insomnia were more likely to have major depressive disorder, greater multiple sclerosis severity, elevated anxiety and lower mental components of quality of life. Results demonstrate rates of insomnia in patients with comorbid multiple sclerosis and depression are higher than those reported in the general multiple sclerosis population and additional insomnia treatment is indicated beyond the treatment of comorbid psychological disorders."

The study aims to compare a single-session cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) workshop, self-help CBTI and sleep hygiene education (SHE) workshop among adults with insomnia in the community, in terms of insomnia severity, anxiety and depressive symptoms, the quality of life, treatment adherence and credibility.Participants: Two-hundred-and-ten Hong Kong adults with DSM-5 defined insomnia disorder for at least one month were recruited in the community.Methods: A three-arm-parallel, active-treatment-controlled and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was performed. Participants were block-randomized to the half-day CBTI workshop, self-help Internet-delivered CBTI and half-day SHE workshop groups evenly. Eight-week and 16-week post-baseline follow-ups were conducted. The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index whereas the secondary measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Short-Form Six-Dimension Health Survey, treatment adherence and credibility.Results: All arms demonstrated a significant treatment effect on insomnia severity, anxiety and depressive symptoms and the quality of life. However, there was no difference between arms. Treatment adherence did not vary among the three groups, but treatment credibility of the self-help group dropped whereas that of the CBTI workshop group rose after interventions (p = .037).Conclusions: Despite the lack of between-group differences, self-help CBTI can be considered as the preferred entry point of the stepped-care model for insomnia. It demonstrates comparable efficacy and adherence rate to the workshop-based interventions, and is highly accessible and convenient with few resources required."

Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between two common pro-inflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms namely, IL6-174 (rs1800795 G>C) and TNF-308 (rs1800629 G>A), and chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment (CACI) among Asian early-stage breast cancer patients. In addition, the differential effect of these SNPs on plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels, and the associations of plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels with CACI were also assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Asian early-stage breast cancer patients (Stage I to III) receiving chemotherapy were prospectively recruited from two cancer centers in Singapore.

Exercise is an efficacious intervention for depression among adults; however, few studies have examined the effect of exercise on postpartum depression. The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of exercise and wellness interventions on preventing postpartum depression among women at risk. Specifically, women (n = 450) who were on average 4.35 weeks postpartum and had a history of depression were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: (1) Telephone-based exercise intervention; (2) telephone-based wellness/support intervention (covered topics such as sleep, stress, and healthy eating); or (3) usual care. Both interventions lasted six months. The exercise intervention was based on social cognitive theory and the Transtheoretical model and was specifically designed to motivate postpartum women to exercise. The primary dependent variable was depression based on the Structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview (SCID). Secondary dependent variables included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, PHQ-9, and Perceived Stress Scale. Potential mediator variables included quality of sleep, postpartum social support, fatigue, and exercise attitudes. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, six, and nine months. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the methodology, study design, and baseline data for this study. This trial will provide important information regarding the efficacy of exercise and wellness interventions for preventing postpartum depression."

We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial involving 66 women with fibromyalgia eligible for the study at a university hospital setting. The patients were randomized into three groups (allocation ratio 1:1:1) using a computer-generated random numbers: a long-term interdisciplinary treatment group (LG, n = 22) that participated in 10 sessions (3-h once-weekly session for 10 weeks) of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) together with exercise training and other fibromyalgia related educational programs (two full days); a short-term interdisciplinary treatment group (SG, n = 22) that received two full days of educational, exercise, and CBT programs; and a control group (CG, n = 22). The patients were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after treatment using the visual analog scale (pain, fatigue, and sleep), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Short Form-36, tender point numbers, and pressure algometry as primary outcomes. The statistical analysis was confined to the 'per-protocol' set. No blinding was performed. The number of patients analyzed was 21 in the LG, 19 in the SG, and 19 in the CG. The intensity of pain (p < 0.001), severity of fatigue (p = 0.048), number of tender points (p = 0.002), and pressure pain threshold (p = 0.012) decreased significantly in both the LG and SG groups compared with controls. Moreover, physical functions (p = 0.017) and physical components of the HRQoL (p = 0.036) improved significantly in the intervention groups compared with the controls. However, there was no significant difference between intervention groups and the control group at the end of study in terms of quality of sleep (p = 0.055), severity of depressive symptoms (p = 0.696), and mental components of the HRQoL (p = 0.229). Finally, with the exception of the severity of fatigue and physical components of the HRQoL, there was no obvious significant difference between the efficacies of the two treatment approaches when compared with controls; the long-term treatment was found more effective in reducing pain than the short-term. Both, long- and short-term interdisciplinary treatments were effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms and disease activity in patients with fibromyalgia. The short-term program well meets the needs of women with fibromyalgia particularly in relation to pain and health status as measured using FIQ; however, a long-term program may be beneficial in reducing fatigue and improving physical function to a higher extent."

            "abstract": "Introduction: In March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Restrictive isolation measures have also brought psychological distress to the pediatric population. Building on the syndrome's characteristics, the present study explored the impact of lockdown on the clinical course of young people with PANDAS/PANS. The initial hypothesis considered both the reduced exposure to viral agents and the strategies of the parents and other containment actions as protective factors against the worsening of symptoms. Methods: One hundred and eight children, adolescents, and young adults were recruited according to the multicenter PANDAS/PANS research program. Parents participated in a web-based survey. Results: contrary to our hypothesis, the study results show an increase in symptoms during the block in 71% of the sample. Psychometric analyzes allowed us to exclude a relationship between the main symptoms of PANDAS and the increase in symptoms or the presence of symptoms before the block and their increase over time. The increase in symptoms is best explained by the presence of sleep disturbances and emotional lability. The exacerbation also appears to be linked to the onset of new symptoms in children and adolescents with depressed moods and eating problems. Furthermore, irritability and oppositionality are significant predictors of acute exacerbation. Equally statistically significant is the factor linked to the effects of pandemic stress, such as the fear of contracting the virus. No significant associations for symptom reduction have been identified between parental strategies or other parent-initiated actions, but the study demonstrates that caregiver perceived efficacy on the strategies used can reduce the risk of exacerbation. Conclusion: This preliminary study highlights the importance of studying the causes of increased symptoms in children with PANDAS/PANS. Life events can exacerbate the clinical condition or generate new symptoms in young patients. In particular, environmental, family, and social changes in the course of clinical symptoms in PANDAS/PANS patients should be investigated. It highlights the importance of emotional and behavioral management, which can be improved by enhancing coping strategies in young people with PANDAS/PANS and their caregivers through a combination treatment in which CBT and PMT are included, in line with guidelines. Limits: An experimental proxy-report questionnaire not yet standardized and validated on the PANS/PANDAS pediatric clinical sample was used for the exploratory study. There is also a small sample size (N = 108) and the absence of a control group (pre-lockdown or children without PANDAS/PANS). It would be interesting to evaluate the exact long-term dimensions to see the course of symptoms after covid and conduct a new study focusing on the impact of stressful events on the clinical course of the syndrome."

Most sleep training in toddlers requires contact with a trained professional, and requires a parent to ignore their child's cries, causing distress to many children and parents, increasing attrition and leaving families untreated and at risk. This case study reports success in significantly ameliorating sleep reluctance and bedtime fears in a sleep disturbed toddler with a history of trauma. It uses a novel use of bedtime behaviour management with some positive reinforcement techniques, called the Boss of My Sleep book: a non-cry, online (thus readily and cheaply available without a trained professional) sleep intervention.

Early evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the efficacy of face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for prenatal insomnia.

This RCT examined the efficacy internet-based digital CBTI in pregnant women with insomnia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Single-site RCT. A total of 91 pregnant women (29.03 ± 4.16 years) nearing/entering the third trimester who screened positive for clinical insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were randomized to digital CBTI or digital sleep education control. The ISI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale's Cognitive factor (PSAS-C) served as study outcomes, which were collected before treatment and after treatment during pregnancy, then six weeks after childbirth.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From pre to posttreatment, CBTI patients reported reductions in ISI (-4.91 points, p < 0.001) and PSQI (-2.98 points, p < 0.001) and increases in nightly sleep duration by 32 min (p = 0.008). Sleep symptoms did not change during pregnancy in the control group.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Late-life depression (LLD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in old age. It is associated with various adverse outcomes and frequent use of health care services thereby remaining a serious public health concern. Compared with depression in early adulthood, most treatment options of LLD are less effective. Psychotherapy may be particularly beneficial for LLD due to specific psychological conditions in old age and a low risk of side effects. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is highly established and effective in depression in young and mid-life there is only a limited number of small studies on CBT in LLD. An LLD-specific CBT has not yet been compared to an active, but unspecific supportive psychological intervention in a multicentre trial.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Here we present the design of the CBTlate trial, which is a multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, parallel group trial. CBTlate aims at including 248 patients with LLD of both genders at 7 sites in Germany. The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that a 15-session individually-delivered CBT specific for LLD is of superior efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression in comparison with a supportive unspecific intervention (SUI) of the same quantity. The intervention includes 8 weeks of individual treatment sessions twice per week and a follow-up period of 6 months after randomization. The primary end point is the severity of depression at the end of treatment measured by the self-rated 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Secondary endpoints include depressive symptoms at week 5 and at follow-up (6 months after randomization). Additional secondary endpoints include the change of depressive symptoms assessed with a clinician-rating-scale and a patient reported outcome instrument for major depressive disorder, anxiety symptoms, sleep, cognition, quality of life, and overall health status from baseline to end-of treatment and to end of follow-up. Add-on protocols include MRI and the collection of blood samples.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study is the first multicentre trial of a specific CBT intervention for LLD compared to an unspecific supportive psychological intervention administered in a specialist setting.

Participants were 24 individuals attending outpatient cognitive behavioral treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. Participants were assessed over a 3 week period. Outcomes included measures of anxiety (STAI-Y), sleep disturbances (PSQI), anger (STAEI), and subjective questions about the effectiveness of the device as a treatment adjunct. Significant reductions were found for anxiety and anger and for certain sleep variables (e.g. sleep latency). There was a significant dos-effect in that those who were more compliant had significantly greater reductions in most domains including sleep, anger and trait anxiety. Overall, participants found the device more helpful than other relaxation techniques such as mediation, yoga and unassisted breathing techniques but less helpful than exercise. The most frequently endorsed side effects were dizziness (15%) and sleepiness (55%). These preliminary results suggest that portable RSA biofeedback appears to be a promising treatment adjunct for disorders of autonomic arousal and is easily integrated into treatment.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to compile an up-to-date evaluation on the efficacy, adherence, acceptability and dropout rate of self-help CBT for insomnia. We systematically searched six key electronic databases up until May 2013. Two researchers independently selected relevant publications, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality according to the Cochrane criteria. Twenty randomized controlled trials were included; 10 of which were published after the last review up until January 2007. Meta-analysis of self-help CBT vs. waiting-list, routine care or no treatment was performed. Results showed that self-help CBT improved sleep, sleep-related cognitions and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Effect sizes for sleep-diary-derived sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset at immediate posttreatment were 0.80, 0.66, and 0.55, respectively. The average dropout rate of self-help CBT at immediate posttreatment was 14.5%, which was not significantly different from the 16.7% in therapist-administered CBT. Subgroup analyses supported the added benefit of telephone consultation. In conclusion, self-help CBT is efficacious and acceptable as an entry level of a stepped care model for insomnia.

This may be caused by the highly individualized treatment approach, by the fact that chatting forces both patients and therapists to adhere to the essence of the treatment goal, by increased feelings of privacy, autonomy, and a sense of felt responsibility for treatment. These hypotheses should be validated in future studies. So far, we can summarize that chat-based communication facilitates the treatment of patients who cannot or who do not want to attend FtF treatment."

The studies that have addressed brain morphometry in FMS have had very heterogeneous results. Thus, the question of which specific FMS symptoms and clinical features-pain, but also psychological distress, sleep-related problems, health status, and medication intake-impact on brain morphometry remains open. Here, we wanted to determine if brain changes in FMS are \"symptom-related\" more than \"diagnostic-related\". We performed an observational study of 46 premenopausal women (23 FMS patients and 23 age-matched healthy participants). Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation. We used multiple regression models to assess the associations between total and local brain volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we calculated associations between subcortical structures' shapes and volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Larger psychological distress, anxiety, and sleepiness, and higher analgesic consumption accounted for 38 % of FMS patients' smaller total gray matter volume (GMV). For both groups, local decrements of GMV in the medial orbitofrontal cortex were associated to larger psychological distress. Local increases of GMV were positively related to pain scores (superior frontal gyrus), psychological distress (cerebellum), anxiety (medial orbitofrontal cortex), and sleepiness (frontal superior medial cortex). FMS clinical characteristics were also associated to deformations in subcortical structures and volumes changes. This study reveals that total and local GMV changes in FMS go beyond the traditional \"pain matrix\" alterations. We demonstrated that brain morphology is altered by pain, but also by clinical characteristics that define the FMS experience."

            "abstract": "Common mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and other disorders, affect many people and incur increasing costs to individuals, employers, and government. Several challenges have been identified in the provision of public services for people with common mental health problems. A previous study by RAND Europe suggested that providing access to online mental health assessment and support and building on computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) interventions could help reach out to the general population and, in particular, those less likely to seek help elsewhere. This study explores online platforms and mobile applications that offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with mental health needs. Overall, this review shows that a variety of cCBT products exist which differ both in terms of the conditions products aim to address and the ways in which platforms are designed. The tools offer support through a varying number of modules (or lessons) clustered around specific issues that need to be addressed. The number of modules offered by the tools differs slightly by condition: platforms for anxiety disorders and insomnia are on average lengthier, with a median number of modules of 9 and 8 respectively, compared to those for depression in which the median is 6.5. The majority of tools use a linear structure and offer at least some additional guidance, although the intensity of this extra support is typically low."

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most studied nonpharmacological intervention and it has demonstrated efficacy in reducing late-life worry and anxiety. Although the evidence-base is smaller, yoga has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of these two nonpharmacological interventions. Further, the impact of patient preference on outcomes is unknown.Purpose: The purpose to this study is to compare the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with yoga for improving late-life worry, anxiety, and sleep.

The objective of this study was to characterize self-reported demographics, health characteristics, QOL, and health care utilization of Cannabis Users compared with Controls. Methods: A longitudinal, cross-sectional web-based survey study was completed between April 2016 and February 2018. Study participants (n=1276) were a convenience sample of either patients with a diagnosed health condition or caregivers of a patient with a diagnosed health condition registered with the Realm of Caring Foundation (a nonprofit organization dedicated to therapeutic cannabis research and education). Participants were invited through e-mail to complete follow-up assessments every 3 months with 33% of participants completing one or more prospective follow-ups. Assessments included self-reported demographics, health care utilization, medication use, pain, anxiety, depression, sleep, and QOL. Cannabis Users (n=808) were compared with Controls (n=468) using negative binomial regression and linear mixed effects models testing the effect of initiation, cessation, and maintenance of medicinal cannabis use. Results: Cannabis Users self-reported significantly better QOL [t(1054)=-4.19, p<0.001], greater health satisfaction [t(1045)=-4.14, p<0.001], improved sleep [children: t(224)=2.90, p<0.01; adults: [t(758)=3.03, p<0.01], lower average pain severity [t(1150)=2.34, p<0.05], lower anxiety [t(1151)=4.38, p<0.001], and lower depression [t(1210)=5.77, p<0.001] compared with Controls. Cannabis Users reported using fewer prescription medications (rate ratio [RR]=0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.96) and were less likely to have a past-month emergency department visit (RR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.44-0.84) or hospital admission (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.34-0.87). Controls who initiated cannabis use after baseline showed significant health improvements at follow-up, and the magnitude of improvement mirrored the between-group differences observed at baseline. Conclusions: Cannabis use was associated with improved health and QOL. Longitudinal testing suggests that group differences may be due to the medicinal use of cannabis. Although bias related to preexisting beliefs regarding the health benefits of cannabis in this sample should be considered, these findings indicate that clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of defined cannabinoid products for specific health conditions are warranted."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a respiratory condition characterized by interrupted sleep due to repeated, temporary collapse of the soft tissue of the upper airway that can lead to a cascade of physiological and psychological adverse health outcomes. The most common therapeutic interventions for OSA patients include the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which acts to keep the airway open and, as such, provides less interrupted and more restorative sleep. Improved sleep has been linked to more efficacious treatments for psychiatric conditions most notably those that include cognitive-behavioral elements, new learning, and memory consolidation. In the current study, we investigated the acquisition, inhibition, and extinction of conditioned fear in OSA patients, before and after CPAP therapy, using an established fear-potentiated startle paradigm. Patients with OSA displayed an intact ability to acquire, inhibit, and extinguish fear prior to CPAP treatment and this ability was significantly enhanced following CPAP usage. In addition, those patients with more severe OSA, as measured by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), were more likely to show improved fear inhibition and extinction. Lastly, we observed impairments in discrimination between reinforced and nonreinforced conditioned stimuli, in the inhibition of fear, and in fear extinction in a subset of patients with OSA and co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These data suggest that evolving treatment algorithms for PTSD should address disrupted sleep problems prior to initiation of inhibition/extinction-based exposure therapies."

The HS-Omega-3 Index(®) was not significantly associated with scores for anxiety, depression, or sleep, whether assessed as continuous or dichotomous variables, but was directly associated with CF and EF (P < 0.02 and 0.01, respectively), especially in the 81% who reported poor sleep quality. In those with poor sleep quality (n = 63), EF and CF were higher (P = 0.005) in subjects with Omega-3 levels above versus below the mean.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Optimal neurocognitive performance is essential during deployment. Our finding that EF and CF were positively related to HS-Omega-3 Index(®) suggests that improving omega-3 status through an increase in omega-3 intake may improve neurocognitive performance and confer an element of resilience to poor sleep."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Since the turn of the century, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has come into widespread use in medical and psychological treatment settings. It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an \"evidence-based\" practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research. It has been viewed or downloaded over 36,000 times, indicating widespread interest in this treatment modality. Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be \"moderate\" to \"large.\" Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow."

            "abstract": "Background and objective:\n        \n      \n      Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic."

Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) telephone-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week program of meditation and yoga); or ii) a telephone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      55 patients (age 54±12yrs) attended their assigned program (tMBSR, n=27; tSupport, n=28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: +6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P=0.01).

            "abstract": "Many of the currently available treatments for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) such as pharmacotherapy augmentation strategies, partial hospitalization programs, deep brain stimulation, and neurosurgery are efficacious for individuals suffering from more severe forms of these conditions. Unfortunately, the application of these treatments in milder forms of illness and subclinical samples, which affect a substantial portion of the population, is not justifiable by their costs (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy) and/or potential for side effects (serotonin-reuptake inhibitors associated sexual side effects). As such, there is an urgent need to develop simple yet effective treatments, such as modifiable lifestyle interventions, that can be employed on a broader scale. Here, we review the current state of evidence that supports or refutes the efficacy of lifestyle approaches for OCRDs. We focus on dimensions of lifestyle that are deemed important for cardiovascular diseases; namely, physical activity, stress, sleep, diet and eating behaviors, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Despite the relative scarcity of welldesigned randomized controlled trials targeting unhealthy life styles in OCRDs, we found meditation-based therapies and interventions focusing on eliminating sedentarism to be promising approaches. In the future, these strategies may represent valid alternative for subjects with subthreshold symptoms or at risk for OCRDs or other \"compulsive\" disorders."

            "abstract": "Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a functional deterioration of the fronto-temporo-parietal network of the right hemispheric vigilance system in narcolepsy and a therapeutic effect of modafinil. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA."

            "abstract": "One of the crucial purposes of treating alcohol-dependent patients is to enhance their ability to stay abstinent after detoxification therapy. Anxiety and stress vulnerability are the main factors provoking alcohol craving and relapse. In the first months of abstinence, alcohol-dependent patients frequently show sleep disturbances, irritability and depression, indicating chronic activation of stress pathways. In addition, the loss of confidence in interpersonal interactions results in social withdrawal and reduced willingness to participate in therapeutic programs.Current research shows that the peptide hormone oxytocin exerts substantial anxiolytic effects and facilitates prosocial behavior. Oxytocin can be safely applied as intranasal preparation. Oxytocin acts by inhibiting the effects of the corticotropin-releasing factor on GABAergic interneurons in the amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus.Recent research strongly suggests that application of oxytocin may beneficially influence the mechanisms of relapse and craving by reduction of anxiety, stress vulnerability and social withdrawal in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.This article reviews neurobiological mechanisms of oxytocin effects on stress-related pathways and discusses the potential use of oxytocin in the treatment of alcohol addiction."

The primary outcome was the pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory. Secondary outcomes included measures of pain severity, mental and physical health-related quality of life, pain acceptance, activity level, depression, pain-related anxiety, and sleep quality. In intent to treat analyses using mixed linear effects modeling, both groups exhibited significant improvements on primary and secondary outcomes, with the exception of sleep quality. Further, improvements in activity level at 6-month follow-up were significantly greater in the IP group. The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for the primary outcome and several secondary outcomes. Treatment satisfaction was similar between groups; however, significantly more participants withdrew during treatment in the VTC group compared with the IP group, which was moderated by activity level at baseline. These findings generally suggest that ACT delivered via VTC can be as effective and acceptable as IP delivery for chronic pain. Future studies should examine the optimal delivery of ACT for patients with chronic pain who report low levels of activity.

The objective of this study was to compare comorbidity and patient characteristics among patients having treatment for depression before and after implementation of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in a routine care internet treatment clinic. We hypothesized that insomnia comorbidity would be lower among patients having treatment for depression after the treatment for insomnia became available, and that depression levels would be high among patients in the insomnia treatment group compared to previous studies of insomnia. Patients were assessed face-to-face by physicians and guided through internet-delivered treatment by psychologists in a psychiatric setting. We retrieved patient data from 3 years before and 3 years after the CBT-I implementation. Measures were the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self rated (MADRS-S) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Pretreatment symptom levels were high in both the depression (MADRS-S = 23, n = 1467) and insomnia treatment (ISI = 20, n = 552) groups, indicating a true psychiatric sample. Contrary to the hypothesis, there were no significant changes in the group having treatment for depression regarding insomnia severity or comorbid insomnia diagnosis (from 66% to 68%) after CBT-I implementation. Also contrary to the hypothesis, comorbid depression levels among insomnia patients having CBT-I were similar to or slightly higher than in previous studies. It is likely that more patients with this comorbidity, who currently receive treatment for depression, would benefit from CBT-I. We suggest an emphasis on information on the benefits of CBT-I among patients and clinical staff involved in the implementation of treatments for insomnia in psychiatry, and further research into possible differences between patients actively seeking treatment for insomnia or depression."

It is characterized by motor symptoms such as excessive tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and non-motor symptoms include neuropsychiatric complications like anxiety, depression, insomnia and cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal complications. Treatment of anxiety in PD poses extensive challenge to global healthcare which makes it urgent to develop innovative treatment for the better management of the disease. The gold standard treatment by Levodopa provides symptomatic relief and its effect on neuropsychiatric complications like anxiety is elusive. Presence of anxiety worsens the condition and challenges therapeutic management of the PD. The in-depth analysis and understanding the molecular mechanism and pathophysiological pathways associated with the onset of anxiety in PD is essential. The disturbances in serotonergic, adrenergic and GABAergic neurons and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis play a significant role in the pathophysiology of anxiety. The drugs like Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines are useful in the management of anxiety but due to severe side effects and progression of the disease it results in the failure of treatment. The present review imparts an insight in the management of anxiety in PD by understanding molecular mechanism and application of alternative treatment options which can enlighten the perception of researchers towards better therapeutic management of the disease."

            "abstract": "Epilepsy, an ancient disease, is defined as an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are currently used as first-line treatment for patients with epilepsy; however, around 36% of patients are diagnosed with refractory epilepsy, which means two or more AEDs have been considered as failed after sufficiently correct usage. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the improvement of the efficacy of AEDs will be easily achieved, especially since no AEDs show efficacy in ceasing epileptogenesis. Consequently, several endogenous anticonvulsants attract investigators and epileptologists, such as galanin, cannabis, and adenosine. Astrogliosis is a neuropathological hallmark of epilepsy, whatever the etiology is, and astrogliosis is frequently associated with overexpression of adenosine kinase, which means downregulation of synaptic levels of adenosine. Consequently, adenosine is negatively regulated by adenosine kinase through the astrocyte-based cycle. On the other hand, focal adenosine augmentation therapy, using adenosine kinase inhibitor, has been proved to be effective for reducing seizures in both animal models and in vitro human brain tissue resected from a variety of etiology of refractory epilepsy patients. In addition to reducing seizures, adenosine augmentation therapy can also palliate co-morbidities, like sleep, cognition, or depression. Of importance, transgenic mice with reduced ADK were resistant to epileptogenesis induced by acute brain injury. In terms of translation, based on findings of adenosinerelated epileptogenic mechanisms, the application into clinical practice seems to be feasible by molecular strategies that have been already experimentally implemented, including gene and RNA interference. In the present review, we will focus on the evidence of ADK dysfunction in the epileptic brain from human beings and animals, and review the role of ADK inhibitor in adenosine augmentation therapy and the underlying mechanism of prevention of epileptogenesis."

However, these conditions can be challenging to treat concurrently using depression-specific therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia may be an appropriate treatment to improve both insomnia and depressive symptoms. We examined the effects of a fully-automated digital cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for insomnia (Sleepio) on insomnia and depressive symptoms, and the mediating role of sleep improvement on depressive symptoms in participants from two randomized controlled trials of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. We also explored potential moderators of intervention effects. All participants met criteria for probable insomnia disorder and had clinically significant depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 ≥ 10; n = 3,352). Individuals allocated to treatment in both trials were provided access to digital cognitive behavioural therapy. Digital cognitive behavioural therapy significantly improved insomnia (p < .001; g = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (p < .001; g = 0.48) at post-intervention (weeks 8-10), and increased the odds (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.34, 3.65) of clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10). Improvements in insomnia symptoms at mid-intervention mediated 87% of the effects on depressive symptoms at post-intervention. No variables moderated effectiveness outcomes, suggesting generalizability of these findings. Our results suggest that effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia extend to depressive symptoms in those with clinically significant depressive symptomatology. Insomnia may, therefore, be an important therapeutic target to assist management of depressive symptoms."

Ruminating on stress is etiologically implicated in both disorders, and ruminating while trying to fall asleep has been linked to insomnia and depression during pregnancy. Incompatible with rumination is everyday mindfulness, i.e., living with intentional and nonjudgmental awareness of internal and external experiences in the present moment. Responding to stress mindfully may protect against stress-related perinatal complications such as insomnia and depression.

Psychosocial interventions improve outcomes overall but are less effective for women than for men with MI, suggesting the need for different approaches. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based intervention that targets key psychosocial vulnerabilities in women including rumination (i.e., repetitive negative thinking) and low social support. This article describes the rationale and design of a multicenter randomized controlled trial to test the effects of telephone-delivered MBCT (MBCT-T) in women with MI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We plan to randomize 144 women reporting elevated perceived stress at least two months after MI to MBCT-T or enhanced usual care (EUC), which each involve eight weekly telephone sessions.

We will test the hypothesis that MBCT-T will be associated with greater 6-month improvements in perceived stress (primary outcome), disease-specific health status, quality of life, depression and anxiety symptoms, and actigraphy-based sleep quality (secondary outcomes) compared with EUC. Changes in mindfulness, rumination and perceived social support will be evaluated as potential mediators in exploratory analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      If found to be effective, this innovative, scalable intervention may be a promising secondary prevention strategy for women with MI experiencing elevated perceived stress."

Additionally, participants were assessed for past major depression, sleep related difficulties, a number of anxiety disorders, and suicide ideation. Moderation of the effectiveness of the early intervention program by these factors depended on the dependent variable of interest, specifically: the effectiveness of the intervention program on symptoms of depression was moderated by insomnia; symptoms of anxiety by past post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobia as well as sleep problems related to nightmares; and symptoms of general negative affect by social phobia and suicide ideation.

Inconsistent clinical and biomarker findings in patients with insomnia disorder suggest that heterogeneity exists and that subtypes of this disease remain unrecognised. Previous top-down proposed subtypes in nosologies have had insufficient validity. In this large-scale study, we aimed to reveal robust subtypes of insomnia disorder by use of data-driven analyses on a multidimensional set of biologically based traits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this series of studies, we recruited participants from the Netherlands Sleep Registry, a database of volunteers aged 18 years or older, who we followed up online to survey traits, sleep, life events, and health history with 34 selected questionnaires of which participants completed at least one. We identified insomnia disorder subtypes by use of latent class analyses. We evaluated the value of our identified subtypes of insomnia disorder by use of a second, non-overlapping cohort who were recruited through a newsletter that was emailed to a new sample of Netherlands Sleep Registry participants, and by assessment of within-subject stability over several years of follow-up. We extensively tested the clinical validity of these subtypes for the development of sleep complaints, comorbidities (including depression), and response to benzodiazepines; in two subtypes of insomnia disorder, we also assessed the clinical relevance of these subtypes by use of an electroencephalogram biomarker and the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy. To facilitate implementation, we subsequently constructed a concise subtype questionnaire and we validated this questionnaire in the second, non-overlapping cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      4322 Netherlands Sleep Registry participants completed at least one of the selected questionnaires, a demographic questionnaire, and an assessment of their Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) between March 2, 2010, and Oct 28, 2016. 2224 (51%) participants had probable insomnia disorder, defined as an ISI score of at least 10, and 2098 (49%) participants with a lower ISI score served as a control group. With a latent class analysis of the questionnaire responses of 2224 participants, we identified five novel insomnia disorder subtypes: highly distressed, moderately distressed but reward sensitive (ie, with intact responses to pleasurable emotions), moderately distressed and reward insensitive, slightly distressed with high reactivity (to their environment and life events), and slightly distressed with low reactivity. In a second, non-overlapping replication sample of 251 new participants who were assessed between June 12, 2017, and Nov 26, 2017, five subtypes were also identified to be optimal. In both the development sample and replication sample, each participant was classified as having only one subtype with high posterior probability (0·91-1·00). In 215 of the original sample of 2224 participants with insomnia who were reassessed 4·8 (SD 1·6) years later (between April 13, 2017, and June 21, 2017), the probability of maintaining their original subtype was 0·87, indicating a high stability of the classification. We found differences between the identified subtypes in developmental trajectories, response to treatment, the presence of an electroencephalogram biomarker, and the risk of depression that was up to five times different between groups, which indicated a clinical relevance of these subtypes.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      High-dimensional data-driven subtyping of people with insomnia has addressed an unmet need to reduce the heterogeneity of insomnia disorder.

            "abstract": "Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) are commonly characterized by unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioural profiles that emerge within specific stages in the developmental continuum. A plethora of studies have confirmed DS's relationship to premature aging and subsequent cognitive decline. Due to having three copies of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene which results in amyloid-beta plaque deposition, the cognitive decline often resembles the decline observed in Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, as individuals with DS mature in age (>40) they experience a dramatic increase in difficulties in several cognitive domains, such as language, visuo-spatial abilities, executive functions, working memory, etc. Especially, frontal functions are reported to show an inverse correlation with age. In contrast to the pronounced and well-described neuropsychological deficits, psychiatric symptoms presented by this patient category are not uniform. Mental health disturbances commonly include general anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or oppositional/aggressive behaviors, depression and sleep disorders, as well as self-injury and behavior belonging to autistic spectrum disorders. Therefore, the purpose of the present review is twofold. Our first goal is to depict the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of adults with DS and our second goal is to review the current treatment options available for the behavioral and psychological symptoms, with an emphasis put on the quality of evidence available through meta-analyses and appraising critically the anecdotal treatment often applied. We also present a review on the psychotropic medication, especially acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, that can potentially slow the progression of cognitive decline of those patients. Finally, novel therapeutic strategies, psychological interventions and future diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are discussed."

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the 'My Health too' CBT program-a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic-on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy.

            "abstract": "Increasing materialism in society is resulting in more wide spread nervous tension in all age groups. While some degree of nervous tension is necessary in everyday living, its adverse effects require that we must learn to bring it under control. Total tension is shown to have two components: a controllable element arising from factors in the environment and the inbuilt uncontrollable residue which is basic in the individual temperament. The effects of excessive or uncontrolled stress can be classified as 1) emotional reactions such as neurotic behaviour (anxiety hypochondria, hysteria, phobia, depression obsessions and compulsions) or psychotic behaviour and 2) psychosomatic reactions (nervous asthma, headache, insomnia, heart attack). Nervous energy can be wastefully expended by such factors as loss of temper, wrong attitudes to work, job frustration and marital strains. Relaxation is the only positive way to control undesirable nervous tension and its techniques require to be learned. A number of techniques (progressive relaxation, differential relaxation, hypnosis, the use of biofeedback, Yoga and Transcendental Meditation) are described and their application to dental practice is discussed."

            "abstract": "Emotion dysregulation frequently co-occurs with chronic pain, which in turn leads to heightened emotional and physical suffering. This cycle of association has prompted a recommendation for psychological treatment of chronic pain to target mechanisms for emotion regulation. The current trial addressed this need by investigating a new internet-delivered treatment incorporating emotional skills training from dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). Using a single-case experimental design that is suited to heterogeneous populations and can demonstrate efficacy with a small sample, three participants with chronic pain were recruited. Participants received four weeks of online DBT skills training (iDBT-Pain intervention) which incorporated one-on-one sessions over Zoom and a web app. Results revealed compelling evidence for the intervention on the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and were promising for the secondary outcome of pain intensity. Improvement was also identified on pre-and post-measures of depression, coping behaviors, sleep problems, wellbeing, and harm avoidance, indicating that the intervention may positively influence other factors related to chronic pain. Overall, the trial provides preliminary efficacy for the intervention to improve chronic pain. However, we recommend further investigation of the iDBT-Pain intervention, either in single case trials, which when conducted with scientific rigor may be aggregated to derive nomothetic conclusions, or in a group-comparison trial to compare with usual modes of treatment. PERSPECTIVE: This trial advances understanding of emotion-focused treatment for chronic pain and provides evidence for a viable new technological treatment. Importantly, as an internet-delivered approach, the iDBT-Pain intervention is accessible to those with restricted mobility and remote communities where there are often limited psychological services for people with chronic pain."

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of sleep bruxism (SB) has been recognized and described for centuries, including literary references to the gnashing of teeth. Early etiologic explanations were generally focused on mechanistic factors, but later, attention was focused on psychologic issues such as stress and anxiety; by the end of the 20th century, most opinions combined these two ideas. However, recently, the study of the SB phenomena has occurred primarily in sleep laboratories in which patients could be observed and monitored over several nights. Various other physiologic systems were also studied in sleep laboratories, including brain activity, muscle activity, cardiac function, and breathing. As a result of these studies, most authorities now consider SB to be a primarily sleep-related movement disorder, and specific diagnostic criteria have been established for the formal diagnosis of that condition. All of these changes in the understanding of the SB phenomena have led to a corresponding change in thinking about how oral appliances (OAs) might be used in the management of SB. Originally, they were thought to be a temporary measure that could help dentists analyze improper dental relationships. Unfortunately, this often led to dental procedures to \"improve\" these relationships, including equilibrations, orthodontics, bite opening, or even major restorative dentistry. However, it is now understood that the proper role for OAs is to protect the teeth and hopefully to diminish muscle activity during sleep. This paper reviews these evolutionary changes in the understanding of SB and how this affects concepts of designing and using OAs."

            "abstract": "The present article demonstrates the clinical application and the efficacy of relaxation techniques in general hospital psychiatry in Japan. During April to December 1993, 20 patients were treated with progressive muscle relaxation and \"modified' autogenic training therapies. The targeted symptoms were anxiety attacks (or panic attacks), neurotic insomnia, hyperventilation syndrome, agoraphobia, chronic pain, and distress. Most patients (18/20) improved rapidly with the use of these techniques and their excellence encourages increased use in general hospital psychiatry for the following reasons. First, physically ill patients are likely to show unexpected reactions to psychotropic medications. Second, some patients prefer these treatment methods rather than medications because they feel that they are participating voluntarily in their own treatment and also because they are fearful of being addicted to tranquilizers. Third, these treatments have produced rapid improvement especially for patients with panic attacks and/or hyperventilation. This study strongly suggests that progressive muscle relaxation and \"modified' autogenic training are simple and useful methods which can be easily employed in the clinical practice of general hospital psychiatry."

However, we are still at the beginning of answering the questions of how effective eMBPs are and for whom, and what kinds of delivery modes are the most efficient.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review aims to examine the feasibility and efficacy of eMBPs in improving the mental health and well-being of patients with cancer, to describe intervention characteristics and delivery modes of these programs, and to summarize the results of the included studies in terms of moderators, mediators, and predictors of efficacy, adherence, and attrition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In total, 4 databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) were searched using relevant search terms (eg, mindfulness, program, eHealth, neoplasm) and their variations. No restrictions were imposed on language or publication type. The results of the efficacy of eMBPs were synthesized through the summarizing effect estimates method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 29 published papers describing 24 original studies were included in this review. In general, the results indicate that eMBPs have the potential to reduce the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep problems, and pain, and improve the levels of mindfulness, posttraumatic growth, and some parameters of general health. The largest median of Cohen d effect sizes were observed in reducing anxiety and depression (within-subject: median -0.38, IQR -0.62 to -0.27; between-group: median -0.42, IQR -0.58 to -0.22) and facilitating posttraumatic growth (within-subject: median 0.42, IQR 0.35 to 0.48; between-group: median 0.32, IQR 0.22 to 0.39). The efficacy of eMBP may be comparable with that of parallel, face-to-face MBPs in some cases. All studies that evaluated the feasibility of eMBPs reported that they are feasible for patients with cancer. Potential moderators, mediators, and predictors of the efficacy, attrition, and adherence of eMBPs are discussed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although the effects of the reviewed studies were highly heterogeneous, the review provides evidence that eMBPs are an appropriate way for mindfulness practice to be delivered to patients with cancer. Thus far, existing eMBPs have mostly attempted to convert proven face-to-face mindfulness programs to the eHealth mode. They have not yet fully exploited the potential of eHealth technology."

However, most of these studies are retrospective and cross-sectional and employed small sample sizes and a mixture of SSRIs. In this 8-week open-label trial of sertraline in depressed patients (n = 31), depressed patients were administered 50mg sertraline at 8 am on the 1st day and subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 200mg/day. All patients underwent repeated video-polysomnography (vPSG) (baseline, 1st day, 14th day, 28th day, and 56th day). Both tonic (submental) and phasic (submental and anterior tibialis) RSWA events were visually counted. Tonic RSWA increased from 3.2 ± 1.8% at baseline to 5.1 ± 2.3% on the 1st day and 10.4 ± 2.7% on the 14th day; after that, measurements were stable until the 56th day. A similar profile was observed for phasic RSWA. The increases in tonic RSWA (r = 0.56, P = 0.004) and phasic RSWA (submental: r = -0.51, P = 0.02; anterior tibialis: r = 0.41, P = 0.04) were correlated with the degree of the prolonging of REM latency. All of RSWAs were not correlated with patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Sertraline may induce or exacerbate RSWA. In contrast to idiopathic RBD, sertraline-related RSWA had the specific characteristics of being correlated with the degree of the prolonging of REM latency and no predominance of male sex and elder age, suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms. The antidepressant-related RSWA should be a potential public health problem in the depressed patients."

Poor physical and mental health is costly to organisations, the National Health Service and society. Existing interventions aimed at reducing risk of mental ill health in this population are not very successful. More effective preventative interventions are urgently needed. We first conducted a large-scale prospective study of newly recruited student paramedics, identifying two cognitive factors (rumination and resilience appraisals) that predicted episodes of PTSD and MD over a 2-year period. We then developed internet-delivered cognitive training for resilience (iCT-R), a supported online intervention, to modify cognitive predictors.

Using a single-blinded waitlist control design, 50 participants with Parkinson's disease were recruited from the Brain & Mind Research Institute, Sydney, Australia. The intervention encompassed both psychoeducation and cognitive training; each component lasted 1-hour. The 2-hour sessions were delivered in a group format, twice-weekly over a 7-week period. Multifactorial psychoeducation was delivered by a range of health professionals. In addition to delivering cognitive strategies, it targeted depression, anxiety, sleep, vascular risk factors, diet, and exercise. Cognitive training was computer-based and was conducted by clinical neuropsychologists. The primary outcome was memory. Secondary outcomes included other aspects of cognition and knowledge pertaining to the psychoeducation material. Results demonstrated that cognitive training was associated with significant improvements in learning and memory corresponding to medium to large effect sizes. Treatment was also associated with medium effect size improvements in knowledge. Although the study was limited by the lack of randomized allocation to treatment and control groups, these findings suggest that a healthy brain ageing cognitive training program may be a viable tool to improve memory and/or slow cognitive decline in people with Parkinson's disease. It also appeared successful for increasing awareness of adaptive and/or compensatory cognitive strategies, as well as modifiable risk factors to optimize brain functioning."

            "abstract": "The application of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for neuronal stimulation is studied in different animal models and in humans, and has shown to improve cerebral metabolic activity and blood flow, and provide neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways. Recently, intranasal PBMT (i-PBMT) has become an attractive and potential method for the treatment of brain conditions. Herein, we provide a summary of different intranasal light delivery approaches including a nostril-based portable method and implanted deep-nasal methods for the effective systemic or direct irradiation of the brain. Nostril-based i-PBMT devices are available, using either lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), and can be applied either alone or in combination to transcranial devices (the latter applied directly to the scalp) to treat a wide range of brain conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, depression and anxiety as well as insomnia. Evidence shows that nostril-based i-PBMT improves blood rheology and cerebral blood flow, so that, without needing to puncture blood vessels, i-PBMT may have equivalent results to a peripheral intravenous laser irradiation procedure. Up to now, no studies were conducted to implant PBMT light sources deep within the nose in a clinical setting, but simulation studies suggest that deep-nasal PBMT via cribriform plate and sphenoid sinus might be an effective method to deliver light to the ventromedial part of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. Home-based i-PBMT, using inexpensive LED applicators, has potential as a novel approach for neurorehabilitation; comparative studies also testing sham, and transcranial PBMT are warranted."

The intervention was guided by a clinical psychologist and comprised a brief memory reminder, followed by Tetris gameplay with mental rotation, targeting one memory at a time in each session.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a single case study in Iceland with a woman in her 50s (drawn from an epidemiological study of trauma) with subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder and a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. The participant had four different intrusive memories from a traumatic event that happened in her childhood. The primary outcome was the change in the number of intrusive memories from baseline to intervention phase and to follow-ups. The number of intrusions was monitored in a daily diary for 4 weeks preintervention, 8 weeks during the intervention, and 1 week at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Intrusions were targeted one by one over six intervention sessions, creating four repetitions of an AB design (ie, length of baseline A and intervention phase B varied for each memory). We examined changes in both the total number of intrusions (summed across all four memories) and individually for each memory. In addition, we explored whether having fewer intrusive memories would have an impact on functioning, posttraumatic stress, and depression or anxiety symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total number of intrusions per week was 12.6 at baseline, 6.1 at the intervention phase (52% reduction from baseline), 3.0 at the 1-month follow-up (76% reduction), and 1.0 at the 3-month follow-up (92% reduction). Reductions in the symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression were observed postintervention. Sleep, concentration, stress, and functioning improved.

A cohort of 4686 individuals between the ages of 40 and 65 years free from any neurological or psychiatric diseases was established, and we collected extensive demographic, socio-economic information along with measures of self-perceived health and lifestyles (general health, physical activity, cognitive activity, socialization, sleep, nutrition and vital plan). Here we report on the baseline characteristics of the participants, and the results of the one-year follow-up evaluation. Participants were mainly women, highly educated, and with better lifestyles compared with the general population. After one year 60% of participants completed the one-year follow-up, and these were older, with higher educational level and with better lifestyles in some domains. In the absence of any specific interventions to-date, these participants showed small improvements in physical activity and sleep, but decreased adherence to a Mediterranean diet. These changes were negatively associated with baseline scores, and poorer habits at baseline were predictive of an improvement in lifestyle domains. Of the 2353 participants who completed the one-year follow-up, 73 had been diagnosed with new neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Changes in vital plan at follow-up, as well as gender, sleep quality and sense of coherence at baseline were shown to be significant risk factors for the onset of these diagnoses. Notably, gender risk factor decreased in importance as we adjusted by sleep habits, suggesting its potential mediator effects. These findings stress the importance of healthy lifestyles in sustaining brain health, and illustrate the individual benefit that can be derived from participation in longitudinal observational studies. Modifiable lifestyles, specifically quality of sleep, may partially mediate the effect of other risk factors in the development of some neuropsychiatric conditions."

Here, we confirmed whether DCS (100 mg) and VPA (400 mg) act in off-line learning processes during sleep or waking, for further clinical application to anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We performed a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 90 healthy adults. Visual cues and electric shocks were used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively. The extinction effect was observed not in simple recall after the extinction of coupled CS-US, but was observed in the post-re-exposure phase after unexpected re-exposure to reinstatement CS-US coupling. Newly acquired conditioned fear was also eliminated or habituated by DCS and VPA administration, in line with previous findings. Furthermore, VPA facilitated the off-line learning process of conditioned fear extinction and habituation during sleep, while DCS facilitated this process during waking. These novel findings suggest that DCS and VPA might enhance exposure-based cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders and PTSD by reducing the vulnerability to reinstatement and preventing relapses of fear-conditioned responses, and provide evidence for a peculiarity of the sleep-dependent off-line learning process for conditioned fear extinction.

Even if the pathophysiology of these disorders is complex, one of its defining signatures is behavioral and physiological over-arousal. Interestingly, arousal-related brain activity can be modulated by electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback (EEG NF), a non-pharmacological and non-invasive method that involves neurocognitive training through a brain-computer interface (BCI). EEG NF is characterized by a simultaneous learning process where both patient and computer are involved in modifying neuronal activity or connectivity, thereby improving associated symptoms of anxiety and/or over-arousal. Positive effects of EEG NF have been described for both anxiety disorders and PTSD, yet due to a number of methodological issues, it remains unclear whether symptom improvement is the direct result of neurophysiological changes targeted by EEG NF. Thus, in this work we sought to bridge current knowledge on brain mechanisms of arousal with past and present EEG NF therapies for anxiety and PTSD. In a nutshell, we discuss the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of EEG NF in anxiety disorder and PTSD, the methodological strengths/weaknesses of existing EEG NF randomized controlled trials for these disorders, and the neuropsychological factors that may impact NF training success."

            "abstract": "Work in the development and evaluation of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for cancer care has been underway for the last 20 years, and a growing body of literature now supports their efficacy. MBIs are particularly helpful in dealing with common experiences related to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship, including loss of control, uncertainty about the future, and fears of recurrence, as well as a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue. Our adaptation, mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), has resulted in improvements across a range of psychological and biological outcomes, including cortisol slopes, blood pressure, and telomere length, in various groups of cancer survivors. In this paper, I review the rationale for MBIs in cancer care and provide an overview of the state of the current literature, with a focus on results from three recent clinical trials conducted by our research group. These include a comparative efficacy trial comparing MBCR to supportive-expressive therapy in distressed breast cancer survivors, a non-inferiority trial comparing MBCR to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in cancer survivors with clinical insomnia, and an online adaptation of MBCR for rural and remote cancer survivors without access to in-person groups. I conclude by outlining work in progress and future directions for MBI research and applications in cancer care."

            "abstract": "Nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common clinical condition that has impacts at both the individual and societal level. Pain intensity is a primary outcome used in clinical practice to quantify the severity of CLBP and the efficacy of its treatment; however, pain is a subjective experience that is impacted by a multitude of factors. Moreover, differences in effect sizes for pain intensity are not observed between common conservative treatments, such as spinal manipulative therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and exercise training. As pain science evolves, the biopsychosocial model is gaining interest in its application for CLBP management. The aim of this article is to discuss our current scientific understanding of pain and present why additional factors should be considered in conservative CLBP management. In addition to pain intensity, we recommend that clinicians should consider assessing the multidimensional nature of CLBP by including physical (disability, muscular strength and endurance, performance in activities of daily living, and body composition), psychological (kinesiophobia, fear-avoidance, pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality), social (social functioning and work absenteeism), and health-related quality-of-life measures, depending on what is deemed relevant for each individual. This review also provides practical recommendations to clinicians for the assessment of outcomes beyond pain intensity, including information on how large a change must be for it to be considered \"real\" in an individual patient. This information can guide treatment selection when working with an individual with CLBP."

Adult patients (N = 178, mean age = 44.8, 67% females) with insomnia were randomized to either ICBTi (N = 92; morning persons = 41; evening persons = 51) or a web-based patient education condition (N = 86; morning persons = 44; evening persons = 42). All patients were assessed with sleep diaries, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ). Patients were characterized as morning or evening persons based on a median split on the Horne-Östberg Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire. Short and long-term effects of treatment were examined with mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Morning and evening persons did not differ in terms of age, gender or educational status. At baseline, morning persons had more wake time after sleep onset (d= 0.54, p < .001) and more early morning awakening (d= 0.38, p < .05) compared to evening persons, while evening persons reported longer sleep onset latency (d= 0.60, p < .001), more time in bed (d= 0.56, p < .001), longer total sleep time (d= 0.45, p < .01), more fatigue (d= 0.31, p < .05) and more dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep (d= 0.47, p < .01). Despite these differences at baseline, both morning and evening persons receiving ICBTi benefitted more across most measures compared to morning and evening persons who received patient education. For morning persons in the ICBTi group, ISI scores were reduced from 17.3 at baseline to 8.8 (dpre-post = 2.48, p < .001) at post-assessment, and to 10.0 at 18-month follow up (dpre-post18m = 2.13, p < .001). Comparable results were found for evening persons in the ICBTi group, with a reduction in ISI scores from 17.4 at baseline to 8.6 (dpre-post = 2.24, p < .001) at post-assessment, and to 8.7 at 18-month follow up (dpre-post18m = 2.19, p < .001). Similar results were found on the BIS, DBAS, HADS, CFQ and sleep diary data. Despite different insomnia symptomatology between the two groups, the current study suggests that ICBTi is effective across scores on the morningness-eveningness dimension.

Previous studies report that computerized health interventions can be effective. However, treatment adherence is still an issue. Reminders are a simple technique that could improve adherence. A minimal intervention prototype in the realm of sleep treatment was developed to test the effects of reminders on adherence. Two prominent ways to determine the reminder-time are: a) ask users when they want to be reminded, and b) let an algorithm decide when to remind users. The prototype consisted of a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise and reminders. A within subject design was used in which the effect of reminders and two underlying principles were tested by 45 participants that all received the following three different conditions (in random order): a) event-based reminders b) time-based reminders c) no reminders. Both types of reminders improved adherence compared to no reminders. No differences were found between the two types of reminders. Opportunity and self-empowerment could partly mediate adherence to filling out the sleep diary, but not to the number of relaxation exercises conducted. Although the study focussed on CBT-I, we expect that designers of other computerized health interventions benefit from the tested opportunity and self-empowerment principles for reminders to improve adherence, as well.\n"

Domperidone may also be available from some compounding pharmacies and via the internet in the US. The quality of such products cannot be assured, and the FDA has warned against their use.[1]\n    \n\n      \n      Data available from 4 small studies on the excretion of domperidone into breastmilk are somewhat inconsistent, but infants would probably receive less than 0.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, even at high maternal doses. No adverse effects have been found in a limited number of published cases of breastfed infants whose mothers were taking domperidone.\n    \n\n      \n      Domperidone is sometimes used as a galactogogue to increase milk supply.[2,3] and has been used in induced lactation by adoptive and transgender women.[4-9] Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[10,11] Most mothers who are provided instruction in good breastfeeding technique and breastfeed frequently are unlikely to obtain much additional benefit from domperidone. Several meta-analyses of domperidone use as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants concluded that domperidone can increase milk production acutely in the range of 90 to 94 mL daily.[3,12,13] Other reviewers concluded that improvement of breastfeeding practices seems more effective and safer than off-label use of domperidone.[14,15] One retrospective study found that breastmilk feeding rates at discharge remained consistently lower in very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) infants of women dispensed domperidone than those who were not prescribed domperidone.[16]\n    \n\n      \n      Domperidone has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply. Most published studies have used domperidone in a dosage of 10 mg 3 times daily for 4 to 10 days. Two small studies found no statistically significant additional increase in milk output with a dosage of 20 mg 3 times daily compared to a dosage of 10 mg 3 times and that women who failed to respond to the low dosage did not respond to the higher dosage.[17,18] Dosages greater than 30 mg daily may increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients receiving domperidone,[19] although some feel that the risk is less in nursing mothers because of their relatively younger age.[20] Large database retrospective cohort studies in Canada found an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, but some confounders make the results subject to question.[21,22] In one case, domperidone use uncovered congenital long QT syndrome in a woman who developed loss of consciousness, behavioral arrest, and jerking while taking domperidone.[23] Mothers with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should not receive domperidone and all mothers should be advised to stop taking domperidone and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of an abnormal heart rate or rhythm while taking domperidone, including dizziness, palpitations, syncope or seizures.[19]\n    \n\n      \n      Maternal side effects of domperidone reported in galactogogue studies and cases reported to the FDA include dry mouth, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, palpitations malaise, and shortness of breath. Some of these were more frequent with dosages greater than with 30 mg daily.[17,18,24-26] Surveys of women taking domperidone for lactation enhancement found gastrointestinal symptoms, breast engorgement, weight gain, headache, dizziness, irritability, dry mouth and fatigue were the most common side effects reported.[27-29] One mother taking domperidone 20 mg three times daily as a galactogogue for feeding her adoptive daughter developed obsessional thoughts with adjustment disorder. This manifested as thoughts of killing her daughter. Stopping domperidone and instituting duloxetine therapy resulted in remission over a 10-month period.[30]\n    \n\n      \n      Canadian health authorities found an association between the abrupt discontinuation or tapering of domperidone used for lactation stimulation and the development of psychiatric adverse events.[31] Canadian labeling warns against use of domperidone doses greater than 30 mg daily for longer than 4 weeks. Drug withdrawal symptoms consisting of insomnia, anxiety, and tachycardia were reported in a woman taking 80 mg of domperidone daily for 8 months as a galactogogue who abruptly tapered the dosage over 3 days.[32] Another mother took domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 10 months as a galactagogue and stopped abruptly. After discontinuation, she experienced severe insomnia, severe anxiety, severe cognitive problems and depression.[33] A third postpartum woman began domperidone 90 mg daily, increasing to 160 mg daily to increase her milk supply. Because her milk supply did not improve, she stopped nursing at 14 weeks and began to taper the domperidone dosage by 10 mg every 3 to 4 days. Seven days after discontinuing domperidone, she began experiencing insomnia, rigors, severe psychomotor agitation, and panic attacks. She restarted the drug at 90 mg daily and tapered the dose by 10 mg daily each week. At a dose of 20 mg daily, the same symptoms recurred. She required sertraline, clonazepam and reinstitution of domperidone at 40 mg daily, slowly tapering the dose over 8 weeks. Three months were required to fully resolve her symptoms.[34] In a fourth case, a mother took domperidone 20 mg four times daily for 9 months to stimulate breastmilk production. She stopped breastfeeding and domperidone at that time. Two weeks later, she presented with insomnia, anxiety, nausea, headaches and palpitations. The drug was restarted at a dosage of 20 mg three times daily and began to taper the daily dosage by 10 mg every week, but after one week she complained of insomnia. Tapering was reduced to 5 mg every week, but whenever she stopped the drug, symptoms returned. She was able to discontinue domperidone after tapering the daily dosage by 2.5 mg weekly over 10 months.[35] A fifth case of a mother with a history of bipolar disorder and major depression developed severe anxiety, a recurrence of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder 6 days after abruptly discontinuing domperidone 120 mg daily that she was taking as a galactogogue. Three days later, she restarted domperidone 120 mg daily and tapered her daily dose by 10 mg at weekly intervals. She took no other medications. Two weeks after discontinuing domperidone, she had signs of only mild mood disorder.[36] Three patients were reported to have severe symptoms of withdrawal (depression, reemergence of obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, loss of libido, lack of energy, suicidality, hot flashes, night sweats, hair thinning, and dry eyes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite) after stopping domperidone as a galactogogue. Dosages ranged from 90 to 150 mg daily for 5 to 32 weeks. Dosages required a slow hyperbolic tapering over a period of several months to fully discontinue the drug.[37]"

The primary outcome was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and secondary outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), each administered at baseline and weekly thereafter. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that ICBT-I produced statistically significant pre- to post- reductions in symptoms of insomnia, yielding within-group effects of d = 0.82 suggesting a potential for improved outcomes. Similar improvements were seen across secondary outcomes, with small-to-medium post-treatment within-group effects observed: depression (d = 0.63), anxiety (d = 0.39), and functional impairment (d = 0.31). These findings are supportive of the intervention's potential effectiveness and speak to the importance of several implementation factors that could enhance the effects of the intervention. The results contribute to the growing evidence base for digital interventions designed to help those with sleep difficulties and will inform the design of a future controlled evaluation of ICBT-I under routine clinical settings."

Many patients experience adjustment problems, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression and sleep problems, contributing to high healthcare costs. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) has shown to support patients with somatic conditions in coping with their disease, with therapist-guided iCBT usually showing larger effects than unguided iCBT. However, the specific relevance of guided iCBT for rheumatic conditions has not been reviewed yet, which could have important implications for implementation.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective of our review was to give an overview of evaluations of guided iCBT for rheumatic conditions, including physical, psychological, and impact on daily life outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This review is registered with PROSPERO with registration number CRD42020154911.

Inclusion criteria were: patients ≥18 years old with a rheumatic condition, randomized controlled trial, accessible full-text English article, original data, inclusion of psychological, and/or physical and/or impact outcomes, and therapist-guided iCBT. Study and sample characteristics, as well as clinical variables were extracted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search identified 6089 studies, of which 8 trials were included, comprising of 1707 participants in total.

Whilst cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches have been shown to be effective, not all patients benefit from psychological or psychologically anchored multimodal therapies. Determinants of tinnitus-related distress thus provide valuable information about tinnitus characterization and therapy planning.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The study aimed to develop machine learning models that use variables (or \"features\") obtained before treatment to characterize patients' tinnitus-related distress status after treatment. Whilst initially all available variables were considered for model training, the final model was required to achieve highest predictive performance using only a small number of features.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      1,416 tinnitus patients (decompensated tinnitus: 32%) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing tinnitus-specific components, CBT, physiotherapy and informational counseling were included in the analysis. At baseline, patients were assessed using 205 features from 10 questionnaires comprising sociodemographic and clinical information. A data-driven workflow was developed consisting of (a) an initial exploratory correlation analysis, (b) supervised machine learning to predict tinnitus-related distress after treatment (T1) using baseline data only (T0), and (c) post-hoc analysis of the best model to facilitate model inspection and understanding. Classification methods were embedded in a feature elimination wrapper that iteratively learned on features found to be important for the model in the preceding iteration, in order to keep the performance stable while successively reducing the model complexity. 10-fold cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC) as performance measure was implemented for model generalization error estimation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The best machine learning classifier (gradient boosted trees) can predict tinnitus-related distress in T1 with AUC = 0.890 using 26 features. Subjectively perceived tinnitus-related impairment, depressivity, sleep problems, physical health-related impairments in quality of life, time spent to complete questionnaires and educational level exhibited a high attribution towards model prediction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Machine learning can reliably identify baseline features recorded prior to treatment commencement that characterize tinnitus-related distress after treatment.

Other supportive features include: neuroleptic sensitivity, repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, REM sleep disturbances, depression, delusions, and nonvisual hallucinations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Increased prudence with the use of neuroleptic agents is essential in DLBs because the use of these agents is associated with physical and cognitive decline and increased mortality. While neuroleptic sensitivity has been reported with the use of both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications, these medications are often necessary for the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Decreases in neuroleptic sensitivity can often be achieved by dose reductions, although neuroleptic discontinuation is sometimes necessary.

            "abstract": "The recently discovered Neuropeptide S (NPS) and its cognate receptor represent a highly interesting system of neuromodulation with unique physiological effects. On one hand, NPS increases wakefulness and arousal. On the other, NPS produces anxiolytic-like effects by acutely reducing fear responses as well as modulating long-term aspects of fear memory, such as attenuation of contextual fear or enhancement of fear extinction. The main sources of NPS in the brain are a few clusters of NPS-producing neurons in the brainstem. NPS binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor that is highly conserved among vertebrates and stimulates mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) as well as activation of protein kinases. In synaptic circuits within the amygdala, which are important for processing of acute fear as well as formation and expression of fear memories, NPS causes increased release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate, especially in synaptic contacts to a subset of GABAergic interneurons. Polymorphisms in the human NPS receptor gene have been associated with altered sleep behavior and panic disorder. In conclusion, the NPS system displays a unique physiological profile with respect to the specificity and time course of its actions. These functions could provide interesting opportunities for both basic research and clinical applications."

Newly diagnosed patients tended to report high trajectories of depression and persistent sleep disturbance. Most patients who underwent surgery reported significant sleep disturbance and anxiety shortly after surgery. For patients who received cancer-related treatment, only a small proportion had a high level of physical activity after cancer-related therapy over time. A high body mass index, a low relationship quality, parental responsibilities, insufficient social support, a low educational background, and an unhealthy lifestyle may increase the risk of negative symptom trajectories in patients with breast cancer. Additionally, old patients were more likely to report cognitive impairment after chemotherapy, while young patients tended to report trajectories of persistent sexual dysfunction.

Their goals are to change user behavior, reduce unwanted complications or symptoms, and improve health status and health-related quality of life. Internet interventions have been found efficacious in addressing a wide range of behavioral and mental health problems, including insomnia, nicotine dependence, obesity, diabetes, depression, and anxiety. Despite the existence of many Internet-based interventions, there is little research to inform their design and development. A model for behavior change in Internet interventions has been published to help guide future Internet intervention development and to help predict and explain behavior changes and symptom improvement outcomes through the use of Internet interventions. An argument is made for grounding the development of Internet interventions within a scientific framework. To that end, the model highlights a multitude of design-related components, areas, and elements, including user characteristics, environment, intervention content, level of intervention support, and targeted outcomes. However, more discussion is needed regarding how the design of the program should be developed to address these issues. While there is little research on the design and development of Internet interventions, there is a rich, related literature in the field of instructional design (ID) that can be used to inform Internet intervention development. ID models are prescriptive models that describe a set of activities involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of instructional programs. Using ID process models has been shown to increase the effectiveness of learning programs in a broad range of contexts. ID models specify a systematic method for assessing the needs of learners (intervention users) to determine the gaps between current knowledge and behaviors, and desired outcomes. Through the ID process, designers focus on the needs of learners, taking into account their prior knowledge; set measurable learning objectives or performance requirements; assess learners' achievement of the targeted outcomes; and employ cycles of continuous formative evaluation to ensure that the intervention meets the needs of all stakeholders. The ID process offers a proven methodology for the design of instructional programs and should be considered an integral part of the creation of Internet interventions. By providing a framework for the design and development of Internet interventions and by purposefully focusing on these aspects, as well as the underlying theories supporting these practices, both the theories and the interventions themselves can continue to be refined and improved. By using the behavior change model for Internet interventions along with the best research available to guide design practice and inform development, developers of Internet interventions will increase their ability to achieve desired outcomes."

Our initial review yielded 1868 papers, from which 58 met inclusion criteria. A significant small to moderate effect size was found favoring HRVB, which does not differ from that of other effective treatments. With a small number of studies for each, HRVB has the largest effect sizes for anxiety, depression, anger and athletic/artistic performance and the smallest effect sizes on PTSD, sleep and quality of life. We found no significant differences for number of treatment sessions or weeks between pretest and post-test, whether the outcome measure was targeted to the population, or year of publication. Effect sizes are larger in comparison to inactive than active control conditions although significant for both.

The sample includes workers, who are awaiting to go on vacation and are randomly assigned to either the intervention (IG) or a waitlist-control group (CG). The IG receives two weeks pre-vacation access to Holidaily, while the CG receives access two weeks post-vacation. On a daily basis participants in the IG are provided with three options promoting recreational activities and beneficial recovery experiences. Online questionnaires are distributed to all participants at several timepoints. The primary outcome measure assesses participants' work-related rumination (Irritation Scale). A significant difference two weeks post-vacation is expected, favouring the IG. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression, insomnia severity, emotional exhaustion, thinking about work, recovery experiences, vacation specifics, work and personal characteristics. To help explain the intervention's effect, explorative analyses will investigate the mediation properties of the frequency of engaging in recreational activities and the moderation properties of Holidaily users' experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      If successful, workers will maintain their recovery behaviour beyond their vacation into daily working life. Findings could, therefore, provide evidence for low-intensity interventions that could be very valuable from a public-health perspective. App-based interventions have greater reach; hence, more workers might access preventative tools to protect themselves from developing adverse health effects linked to work-related rumination. Further studies will still be needed to investigate whether the vacation phenomenon of \"lots of fun quickly gone\" can be defied and long-term benefits attained.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      German Clinical Trials Registration DRKS00013650 .

Biofeedback is one of the approaches used in connected mental health solutions, which is mainly based on the analysis of physiological indicators for the assessment and management of the psychological state. Biofeedback is recommended by many therapists and has been used for conditions including depression, insomnia, and anxiety. Anxiety is associated with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and management.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to identify interventions using biofeedback as a part of their process for anxiety management and investigate their perceived effectiveness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature review of publications presenting empirically evaluated biofeedback-based interventions for anxiety was conducted. The systematic literature review was based on publications retrieved from IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. A preliminary selection of papers was identified, examined, and filtered to include only relevant publications. Studies in the final selection were classified and analyzed to extract the modalities of use of biofeedback in the identified interventions, the types of physiological data that were collected and analyzed and the sensors used to collect them. Processes and outcomes of the empirical evaluations were also extracted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After final selection, 13 publications presenting different interventions were investigated. The interventions addressed either primarily anxiety disorders or anxiety associated with health issues such as migraine, Parkinson disease, and rheumatology. Solutions combined biofeedback with other techniques including virtual reality, music therapy, games, and relaxation practices and used different sensors including cardiovascular belts, wrist sensors, or stretch sensors to collect physiological data such as heart rate, respiration indicators, and movement information. The interventions targeted different cohorts including children, students, and patients. Overall, outcomes from the empirical evaluations yielded positive results and emphasized the effectiveness of connected mental health solutions using biofeedback for anxiety; however, certain unfavorable outcomes, such as interventions not having an effect on anxiety and patients' preferring traditional therapy, were reported in studies addressing patients with specific physical health issues.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of biofeedback in connected mental health interventions for the treatment and management of anxiety allows better screening and understanding of both psychological and physiological patient information, as well as of the association between the two. The inclusion of biofeedback could improve the outcome of interventions and boost their effectiveness; however, when used with patients suffering from certain physical health issues, suitability investigations are needed."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Development of psychosocial group interventions for ovarian cancer survivors has been limited. Drawing from elements of cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), we developed and conducted preliminary testing of an Internet-based group intervention tailored specifically to meet the needs of ovarian cancer survivors. The Internet-based platform facilitated home delivery of the psychosocial intervention to a group of cancer survivors for whom attending face-to-face programs could be difficult given their physical limitations and the small number of ovarian cancer survivors at any one treatment site.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to develop, optimize, and assess the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary intended effects of an Internet-based group stress management intervention for ovarian cancer survivors delivered via a tablet or laptop.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In total, 9 ovarian cancer survivors provided feedback during usability testing. Subsequently, 19 survivors participated in 5 waves of field testing of the 10-week group intervention led by 2 psychologists. The group met weekly for 2 hours via an Internet-based videoconference platform. Structured interviews and weekly evaluations were used to elicit feedback on the website and intervention content. Before and after the intervention, measures of mood, quality of life (QOL), perceived stress, sleep, and social support were administered. Paired t tests were used to examine changes in psychosocial measures over time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Usability results indicated that participants (n=9) performed basic tablet functions quickly with no errors and performed website functions easily with a low frequency of errors. In the field trial (n=19), across 5 groups, the 10-week intervention was well attended. Perceived stress (P=.03) and ovarian cancer-specific QOL (P=.01) both improved significantly during the course of the intervention. Trends toward decreased distress (P=.18) and greater physical (P=.05) and functional well-being (P=.06) were also observed. Qualitative interviews revealed that the most common obstacles participants experienced were technical issues and the time commitment for practicing the techniques taught in the program. Participants reported that the intervention helped them to overcome a sense of isolation and that they appreciated the ability to participate at home.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An Internet-based group intervention tailored specifically for ovarian cancer survivors is highly usable and acceptable with moderate levels of feasibility. Preliminary psychosocial outcomes indicate decreases in perceived stress and improvements in ovarian cancer-specific QOL following the intervention. A randomized clinical trial is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of this promising intervention for ovarian cancer survivors."

Data from 2487 patients receiving fluoxetine and 815 receiving trazodone were used to see whether such information was redundant when added to standard statistical analysis directed toward detecting ADRs. Relative risk values for 14 trazodone or fluoxetine ADRs were selected because each was significantly identified by an innovative postmarketing surveillance system. In one analysis, all patient reports were used to compute relative risk; in the other, only reports attributed by patients to the study drug were included. Results indicate that taking into account patient attribution judgments results in a consistent, albeit modest, increase in the discriminatory power of this monitoring method."

TMS has demonstrated neuroplastic effects akin to long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and therapeutic applications are in development for post-stroke recovery, Alzheimer's disease, and depression in seniors. Here, we discuss two new directions of TMS research relevant to cerebral aging and cognition. First, we introduce a paradigm for enhancing cognitive reserve, based on our research in sleep deprivation. Second, we discuss the use of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) to spare cognitive functions relative to conventional electroconvulsive therapy, and as a means of providing a more potent antidepressant treatment when subconvulsive TMS has shown modest efficacy in seniors. Whether in the enhancement of cognition as a treatment goal, or in the reduction of amnesia as a side effect, these approaches to the use of TMS and MST merit further exploration regarding their clinical potential."

Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce these symptoms in other patient populations, and it is unlikely to interfere with the immune suppressive medication regimen.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      This article describes the design and rationale of a clinical trial to determine whether training in mindfulness meditation can reduce depression, anxiety and insomnia after transplantation, and summarizes baseline characteristics of the participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Transplant recipients were randomized in equal numbers to one of three arms: a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program consisting of 8 weeks of group instruction, home practice and telephone monitoring; a time and attention control Health Education program; or a waitlist arm. After serving 6 months as waitlist controls, these participants were re-randomized to MBSR or Health Education. Evaluations were obtained at baseline (prior to the active interventions), 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year (after randomization to MBSR or Health Education only). The primary analysis will compare composite symptom scores between MBSR and Health Education, initially or after serving in the waitlist. Subsequent analyses will compare these two groups on depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptom scales and secondary outcomes of health-related QOL, actigraphy, and health care utilization.

There is a paucity of research detailing and comparing PALS and caregiver day-to-day perspectives of ALS. Methods: A survey developed collaboratively by The ALS Association and a panel of experts in ALS care was designed to broadly sample the experience of PALS and caregivers with respect to physical and emotional symptoms, the efficacy of treatment approaches, and goals for future treatments. Specific physical symptoms assessed consisted of fatigue, pain, weakness, shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping, speech problems, depression and other mood changes, and cognitive changes. PALS, caregivers of living patients with ALS (C-LPALS), and caregivers of deceased patients with ALS (C-DPALS) were contacted by email to participate in a 30-minute online survey. Results: 887 PALS, 444 C-LPALS, and 193 C-DPALS responded to the survey. In comparison to PALS, C-LPALS perceived that PALS had significantly higher rates of all surveyed symptoms except for pain and weakness. Caregivers self-reported higher stress levels than PALS (p < 0.001). 35% (135/383) of caregivers reported experiencing a devastating or near devastating financial impact of ALS and 64% (247/383) of caregivers felt their own health had worsened. Caregivers were significantly less likely to perceive a positive response to treatment in comparison to PALS (p < 0.001). Conclusions: PALS and caregivers report a number of symptoms beyond weakness that affect daily life which may be targets of future interventions.

Its chronicity places a major burden on primary and secondary healthcare services. In our recent national survey of General Practitioners (GPs) from across England, many reported that their awareness of tinnitus was limited and as a result were dissatisfied with the service they currently provide. GPs identified 10 online sources of information they currently use in clinical practice, but welcomed further concise and accurate information on tinnitus assessment and management.

            "title": "Kind attention and non-judgment in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy applied to the treatment of insomnia: state of knowledge.",
            "abstract": "Psychophysiological insomnia is characterized by acquired sleep difficulties and/or a state of hypervigilance when going to bed. This mental and physiological condition prevents sleep onset regardless of the presence of anxious or depressive disorders. Despite the fact that cognitive behavioural therapies have been shown to be effective for this disorder, some people are not responding to this treatment. It is therefore important to explore new ways of increasing the effectiveness of current treatments. Approaches based on mindfulness, which promote a non-judgemental acceptance of the living experience, are increasingly reported in the literature to be effective in the treatment of various physical and psychological health conditions, being particularly efficient in reducing the stress and discomfort associated with these problems. This article focuses on some cognitive factors associated with maintaining insomnia and suggests that approaches based on mindfulness, through certain action mechanisms, may help to improve sleep. A review of recent studies on the application of mindfulness-based approaches to treat insomnia is hereby presented. Avenues for future research to improve insomnia treatment protocols based on mindfulness are suggested."

Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5-9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression.

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with reported prevalence in the United States of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%). Core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. There is an increasing evidence base to support behavioral and other interventions to address specific skills and symptoms. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions. This single clinical report updates the 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical reports on the evaluation and treatment of ASD in one publication with an online table of contents and section view available through the American Academy of Pediatrics Gateway to help the reader identify topic areas within the report."

The main databases consulted were the Christian Meditation Centre, Project Meditation, and Stress-Related Facts and Well-Being at Monash. We were specifically interested in data acquired from clinical and nonclinical trials. The arguments needed to be based on qualitative and quantitative scientific data. Papers were published between 1985 and 2014. We then subdivided the review into three subcategories: physical, emotional, and self-awareness. When reviewing each category, we put our results into tabular form.

However, no research has been done on heart disease, hypertension, depression, among others. Second, virtually no research has been conducted on how meditation affects the mental health of TIPs. Notably neglected areas include anxiety, compliance, depression, and stress. Third, no research has been done on whether meditation increases self-awareness in TIPs.

            "abstract": "Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can reduce tinnitus distress but is not available for most patients. Therapist guided, internet-based CBT (ICBT) increase availability and has been shown to be effective. However, the initial positive results need to be replicated in larger samples, and treatment dropout has not been thoroughly studied. Moreover, it has not been evaluated if a low-intensity version of ICBT without therapist contact could be an alternative for patients who do not need or are able to manage the full ICBT-program. This study evaluated two parallel interventions delivered in regular care: ICBT for tinnitus distress (n = 293) and a low-intensity version of ICBT (n = 81) for patients with lower levels of tinnitus distress. We also explored predictors of dropout from ICBT and if dropout influences outcome. Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (Wilson, Henry, Bowen, & Haralambous, 1991) was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety, sleep, and sound sensitivity. Significant reductions following ICBT were found on all measures after treatment and also at a three-month follow-up. Patients receiving low-intensity ICBT showed a significant reduction in distress, even when they had low levels of distress initially. Treatment dropout was preceded by an increase in days spent at each treatment step but not by an increased distress. Early dropout was related to worse outcome. ICBT can be used in a regular clinical setting to reduce tinnitus distress. Early dropouts may need additional management. For help-seeking patients with lower distress, a low-intensity version of ICBT can be used."

In recent years, an increased number of internet interventions have been developed, targeting a range of conditions and behaviors, including depression, pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. Human support (coaching) is a common component of internet interventions that is intended to boost engagement; however, little is known about how participants interact with coaches and how this may relate to their experience with the intervention. By examining the data that participants produce during an intervention, we can characterize their interaction patterns and refine treatments to address different needs.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we employed text mining and visual analytics techniques to analyze messages exchanged between coaches and participants in an internet-delivered pain management intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their parents.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We explored the main themes in coaches' and participants' messages using an automated textual analysis method, topic modeling.

The themes in coaches' messages fell into 3 categories: Treatment Content, Administrative and Technical, and Rapport Building. Next, we employed topic modeling to identify topics from participants' message histories. Similar to the coaches' topics, these were subsumed under 3 high-level categories: Health Management and Treatment Content, Questions and Concerns, and Activities and Interests. Finally, the cluster analysis identified 4 clusters, each with a distinguishing characteristic: Assignment-Focused, Short Message Histories, Pain-Focused, and Activity-Focused. The name of each cluster exemplifies the main engagement patterns of that cluster.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this secondary data analysis, we demonstrated how automated text analysis techniques could be used to identify messages of interest, such as questions and concerns from users. In addition, we demonstrated how cluster analysis could be used to identify subgroups of individuals who share communication and engagement patterns, and in turn facilitate personalization of interventions for different subgroups of patients. This work makes 2 key methodological contributions. First, this study is innovative in its use of topic modeling to provide a rich characterization of the textual content produced by coaches and participants in an internet-delivered behavioral health intervention. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of a visual analysis method to cluster participants and identify similar patterns of behavior based on intervention message content."

            "abstract": "Professionally significant enhancement of music and dance performance and mood has followed training with an EEG-neurofeedback protocol which increases the ratio of theta to alpha waves using auditory feedback with eyes closed. While originally the protocol was designed to induce hypnogogia, a state historically associated with creativity, the outcome was psychological integration, while subsequent applications focusing on raising the theta-alpha ratio, reduced depression and anxiety in alcoholism and resolved post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). In optimal performance studies we confirmed associations with creativity in musical performance, but effects also included technique and communication. We extended efficacy to dance and social anxiety. Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation. Neuroanatomical circuitry involves the ascending mescencephalic-cortical arousal system, and limbic circuits subserving cognitive as well as affective/motivational functions. Working memory and meditative bliss, representing cognitive and affective domains, respectively, involve coupling between frontal and posterior cortices, exemplify a role for theta and alpha waves in mediating the interaction between distal and widely distributed connections. It is posited that this mediation in part underpins the integrational attributes of alpha-theta training in optimal performance and psychotherapy, creative associations in hypnogogia, and enhancement of technical, communication and artistic domains of performance in the arts."

Affected populations include the public and health care workers. A sleep deprived society faces the increased burden of COVID-related economic disruption, psychosocial problems, substance abuse, and suicide. Disordered sleep is not expected to disappear with control of infection, making interventions acutely necessary. The question becomes how to manage the sleep dysfunction during and after the pandemic. Depression and anxiety are prominent complaints during pandemic restrictions. Insomnia symptoms and fatigue continue even as mood improves in those who are in recovery from COVID-19 infection. Management of disturbed sleep and mental health is particularly needed in frontline health care workers. This overview describes 53 publications, as of February 2021, on disturbed sleep during the pandemic, treatment studies on COVID-related sleep disturbance, and need to rely on current treatment guidelines for common sleep disorders. The available research during the first year of COVID-19 has generally described symptoms of poor sleep rather than addressing treatment strategies. It covers digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) for the public and frontline workers, recognizing the need of greater acceptance and efficacy of controlled trials of CBT for affected groups.

The search adhered to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and the review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42019138148). A search for peer-reviewed observational studies published until June 2019 was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases, followed by an additional manual search for publications conducted via analyzing the references of the found studies. With respect to the intake of fruit and/or vegetable, studies that assessed the intake of fruits and/or vegetables, or their processed products (e.g., juices), as a measure expressed in grams or as the number of portions were included. Those studies that assessed the general dietary patterns were not included in the present analysis. With respect to mental health, studies that assessed all the aspects of mental health in both healthy participants and subjects with physical health problems were included, but those conducted in groups of patients with intellectual disabilities, dementia, and eating disorders were excluded. To assess bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied. A total of 5911 studies were independently extracted by 2 researchers and verified if they met the inclusion criteria using a 2-stage procedure (based on the title, based on the abstract). After reviewing the full text, a total of 61 studies were selected. A narrative synthesis of the findings from the included studies was performed, which was structured around the type of outcome. The studies included mainly focused on depression and depressive symptoms, but also other characteristics ranging from general and mental well-being, quality of life, sleep quality, life satisfaction, flourishing, mood, self-efficacy, curiosity, creativity, optimism, self-esteem, stress, nervousness, or happiness, to anxiety, minor psychiatric disorders, distress, or attempted suicide, were analyzed. The most prominent results indicated that high total intake of fruits and vegetables, and some of their specific subgroups including berries, citrus, and green leafy vegetables, may promote higher levels of optimism and self-efficacy, as well as reduce the level of psychological distress, ambiguity, and cancer fatalism, and protect against depressive symptoms. However, it must be indicated that the studies included were conducted using various methodologies and in different populations, so their results were not always sufficiently comparable, which is a limitation. Taken together, it can be concluded that fruits and/or vegetables, and some of their specific subgroups, as well as processed fruits and vegetables, seems to have a positive influence on mental health, as stated in the vast majority of the included studies. Therefore, the general recommendation to consume at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day may be beneficial also for mental health."

Results: Of 41 participants, median age was 47 years, Interquartile range (IQR) 31, 92% were male and 80% were of white ethnicity. A significant reduction in total CNS score (10 to 7) was observed at 4 weeks (p = 0.028), but not thereafter. Significant improvements in sleep and anxiety were observed 4, 12 and 24 weeks after switching therapy (p < 0.05). No significant change in global cognitive scores was observed. Conclusions: Switching from efavirenz to rilpivirine based regimens in virologically suppressed PLWH without perceived CNS symptoms was well tolerated and slightly improved overall CNS symptoms."

            "abstract": "Anxiety and insomnia disorders are two of the most common and costly mental health conditions. They are frequently comorbid, but current treatments do not target both. To streamline treatment, we developed a computerized intervention targeting a transdiagnostic factor, safety aids (cognitive or behavioral strategies used to cope with distress that paradoxically exacerbate symptoms). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the acceptability and efficacy of this brief one-session intervention. Young adult undergraduates (N = 61) with elevated subclinical anxiety and insomnia were randomized to receive the anxiety-insomnia intervention or a physical health control condition. Participants were followed for 1 month and completed self-report measures. Analyses indicated that participants found the intervention acceptable, credible, and engaging. Analyses revealed the active intervention reduced sleep- and anxiety-related safety aids, with medium to large effect sizes. Findings suggest that targeting safety aids for anxiety and insomnia is acceptable and effective in reducing the target mechanism, safety aids, as well as worry. Future research should replicate these findings within a clinical sample and with a longer-term follow-up."

Women with stages I-IIIA breast cancer (n = 113) received a BT sleep intervention composed of stimulus control, modified sleep restriction (MSR), relaxation therapy (RT), and sleep hygiene counseling components. A BT plan was developed by a research nurse and each participant, reinforced on day 8, and repeated for chemotherapy cycles 2, 3, and 4. Adherence to the BT plan was measured daily; total adherence score was computed at each chemotherapy cycle by combining adherence estimates of all BT plan components. Psychological and physical symptoms over the past 7 days were measured 2 days prior to and 7 days after each chemotherapy treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Total adherence rates to the BT plan were 51-52% at all four treatments but adherence varied by component. Sleep disturbance, pain, and anxiety significantly decreased whereas depression significantly increased across chemotherapy. Structural equation modeling revealed a good model fit with decreasing sleep disturbances (0.409) and increasing depression (-0.711) contributing to lower total adherence rates. Increasing depression predicted lower MSR adherence (-0.203) and decreasing sleep disturbances predicted lower RT adherence (1.220).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Sleep disturbance and depression significantly impacted adherence rates during chemotherapy.

            "abstract": "Background: Firefighters are vulnerable to irregular sleep patterns and sleep disturbance due to work characteristics such as shift work and frequent dispatch. However, there are few studies investigating intervention targeting sleep for firefighters. This preliminary study aimed to develop and test a sleep intervention, namely FIT-IN (Firefighter's Therapy for Insomnia and Nightmares), which was based on existing evidence-based treatment tailored to firefighters in consideration of their occupational characteristics. Methods: This study implemented a single-group pre-post study design, utilizing an intervention developed based on brief behavior therapy for insomnia with imagery rehearsal therapy components. FIT-IN consisted of a total of three sessions (two face-to-face group sessions and one telephone session). Participants were recruited from Korean fire stations, and a total of 39 firefighters participated. Participants completed a sleep diary for two weeks, as well as the following questionnaires to assess their sleep and psychological factors: insomnia severity index (ISI), disturbing dream and nightmare severity index (DDNSI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), depressive symptom inventory-suicidality subscale (DSI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). These questionnaires were administered before the first session and at the end of the second session. Results: The FIT-IN program produced improvements in sleep indices. There was a significant increase in sleep efficiency (p < 0.01), and a decrease in sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and time in bed (p < 0.05), as derived from weekly sleep diaries. In addition, significant decreases were shown for insomnia (p < 0.001) and nightmare severity (p < 0.01). Conclusion: There were significant improvements in sleep and other clinical indices (depression, PTSD scores) when comparing pre-and post-intervention scores. FIT-IN may be a feasible and practical option in alleviating sleep disturbance in this population. Further studies will be needed to ascertain FIT-IN's effectiveness."

ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening.Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data.The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use.Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers.Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective."

This phase 2 study investigated brexanolone (USAN; formerly SAGE-547 injection), an intravenous formulation of allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, for the treatment of post-partum depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled self-referred or physician-referred female inpatients (≤6 months post partum) with severe post-partum depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] total score ≥26) in four hospitals in the USA. Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation program, to receive either a single, continuous intravenous dose of brexanolone or placebo for 60 h. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 17-item HAM-D total score at 60 h, assessed in all randomised patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo and who had a completed baseline HAM-D assessment and at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment.

Four of ten patients in the brexanolone group had adverse events compared with eight of 11 in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events in the brexanolone group were dizziness (two patients in the brexanolone group vs three patients in the placebo group) and somnolence (two vs none). Moderate treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in two patients in the brexanolone group (sinus tachycardia, n=1; somnolence, n=1) and in two patients in the placebo group (infusion site pain, n=1; tension headache, n=1); one patient in the placebo group had a severe treatment-emergent adverse event (insomnia).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      In women with severe post-partum depression, infusion of brexanolone resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HAM-D total score, compared with placebo.

Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored ≥7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores.

While some studies dedicated in structural neuroimaging credibly address negative impact of low Cbl status, functional imaging reports are limited. We herein retrospectively review the correlation of Tc-99 m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-99 m-ECD SPECT) and clinical presentations among patients with low serum cobalamin (Cbl) status (<250 pg/ml).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twelve symptomatic patients with low serum Cbl status were enrolled. Clinical presentations, Tc-99 m-ECD SPECT, and neuropsychological tests were reviewed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Dysexecutive syndrome (67 %), forgetfulness (50 %), attention deficits (42 %), and sleep disorders (33 %) constituted the major clinical presentations. All patients (100 %) had temporal hypoperfusion on the Tc-99 m-ECD SPECT. Five patients (42 %) had hypoperfusion restricted within temporal regions and deep nuclei; seven patients (58 %) had additional frontal hypoperfusion. In patients with hypoperfusion restricted within temporal regions and deep nuclei, psychiatric symptoms with spared cognition were their main presentations. Among patients with additional frontal hypoperfusion, six of seven patients (86 %) showed impaired cognitive performances (two of them were diagnosed as having dementia). Among ten patients who finished neuropsychological tests, abstract thinking (70 %) was the most commonly affected, followed by verbal fluency (60 %), short-term memory (50 %), and attention (50 %). Anxiety and sleep problems were the major clinically remarkable psychiatric features (33 % both). Four Tc-99 m-ECD SPECT follow-up studies were available; the degree and extent of signal reversal correlated with cognitive changes after Cbl replacement therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our TC-99 m-ECD SPECT observations provide pivotal information of neurobiological changes within basal ganglia and fronto-temporal regions in conjunction with disease severity among patients with Cbl deficiency. Hypoperfusion within thalamus/basal ganglia and temporal regions may be seen in the earlier state of Cbl deficiency, when psychiatric symptoms predominate. Hypoperfusion beyond thalamus/basal ganglia and involving frontal regions appears when cognitive problems, mostly dysexecutive syndrome, are manifested. Symmetric hypofrontality of SPECT in the context of dysexcutive syndrome serves as a distinguishing feature of non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment attributed to Cbl deficiency. Concordant with TC-99 m-ECD SPECT findings, the psychiatric symptoms and dysexcutive syndrome undergird impaired limbic and dorsolateral prefrontal circuits originating from basal ganglia respectively."

The methodological requirements of policy makers internationally is driving growth in the use of methods to obtain utilities from the general public to inform cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analyses of health technologies being considered for adoption by health systems.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The precision of five comparisons of the outcomes of treatments, based on health state descriptions, was assessed against the results of clinical trials which showed a statistically and clinically significant improvement using an internet panel of members of the UK general public. Health states were developed to depict the baseline and post-treatment states from these exemplar clinical trials. Preferences for health states were obtained using bottom-up titrated standard gamble over the internet, and differences between summary health state values corresponding to the treatment and comparator groups within each exemplar study were compared. Results are considered in the context of various estimates for the minimally important difference in utility values.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participation among members of the internet panel in the five exemplars ranged from 27 to 59. In four of the five exemplars, the utility-based estimates of treatment benefit showed significant differences between groups and were greater than an assumed minimally important difference of 0.1. Mean utility differences between groups were: 0.23 (computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression, P < 0.001), 0.11 (hip resurfacing for hip osteoarthritis, P < 0.001), 0.0005 (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, P = 0.98), 0.15 (pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD, P < 0.001) and 0.11 (infliximab for Crohn's disease, P < 0.001). The confidence intervals around the estimates of utility-based treatment effect in three of the five examples did not exclude the possibility of a difference smaller than a minimally important difference of 0.1.

The experience of persistent sleep disturbance places these women at a higher risk of psychological and physical morbidity and a reduced quality of life. Treatment for sleep in this population is not part of routine care and is often managed inadequately. This randomised controlled trial will examine the combined effects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and bright light therapy (BLT) on the symptoms of insomnia, fatigue and mental health.\n    \n\n\n          Method/design:\n        \n      \n      Women diagnosed with breast cancer who receive intravenous chemotherapy treatment at a quaternary referral metropolitan cancer centre in Melbourne, Australia, will be recruited. Recruitment will occur after diagnosis and prior to completion of chemotherapy.

The CBT+ group will receive one face-to-face session on sleep strategies, one subsequent telephone call, and seven email packages containing CBT-based information and strategies. CBT+ participants will also wear Luminette® light glasses for 20 min each morning for the 6-week duration of the intervention. Women in TAU+ will receive two relaxation audio tracks via email. Outcomes will be measured at multiple points throughout the 6 weeks. Primary outcomes will be symptoms of insomnia and sleep efficiency, measured using the Insomnia Severity Index and a self-reported sleep diary. Secondary outcomes include objective measures of sleep assessed using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, and sleep-related complaints, fatigue and mental health, all assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).

Beyond these well-described effects and mechanisms, there is literature to suggest that creatine may also be beneficial to brain health (e.g., cognitive processing, brain function, and recovery from trauma). This is a growing field of research, and the purpose of this short review is to provide an update on the effects of creatine supplementation on brain health in humans. There is a potential for creatine supplementation to improve cognitive processing, especially in conditions characterized by brain creatine deficits, which could be induced by acute stressors (e.g., exercise, sleep deprivation) or chronic, pathologic conditions (e.g., creatine synthesis enzyme deficiencies, mild traumatic brain injury, aging, Alzheimer's disease, depression). Despite this, the optimal creatine protocol able to increase brain creatine levels is still to be determined. Similarly, supplementation studies concomitantly assessing brain creatine and cognitive function are needed. Collectively, data available are promising and future research in the area is warranted."

If this is true, improving sleep should benefit psychological health. We aimed to determine whether treating insomnia leads to a reduction in paranoia and hallucinations.\n## METHODS\nWe did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial (OASIS) at 26 UK universities. University students with insomnia were randomly assigned (1:1) with simple randomisation to receive digital cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia or usual care, and the research team were masked to the treatment. Online assessments took place at weeks 0, 3, 10 (end of therapy), and 22. The primary outcome measures were for insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinatory experiences. We did intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61272251.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864). Compared with usual practice, the sleep intervention at 10 weeks reduced insomnia (adjusted difference 4·78, 95% CI 4·29 to 5·26, Cohen's d=1·11; p<0·0001), paranoia (-2·22, -2·98 to -1·45, Cohen's d=0·19; p<0·0001), and hallucinations (-1·58, -1·98 to -1·18, Cohen's d=0·24; p<0·0001). Insomnia was a mediator of change in paranoia and hallucinations. No adverse events were reported.\n## INTERPRETATION\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a mental health problem. It provides strong evidence that insomnia is a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences and other mental health problems. Whether the results generalise beyond a student population requires testing. The treatment of disrupted sleep might require a higher priority in mental health provision.\n## FUNDING\nWellcome Trust.\n"

The absence or insufficient disclosure of recommendations or instructions for appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree of treatment.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital CBT for depression and anxiety in young people to describe how appropriate use has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe how adherence has been measured, and to determine the associations between adherence and treatment outcomes.\n## METHODS\nA systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) extracting data independently. Overall, 4 electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting depression or anxiety, and reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. Studies that evaluated non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths). Definitions of appropriate use varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, duration and frequency of use, and the features used to support engagement and adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing components of appropriate use or providing information on how recommendations for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were derived from the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention completion; however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little evidence of an association between degree of use and outcomes in the 9 studies that examined this.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDefinitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT intervention. However, statements of appropriate use are not systematically reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for use are communicated to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically operationalized as the degree of intervention completion and was not consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions to provide guidance to users and to assist the development of appropriate and nuanced measures of adherence.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO CRD42020208668; https://tinyurl.com/4bu2yram.\n"

Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for bipolar disorder; however, adjunctive psychotherapy can help individuals use self-management strategies to improve outcomes. Yet access to this therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies have the potential to increase access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously providing real-time user feedback and provider alerts to augment care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper describes the user-centered development of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder, to contribute to and support the ongoing improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Individuals with bipolar disorder first participated in a field trial of a simple smartphone app for self-monitoring of behavioral targets. To develop a complete technology-based intervention for bipolar disorder, this field trial was followed by design sessions, usability testing, and a pilot study of a smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder. Throughout all phases of development, intervention revisions were made based on user feedback.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The core of the LiveWell intervention consists of a daily self-monitoring tool, the Daily Check-in. This self-monitoring tool underwent multiple revisions during the user-centered development process. Daily Check-in mood and thought rating scales were collapsed into a single wellness rating scale to accommodate user development of personalized scale anchors. These anchors are meant to assist users in identifying early warning signs and symptoms of impending episodes to take action based on personalized plans. When users identified personal anchors for the wellness scale, the anchors most commonly reflected behavioral signs and symptoms (40%), followed by cognitive (25%), mood (15%), physical (10%), and motivational (7%) signs and symptoms. Changes to the Daily Check-in were also made to help users distinguish between getting adequate sleep and keeping a regular routine. At the end of the pilot study, users reported that the Daily Check-in made them more aware of early warning signs and symptoms and how much they were sleeping. Users also reported that they liked personalizing their anchors and plans and felt this process was useful. Users experienced some difficulties with developing, tracking, and achieving target goals. Users also did not consistently follow up with app recommendations to contact providers when Daily Check-in data suggested they needed additional assistance. As a result, the human support roles for the technology were expanded beyond app use support to include support for self-management and clinical care communication. The development of these human support roles was aided by feedback on the technology's usability from the users and the coaches who provided the human support.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      User input guided the development of intervention content, technology, and coaching support for LiveWell. Users valued the provision of monitoring tools and the ability to personalize plans for staying well, supporting the role of monitoring and personalization as important features of digital mental health technologies. Users also valued human support of the technology in the form of a coach, and user difficulties with aspects of self-management and care-provider communication led to an expansion of the coach's support roles. Obtaining feedback from both users and coaches played an important role in the development of both the LiveWell technology and human support. Attention to all stakeholders involved in the use of mental health technologies is essential for optimizing intervention development."

Beginning in 2006, 9 atypical antipsychotic drugs have been approved by the FDA for indications that were previously off-label uses: aripiprazole (as augmentation for major depressive disorder [MDD] and for autism spectrum disorders), asenapine, clozapine, iloperidone, olanzapine (in combination with fluoxetine for MDD and bipolar depression), paliperidone, quetiapine (quetiapine and quetiapine XR [extended release] as monotherapy in bipolar depression and quetiapine XR as augmentation for MDD), risperidone (for autism spectrum disorders), and ziprasidone. In 2006, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of off-label uses of atypical antipsychotics. Since that time, numerous studies have been published evaluating these therapies in various new off-label uses; new or increased adverse effects have been observed with off-label uses; new atypical antipsychotics have been approved; and previously off-label uses have been approved for some atypical antipsychotics. Hence, AHRQ published an updated review in September 2011 that summarized the benefits and harms of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder (ADHD), anxiety, behavioral disturbances of dementia and severe geriatric agitation, depression, eating disorders, insomnia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use and dependence disorders, and Tourette's syndrome. The new report also investigated topics for which data in the previous report were found to be insufficient to make conclusions, including subpopulations (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender) that would benefit most from atypical antipsychotics, appropriate dose, and time needed to see clinical improvement. The 2011 review included the following atypical antipsychotics: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone; no clinical trials were found for off-label use of the 3 most recently FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics (asenapine, iloperidone, and paliperidone).\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To (a) familiarize health care professionals with the methods and findings from AHRQ's 2011 Comparative Effectiveness Review (CER) of off-label use of atypical antipsychotics, (b) encourage consideration of the clinical and managed care applications of the review findings, and (c) identify limitations and gaps in the existing research with respect to the benefits and risks of off-label use of atypical antipsychotics.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Antipsychotic medications are FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Conventional antipsychotics have been widely used for decades and spurred the development of the atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics were produced and are now being used for patients who may have experienced various side effects while using conventional antipsychotics.In 2006, an AHRQ study reviewed off-label uses of atypical antipsychotics (excluding clozapine because of its association with potentially fatal bone marrow suppression and the requirement for frequent blood tests for safety monitoring). Findings indicated that the most common off-label uses of these drugs included depression, OCD, PTSD, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome, autism, and agitation in dementia. The reviewers concluded in 2006 that overall there was not sufficiently high strength of evidence of efficacy for any off-label use of atypical antipsychotics. There was, however, strong evidence for an increased risk of adverse events with off-label use, including significant weight gain and sedation and increased mortality among the elderly.Since the 2006 review, significant developments occurred in the use of atypical antipsychotics, including FDA approval of the atypical antipsychotics asenapine, iloperidone, and paliperidone and FDA approval of previous off-label uses: (a) quetiapine and quetiapine XR as monotherapy in bipolar depression; (b) quetiapine XR as augmentation therapy for MDD; (c) aripiprazole as augmentation therapy for MDD; (d) olanzapine/fluoxetine combination for MDD; (e) olanzapine/fluoxetine combination for bipolar depression; and (f) risperidone and aripiprazole for autism spectrum disorders. Additional studies have been published for new off-label uses, and there have been reports of new or increased adverse effects for off-label uses.Further review of previously insufficient information was warranted on subpopulations where treatment modification such as dosing may increase efficacy. The 2006 review did not have sufficient information to make conclusions regarding subpopulations (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender) that would benefit most from atypical antipsychotics, appropriate dosing, and the duration of treatment needed to see clinical improvement. The updated AHRQ report in 2011 reviewed off-label uses of atypical antipsychotic medications in anxiety, ADHD, behavioral disturbances of dementia and severe geriatric agitation, MDD, eating disorders, insomnia, OCD, PTSD, personality disorders, substance abuse, and Tourette's syndrome; autism was included in the 2006 review but is now reviewed in a separate report of the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotics for on-label uses. The significant findings in the updated review include (a) small but statistically significant benefits for olanzapine, aripiprazole, and risperidone for elderly patients with dementia; (b) quetiapine appears superior to placebo for general anxiety disorder (GAD); (c) risperidone was associated with benefits in the treatment of OCD; and (d) adverse events are common. Atypical antipsychotics were not effective in the treatment of eating disorders or personality disorder. The evidence did not support the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of substance abuse, and data were inconclusive for the use of these medications for insomnia. The number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for adverse events in elderly patients, including risk of death (NNH = 87), stroke (NNH = 53 for risperidone), extrapyramidal symptoms (NNH = 10 for olanzapine and NNH = 20 for risperidone), and urinary symptoms (NNH = 16 to 36). Adverse events in nonelderly adults included weight gain (particularly with olanzapine), fatigue, sedation, akathisia (with aripiprazole), and extrapyramidal symptoms."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be effective in this population, but it is not widely available to those who need it.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to better understand BCSs' experiences with insomnia and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CBT-I using a virtual assistant (Amazon Alexa).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We first conducted a formative phase with 2 focus groups and 3 in-depth interviews to understand BCSs' perceptions of insomnia as well as their interest in and comfort with using a virtual assistant to learn about CBT-I. We then developed a prototype incorporating participant preferences and CBT-I components and demonstrated it in group and individual settings to BCSs to evaluate acceptability, interest, perceived feasibility, educational potential, and usability of the prototype. We also collected open-ended feedback on the content and used frequencies to describe the quantitative data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 11 BCSs with insomnia in the formative phase and 14 BCSs in the prototype demonstration. In formative work, anxiety, fear, and hot flashes were identified as causes of insomnia. After prototype demonstration, nearly 79% (11/14) of participants reported an interest in and perceived feasibility of using the virtual assistant to record sleep patterns. Approximately two-thirds of the participants thought lifestyle modification (9/14, 64%) and sleep restriction (9/14, 64%) would be feasible and were interested in this feature of the program (10/14, 71% and 9/14, 64%, respectively). Relaxation exercises were rated as interesting and feasible using the virtual assistant by 71% (10/14) of the participants. Usability was rated as better than average, and all women reported that they would recommend the program to friends and family.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This virtual assistant prototype delivering CBT-I components by using a smart speaker was rated as feasible and acceptable, suggesting that this prototype should be fully developed and tested for efficacy in the BCS population.

            "abstract": "The number of people with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increasing worldwide. Anxiety about potential infection, fear of severe illness, death, economic problems, and loneliness and isolation brought on by social distancing are increasingly being experienced by people. Therefore, it is imperative to address and improve such mental health-related problems during COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the current mental health care and psychological intervention statuses related to COVID-19 in Japan. In a questionnaire survey, 55 of 69 (80%) mental health and welfare centers and 194 of 931 (21%) psychiatric institutions across Japan responded. COVID-19 patients, their family members, and the general public often consulted the mental health and welfare institutions through telephone. The questionnaire included various information of mental health difficulties related to COVID-19 such as the numbers and contents of the consultations, and the type of the interventions. The contents of consultation included psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and alcohol problems) and psychosocial problems (interpersonal problems, prejudice, and discrimination). Overall, 9% of mental health and welfare centers provided psychological first aid as psychological intervention and 28% of consultations involved cases requiring urgent care. In Japan, consultations about COVID-19-related mental health problems occurred mainly in mental health and welfare centers. There is urgent need to establish a system that enables mental health triage and brief psychological interventions that are feasible in the centers."

            "abstract": "Various sleep disorders have deleterious effects on mental and cognitive performance. Exercise, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, exerts beneficial impacts on human health. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of 4 weeks treadmill exercise (4W-TE) on anxiety-like behavior and cognitive performance in mice exposed to 2 months REM sleep deprivation (2M-SD) (20 h per day). Behavioral performance of mice in elevated plus maze test (EPM), open field test (OFT), Y maze test (YM) and Morris water maze test (MWM) was recorded and analyzed 28 h after the last day of sleep deprivation. After behavioral tests, various neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mouse hippocampus were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. The hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were further detected using ELISA. Behavioral data indicated that 2M-SD exposure induced anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, as evidenced by the decreased open-arm entries in EPM, reduced central area travels in OFT, declined spontaneous alteration in YM and prolonged escaping latency in MWM. In addition, 2M-SD exposure increased NE and DA, decreased 5-HT and GABA, and reduced IGF-1 and BDNF levels in mouse hippocampus. Interestingly, all these behavioral, neurochemical and neurobiological changes can be ameliorated by 4W-TE training. In summary, these findings confirm the beneficial impacts of exercise on health and provide further experimental evidence for future application of exercise as an alternative therapy against the mental and cognitive problems in patients with sleep disorders."

            "abstract": "Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of major depressive episodes. Since 1985, it has been evaluated for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus are cerebral structures believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of OCD, since hyperactivation of these territories in the basal state is corrected upon remission of symptoms induced by therapy with an SSRI or by behavioral psychotherapy. Furthermore, several studies have found abnormalities in serotoninergic transmission in the orbitofrontal cortex and SSRIs can increase serotonin release by desensitizing 5HTID autoreceptors. OCD is a severe, chronic psychiatric disorder frequently complicated by depressive episodes. Here we review the clinical trials of fluoxetine listed in the Medline and Embase computerized databases. Fluoxetine was found to be effective in OCD in all the published open-label studies as well as in placebo-controlled trials with an effective dose range of 40 to 60 mg daily. Clinical evaluation was carried out by using specific scales such as the Y-BOCS or NIMH-OC and improvement was observed after several weeks of therapy. These studies comprising an extended phase showed that efficacy was maintained--for three years in the longest study--resulting in a higher percentage of responders relative to the treatment initiation phase. A comparison of fluoxetine and clomipramine showed comparable efficacy and a superior safety profile, both in terms of anticholinergic side effects and cardiotoxicity or overdosage. The relapse rate was similar with both drugs. In the four meta-analyses appearing in the databases, two studies found similar efficacy for clomipramine and fluoxetine. There are few studies which directly compare the different SSRIs, apart from a comparison of fluoxetine and sertraline showing that both drugs have similar efficacy. With clomipramine, the SSRIs represent the first-line treatment recommended by the experts, in association with behavioral therapy to improve and maintain the clinical response over the long term. The guidelines recommend an optimal fluoxetine dose of 40 to 60 mg daily with a minimum treatment duration of 1 to 2 years. Efficacy should not be evaluated before 8 weeks to allow for onset of the therapeutic effects. Fluoxetine was found to have a good safety profile in these studies and the adverse effects described (insomnia, headache, diminished libido) rarely led to discontinuation of the treatment. Adverse effects such as nervousness or insomnia at the start of therapy were predictors of a good response to fluoxetine, as were the presence of remissions, the absence of prior pharmacologic therapy and a high impulsiveness score. A long history of the disorder, severity of the symptoms, collection obsessions, washing compulsions, obsessional slowness and comorbidity with a schizotypic personality or vocal or motor tics were associated with a poorer response. Fluoxetine also alleviates collateral depressive symptoms by significantly reducing suicidal ideation and impulsiveness in OCD patients. Our study indicates that fluoxetine is effective and well tolerated in OCD, placing it among the first-line treatments recommended by consensus conference guidelines."

The objective of this study was to identify which brain structures' activity differentiates responders from nonresponders and to study how metabolism in these brain regions changes with mood.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]deoxyglucose (FDG) before and after total sleep deprivation in 15 unmedicated awake patients with unipolar major depression and 15 normal control subjects, who did the continuous performance test during FDG uptake.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After sleep deprivation, four patients showed a 40% or more improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Before sleep deprivation the depressed responders had a significantly higher cingulate cortex metabolic rate than the depressed nonresponders, and this normalized after sleep deprivation. The normal control subjects and nonresponding depressed patients showed no change in cingulate metabolic rate after sleep deprivation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overactivation of the limbic system as assessed by PET scans may characterize a subset of depressed patients.

The IC consisted of 6 Internet-based sessions that aimed to promote healthy restorative behavior. Self-report data were assessed at baseline and again after 8 weeks. Additionally, a sleep diary was used starting 1 week before baseline and ending 1 week after postassessment. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included perseverative cognitions (i.e., work-related rumination and worrying), a range of recovery measures and depression. An extended 6-month follow-up was assessed in the IC only. A serial multiple mediator analysis was carried out to investigate mechanisms of change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      IC participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in insomnia severity (d = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.77) than did participants of the CC. The IC was also superior with regard to changes in all investigated secondary outcomes. Effects were maintained until a naturalistic 6-month follow-up. Effects on insomnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perseverative cognitions and sleep effort. Additionally, a greater increase in number of recovery activities per week was found to be associated with lower perseverative cognitions that in turn led to a greater reduction in insomnia severity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides evidence for the efficacy of an unguided, Internet-based occupational recovery training and provided first evidence for a number of assumed mechanisms of change."

Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been related to cholinergic deficiency and improve after treatment with cholinomimetic agents. Cholinergic drugs are unique among psychotropic agents in exerting disease-specific and broad-spectrum effects. These observations provide the basis for the cholinergic hypothesis of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD, suggesting that the cholinergic deficit of AD contributes to the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD and that cholinomimetic therapy ameliorates the behavioral disturbances accompanying AD."

We aimed to identify: (I) network systems; (II) central symptoms; and (III) network differences, in patient-reported depression for baseline, endpoint and change scores. STAR*D data during citalopram treatment were reanalyzed to examine depression based on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR). Network analyses were computed from the QIDS-SR item-level severity scores at baseline and endpoint, and from estimated change scores based on mixed models, adjusted for confounding by dose and baseline severity. Centrality indices for each symptom were computed. Networks were contrasted for connectivity with permutation tests. Network analyses grouped symptoms consistently as: Sleep disturbances, cognitive and physical avolition, Affect and Appetite. Symptom centrality was highest for Energy at baseline, Mood at endpoint, and Mood and Concentration on change scores. Generally, permutation tests showed that the networks all significantly (p<.05) differed. Results demonstrated: (I) a replicable network group of the symptoms of depression that modestly mapped onto well-known mechanisms for depression; (II) symptoms with high centrality that may be future treatment targets (e.g., mood); and (III) that the form of the networks differed across treatment time-points, thereby contributing centrality as a possible mechanism to the initial severity debate. These findings highlight the utility of focusing on symptoms rather than total scores to understand how treatment unfolds, and tentative mechanisms."

            "abstract": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) increasingly emerges as a potential novel treatment option for anxiety diseases like panic and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, the neural underpinnings of its anxiolytic action are still not clearly understood. Recently, we reported that neurons of the ventral hippocampus (VH) take up intranasally administered fluorophore-conjugated NPS and, moreover, that application of NPS to mouse brain slices affects neurotransmission and plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Although these previous findings define the VH as a novel NPS target structure, they leave open whether this brain region is directly involved in NPS-mediated anxiolysis and how NPS impacts on neuronal activity propagation in the VH. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating, first, that microinjections of NPS into the ventral CA1 region are sufficient to reduce anxiety-like behavior of C57BL/6N mice and, second, that NPS, via the NPS receptor, rapidly weakens evoked neuronal activity flow from the dentate gyrus to area CA1 in vitro. Additionally, we show that intranasally applied NPS alters neurotransmission and plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses in the same way as NPS administered to hippocampal slices. Thus, our study provides, for the first time, strong experimental evidence for a direct involvement of the VH in NPS-induced anxiolysis and furthermore presents a novel mechanism of NPS action."

To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents. This article will describe the design process that was followed, the functionality of both systems, the results of the user studies that were conducted for the evaluation of their end-user applications, and a discussion about future plans."

Four of the 12 studies compared melatonin, placebo and midazolam, whereas the remaining eight studies compared melatonin and placebo only.The quality of the evidence for our primary outcome (melatonin versus placebo for preoperative anxiety) was high. More than half of the included studies had a low risk of selection bias and at least 75% of the included studies had a low risk of attrition, performance and detection bias. Most of the included studies had an unclear risk of reporting bias.Eight out the 10 studies that assessed the effect of melatonin on preoperative anxiety using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (ranging from 0 to 100 mm, higher scores indicate greater anxiety) showed a reduction compared to placebo. The reported estimate of effect (relative effect -13.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.13 to -10.58; high quality evidence) was based on a meta-analysis of seven studies. Two studies did not show any difference between melatonin and placebo. Two studies comparing melatonin with midazolam using a VAS found no evidence of a difference in preoperative anxiety between the two groups (relative effect -1.18, 95% CI -2.59 to 0.23; low quality evidence).Eight studies assessed the effect of melatonin on postoperative anxiety. Four of these studies measuring postoperative anxiety 90 minutes postoperatively using a VAS did not find any evidence of a difference between melatonin and placebo (relative effect -3.71, 95% CI -9.26 to 1.84). Conversely, two studies showed a reduction of postoperative anxiety measured six hours after surgery using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) when comparing melatonin with placebo (relative effect -5.31, 95% CI -8.78 to -1.84; moderate quality evidence). Two studies comparing melatonin with midazolam using a VAS did not find any evidence of a difference between the two groups in postoperative anxiety (relative effect -2.02, 95% CI -5.82 to 1.78).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      When compared to placebo, melatonin given as premedication (tablets or sublingually) can reduce preoperative anxiety in adults (measured 50 to 100 minutes after administration). Melatonin may be equally as effective as standard treatment with midazolam in reducing preoperative anxiety in adults (measured 50 to 100 minutes after administration). The effect of melatonin on postoperative anxiety (measured 90 minutes and 6 hours after surgery) in adults is mixed but suggests an overall attenuation of the effect compared to preoperatively."

            "abstract": "Depressed patients often report problems sleeping, and epidemiologic evidence suggests that insomnia may precede the onset of depression. Insomnia is associated with marked impairment in quality of life and ability to function effectively. Many studies have indicated that patients with chronic sleep problems have impaired mood and that effective management of insomnia in depressed patients can markedly improve their depression. Diagnosis of insomnia is challenging because there can be many different causes and the clinical picture can be blurred by the presence of other psychiatric illnesses. Pharmacotherapy provides reliable and rapid relief from insomnia, whereas behavioral therapies help produce long-term improvement. For many years, benzodiazepines have been the mainstay of drug treatment for insomnia. However, these drugs have significant side effects, and tolerance and dependence have discouraged use. Many doctors use sedating antidepressants in low doses to treat chronic insomnia. However, there is little evidence supporting the efficacy of these agents, and many have adverse side effects, including impairment of sleep. The newer selective hypnotic drugs, including the imidazopyridines, may offer patients a better short-term alternative to benzodiazepines or sedating antidepressants."

Psychosis is common in patients with PD. When psychosis is induced by antiparkinson drugs, a dose reduction can be considered, but it is seldom successful. Patients with PD do not generally tolerate conventional antipsychotic medications, justifying evaluation of newer atypical agents in this population. Cholinesterase inhibitors have also become increasingly important in the treatment of PD in recent years. Finally, insomnia is a very frequent complaint in patients with PD and may also contribute to the development of depression.

All participants received an internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia. In addition, the participants in the support condition received weekly emails. Assessments were at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Both groups effectively ameliorated insomnia complaints. Adding support led to significantly higher effects on most sleep measures (d = 0.3-0.5; p < 0.05), self-reported insomnia severity (d = 0.4; p < 0.001), anxiety, and depressive symptoms (d = 0.4; p < 0.01). At the 6-month follow-up, these effects remained significant for sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, insomnia symptoms, and depressive symptoms (d = 0.3-0.5; p < 0.05). Providing support significantly enhances the benefits of internet-delivered treatment for insomnia on several variables.

Most of the studies used usual care (routine medical follow-up services) as the comparator. A few studies used a lower level or different type of intervention (e.g. stress management or exercise) or attention control as the comparator.We used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT B), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life C30 (EORTC C30), Quality of Life (QoL) Breast Cancer, and SF36 questionnaires to assess quality of life. HBMS programmes may increase breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life immediately after the intervention, as measured by FACT-B and EORTC C30 (FACT-B: mean difference (MD) 4.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.33 to 6.78, 7 studies, 764 participants; EORTC: MD 4.38, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.64, 6 studies; 299 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

HBMS programmes may decrease anxiety (MD of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -1.01, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.08, 5 studies, 253 participants, low-quality evidence) compared to control immediately after the intervention but the effect did not persist at four to six months. There was no evidence of improvements in depression immediately after HBMS (MD of HADS -1.36, 95% CI -2.94 to 0.22, 4 studies, 213 participants, low-quality evidence) or at follow-up.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder causing clinically significant distress and impairment. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with high societal and individual costs. Although cognitive behavioural treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is the preferred treatment, it is not used often. Offering CBT-I in an online format may increase access. Many studies have shown that online CBT for insomnia is effective. However, these studies have all been performed in general population samples recruited through media. This protocol article presents the design of a study aimed at establishing feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a guided online intervention (i-Sleep) for patients suffering from insomnia that seek help from their general practitioner as compared to care-as-usual.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, adult patients with insomnia disorder recruited through general practices are randomized to a 5-session guided online treatment, which is called \"i-Sleep\", or to care-as-usual. Patients in the care-as-usual condition will be offered i-Sleep 6 months after inclusion. An ancillary clinician, known as the psychological well-being practitioner who works in the GP practice (PWP; in Dutch: POH-GGZ), will offer online support after every session. Our aim is to recruit one hundred and sixty patients. Questionnaires, a sleep diary and wrist actigraphy will be administered at baseline, post intervention (at 8 weeks), and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up. Effectiveness will be established using insomnia severity as the main outcome. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (using costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) as outcome) will be conducted from a societal perspective. Secondary measures are: sleep diary, daytime consequences, fatigue, work and social adjustment, anxiety, alcohol use, depression and quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this trial will help establish whether online CBT-I is (cost-) effective and feasible in general practice as compared to care-as-usual. If it is, then quality of care might be increased because implementation of i-Sleep makes it easier to adhere to insomnia guidelines.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Several single-site alcohol treatment clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for immediate-release (IR) gabapentin in reducing drinking outcomes among individuals with alcohol dependence. The purpose of this study was to conduct a large, multisite clinical trial of gabapentin enacarbil extended-release (GE-XR) (HORIZANT® ), a gabapentin prodrug formulation, to determine its safety and efficacy in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Men and women (n = 346) who met DSM-5 criteria for at least moderate AUD were recruited across 10 U.S. clinical sites. Participants received double-blind GE-XR (600 mg twice a day) or placebo and a computerized behavioral intervention (Take Control) for 6 months. Efficacy analyses were prespecified for the last 4 weeks of the treatment period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The GE-XR and placebo groups did not differ significantly on the primary outcome measure, percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days (28.3 vs. 21.5, respectively, p = 0.157). Similarly, no clinical benefit was found for other drinking measures (percent subjects abstinent, percent days abstinent, percent heavy drinking days, drinks per week, drinks per drinking day), alcohol craving, alcohol-related consequences, sleep problems, smoking, and depression/anxiety symptoms. Common side-effects were fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence. A population pharmacokinetics analysis revealed that patients had lower gabapentin exposure levels compared with those in other studies using a similar dose but for other indications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, GE-XR at 600 mg twice a day did not reduce alcohol consumption or craving in individuals with AUD. It is possible that, unlike the IR formulation of gabapentin, which showed efficacy in smaller Phase 2 trials at a higher dose, GE-XR is not effective in treating AUD, at least not at doses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating other medical conditions."

The intervention consisted of 6 weeks of unsupported self-help CBT, and post-tests were 4, 18, and 48 weeks after intervention. At 4-week follow-up, electronic and paper-and-pencil conditions were superior (p < .01) compared to the waiting-list condition on most daily sleep measures (Δd = 0.29-0.64), global insomnia symptoms (Δd = 0.90-1.00), depression (Δd = 0.36-0.41), and anxiety symptoms (Δd = 0.33-0.40). The electronic and paper-and-pencil groups demonstrated equal effectiveness 4 weeks after treatment (Δd = 0.00-0.22; p > .05). Effects were sustained at 48-week follow-up. This large-scale unsupported self-help study shows moderate to large effects on sleep measures that were still present after 48 weeks. Unsupported self-help CBT for insomnia therefore appears to be a promising first option in a stepped care approach."

            "abstract": "Objective: Epilepsy is a chronic disease that places a heavy burden on caregivers. Previous studies have shown that caregivers of epilepsy patients often experience anxiety and depression; however, few comprehensive studies have assessed their sleep quality and family function. Based on the current understanding of the anxiety and depression state of caregivers in children with epilepsy, we further explored the caregivers' sleep and family function and evaluated the predictors of the depression state of caregivers. Methods: In this cross-sectional online anonymous survey, we sent an online questionnaire to the caregivers of children with epilepsy who visited our hospital. The QR code of the questionnaire was scanned at the follow-up course to conduct an online survey. The questionnaire contained questions about sociodemographic and clinical information, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Family Assessment Device. Results: A total of 308 caregivers of children with epilepsy aged 0-12 years were included in this study. The mean age of children with epilepsy was 4.8 ± 3.18 years, and the average illness duration was 34.2 ± 29.18 months. Further, 47.1% of the children took three or more anti-seizure medications, and 43.2% were on ketogenic diet therapy. We found that in 77.9% of the cases, the subjects were the mothers, in 89% there was more than one co-caregiver, and in 51.9%, financial help was required. Further, 63.6% of the caregivers thought they could not get enough access to disease knowledge education, and 83.7% perceived epilepsy was a terrible disease. Our results also showed that 65.6% of the caregivers were in depression status, 41.9% were in anxiety status, and 49.0% had poor sleep quality. The proportion of unhealthy family functioning in each subscale was 45.1-96.1%, and the unhealthy behavior control function accounted for 96.1%. Binary logistic regression analysis of the data showed that without co-caregivers [odds ratio (OR), 5.193], free of anxiety status (OR, 0.063), good sleep quality (OR, 0.446), healthy family role dimension (OR, 0.344), and healthy family general functional dimension (OR, 0.259) were predictors of depression status in caregivers of children with epilepsy. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression status are common in caregivers of children with epilepsy, with depression status being more prominent. Moreover, a considerable proportion of caregivers had poor sleep quality and unhealthy family function. The caregivers' anxiety status, sleep quality, family role dimension, family general function dimension, and the number of co-caregivers were predictors of depression status in caregivers. In clinical practice, caregivers' anxiety and depression status, poor sleep quality, and unhealthy family functioning should be addressed along with the treatment of children with epilepsy."

There is insufficient evidence of how best to treat the consequences of mTBI. In a randomized, clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy of telephone-delivered problem-solving treatment (PST) on psychological and physical symptoms in 356 post-deployment active duty service members from Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Members with medically confirmed mTBI sustained during deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan within the previous 24 months received PST or education-only (EO) interventions. The PST group received up to 12 biweekly telephone calls from a counselor for subject-selected problems. Both groups received 12 educational brochures describing common mTBI and post-deployment problems, with follow-up for all at 6 months (end of PST), and at 12 months. At 6 months, the PST group significantly improved on a measure of psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory; BSI-18) compared to the EO group (p = 0.005), but not on post-concussion symptoms (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire [RPQ]; p = 0.19), the two primary endpoints. However, these effects did not persist at 12-month follow-up (BSI, p = 0.54; RPQ, p = 0.45). The PST group also had significant short-term improvement on secondary endpoints, including sleep (p = 0.01), depression (p = 0.03), post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.04), and physical functioning (p = 0.03). Participants preferred PST over EO (p < 0.001). Telephone-delivered PST appears to be a well-accepted treatment that offers promise for reducing psychological distress after combat-related mTBI and could be a useful adjunct treatment post-mTBI.

Thirty-two participants were enrolled in a pilot randomized controlled trial: half of them were assigned to a 3-month waiting list before receiving the four \"acceptance and commitment therapy-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia\" treatment sessions using videoconference. The primary outcome was sleep quality as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. All participants also filled out questionnaires about quality of life, use of hypnotics, depression and anxiety, acceptance, mindfulness, thought suppression, as well as a sleep diary at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. A large effect size was found for Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, but also daytime improvements, with increased quality of life and acceptance at post-treatment endpoint in acceptance and commitment therapy-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia participants. Improvement in Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was maintained at the 6-month follow-up.

Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4 months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior, resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take precedence when making referrals. Implications of COVID-19 on treatment provision and trial outcomes are discussed."

However, the mechanisms by which dCBT-I reduces and prevents depression is less clear. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: dCBT-I (N=358), or online sleep education as the control condition (N=300). Outcome variables were measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up, and included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ). The analyses tested change in PTQ scores as a mediator for post-treatment insomnia, post-treatment depression, and incident depression at one-year follow-up. Results Reductions in rumination (PTQ) were significantly larger in the dCBT-I condition compared to control. Results also showed that reductions in rumination significantly mediated the improvement in post-treatment insomnia severity (proportional effect = 11%) and post-treatment depression severity (proportional effect = 19%) associated with the dCBT-I condition. Finally, reductions in rumination also significantly mediated the prevention of clinically significant depression via dCBT-I (proportional effect = 42%).

Over the course of 2 weeks, participants completed daily questionnaires assessing daily stress, PSA, and sleep quality. Results indicated that indirect effects from stress to sleep quality via PSA were statistically significant at low and high levels of rumination and worry, and people at high levels of rumination and worry had stronger relationships between stress and PSA.

Twenty-three unmedicated outpatients with MDD and 20 matched nondepressed controls completed rs-fcMRI scans after which the MDD group received an average of 12 sessions of psychotherapy. The mean change in Beck Depression Inventory-II scores after psychotherapy was 12.04 points, a clinically meaningful response. Resting-state neuroimaging data were analyzed with a seed-based approach to investigate functional connectivity with four canonical resting-state networks: the default mode network, the dorsal attention network, the executive control network, and the salience network. At baseline, the MDD group was characterized by relative hyperconnectivity of multiple regions with precuneus, anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seeds and by relative hypoconnectivity with intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and dACC seeds. Additionally, connectivity of the precuneus with the left middle temporal gyrus and connectivity of the dACC with the parahippocampal gyrus predicted the magnitude of pretreatment MDD symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that response to psychotherapy in the MDD group was predicted by pretreatment connectivity of the right insula with the right middle temporal gyrus and the left intraparietal sulcus with the orbital frontal cortex. These results add to the nascent body of literature investigating pretreatment rs-fcMRI predictors of antidepressant treatment response and is the first study to examine rs-fcMRI predictors of response to psychotherapy."

Antidepressants in general (8 of 9 treatments) were more effective for core emotional symptoms than for sleep or atypical symptoms. Differences in efficacy between drugs were often greater than the difference in efficacy between treatments and placebo. For example, high-dose duloxetine outperformed escitalopram in treating core emotional symptoms (effect size, 2.3 HAM-D points during 8 weeks, 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.1; P < .001), but escitalopram was not significantly different from placebo (effect size, 0.03 HAM-D points; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.8; P = .94).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      Two common checklists used to measure depressive severity can produce statistically reliable clusters of symptoms.

            "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. \"Lifestyle Medicine\" provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts."

This study aimed to characterize beliefs and attitudes of Portuguese physicians regarding the prescription, management challenges, benefits, risks and withdrawal effects of BZD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional, observational study with online data collection through anonymous self-administered questionnaire. Physicians registered with the Portuguese Medical Association were invited to participate through direct e-mail message. Physicians were asked to give their opinion (using a 5-points Likert scale) regarding the prescription of BZD, their benefits and risks in the management of insomnia and anxiety, the possible adverse effects of chronic use and alternative non-pharmacologic approaches. Descriptive statistics were used and groups were compared through logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 329 physicians participated in the study (56% family physicians). Mean age was 44.10 ± 15.2 years, with 19.03 ± 14.9 years of clinical experience. Fifty eight percent of participants were female. Physicians reported BZD's negative impact on cognitive function (89%), association with road traffic accidents (88%) and falls (79%). Also, 58% shared the belief that chronic use is justified if the patient feels better and without adverse events. Although 68% reported to feel capable of helping patients to reduce or stop BZD, 55% recognized difficulties in motivating them. Compared to other medical specialists (altogether), family physicians were significantly more aware about the adverse effects of BZD and considered that chronic use may not be justified. Conversely, more family physicians expressed concerns about their skills to motivate patients engaging in withdrawal programs and to support them during the process.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our results show that physicians' awareness about risks of BZD chronic use is adequate though their attitudes and self-perceived skills towards promoting BZD withdrawal can be improved. Interventions in primary care are needed to capacitate physicians to better motivate patients for BZD withdrawal."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders among university students; however, many students go untreated due to treatment costs, stigma concerns, and limited access to trained mental health professionals. These barriers are heightened in universities in India, where there are scant mental health care services and severe stigma surrounding help seeking.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of Internet-based, or \"online,\" cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based unguided and guided self-help interventions (using the programs GAD Online and Lantern, respectively) to reduce GAD symptoms in students with clinical and subthreshold GAD and, ultimately, reduce the prevalence and incidence of GAD among the student population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Students will be recruited via 3 colleges in Hyderabad, India, and referred for a campus-wide online screening. Self-report data will be collected entirely online. A total of 300 qualifying students will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive GAD Online, Lantern, or to be in a wait-list control condition, stratified by clinical and subthreshold GAD symptomatology. Students will complete a postintervention assessment after 3 months and a follow-up assessment 6 months later, at which point students in the wait-list control condition will receive one of the programs. The primary outcome is GAD symptom severity at 3 months postintervention. Secondary outcomes include GAD caseness at 9 months, other anxiety and depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and functional measures (eg, sleep, social functioning) at 3 and 9 months, respectively. Primary analyses will be differences between each of the intervention groups and the wait-list control group, analyzed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis using mixed-design ANOVA.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study commenced in February 2015. The sample was recruited over a 3-week period at each college. The trial is expected to end in December 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This trial will be the first to evaluate the use of Internet-based CBT programs compared with a wait-list control group for the treatment of GAD among students in Indian universities. If effective, these programs have the potential to reduce the mental health care treatment gap by providing readily accessible, private, and cost-effective evidence-based care to students with GAD who do not currently receive the treatment they need.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02410265 http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02410265 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6ddqH6Rbt)."

            "abstract": "Fatigue is usually defined as a subjective perception of lacking energy, mentally or physically, with a difficulty sustaining voluntary activities. It is a common symptom of many diseases and most likely has a multifactorial cause. In myasthenia gravis (MG), fatigue has a high prevalence and is correlated with female sex and disease severity. However, no large scale studies have been performed. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate fatigue in the Dutch participants (n = 420) of the Dutch-Belgian Myasthenia Patient Registry using an online survey. Additional information was obtained on mood, sleep, coping, quality of life, disease severity, physical activities and medication. Severe fatigue was present in 62% with a mean score of 37.1 ± 13.2 points. Fatigue severity and prevalence increased significantly with disease severity. A positive correlation was found for female gender, BMI, disease severity and depressive symptoms. A negative correlation was found for strenuous physical activities and older age. The strong association with disease severity suggests that fatigue should be recognized as an element of the symptomatology of MG. The observed association between strenuous activity and fatigue and differences in coping style between fatigued and non-fatigued patients warrant future clinical trials on exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy."

            "abstract": "This study aimed to assess whether the transdiagnostic therapy elements of an online cognitive behaviour therapy anxiety program also impact on sleep-related problems (SRPs) in anxious youth. Participants were drawn from two previously published studies evaluating online cognitive behaviour therapy for child anxiety (BRAVE-ONLINE). The study included 63 children 7-12 years of age (M = 9.49, SD = 1.37) and 71 adolescents 12-18 years of age (M = 13.90, SD = 1.68). SRPs, severity of anxiety diagnosis, anxiety symptoms, number of diagnoses, depressive symptoms, and global functioning were assessed at pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up assessment points. SRPs were positively related to anxiety symptoms and severity for children and were positively related to depression for adolescents. SRPs did not differ between male and female participants, between children and adolescents, or between those who had generalised anxiety disorder in their profile and those who did not. Finally, children but not adolescents participating in the online program demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in SRPs from pre- to posttreatment compared to the waitlist group, and these gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Treatment focusing on child anxiety alone may reduce SRPs in children but not adolescents. Although further research is clearly needed, clinicians should ensure that they assess for SRPs in their teenage clients and directly target SRPs in treatment where required."

Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may benefit people with Parkinson's. The objective of the paper is to examine the appropriateness, feasibility, and potential cost-effectiveness of an online mindfulness intervention, designed to reduce anxiety and depression for people with Parkinson's. We conducted a feasibility randomized control trial and qualitative interviews. Anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, impact on daily activities and health-related quality of life were measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 20 weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the intervention. Participants were randomized to the Skype delivered mindfulness group (n = 30) or wait-list (n = 30). Participants in the mindfulness group were also given a mindfulness manual and a CD with mindfulness meditations. The intervention did not show any significant effects in the primary or secondary outcome measures. However, there was a significant increase in the quality of life measure. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be £27,107 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year gained. Also, the qualitative study showed that mindfulness is a suitable and acceptable intervention. It appears feasible to run a trial delivering mindfulness through Skype, and people with Parkinson's found the sessions acceptable and helpful."

Innovative programs are needed to support both maternal mental health and parenting, and to buffer the long-term impacts of stress on young children. Using a patient-oriented approach, our research team aimed to co-develop and pilot test an App-based psychoeducation and social-connection platform: Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The co-development process involved a parent advisory board from conceptualization and design, through to direct participation in the program delivery. The BEAM program includes weekly videos and activities based on Unified Protocol therapy modules and emotion-focused parenting strategies, a weekly telehealth group review session, and access to a private online forum for support from other mothers and clinical coaches. A parallel randomized control trial was conducted across two provinces in Canada. Mothers of preschool children (aged 18-36 months old), with moderate-to-severe depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9 ≥ 10), were recruited online and randomized to either the 10-week BEAM intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) control group. Online surveys (ensuring researcher blinding) included questions about feasibility and acceptability of the program and pre/post self-report measures of mental health, parenting, positive coping and child behavior outcomes. The primary outcome measures were symptoms of depression and parenting stress. Data were analyzed using mixed models and an intention-to-treat approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      65 participants were randomized, by an online allocation tool, to the BEAM (n = 33) and TAU (n = 32) groups. Engagement was relatively high at the beginning of the program, with 78.8% starting the BEAM App and 70.6% attending ≥1 telehealth session. Most respondents felt socially supported, satisfied with the App, and found it easy to use. Pre-post results indicated interaction effects with greater reductions in overall mental health problems, and specifically anxiety and sleep symptoms, among BEAM vs. control participants. There were also time effects with reductions in depression symptoms across both groups. No significant treatment effects emerged for the other mental health symptoms, parenting problems, positive coping, or child behavior outcomes. Descriptive data are included to highlight possible areas of promise for future large efficacy trials. Technological difficulties and other challenges that may have led to attrition and impacted outcomes are discussed. There were no adverse events related to study participation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The BEAM program has promise as a novel, feasible and acceptable intervention for improving mental health among mothers of young children.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical trial registration:\n        \n      \n      [www.ClinicalTrials.gov], identifier [NCT04772677]."

Prevalence of sleep disorders in migrants and refugees ranges between 39 and 99%. In migrant workers, stress related to integration and adaptation to the host society is connected to higher risks of snoring, metabolic diseases, and insomnia. Sleep disturbances in refugees are predicted by past war experience. Sleep difficulties in adult and child refugees are strongly correlated to trauma. Torture of parents and grandparents can predict sleep disorders in refugee children, while being accompanied by parents to the host country has a protective effect on children's sleep.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and implications:\n        \n      \n      Considering the differences in risk factors, vulnerability, and traumatic life events for different migrant populations, origins of sleep difficulties vary, depending on the migrant populations. Effects on sleep disturbances and sleep quality may be a result of integration in the host country, including changes of lifestyle, such as diet and working hours with implication for OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea) and insomnia. Compared with migrant populations, sleep disturbances in refugee populations are more correlated with mental health symptoms and disorders, especially PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), than with psychosocial problems. In juvenile refugee populations, psychological problems and disturbed sleep are associated with traumatic experiences during their journey to the host country. Findings highlight the need for expert recommendations for development of 3P approach stratified in the following: (1) prediction, including structured exploration of predisposing and precipitating factors that may trigger acute insomnia, screening of the according sleep disorders by validated translated questionnaires and sleep diaries, and a face-to-face or virtual setting and screening of OSAS; (2) target prevention by sleep health education for female and male refugees and migrant workers, including shift workers; and (3) personalized medical approach, including translated cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) and imagery rehearsal therapy for refugees and telehealth programs for improved CPAP adherence in migrants, with the goal to enable better sleep health quality and improved health economy."

            "abstract": "This study compared Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) and Relaxation Therapy (RLT) as treatments for insomnia in a sample of community-residing elderly (mean age, 69.7 years). SRT subjects (n = 10) and RLT subjects (n = 12) reported information about their sleep twice daily to a telephone recording machine for 2 weeks of baseline, 4 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks at 3-month follow-up. Results showed sleep latency and waking after sleep onset were significantly reduced for both treatment groups under active treatment. Predictable reductions in time in bed and improved sleep efficiency reported during active treatment by SRT subjects were still apparent at 3-month follow-up; no corresponding changes were found for RLT. In both groups, increased total sleep time was reported at follow-up; the improvement for SRT subjects was approximately twice that seen in RLT. These findings, at this early stage in the development of behavioral treatments for insomnia in older adults, encourage further study."

We included randomized and nonrandomized and controlled and noncontrolled clinical trials and interventions focused on physical therapy as treatment for sleep bruxism or awake bruxism. Two reviewers independently screened the records, examined full-text reports for compliance with the eligibility criteria, and extracted data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The present review found 1296 articles. We excluded 766 duplicated articles and 461 irrelevant articles and selected 69 titles to read. Forty-five of these were excluded, leading to a total of 24 that met the eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis. The articles were grouped into 7 treatment methods used in physical therapy. The treatment methods were electrotherapeutic (14 articles), cognitive-behavioral therapy (3 articles), therapeutic exercises (2 articles), acupuncture (2 articles), postural awareness (1 article), muscular relaxation (1 article), and massage (1 article). Results and conclusions, methodological quality, and quality of evidence of each study were reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results suggest very low-quality evidence that diverse methods used in physical therapy improve muscle pain and activity, mouth opening, oral health, anxiety, stress, depression, temporomandibular disorder, and head posture in individuals with bruxism. This finding is mainly a result of the poor methodological quality of most of the studies."

Research has revealed similarities to substance-related disorders. There are often associations with other mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, as well as disturbed sleep patterns, increased risk taking, nicotine abuse, an unbalanced diet, and lack of exercise. Female adolescents are statistically significantly more often affected than male adolescents (7.1% versus 4.5%). The German STICA study, the first randomized controlled trial worldwide, demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy was effective compared with a waiting group (odds ratio 10.10, 95% confidence interval [3.69; 27.65]).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Internet-related disorders have not yet been conclusively conceptualized and operationalized.

            "abstract": "In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a number of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially sleep issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and treatment options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers' needs are rare. We devised a 4-week online cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compared sleep outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient treatment for shift-workers (n = 12) using a sleep diary and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Results showed significant improvements in sleep efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the rate of improvement in sleep efficiency across four weeks of treatment between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO-5) and insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symptoms of depression (BDI-II and MADRS scores) and insomnia symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, CBT-I significantly improved sleep efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbeing, symptoms of insomnia, and depression. The findings of this study demonstrate online CBT-I as a feasible approach for treating insomnia in shift-workers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed."

Recent investigations suggest that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, provide a physiological link between the serotonin system and the GSK-3β/Wnt pathway through neuroinflammation. We review the pharmacological, translational and brain imaging studies that support a role for microglia in regulating neurotransmitter synthesis and immune cell activation. These investigations provide a model for microglia involvement in the pathophysiology and phenotype of BD that may translate into improved therapies."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Fatigue is a common symptom among cancer survivors that can be successfully treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Insights into the working mechanisms of CBT are currently limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improvements in targeted cognitive-behavioral variables and reduced depressive symptoms mediate the fatigue-reducing effect of CBT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We pooled data from three randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of CBT to reduce severe fatigue. In all three trials, fatigue severity (checklist individual strength) decreased significantly following CBT. Assessments were conducted pre-treatment and 6 months later. Classical mediation analysis testing a pre-specified model was conducted and its results compared to those of causal discovery, an explorative data-driven approach testing all possible causal associations and retaining the most likely model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 250 cancer survivors (n = 129 CBT, n = 121 waitlist) were analyzed. Classical mediation analysis suggests that increased self-efficacy and decreased fatigue catastrophizing, focusing on symptoms, perceived problems with activity and depressive symptoms mediate the reduction of fatigue brought by CBT. Conversely, causal discovery and post-hoc analyses indicate that fatigue acts as mediator, not outcome, of changes in cognitions, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cognitions, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms improve during CBT. When assessed pre- and post-treatment, fatigue acts as a mediator, not outcome, of these improvements. It seems likely that the working mechanism of CBT is not a one-way causal effect but a dynamic reciprocal process. Trials integrating intermittent assessments are needed to shed light on these mechanisms and inform optimization of CBT."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Corticosteroids are documented as associated with psychological adverse effects, including insomnia, irritability, aggression, neuropsychological deficits, mood disorders (including severe depression), delirium, and psychosis. Given the severity of these potential adverse effects and that corticosteroid use is central to the treatment of most hematological malignancies, it would be expected that a thorough research literature would exist on the effects of corticosteroid use in hematology. However, scant research is available. This leaves many questions unanswered and a vacuum for clinical practice. Thus, there is a strong need for empirical data, not only on the psychological adverse effects experienced by patients, but also on the coping strategies patients use to manage them.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To present findings on the coping strategies used by ten hematology patients in Australia undergoing treatment involving corticosteroids as a first step in understanding the emotional and psychological effects experienced by this group of patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The pilot study was conducted from January 2007 until March 2008.The study participants were ten hematology outpatients (eight with multiple myeloma, two with acute immune thrombocytopenia purpura) from two major Australian public hospitals (Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, and Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Western Australia) who were taking dexamethasone and/or prednisolone and referred to the study by their treating hematologists on the basis that they were experiencing difficulties with their corticosteroid therapy.Data were collected through an iterative, phenomenological, qualitative research methodology using open-ended interviews. Interview transcriptions were entered into the QSR NUD*IST (Non-numeric, Unstructured Data * Index and Searching Technology) computer program and analyzed thematically.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Coping strategies found to be helpful by patients included believing that corticosteroids are necessary for disease control, knowing that the negative emotional states being experienced are due to the corticosteroids, stoicism and self-reliance based on a cognitive-rational approach, keeping busy, remaining fit and active, and, for some, using antidepressants to help with mood swings. For sleep disturbances, patients found it helpful to try to accept the sleeplessness, engage in distraction, and have light sleeps. Support from family and friends who understand the range of corticosteroid adverse effects, including patients' need to withdraw during treatment, was seen as important. Counseling was not considered helpful. Tapering corticosteroid doses and cessation of corticosteroids were also discussed as aids to coping.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings provide a start to understanding how individuals cope with corticosteroid therapy for hematological conditions.

Clinical data of 14 children with MPS VI who were followed up at the Department of Pediatrics of the Gazi University Faculty of Medicine in Ankara, Turkey were retrospectively collected from the patients' medical records. Patients were selected based on availability of a pre-ERT baseline and follow-up clinical data for a similar period of time (1.9-3.2 years). Event data (occurrence of acute clinical events, onset of chronic events, surgeries) collected during hospital visits and telemedicine were available for up to 10 years after initiation of ERT (2.5-10 years).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Age at initiation of ERT ranged from 2.8 to 15.8 years (mean age 7.5 years).

            "abstract": "Sleep is a crucial factor for human health and is closely related to quality of life. Sleep disturbances constitute a health problem that should be solved, especially when it affects the elderly. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICT) interventions in managing sleep disturbances in the elderly. The study used a systematic review of three databases: Ovid-Medline, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane library database for papers published till 15 April 2021. Two authors independently selected and screened relevant studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out using Review Manager 5.4. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 4297 studies considering both inclusion and exclusion criteria. The complete texts of 47 articles were then evaluated, 31 articles were excluded, and finally, 16 articles were selected. Our meta-analysis showed that the cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) group had a significantly reduced Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) compared to the control group (-4.81 [-5.56, -4.06], p < 0.00001, I2 = 83%) in RCTs, with a significant reduction in ISI (3.47 [1.58, 5.35], p = 0.0003) found in quasi-experimental studies. A significant improvement was found in total sleep time in the CBT-I group compared to the control group (29.24 [15.41, 43.07], p <0.0001) in RCTs, while the CBT-I group showed significantly reduced wake time after sleep onset compared to the control group (-20.50 [-26.60, -14.41], p < 0.00001). In addition, a significant reduction in depression was found in the CBT-I group compared to the control group (-2.11 [-2.85, -1.37], p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%) in RCTs. The quality of life-mental component score (5.75 [1.64, 9.87], p = 0.006, I2 = 0%) and the quality of life-physical component score (5.19 [0.76, 9.62], p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) showed significant improvement in the CBT-I group compared to the control group. ICT interventions showed positive effects on sleep disturbances of the elderly, specifically confirming the positive effect on depression and quality of life as well as the indicators directly related to sleep such as ISI and quality of sleep. Thus, the application of ICT in the healthcare sector will be greater in the future, with changes in the nursing education and practice guidelines so that nurses can play a pivotal role in promoting health behaviors such as sleep-related quality of life and daily activities of the elderly."

            "abstract": "Background: Despite cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) being the recommended treatment for insomnia disorder, its access remains very limited. Automated Internet-delivered CBT-I (eCBT-I) is an emerging cost-effective strategy for adults with insomnia, however no such program is currently available in French Language. We evaluated a French-speaking, eCBT-I intervention to improve insomnia disorder in comparison to minimal psychoeducation therapy (mPT). Methods: Forty-six adults with insomnia disorder were randomly allocated to eCBT-I or mPT. The eCBT-I program consisted of seven sessions that delivered the typical components of CBT-I during 12 weeks. The mPT provided structured and non-tailored information about sleep and insomnia during a 1 h session. Insomnia severity Index (ISI, primary outcome), measures of fatigue, sleepiness, anxiety, depressive symptoms and quality of life were collected at baseline and endpoint. Electronic sleep diaries were completed over 2 week periods pre- and post-intervention. Results: Compared to mPT, eCBT-I resulted in greater decrease in ISI scores between baseline and endpoint. Sleep diaries parameters improved in both groups, with a greater improvement in the eCBT-I group. Patients allocated to eCBT-I group also improved depressive, fatigue, anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. Among patients with CNS-active drug at baseline, 91.7% reduced or stopped their hypnotic medication, and 16.7% in the mPT group. Conclusions: The present eCBT-I program seems feasible, acceptable and effective in reducing insomnia severity and insomnia-related functional outcomes in this small clinically-derived population. Given the high prevalence of insomnia, our data are supportive of the use of such program as an effective alternative to treat insomnia in daily clinical practice in French speaking countries."

Symptoms and syndromes that are reported after HCT include sexual dysfunction, cognitive problems, fatigue, insomnia, musculoskeletal symptoms, emotional distress, anger, and depression. Addressing these complex potential or actual complications requires diligent routine health care to intervene early or, when possible, to prevent late complications. To accomplish early detection and prevention of life-threatening complications, HCT survivors should undergo an annual comprehensive physical examination that includes screening for functional and psychosocial consequences of treatment and encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviors.

From March 2010 to June 2011, we enrolled 40 of 45 eligible participants (n = 20 per group), average age 15 ± 2.1 years, 7 participants were male. Compared with the control group, the experimental group experienced significantly less overall pain at all time points, with moderate to large effect sizes at T2, T3 (p ≤ .007). Worst pain in 24 hours was moderately decreased at T2 (p = .01). State-trait anxiety remained high. On a 10-point scale, a median 2.5-point benefit was seen in eating and sleeping (Mann-Whitney test, p = .002), and 2 points in walking (Mann-Whitney test, p = .003). Coping strategies showed no significant differences. Addition of a guided imagery and relaxation exercise DVD for home use was more effective than standard care alone for postoperative pain. Our nonpharmacologic adjunct looks promising. Larger sample size and longer (6-9 months) follow-up will permit refinement."

Extreme overloading experienced internally may not be externally visible. Identifying stressful situations at an early stage may avoid socially problematic behaviour from occurring, such as self-injurious behaviour. Activation of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) is involved in the response to anxiety, which can be measured through heart rate variability and skin conductance with the use of portable devices, non-intrusively and pain-free. Thus, developing innovative analysis of signal perception and reaction is necessary, mainly for non-communicative individuals with autism.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The protocol will take place in real life (home and social environments).

ASD and control participants will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events.

            "abstract": "The 5-HT7 receptor has recently received considerable attention since its involvement has been implicated in cognitive disturbances, sleep and circadian rhythmicity disorders, anxiety and depression. At the cellular level, 5-HT7 receptors increase the excitability of excitatory cells and appear to modulate both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus. It has been proposed that 5-HT7 receptors also modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in the raphe nuclei and these effects may play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Repeated administration of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist induced functional desensitization of the 5-HT7 receptor system at the level of its reactivity and effector proteins. These effects resemble the outcome of treatment of rats with antidepressant drugs. Chronic stress and elevated level of corticosterone increase the reactivity of 5-HT7 receptors in the hippocampus. Treatment of rats with a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist also results in attenuation of glutamatergic transmission in the frontal cortex and it prevents the occurrence of stress-induced modifications of glutamatergic transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT7 receptor antagonism might, potentially, be used for the treatment of cognitive deficits and mood disorders."

These findings indicate that internet-delivered CBT is feasible and potentially promising for improving sleep and reducing psychiatric symptoms in adolescent psychiatric patients with insomnia and co-morbid psychiatric disorders. A larger randomised trial is warranted to verify these preliminary results."

            "abstract": "Internet-delivered interventions are emerging as a strategy to address barriers to care for individuals with chronic pain. This is the first large multicenter randomized controlled trial of Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric chronic pain. Participants included were 273 adolescents (205 females and 68 males), aged 11 to 17 years with mixed chronic pain conditions and their parents, who were randomly assigned in a parallel-group design to Internet-delivered CBT (n = 138) or Internet-delivered Education (n = 135). Assessments were completed before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. All data collection and procedures took place online. The primary analysis used linear growth models. Results demonstrated significantly greater reduction on the primary outcome of activity limitations from baseline to 6-month follow-up for Internet CBT compared with Internet education (b = -1.13, P = 0.03). On secondary outcomes, significant beneficial effects of Internet CBT were found on sleep quality (b = 0.14, P = 0.04), on reducing parent miscarried helping (b = -2.66, P = 0.007) and protective behaviors (b = -0.19, P = 0.001), and on treatment satisfaction (P values < 0.05). On exploratory outcomes, benefits of Internet CBT were found for parent-perceived impact (ie, reductions in depression, anxiety, self-blame about their adolescent's pain, and improvement in parent behavioral responses to pain). In conclusion, our Internet-delivered CBT intervention produced a number of beneficial effects on adolescent and parent outcomes, and could ultimately lead to wide dissemination of evidence-based psychological pain treatment for youth and their families."

            "abstract": "As a field, psychiatry is undergoing an exciting paradigm shift toward early identification and intervention that will likely minimize both the burden associated with severe mental illnesses as well as their duration. In this context, the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine has revolutionized our understanding of antidepressant response and greatly expanded the pharmacologic armamentarium for treatment-resistant depression. Efforts to characterize biomarkers of ketamine response support a growing emphasis on early identification, which would allow clinicians to identify biologically enriched subgroups with treatment-resistant depression who are more likely to benefit from ketamine therapy. This chapter presents a broad overview of a range of translational biomarkers, including those drawn from imaging and electrophysiological studies, sleep and circadian rhythms, and HPA axis/endocrine function as well as metabolic, immune, (epi)genetic, and neurotrophic biomarkers related to ketamine response. Ketamine's unique, rapid-acting properties may serve as a model to explore a whole new class of novel rapid-acting treatments with the potential to revolutionize drug development and discovery. However, it should be noted that although several of the biomarkers reviewed here provide promising insights into ketamine's mechanism of action, most studies have focused on acute rather than longer-term antidepressant effects and, at present, none of the biomarkers are ready for clinical use."

Additionally, impulsivity, hostility, demanding, physical discomfort, anxiety for health, emotionality and suicidal tendency are also defined in these people. Personality characteristics in these patients are depression, hysteria and hypochondriac features. Besides these symptom clusters, more severe psychopathologies like personality disorders may be encountered in these patients. Sertraline, paroxetine and nortriptyline can be considered as the first-line antidepressants in the psychopharmacological treatment of tinnitus. There are studies which have reported the efficacy of sulpiride. Carbamazepine, valproate and gabapentin can be effective as mood stabilizers. Short-acting benzodiazepines like alprazolam and midazolam are effective in signs of anxiety. Clonazepam and diazepam can be evaluated as other options. However, some glutamate receptor antagonists also can be used in the treatment of tinnitus. Disturbed sleep is frequently associated with tinnitus. Sleep disturbance can disrupt the quality of life in the patients with tinnitus. These patients might benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy, which offers the promise of relief from tinnitus-related distress and insomnia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      When pathophysiologic reasons are excluded, it should be at least considered that tinnitus is exaggerated by psychopathological symptoms.

Hypotheses were tested in a mixed clinical sample of community individuals presenting for a treatment study (n = 151) who were followed up 1-, 3- and 6-months after treatment. Results indicated that the anxiety sensitivity intervention resulted in reductions in insomnia symptoms and clinically significant insomnia scores at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. These reductions remained significant when covarying for concurrent reductions in depression and anxiety. Models accounted for 15-54% of the variance in follow-up insomnia symptoms. Current findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting anxiety sensitivity may play a causal role in insomnia symptoms. Results also suggest that targeting anxiety sensitivity may be an effective way to reduce insomnia symptoms in a brief and portable intervention that also reduces symptoms commonly comorbid with insomnia disorder."

Meta-effect estimates (Hedge's g) were computed using data from 23 studies. Results indicate beneficial effects following training for mindfulness (g = 0.45, p < .001) and stress (g = 0.56, p < .001), anxiety (g = 0.62, p < .001) and psychological distress (g = 0.69, p < .001), and for well-being (g = 0.46, p = .002) and sleep (g = 0.26, p = .003). No conclusions could be drawn from pooled data for burnout due to ambivalence in results, for depression due to publication bias, or for work performance due to insufficient data.

Fifteen studies (1,811 participants) met the inclusion criteria, with nine studies targeting tinnitus distress, five considering hearing loss, and one for vestibular difficulties. Only the tinnitus and hearing loss Internet intervention studies were eligible for data synthesis. Internet-based interventions for hearing loss were diverse. Overall, they showed no significant effects, although a statistically significant moderate effect (d = 0.59) was found after removing the study with the highest risk of bias (as a result of high attrition). Most Internet-based interventions for tinnitus provided cognitive behavioural therapy. They yielded statistically significant mean effect sizes for reducing tinnitus distress compared with both inactive (d = 0.59) and active controls (d = 0.32). Significant effects were also present for the secondary outcomes of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and quality of life (combined effect d = 0.28). Only Internet-based interventions for tinnitus evaluated the 1-year postintervention effects indicated that results were maintained long term (d = 0.45). Scientific study quality was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and found to vary from very low to moderate. This review indicates the potential of Internet interventions for tinnitus to provide evidence-based accessible care.

Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, sound enrichment using ear-level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co-morbid symptoms such as sleep difficulties, anxiety or depression. As yet, no drug has been approved for tinnitus by a regulatory body. Nonetheless, over 100,000 prescriptions for betahistine are being filled every month in England, and nearly 10% of general practitioners prescribe betahistine for tinnitus.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects of betahistine in patients with subjective idiopathic tinnitus.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials.

Four studies were parallel-group RCTs and one had a cross-over design. The risk of bias was unclear in all of the included studies.Due to heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and measurement methods used, very limited data pooling was possible. When we pooled the data from two studies for the primary outcome tinnitus loudness, the mean difference on a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale at one-month follow-up was not significant between betahistine and placebo (-0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.01 to 0.70; 81 participants) (very low-quality evidence). There were no reports of upper gastrointestinal discomfort (significant adverse effect) in any study.As a secondary outcome, one study found no difference in the change in the Tinnitus Severity Index between betahistine and placebo (mean difference at 12 weeks 0.02, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.09; 50 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). None of the studies reported the other secondary outcomes of changes in depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health-related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor tinnitus intrusiveness.Other adverse effects that were reported were not treatment-related.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is an absence of evidence to suggest that betahistine has an effect on subjective idiopathic tinnitus when compared to placebo. The evidence suggests that betahistine is generally well tolerated with a similar risk of adverse effects to placebo treatments. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, using GRADE, ranged from moderate to very low.If future research into the effectiveness of betahistine in patients with tinnitus is felt to be warranted, it should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the development of validated, patient-centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus."

It is also unknown whether the uptake of online programs can be improved by health professional recommendations, or whether parents require additional prompts and reminders to use the program. In this study we aim to: (1) determine whether weekly email prompts increase engagement with and use of a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying, (2) determine whether encouragement from a maternal and child health nurse promotes greater engagement with and use of the program, (3) examine who uses a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying; and, (4) examine the psychosocial characteristics of participants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This study is a randomised, parallel group, superiority trial, with all participating primary carers of infants aged 2 to 12 weeks, receiving access to the online program.

However, a large number of patients with epilepsy elect to use alternative artisanal CBD products due to cost or access constraints. Despite widespread availability and variety of these artisanal CBD products, studies evaluating their safety or efficacy are rare, making conclusions about clinical utility uncertain. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of artisanal CBD product use with quality of life, mental health, healthcare utilization, and epilepsy-specific outcomes within a large, observational cohort of people with epilepsy. Participants who reported using artisanal CBD products at baseline (Artisanal CBD Users; n = 280) and participants who used no cannabis-based products (Controls; n = 138) completed web-based assessments evaluating psychiatric symptoms, healthcare utilization, and epilepsy-specific factors. Follow-up surveys were collected in a subset of participants (n = 190) following baseline assessment for longitudinal comparison. Cross-sectionally, higher quality of life, lower psychiatric symptom severity, and improved sleep were observed among Artisanal CBD Users at baseline compared with Controls. Initiation of artisanal CBD product use was also related to improved health outcomes longitudinally. No group differences were observed for seizure control, but both groups included a high number of individuals with no past month seizures. Artisanal CBD Users reported significantly better epilepsy medication tolerability, use of fewer prescription medications overall, and reduced healthcare utilization compared with Controls. These findings are consistent with research indicating that practitioners recommending CBD in clinical care for epilepsy report integrating the use of CBD both as a means to improve patient quality of life as well as for seizure control."

It is primarily caused by de novo mutations of the SCN1A gene encoding a neuronal voltage-activated sodium channel. Zebrafish with a mutation in the SCN1A homologue recapitulate spontaneous seizure activity and mimic the convulsive behavioural movements observed in Dravet syndrome. Here, we show that phenotypic screening of drug libraries in zebrafish scn1 mutants rapidly and successfully identifies new therapeutics. We demonstrate that clemizole binds to serotonin receptors and its antiepileptic activity can be mimicked by drugs acting on serotonin signalling pathways e.g. trazodone and lorcaserin. Coincident with these zebrafish findings, we treated five medically intractable Dravet syndrome patients with a clinically-approved serotonin receptor agonist (lorcaserin, Belviq®) and observed some promising results in terms of reductions in seizure frequency and/or severity.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal \"soft\" signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long-term prognosis of community-dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep-related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3-12 mg or clonazepam 0.5-2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence-based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies.

            "abstract": "Volitional neural modulation using neurofeedback has been indicated as a potential treatment for chronic conditions that involve peripheral and central neural dysregulation. Here we utilized neurofeedback in patients suffering from Fibromyalgia - a chronic pain syndrome that involves sleep disturbance and emotion dysregulation. These ancillary symptoms, which have an amplificating effect on pain, are known to be mediated by heightened limbic activity. In order to reliably probe limbic activity in a scalable manner fit for EEG-neurofeedback training, we utilized an Electrical Finger Print (EFP) model of amygdala-BOLD signal (termed Amyg-EFP), that has been successfully validated in our lab in the context of volitional neuromodulation. We anticipated that Amyg-EFP-neurofeedback training aimed at limbic down modulation would improve chronic pain in patients suffering from Fibromyalgia, by reducing sleep disorder improving emotion regulation. We further expected that improved clinical status would correspond with successful training as indicated by improved down modulation of the Amygdala-EFP signal. Thirty-Four Fibromyalgia patients (31F; age 35.6 ± 11.82) participated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial with biweekly Amyg-EFP-neurofeedback sessions or sham neurofeedback (n = 9) for a total duration of five consecutive weeks. Following training, participants in the real-neurofeedback group were divided into good (n = 13) or poor (n = 12) modulators according to their success in the neurofeedback training. Before and after treatment, self-reports on pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue and sleep quality were obtained, as well as objective sleep indices. Long-term clinical follow-up was made available, within up to three years of the neurofeedback training completion. REM latency and objective sleep quality index were robustly improved following the treatment course only in the real-neurofeedback group (time × group p < 0.05) and to a greater extent among good modulators (time × sub-group p < 0.05). In contrast, self-report measures did not reveal a treatment-specific response at the end of the neurofeedback training. However, the follow-up assessment revealed a delayed improvement in chronic pain and subjective sleep experience, evident only in the real-neurofeedback group (time × group p < 0.05). Moderation analysis showed that the enduring clinical effects on pain evident in the follow-up assessment were predicted by the immediate improvements following training in objective sleep and subjective affect measures. Our findings suggest that Amyg-EFP-neurofeedback that specifically targets limbic activity down modulation offers a successful principled approach for volitional EEG based neuromodulation treatment in Fibromyalgia patients. Importantly, it seems that via its immediate sleep improving effect, the neurofeedback training induced a delayed reduction in the target subjective symptom of chronic pain, far and beyond the immediate placebo effect. This indirect approach to chronic pain management reflects the substantial link between somatic and affective dysregulation that can be successfully targeted using neurofeedback."

One hundred and nineteen were interviewed on the telephone and 83 (out of 222) returned completed questionnaires. In total, information was available from 202 callers. Almost one-half of the respondents were dissatisfied with their medication, and almost all of them reported experiencing at least one adverse effect. Depression (or low mood), sedation and difficulty thinking and concentrating were the most prevalent adverse effects. Weight gain was the most distressing, particularly to women. Those taking atypical antipsychotics were significantly more likely than those on typical antipsychotics to experience insomnia and dry mouth, but were less likely to perceive depression and difficulty thinking/concentrating as quite or extremely distressing. Low satisfaction, as opposed to high satisfaction, was significantly associated with reporting weight gain, difficulty thinking/concentrating, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. It was also significantly associated with reporting weight gain, difficulty thinking/concentrating, muscle/joint stiffness and depression as quite or extremely distressing.

Light therapy (LT) has been used to treat some mental and sleep disorders. This review illustrates recent studies of the use of LT in patients with ND and highlights its potential for clinical applications. The literature was collected from PubMed through June 2020. Selected studies were primarily English articles or articles that could be obtained with English abstracts and Chinese main text. Articles were not limited by type. Additional potential publications were also identified from the bibliographies of identified articles and the authors' reference libraries. The identified literature suggests that LT is a safe and convenient physical method of treatment. It may alleviate sleep disorders, depression, cognitive function, and other clinical symptoms. However, some studies have reported limited or no effects. Therefore, LT represents an attractive therapeutic approach for further investigation in ND. LT is an effective physical form of therapy and a new direction for research into treatments for ND. However, it requires further animal experiments to elucidate mechanisms of action and large, double-blind, randomized, and controlled trials to explore true efficacy in patients with ND."

At posttest and follow-up, this effect was found to moderated by sleep-threat monitoring ( t713.69 = -2.39, p < 0.05 and t694.77 = -2.98, p < 0.01 respectively) but not by dysfunctional beliefs about sleep at either posttest or follow-up ( t717.53 = -0.61, p = 0.55 and t683.79 = 0.22, p = 0.83 respectively). Participants in the Sleep Healthy Using The Internet condition with higher levels of sleep-threat monitoring showed a greater reduction in anxiety than those with lower levels from pretest to posttest, ( t724.27 = -6.77, p < 0.001) and through to 6-month follow-up ( t700.67 = -4.27, p < 0.001).

An intention-to-treat analysis showed significant overall gains for a wide range of symptoms in these children, including learning, memory, anxiety, attention span, motor skills, eating, sleeping, sensory processing, self-awareness, communication, social skills, and mood/autism behaviors. The children of compliant caregivers were more likely to experience a significant improvement in their symptoms. The treatment was effective across a wide age range and there was equal progress reported for males and females, for USA and international subjects, for those who paid and those who did not pay for the therapy, and for individuals at all levels of initial symptom severity. Environmental enrichment, delivered via an online system, therefore appears to be an effective, low-cost means of treating the symptoms of ASD."

            "abstract": "Each year millions of travelers undertake long distance flights over one or more continents. These multiple time zone flights produce a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. Familiar to almost every intercontinental traveler is the experience of fatigue upon arrival in a new time zone, but almost as problematic are a number of other jet lag symptoms. These include reduced alertness, nighttime insomnia, loss of appetite, depressed mood, poor psychomotor coordination and reduced cognitive skills, all symptoms which are closely affected by both the length and direction of travel. The most important jet lag symptoms are due to disruptions to the body's sleep/wake cycle. Clinical and pathophysiological studies also indicate that jet lag can exacerbate existing affective disorders. It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion and occurrence of circadian rhythm disturbances may be the common links which underlie jet lag and affective disorders. Largely because of its regulatory effects on the circadian system, melatonin has proven to be highly effective for treating the range of symptoms that accompany transmeridian air travel. Additionally, it has been found to be of value in treating mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin acts on MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of the body's master circadian clock. Melatonin resets disturbed circadian rhythms and promotes sleep in jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome and shift-work disorder. Although post-flight melatonin administration works efficiently in transmeridian flights across less than 7-8 times zones, in the case longer distances, melatonin should be given by 2-3 days in advance to the flight. To deal with the unwanted side effects which usually accompany this pre-departure treatment (acute soporific and sedative effects in times that may not be wanted), the suppression of circadian rhythmicity by covering symmetrically the phase delay and the phase advance portions of the phase response curve for light, together with the administration of melatonin at local bedtime to resynchronize the circadian oscillator, have been proposed. The current view that sleep loss is a major cause of jet lag has focused interest on two recently developed pharmacological agents. Ramelteon and agomelatine are melatonin receptor agonists which, compared to melatonin itself, have a longer half-life and greater affinity for melatonin receptors and consequently are thought to hold promise for treating a variety of circadian disruptions."

She had been abusive and physically aggressive frequently without specific reasons and was involved in criminal legal cases. She was hospitalized twice. During her first hospital stay she experienced a brief episode of detachment from her environment, similar to episodes reportedly suffered at home. Psychosis had developed following heavy polysubstance abuse. Her mother provided sachets containing benzylglycinamide, a substance with no known psychotropic effects, which were also present in the patient's urine. She was occasionally positive for cannabinoids. She used to buy various novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) from the internet and used experimentally various substances freely made available to her by drug suppliers/dealers. She was unable to explain clearly why she was taking any of the identified NPS. She stated she was taking benzylglycinamide to calm her when smoking synthetic cannabinoids. While it appears that benzylglycinamide is not likely to constitute a novel drug of abuse, her polysubstance use exemplifies trends in NPS use patterns among the youths in the Western world and should alert mental health workers as to the possible dangers of such behavior and its reflection on social behavior and psychopathology."

In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering \"medicinal\" self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems."

            "abstract": "In the treatment of schizophrenia, two new strategies have been developed with the aim of adequate relapse prevention accompanied by lowest possible risk of side-effects. One strategy is to have the patient continue to take medication at a highly reduced dosage (10-20% of the standard dose). The other is to gradually stop neuroleptic medication after remission and to reinstitute medication only in the case of prodromal symptoms (termed targeted or intermittent treatment). According to Herz and Melville [13] many schizophrenic patients show signs of relapse well before recurrence of overt psychotic features. Monitoring to detect prodromal symptoms is especially important in targeted treatment because, otherwise, neuroleptic medication often cannot be initiated in time. In the present study of 51 schizophrenic patients we were able to replicate the results of Herz & Melville in the German-speaking countries. Prior to acute exacerbation of psychosis, most patients experience alterations of feelings and behaviour. These alterations may also be recognized by family members. Such early warning signs of relapse mainly consist of non-specific, non-psychotic symptoms: tenseness and nervousness, eating less, trouble concentrating and sleeping, depressive mood and seeing friends less. Furthermore, the regular monitoring and use of early warning signs specific to each patient in the aftercare of schizophrenic patients seems to be practicable, especially in psychoeducative family therapy."

We aimed to assess the medium-term effects and costs of psychological therapies on maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did this multicentre, pragmatic, observer-blind, randomised controlled superiority trial (IMPACT) at 15 National Health Service child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) clinics in three regions in England. Adolescent patients (aged 11-17 years) with a diagnosis of DSM IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via a web-based randomisation service, to receive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or short-term psychoanalytical therapy versus a reference brief psychological intervention. Randomisation was stochastically minimised by age, sex, self-reported depression sum score, and region. Patients and clinicians were aware of group allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. Patients were followed up and reassessed at weeks 6, 12, 36, 52, and 86 post-randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported depression symptoms at weeks 36, 52, and 86, as measured with the self-reported Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Because our aim was to compare the two psychological therapies with the brief psychosocial intervention, we first established whether CBT was inferior to short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy for the same outcome. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN83033550.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between June 29, 2010, and Jan 17, 2013, we randomly assigned 470 patients to receive the brief psychosocial intervention (n=158), CBT (n=155), or short-term psychoanalytical therapy (n=157); 465 patients comprised the intention-to-treat population. 392 (84%) patients had available data for primary analysis by the end of follow-up. Treatment fidelity and differentiation were established between the three interventions. The median number of treatment sessions differed significantly between patients in the brief psychosocial intervention group (n=6 [IQR 4-11]), CBT group (n=9 [5-14]), and short-term psychoanalytical therapy group (n=11 [5-23]; p<0·0001), but there was no difference between groups in the average duration of treatment (27·5 [SD 21·5], 24·9 [17·7], 27·9 [16·8] weeks, respectively; Kruskal-Wallis p=0·238). Self-reported depression symptoms did not differ significantly between patients given CBT and those given short-term psychoanalytical therapy at weeks 36 (treatment effect 0·179, 95% CI -3·731 to 4·088; p=0·929), 52 (0·307, -3·161 to 3·774; p=0·862), or 86 (0·578, -2·948 to 4·104; p=0·748). These two psychological treatments had no superiority effect compared with brief psychosocial intervention at weeks 36 (treatment effect -3·234, 95% CI -6·611 to 0·143; p=0·061), 52 (-2·806, -5·790 to 0·177; p=0·065), or 86 (-1·898, -4·922 to 1·126; p=0·219). Physical adverse events (self-reported breathing problems, sleep disturbances, drowsiness or tiredness, nausea, sweating, and being restless or overactive) did not differ between the groups. Total costs of the trial interventions did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      We found no evidence for the superiority of CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with a brief psychosocial intervention in maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment.

In 2016, the first official Chinese CCBT system was launched by Chinese Cognitive Behavior Therapy Professional Organizations and included four items: getting out of depression, overcoming anxiety, staying away from insomnia and facing Obsessive-compulsive disorder. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese CCBT system served the public for free. This study explored the effects of CCBT on anxiety and depression by comparing the use of the platform during the epidemic and during the same period in 2019. Methods: Users were divided into a depression group or an anxiety group according to their own discretion. The subjects used the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) before each training. Each training group completed the corresponding CCBT training project, which had 5-6 training sessions, an average of once every 5 days. The training content in 2019 and 2020 was identical. This study compared the demographic characteristics, depression, and anxiety levels of CCBT platform users during the lockdown period in Wuhan (LP2020), where the outbreak was concentrated in China, from January 23 to July 23, 2020 and the same period in 2019 (SP2019). Result: (1) There were significant differences in gender (χ2 = 7.215, P = 0.007), region (χ2 = 4.225, P = 0.040) and duration of illness (χ2 = 7.867, P = 0.049) between the two periods. (2) There was a positive Pearson correlation between the number of users of CCBT platform during LP2020 and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each province (r = 0.9429, P < 0.001).

(4) The CCBT platform has an obvious effect on anxiety (F = 4.74, P = 0.009) and depression on users (F = 4.44, P = 0.009). Conclusion: This study showed women, students and people who are more seriously affected by the epidemic were more likely to accept the CCBT training. The CCBT platform made a significant contribution toward alleviating the anxiety and depression symptoms of users during the epidemic. When face-to-face psychotherapy is not available during the epidemic, CCBT can be used as an effective alternative."

Despite the desire to know their risks and the importance of initiating early therapeutic options, large parts of the population do not get access to memory clinic-based assessments. Remote memory clinics facilitate low-level access to cognitive assessments by eschewing the need for face-to-face meetings. At the same time, patients with detected impairment or increased risk can receive non-pharmacological treatment remotely. Sensor technology can evaluate the efficiency of this remote treatment and identify cognitive decline. With remote and (partly) automatized technology the process of cognitive decline can be monitored but more importantly also modified by guiding early interventions and a dementia preventative lifestyle. We highlight how sensor technology aids the expansion of assessments beyond cognition and to other domains, e.g., depression. We also illustrate applications for aiding remote treatment and describe how remote tools can facilitate health education which is the cornerstone for long-lasting lifestyle changes. Tools such as transcranial electric stimulation or sleep-based interventions have currently mostly been used in a face-to-face context but have the potential of remote deployment-a step already taken with memory training apps. Many of the presented methods are readily scalable and of low costs and there is a range of target populations, from the worried well to late-stage dementia."

In both the clinical and self-referred samples, three critical domains were evaluated: (I) feasibility (acceptability, practicality and usage); (II) preliminary efficacy on pain interference, psychological inflexibility, value orientation, QoL, pain intensity, anxiety, insomnia and depressive symptoms; and (III) potential treatment mechanisms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was an open pilot study with two samples: 15 patients from a tertiary pain clinic and 24 self-referred chronic pain participants, recruited from October 2015 until January 2017. Data were collected via an online platform in free text and self-report measures, as well as through individual oral feedback. Group differences were analyzed with Chi square-, Mann-Whitney U- or t-test. Preliminary efficacy and treatment mechanism data were collected via self-report and analyzed with multilevel linear modeling for repeated measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Feasibility: patient feedback guided modifications to refine the intervention and indicated that iACT was acceptable in both samples. User insights provided input for both immediate and future actions to improve feasibility. Comprehensiveness, workability and treatment credibility were adequate in both samples. Psychologists spent on average 13.5 minutes per week per clinical patient, and 8 minutes per self-referred patient (P=0.004). Recruitment rate was 24 times faster in the self-referred sample (24 patients in 1 month, compared to 15 patients in 15 months, P<0.001) and the median distance to the clinic was 40 km in the clinical sample, and 426 km in the self-referred sample (P<0.001). Preliminary effects: post-assessments were completed by 26 participants (67%). Significant effects of time were seen from pre- to post-treatment across all outcome variables. Within group effect sizes (Cohen's d) at post-treatment ranged from small to large: pain interference (d=0.64, P<0.001), psychological inflexibility (d=1.43, P<0.001), value progress (d=0.72, P<0.001), value obstruction (d=0.42, P<0.001), physical QoL (d=0.41, P=0.005), mental QoL (d=0.67, P=0.005), insomnia (d=0.31, P<0.001), depressive symptoms (d=0.47, P<0.001), pain intensity (d=0.78, P=0.001) and anxiety (d=0.46, P<0.001). Improvements were sustained at 1-year follow-up. Psychological inflexibility and value progress were found to be potential treatment mechanisms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results from the present study suggests that iACT was feasible in both the clinical and the self-referred sample. Together with the positive preliminary results on all outcomes, the findings from this feasibility study pave the way for a subsequent large randomized efficacy trial."

Current diagnostic criteria for mood and anxiety tend to lump different forms of sleep disturbance together. Parsing the biological features of sleep impairment and brain circuit dysfunction is one approach to identifying subtypes within these disorders that are mechanistically coherent and offer targets for intervention. We focus on two large-scale neural circuits implicated in sleep impairment and in mood and anxiety disorders: the default mode network and negative affective network. Through a synthesis of existing knowledge about these networks, we pose a testable framework for understanding how hyper- versus hypo-engagement of these networks may underlie distinct features of mood and sleep impairment. Within this framework we consider whether poor sleep quality may have an explanatory role in previously observed associations between network dysfunction and mood symptoms. We expand this framework to future directions including the potential for connecting circuit-defined subtypes to more distal features derived from digital phenotyping and wearable technologies, and how new discovery may be advanced through machine learning approaches."

Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and analysis:\n        \n      \n      A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60-90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance.

This study addresses the efficacy of a transdiagnostic emotion-focused exposure treatment (\"hybrid\") for chronic pain patients with comorbid emotional problems. Adults (n = 115) with chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional and emotional problems were included in a 2-centre, parallel randomized controlled, open-label trial comparing this treatment to an active control condition receiving a guided Internet-delivered pain management treatment based on CBT principles (iCBT). The hybrid treatment (n = 58, 10-16 sessions) integrates exposure in vivo for chronic pain based on the fear-avoidance model with an emotion-regulation approach informed by procedures in Dialectical Behavior Therapy. The iCBT (n = 57; 8 treatment modules) addresses topics such as pain education, coping strategies, relaxation, problem solving, stress, and sleep management using standard CBT techniques. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed before and after treatment as well as at a 9-month primary end point. Across conditions, 78% participants completed post-treatment and 81% follow-up assessment. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that the hybrid had a significantly better post-treatment outcome on pain catastrophizing (d = 0.39) and pain interference (d = 0.63) and significantly better follow-up outcomes on depression (d = 0.43) and pain interference (d = 0.51). There were no differences on anxiety and pain intensity. Observed proportions of clinically significant improvement favoured the hybrid on all but one comparison, but no statistically significant differences were observed. We conclude that the hybrid emotion-focused treatment may be considered an acceptable, credible, and efficacious treatment option for chronic pain patients with comorbid emotional problems."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of prazosin treatment on behavioral parameters (freezing time, total transitions, and rearing frequency measured from the open field; anxiety index, total entries and time spent in open arms calculated from the elevated plus maze), apoptotic proteins and α-2c-AR in fear memory reconsolidation in the PSI stress rat model. We used western blot analysis to determine the effect of prazosin (0.5 mg/kg/ip) on α-2c-AR and apoptotic protein expression changes in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. It was determined that in the stress group, there was increased freezing time and anxiety index, and decreased rearing frequency, total transitions, total entries, and time spent in open arms compared to the control groups. Following PSI-stress, pro-apoptotic (bax) protein expression levels increased and α-2c AR and anti-apoptotic protein (bcl-2) levels decreased in investigated all brain regions. The majority of stress-induced changes were recovered with prazosin treatment.

Although several interventions have been helpful in teaching individuals to better cope with tinnitus, no cure exists at present. Neurofeedback is an emerging treatment modality in tinnitus. Previous studies, utilising an alpha/delta training protocol, have shown promise. However, they were characterised by small sample sizes and a lack of neurofeedback control conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether an alpha/delta neurofeedback training protocol, compared to beta/theta neurofeedback or a diary control group, is effective in reducing not only the tinnitus sound perception but also the psychological symptoms associated with the condition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study is designed as a three-armed randomised controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to a) an established neurofeedback protocol for tinnitus (alpha/delta training), b) an active control group (beta/theta training) or c) a diary control group. In the 4-week intervention period, participants in both neurofeedback groups undergo 10 sessions, whereas participants in the diary control group complete a bi-weekly diary. The primary outcomes are between group differences in tinnitus sound perception change, as measured with the Tinnitus Magnitude Index (TMI), and changes in tinnitus distress, measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), 4 weeks after the start of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures include changes in tinnitus distress, sleep quality, depressive symptoms and whether neurofeedback leads to specific power changes in the trained frequency bands.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of an alpha/delta neurofeedback training protocol in reducing tinnitus sound perception and the distress associated with the condition.

Additional clinically and cost-effective tinnitus management routes are needed. One potential route is providing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for tinnitus via the Internet (iCBT). This study aimed to determine the efficacy of guided iCBT, using audiological support, on tinnitus distress and tinnitus-related comorbidities, in the United Kingdom. A further aim was to establish the stability of intervention effects 2-months postintervention. The hypothesis was that iCBT for tinnitus would be more effective at reducing tinnitus distress than weekly monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A randomized, delayed intervention efficacy trial, with a 2-month follow-up was implemented to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT in the United Kingdom.

After the experimental group completed the 8-week long iCBT intervention, the control group undertook the same intervention. Intervention effects were, therefore, evaluated in two independent groups at two time points. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress between the groups as assessed by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary assessment measures were included for insomnia, anxiety, depression, hearing disability, hyperacusis, cognitive failures, and satisfaction with life.

This reduction was statistically significant (Cohen's d = 0.7) and was clinically significant for 51% of the experimental group and 5% of the control group. This reduction was evident 4 weeks after commencing the iCBT intervention. Furthermore, the experimental group had a greater reduction in insomnia, depression, hyperacusis, cognitive failures, and a greater improvement in quality of life, as evidenced by the significant differences in these assessment measures postintervention.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of insomnia but is seldom offered. CBT delivered through the Internet might be a more accessible alternative. In this study we examined the effectiveness of a guided Internet-delivered CBT for adults with insomnia using a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n## METHOD\nA total of 118 patients, recruited from the general population, were randomized to the 6-week guided Internet intervention (n = 59) or to a wait-list control group (n = 59). Patients filled out an online questionnaire and a 7-day sleep diary before (T0) and after (T1) the 6-week period. The intervention group received a follow-up questionnaire 3 months after baseline (T2).\n## RESULTS\nAlmost three-quarters (72.9%) of the patients completed the whole intervention. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the treatment had statistically significant medium to large effects (p < 0.05; Cohen's d between 0.40 and 1.06), and resulted more often in clinically relevant changes, on all sleep and secondary outcomes with the exception of sleep onset latency (SOL) and number of awakenings (NA). There was a non-significant difference in the reduction in sleep medication between the intervention (a decrease of 6.8%) and control (an increase of 1.8%) groups (p = 0.20). Data on longer-term effects were inconclusive.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study adds to the growing body of literature that indicates that guided CBT for insomnia can be delivered through the Internet. Patients accept the format and their sleep improves.\n"

Specifically, the prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) increased from 5.5% in FY2012 to 22.2% in FY2018, and the prevalence of insomnia diagnoses increased from 7.4% in FY2012 to 11.8% in FY2018. Consequently, Veterans' demand for sleep medicine services also increased significantly between FY2012-2018, with steady increases in the annual number of VA sleep clinic appointments during this period (<250,000 in FY 2012; >720,000 in FY2018). Common co-morbid conditions among Veterans diagnosed with sleep disorders include obesity, diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).

            "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is highly prevalent, and has been identified as a risk factor for many psychiatric problems, including depression, suicide ideation and suicide death. Previous studies have found that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) reduce depression and suicidal ideation in samples with high levels of suicidal ideation. This study aims to investigate associations of CBT-I with suicidal ideation in a sample of 522 patients primarily seeking internet-delivered treatment for insomnia in regular psychiatric care. The sample had high pretreatment insomnia severity levels and a relatively high level of comorbid depression symptoms. Suicidal ideation levels were relatively low pretreatment but still improved significantly after CBT-I. Contrary to previous findings, the strongest predictor of changes in suicidal ideation were improvements in depressive symptoms, rather than improvements in insomnia. We conclude that suicidal ideation may not be a major problem in these patients primarily seeking treatment for insomnia, despite comorbid depressive symptoms, but that suicidal ideation still improves following CBT-i. Considering the increased risk for patients with untreated insomnia to develop depression, this finding is of interest for prevention of suicidal ideation."

The present randomized controlled trial evaluated health effects of a novel program: Relaxation-Response-based Mental Health Promotion (RR-MHP).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The multimodal, meditation-based course was publicly entitled \"Open and Calm\" (OC) because it consistently trained relaxed and receptive (\"Open\") attention, and consciously non-intervening (\"Calm\") witnessing, in two standardized formats (individual or group) over nine weeks. Seventy-two participants who complained to their general practitioner about reduced daily functioning due to prolonged stress or who responded to an online health survey on stress were randomly assigned to OC formats or treatment as usual, involving e.g., unstandardized consultations with their general practitioner. Outcomes included perceived stress, depressive symptoms, quality of life, sleep disturbances, mental health, salivary cortisol, and visual perception. Control variables comprised a genetic stress-resiliency factor (serotonergic transporter genotype; 5-HTTLPR), demographics, personality, self-reported inattentiveness, and course format.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Intent-to-treat analyses showed significantly larger improvements in OC than in controls on all outcomes.

Despite these benefits, many men do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines and have poor eating behaviours. Many health promotion programmes hold little appeal to men and consequently fail to influence men's health practices. HAT TRICK was designed as a 12-week face-to-face, gender-sensitised intervention for overweight and inactive men focusing on physical activity, healthy eating and social connectedness and was delivered in collaboration with a major junior Canadian ice hockey team (age range 16-20 years).

Sound therapy is a core component of many tinnitus management programs. Potential mechanisms of benefit include making tinnitus less noticeable, habituation, distracting attention from tinnitus, relaxation, and promoting neuroplastic changes within the brain. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the use of mobile technology. This provided an additional medium through which people with tinnitus can access different tinnitus management options, including sound therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to (1) generate the list of apps that people use for management of their tinnitus, (2) explore reasons for app use and nonuse, (3) perform quality assessment of the most cited apps, and (4) perform content analysis to explore and describe options and management techniques available in the most cited apps.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A Web-based survey consisting of 33 open and closed questions captured (1) demographic information, information about tinnitus, and hearing loss and (2) mobile app-specific information about the motivation to use an app, the apps which respondents used for tinnitus, important factors when choosing an app, devices used to access apps, and reasons for not using apps. The quality of the most cited apps was assessed using the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS). Content and features of the most cited apps were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 643 respondents were analyzed. The majority of respondents (482/643, 75.0%) had never used an app for management of tinnitus mainly because of lack of awareness (381/643, 59.3%). The list of the 55 apps that people use for their tinnitus was generated. These included apps that were developed specifically for the management of tinnitus; however, the majority of cited apps were developed for other problems (eg, sleep, depression or anxiety, and relaxation). Quality assessment of the 18 most popular apps using MARS resulted in a range of mean scores from 1.6 to 4.2 (out of 5). In line with the current model of tinnitus management, sound was the main focus of the majority of the apps. Other components included relaxation exercises, elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, information and education, and hypnosis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      People used apps for the management of their tinnitus; however, this was done mostly as a self-help option, without conjunction with management provided by hearing health care professionals. Further research should consider the place for apps in tinnitus management (stand-alone self-management intervention vs part of the management by a hearing professional). As the content of the apps varies with respect to sound options, information, and management strategies, it seems that the choice of the best management app should be guided by individual patient's needs and preferences."

Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors significantly associated with help-seeking intentions were almost identical across the four health problems. In particular, perception of family and friends regarding help-seeking, psychiatric history, contact with people with mental illness, better health literacy, and neighborhood communicativeness were significantly associated with the overall help-seeking intention and also the help-seeking intention from formal sources for all the problems of dizziness, insomnia, and depressed mood.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The majority of participants indicated their intentions to seek help, but psychological problems (insomnia and depressed mood) were less likely to induce help-seeking intentions than a physical problem (dizziness).

Acupuncture is a popular alternative for treating CLBP but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Evidence suggests that pain regulatory mechanisms (particularly the ascending and secondarily the descending pain modulatory pathways) and psychological mechanisms (e.g., expectations, pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy) may be involved in the pathogenesis of CLBP and its response to treatments. We will examine these mechanisms in the treatment of CLBP by electroacupuncture (EA).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We present the aims and methods of a placebo-controlled, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded mechanistic study. Adult patients with CLBP will be randomized to receiving 16 sessions of real (active) or sham (placebo) EA over the course of 8 weeks. The primary pain regulatory measure for which the study was powered is temporal summation (TS), which approximates ascending pain facilitation. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM), representing a descending pain modulatory pathway, will be our secondary pain regulatory measure. The primary psychological measure is expectations of benefit, and the secondary psychological measures are pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy in managing pain. Main clinical outcomes are back pain bothersomeness on a 0-100 visual analog scale (primary), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (secondary), and relevant items from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Information System (secondary). We hypothesize that compared to sham, real EA will lead to greater reduction in TS after 8 treatment sessions (4 weeks); and that reduction in TS (and secondarily, increase in CPM) after 8 treatment sessions will mediate reduction in back pain bothersomeness from baseline to week 10 (clinical response) to EA. We also hypothesize that the three psychological factors are moderators of clinical response. With 100 treatment completers, the study is designed to have 80% power to detect a medium-sized between-group effect (d = 0.5) on temporal summation.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first appropriately powered, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating mechanisms of EA in the treatment of CLBP.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02503475 .

Intervention effects were estimated immediately postintervention at week 11 using a constrained mixed-model repeated measures analysis with an unstructured covariance matrix.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We randomly assigned 500 older adults to either the randomized trial (n = 250; n = 125 in CBT and n = 125 in yoga) or the preference trial (n = 250; n = 120 chose CBT and n = 130 chose yoga).\n    \n\n\n          Randomized Trial:\n        \n      \n      The intervention effect on week 11 follow-up PSWQ-A means for yoga compared with CBT was 1.6 (95% CI, −0.2 to 3.3; P = .08), suggesting that the effects of both interventions were not significantly different. There were significant reductions in the mean PSWQ-A scores in both arms of the randomized trial. The mean PSWQ-A score dropped from 31.2 to 22.4 among participants randomly assigned to CBT for a change of −8.8 (95% CI, −10.1 to −7.5). Among participants randomly assigned to yoga, the analogous change was −7.2 (95% CI, −8.5 to −6.0). The intervention effect on follow-up PROMIS Anxiety means was 0.3 (95% CI, −1.5 to 2.2; P = .71). At week 11, the reductions in means, relative to baseline values, were −7.5 (95% CI, −8.8 to −6.1) and −7.1 (95% CI, −8.5 to −5.8) for the CBT and yoga arms, respectively. There was a significant difference on the ISI by intervention. The intervention effect on follow-up ISI means was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2-3.7; P = .0002). At week 11, the reductions in means, relative to their baseline values, were −5.4 (95% CI, −6.3 to −4.4) and −3.0 (95% CI, −3.9 to −2.0) for the CBT and yoga arms, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Preference Trial:\n        \n      \n      Preference and selection effects were estimated by combining the data observed in the randomized and preference trials. The preference and selection effects for PSWQ-A were −1.5 (95% CI, −5.3 to 2.3; P = .44) and −1.0 (95% CI, −4.7 to 2.8; P = .62), respectively. The preference and selection effects for PROMIS Anxiety were −0.2 (95% CI, −4.8 to 4.4; P = 0.93) and 0.4 (95% CI, −4.2 to 5.1; P = .85), respectively. The preference and selection effects for ISI were −0.9 (95% CI, −4.7 to 3.0; P = .66) and −0.9 (95% CI, −4.7 to 2.9; P = .65) respectively. The preference and selection effects for attrition from the study were −8.7% (95% CI, −20.0% to 2.7%; P = .13) and 2.9% (95% CI, −8.5% to 14.2%; P = .62), respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both CBT and yoga produced declines in worry and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the 2 interventions. CBT was superior to yoga in improving sleep disturbances. Approximately half of participants chose CBT and half chose yoga, and there were neither preference nor selection effects on outcomes. These findings suggest that both CBT and yoga may be useful approaches for worry in older adults and may be suggested by clinicians without a strong preference for one vs the other except for those with sleep problems, for whom CBT may show a greater improvement than yoga.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Limitations include that participants had to agree to be randomly assigned to either the preference trial or randomized trial, the differences in the structure of the interventions, and the homogeneous (primarily White, well-educated women) sample."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Sleep problems are common, affecting over a third of adults in the United Kingdom and leading to reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life. Many of those whose lives are affected seek medical help from primary care. Drug treatment is ineffective long term. Psychological methods for managing sleep problems, including cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) have been shown to be effective and cost effective but have not been widely implemented or evaluated in a general practice setting where they are most likely to be needed and most appropriately delivered. This paper outlines the protocol for a pilot study designed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention for general practitioners, primary care nurses and other members of the primary care team to deliver problem focused therapy to adult patients presenting with sleep problems due to lifestyle causes, pain or mild to moderate depression or anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and design:\n        \n      \n      This will be a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention. General practices will be randomised to an educational intervention for problem focused therapy which includes a consultation approach comprising careful assessment (using assessment of secondary causes, sleep diaries and severity) and use of modified CBTi for insomnia in the consultation compared with usual care (general advice on sleep hygiene and pharmacotherapy with hypnotic drugs). Clinicians randomised to the intervention will receive an educational intervention (2 x 2 hours) to implement a complex intervention of problem focused therapy. Clinicians randomised to the control group will receive reinforcement of usual care with sleep hygiene advice. Outcomes will be assessed via self-completion questionnaires and telephone interviews of patients and staff as well as clinical records for interventions and prescribing.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Previous studies in adults have shown that psychological treatments for insomnia administered by specialist nurses to groups of patients can be effective within a primary care setting. This will be a pilot study to determine whether an educational intervention aimed at primary care teams to deliver problem focused therapy for insomnia can improve sleep management and outcomes for individual adult patients presenting to general practice. The study will also test procedures and collect information in preparation for a larger definitive cluster-randomised trial. The study is funded by The Health Foundation."

Approximately 12% of MCI patients convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementia disorders every year. In the present report we retrospectively examined the initial and final neuropsychological assessment of 50 MCI outpatients, 25 of whom had received daily 3-9 mg of a fast-release melatonin preparation p.o. at bedtime for 9-18 months. Melatonin was given in addition to the standard medication prescribed by the attending psychiatrist. Patients treated with melatonin showed significantly better performance in Mini Mental State Examination and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale. After application of a battery of neuropsychological tests including Mattis' test, Digit-symbol test, Trail A and B tasks and the Rey's verbal test, better performance was found in melatonin-treated patients, except for the Digit-symbol test score which remained unchanged. Abnormally high Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased in melatonin-treated patients, concomitantly with an improvement in wakefulness and sleep quality. The results suggest that melatonin can be a useful add-on drug for treating MCI in a clinical setting."

ATS are highly addictive and prolonged use may result in a series of mental and physical symptoms including anxiety, confusion, insomnia, mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, paranoia, hallucinations and delusion.Currently there is no widely accepted treatment for ATS-use disorder. However, cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) is the first-choice treatment. The effectiveness of CBT for other substance-use disorders (e.g. alcohol-, opioid- and cocaine-use disorders) has been well documented and as such this basic treatment approach has been applied to the ATS-use disorder.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatment for people with ATS-use disorder for reducing ATS use compared to other types of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, 12-step facilitation, no intervention or treatment as usual.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We identified randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs comparing CBT for ATS-use disorders with other types of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, 12 step facilitation or no intervention. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase and five other databases up to July 2018.

The studies compared a single session of brief CBT or a web-based CBT to a waiting-list control (total sample size across studies of 129). Results were mixed across the studies. For the single-session brief CBT study, two out of five measures of drug use produced significant results, percentage of abstinent days in 90 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.11) and dependence symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.59, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.02). Little confidence could be placed in the results from this study give the small sample size (25 participants per group) and corresponding large CIs around the observed effects. For the web-based CBT, there was no significant difference across different outcomes. Neither study reported adverse effects. The meta-analytic mean across these two trials for drug use was not significant (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.14). In summary, overall quality of evidence was low and there was insufficient evidence to conclude that CBT is effective, or ineffective, at treating ATS use.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Currently, there is not enough evidence to establish the efficacy of CBT for ATS-use disorders because of a paucity of high-quality research in this area."

Recent studies have demonstrated fatigue to be the most distressing phenomenon experienced by cancer patients. This article examines fatigue from a rehabilitation perspective. Application of innovations in therapeutic exercise training, diet therapy, sleep therapy, cognitive therapy, and pharmacologic therapy and their attendant rationales are discussed. From clinical as well as research perspectives of palliation and rehabilitation, the manifestations of fatigue are better appreciated if fatigue is conceptualized as a syndrome, namely, cancer-related fatigue syndrome (CRFS). Experience of CRFS by cancer patients, regardless of their diagnosis, stage of disease, treatment regimen, or age, influences all aspects of quality of life and aggravates the experience of other distressing symptoms such as pain, nausea, and dyspnea. Understanding the underlying mechanisms for energy loss and gain, as well as the relationship between the right amount and type of activity and sleep, can lead toward more effective and innovative rehabilitation programs. Development of research based clinical interventions in these areas holds promise for significant improvement in functioning and quality of life for cancer survivors and may constitute valuable rehabilitative techniques that can be adjunctive to standard therapies."

After eight weeks and prior to discharge, the patient was able to use effective coping skills to face his negative-automatic thinking and actively participate in group therapy. After discharge, the author tracked patient progress by visiting the OPD and through communications over the telephone. His family and teacher described the patient as having a stable mood, no longer attempting suicide and being able to join clubs on campus and live a a normal daily life."

Emerging evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms may contribute to differential symptom susceptibility. We aimed to systematically review associations between genetic polymorphisms and PN symptoms during or after cancer treatment for early-stage breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six eligible articles published until October 2017 were identified in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and additional records. Information on study characteristics, genetic polymorphisms, and PN symptoms was extracted. Study quality was evaluated by the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association (STREGA) guideline.

Pain has the known highest number of associated genetic polymorphisms reported, followed by fatigue, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. The majority of genetic polymorphisms were involved in immune system and neuronal system pathways. Most studies were unsuccessful in meeting the STREGA guideline, which requires transparent reporting of methods and results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review provides comprehensive evidence of genetic polymorphisms underlying PN symptoms, which may pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics targeting these symptoms.

Although neuroactive steroids are endogenous neuronal modulators, synthetic entities with improved oral bioavailability have recently been developed. These compounds demonstrate efficacy as anticonvulsants against a range of convulsant stimuli and demonstrate anti-epileptogenic activity in a kindling model of epilepsy. Efficacy has also been reported in preclinical models of anxiety, insomnia, migraine and drug dependence. Clinical evidence to date is generally supportive of these findings and indicates that neuroactive steroids are generally well tolerated.

            "abstract": "Adolescents get insufficient sleep, adversely affecting health. Mind-body integrative health interventions for adolescents have been shown to reduce stress, a barrier to good sleep. This scoping review aimed to synthesize mind-body integrative health interventions for adolescents, how interventions were implemented, who was reached. A systematic search of four online databases was conducted. Randomized, quasi-experimental, and single-group designs with participants ages 10-24 years were included. Twelve studies covering 10 interventions using mindfulness, qigong, aromatherapy, or yoga were identified. Participants were predominantly female; only one study reported participants' race or ethnicity (81% non-Hispanic white). Most (n=6) interventions were delivered in groups, and half reported significant improvements in subjective sleep quality. Mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were the most commonly used modalities, with reported impact on sleep outcomes measured objectively. The two interventions that found statistically significant, moderate improvements in objectively-measured sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency were of higher intensity and used mindfulness. Four interventions were self-directed; participants in these struggled with adherence; significant impacts on sleep were not found. While findings were mixed, stemming in part from the quality of the underlying studies, this review identified several promising features of interventions, including using mindfulness, ensuring sufficient intervention dose, and targeting interventions towards adolescents with poor sleep at baseline (rather than a general population of adolescents). The findings suggests that sleep interventions for adolescents may improve psychological well-being as an intermediate effect, as sleep improvements were observed mostly among participants with poor sleep quality or anxiety symptoms at baseline. This review identified several gaps in the literature. Despite documented racial and ethnic disparities in sleep quality among adolescents, published evidence of mind-body integrative health-based sleep interventions among Black and Latinx adolescents is lacking. None of the studies in this review assessed developmental stage or age differences, despite documented differences in sleep across age groups of adolescents. These two gaps in the evidence should be addressed in future intervention research."

            "abstract": "Background and aims Chronic pain patients often present with a host of psychological and somatic problems and are unable to work despite receiving traditional pain management. For example, it is common that patients with persistent pain also suffer from a variety of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Indeed, the regulation of emotions may be one important factor that is associated with the development of persistent pain. Dialectical behavior therapy, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, focuses on emotion regulation and has successfully addressed other complex problems. The objective of this case study was to test the feasibility of developing and applying a dialectical behavior therapy approach to chronic pain. Methods Feasibility study of n = 1: A 52-year-old adult suffering musculoskeletal pain, work disability, depression, and mood swings was offered therapy. She had not worked at her occupation for 10 years. An intervention was developed based on dialectical behavior therapy that included goal setting, validation, behavioral experiments and interoceptive exposure. Goals were developed with the client, based on her own values, and these were to: increase participation in previously enjoyable activities, not only reduce but also accept that some pain may remain, and, express and regulate emotions. Validation (understanding the patient's situation) and psychoeducation were used to analyze the problem with the patient in focus. Function was approached by monitoring activities and conducting dialectical behavioral experiments where the patient systematically approached activities she no longer participated in (exposure). Emotional regulation followed a training program developed in dialectical behavior therapy designed to have people experience, express, and manage a variety of positive and negative emotions. In order to address the patient's complaint that she avoided her own feelings as well as the pain, interoceptive exposure was introduced. After establishing calm breathing, the client was asked to focus attention on the negative feelings or pain as a way of de-conditioning the psychological responses to them. Therapy was conducted during 16 sessions over a six-month period. Results Improvements were seen on the main outcome variables. Pain intensity ratings dropped from 4.3 during the baseline to almost 0 at the end of treatment. Function increased as the patient participated in goal activities. Depression scores were decreased from 26 (Beck's Depression Inventory) at pre treatment to 5 at follow-up, which falls within the normal range. Similarly, catastrophizing and fear decreased on standardized scales and fell within the range of a nonclinical population. Ratings indicated that acceptance of the pain increased over the course of therapy. Sleep improved and was also within the normal range according to scores on the Insomnia Severity Index. The patient reported seeking and obtaining employment as well. At the three-month follow-up improvements were maintained Conclusions This case shows that dialectical behavior therapy may be feasible for people suffering persistent pain with multiple problems such as pain, depression, and emotion regulation. However, since this is a case study, the validity of the findings has not yet been established. The positive results, however, warrant the further investigation of the application of these techniques to complex chronic pain cases."

Diagnosis and treatment for PTH is still evolving, and surprisingly little is known about the putative mechanisms that drive these headaches. This manuscript describes the design of a randomized clinical trial of two nonpharmacological (i.e., behavioral) interventions for posttraumatic headache. Design of this trial required careful consideration of PTH diagnosis and inclusion criteria, which was challenging due to the lack of standard clinical characteristics in PTH unique from other types of headaches. The treatments under study differed in clinical focus and dose (i.e., number of treatment sessions), but the trial was designed to balance the treatments as well as possible. Finally, while the primary endpoints for pain research can vary from assessments of pain intensity to objective and subjective functional measures, this trial of PTH interventions chose carefully to establish clinically relevant endpoints and to maximize the opportunity to detect significant differences between groups with two primary outcomes. All these issues are discussed in this manuscript."

Psychological difficulties are commonly experienced; however, psychological interventions have been little researched with this population. We investigated the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with people with the HD genetic mutation, either pre-manifest (before onset of movement symptoms) or at an early disease stage. Specifically, we evaluated the willingness of participants to be recruited into and complete the intervention; the acceptability of the study measures in relation to completion; the feasibility of offering the standard MBCT course to people with HD; the acceptability of the intervention and the estimated effect sizes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were recruited from two UK HD centres and took part in an 8-week course of MBCT, with three reunions throughout the following year. Stress, depression, anxiety, and mindfulness were measured pre-, mid-, and post-course, at 3 months and at 1 year. Sleep, quality of life, positive affect and coping were measured pre- and post-course, at 3 months and at 1 year. Descriptive data and approximate effect sizes were calculated. Interviews were conducted post-course and at 1 year and data pertaining to the acceptability of the course were extracted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twelve participants took part in two groups; all were pre-manifest. Levels of depression and anxiety were low pre-course leaving little room for improvement. Changes in stress and in some aspects of mindfulness were medium to large. The qualitative data suggested participants rated the course highly and found it helpful and no changes to the standard course were needed. Recruitment levels were below those anticipated. Most measures were found to be acceptable.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although the course was acceptable to those who took part, given the difficulties in recruiting and the rarity of HD, conducting an RCT of MBCT teaching groups in person does not seem feasible.

So far, no study has investigated the potential of mindfulness-based treatments when delivered remotely via the Internet. The current trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of a stand-alone, unguided, Internet-based mindfulness treatment program for anxiety. Ninety-one participants diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified were randomly assigned to a mindfulness treatment group (MTG) or to an online discussion forum control group (CG). Mindfulness treatment consisted of 96 audio files with instructions for various mindfulness meditation exercises. Primary and secondary outcome measures were assessed at pre-, posttreatment, and at 6-months follow-up. Participants of the MTG showed a larger decrease of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia from pre- to postassessment than participants of the CG (Cohen's d(between)=0.36-0.99). Within effect sizes were large in the MTG (d=0.82-1.58) and small to moderate in the CG (d=0.45-0.76). In contrast to participants of the CG, participants of the MTG also achieved a moderate improvement in their quality of life. The study provided encouraging results for an Internet-based mindfulness protocol in the treatment of primary anxiety disorders. Future replications of these results will show whether Web-based mindfulness meditation can constitute a valid alternative to existing, evidence-based cognitive-behavioural Internet treatments.

The purpose of this paper was to directly investigate the ability of MBIs and CBT to improve anxiety symptoms (primary outcome), as well as depression symptoms and sleep quality (second outcome).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the following electronic databases from 1st December, 2019 to 14th January 2021: English databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Elsevier, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, ClinicalTrails, and Embase, and Chinese database including CNKI, WANFANG, and CQVIP. The eligibility criteria included the following: (I) patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety; and those with physical or mental disorders with comorbid anxiety symptoms; (II) randomized controlled trial (RCT) design; (III) the treatment group received MBIs; (IV) the control group received CBT; and (V) the treatment outcomes were anxiety, depression, and sleep quality.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 4,095 abstracts were reviewed. Of these, the full-texts of 45 articles were read in detail; and 11 RCTs were finally included in the analysis. Upon completion of MBIs and CBT group sessions, the study outcomes (mean anxiety, depression, and sleep quality scores) revealed no difference between MBIs and CBT with regards to anxiety, depression, and sleep quality post-intervention. Subgroup analysis was also performed, and the results indicated that MBIs may provide a small advantage for people with anxiety symptoms compared to CBT [standard mean difference (SMD): -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.66 to -0.06], while the CBT group demonstrated a small comparative advantage for anxiety in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) scales, as well as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in the types of MBIs (LSAS: SMD: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.63; SPIN: SMD: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.92; MBSR: SMD: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.74).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      There was no significant difference between MBIs and CBT in terms of the treatment outcomes of anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. MBIs could be used as an alternative intervention to CBT for anxiety symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      This meta-analysis was conducted in line with the PRISMA guideline and was registered at PROSPERO https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (CRD42021219822)."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In patients with cancer, the use of medical cannabis has increased significantly during the recent years. There is evidence that cannabis consumption may affect cognitive performance; however, this potential effect has not been investigated prospectively in patients with cancer to date. We aimed to evaluate the effect of cannabis consumption on cognitive abilities as well as on symptom relief in patients with cancer during chemotherapy treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective study was carried out on a group of 17 patients on cannabis treatment (case) who were compared with 17 patients not on cannabis treatment (control). Participants completed self-reported questionnaires (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Brief Fatigue Inventory, European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer core questions on the Quality of Life Questionnaire) and underwent the following neurocognitive tests: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Digit Symbol Substitution subtest (WAIS III) and Digital-Finger Tapping Test. The evaluation was conducted before the initiation of cannabis consumption and 3 months later during the period of cannabis use.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Improvement in executive functioning was demonstrated in the case group. In aspects of symptoms, improvement in fatigue, appetite and sleep disorder was demonstrated after cannabis consumption. Patients consuming cannabis did not differ from the control group in cognitive functioning over 3 months of use. No significant cognitive decline was observed in either group over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These preliminary findings suggest that the short-term use of cannabis during chemotherapy treatment improved disease-related symptoms and did not affect cognitive skills in patients with cancer."

            "abstract": "Sleep quality, personality, and cognitive load potentially increase second language writing (SLW) anxiety and subsequently affect SLW achievement. This study investigates the predictions of sleep quality, personality (social inhibition/ negative affectivity), and cognitive load (content/ computer) toward SLW anxiety and achievement in a computer-based test. Participants included 172 voluntary undergraduates majoring in English as foreign language. SLW anxiety in a computer-based test, sleep disturbance, personality and cognitive load was assessed with the SLW Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Type-D Personality, and cognitive load questionnaires. A structural equation modeling approach was applied to examine the interdependence among the observed variables. An adequate-fit SLW anxiety model was built (X2 = 6.37, df = 6, p = 0.383, NFI = 0.97, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.02; R-squared multiple correlations: SLW anxiety in a computer-based test = 0.19, computer-based SLW achievement = 0.07). The structural model showed that sleep disturbance (+0.17), social inhibition personality (+0.31), and computer-induced cognitive load (+0.16) were significant predictors of SLW anxiety in a computer-based test. Subsequently, SLW anxiety in a computer-based test (-0.16) and computer-induced cognitive load (-0.16) were significant negative predictors of computer-based SLW achievement."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Depression and fatigue are common in breast cancer survivors, and their presence is associated with personal suffering and worse prognosis. While many women receive short-term psychological support in the acute treatment phase, this is rarely available in subsequent phases. Internet interventions for breast cancer survivors could provide additional psychological support, as they are easily accessible and may be effective. However, no trial has yet examined the effectiveness of an Internet intervention that provides cognitive behavioural therapy techniques plus lifestyle advice for this population. This trial aims to test whether Optimune, a novel Internet intervention we developed for that purpose, leads to improvements in quality of life and relevant lifestyle habits over the course of 3 to 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will include 360 female breast cancer survivors who have completed the active tumour eradication phase. Participants will be recruited from various settings, including web-based advertisements and Internet forums in German-speaking countries. The main inclusion criteria are a breast cancer diagnosis less than 5 years ago and completion of acute treatment at least 1 month ago, as verified by discharge letter from an oncology treatment centre. Participants will be randomly assigned to either (1) a control group, in which they receive care as usual (CAU) and are given access to Optimune after a delay of 3 months (CAU/wait list control), or (2) a treatment group that may also use CAU and will receive 12-month access to Optimune immediately after randomization. The three primary endpoints are quality of life, physical activity and diet quality, assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Quality Questionnaire, at 3 months post-baseline; secondary outcomes include cancer-related fatigue, emotional stress, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, insomnia, usefulness of the programme and negative treatment effects. Online assessments are conducted at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Results of this RCT are expected to extend the body of knowledge with regard to the effectiveness of CBT-based Internet interventions for female breast cancer survivors.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03643640.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Previous research has identified that men experiencing depression do not always access appropriate health services. Web-based interventions represent an alternative treatment option for men, are effective in reducing anxiety and depression, and have potential for wide dissemination. However, men do not access Web-based programs at the same rate as women. Programs with content explicitly tailored to men's mental health needs are required.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study evaluated the applicability of Man Central, a new Web and mobile phone intervention for men with depression. The impact of the use of Man Central on depression, resilience, and work and social functioning was assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A recruitment flier was distributed via social media, email networks, newsletters, research registers, and partner organizations. A single-group, repeated measures design was used. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression. Secondary outcomes included externalizing symptoms, resilience, and work and social functioning. Man Central comprises regular mood, symptom, and behavior monitoring, combined with three 15-min interactive sessions. Clinical features are grounded in cognitive behavior therapy and problem-solving therapy. A distinguishing feature is the incorporation of positive strategies identified by men as useful in preventing and managing depression. Participants were directed to use Man Central for a period of 4 weeks. Linear mixed modeling with intention-to-treat analysis assessed associations between the intervention and the primary and secondary outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 144 men aged between 18 and 68 years and with at least mild depression enrolled in the study. The symptoms most often monitored by men included motivation (471 instances), depression (399), sleep (323), anxiety (316), and stress (262). Reminders were scheduled by 60.4% (87/144). Significant improvements were observed in depression symptoms (P<.001, d=0.68), depression risk, and externalizing symptoms (P<.001, d=0.88) and work and social functioning (P<.001, d=0.78). No change was observed in measures of resilience. Participants reported satisfaction with the program, with a majority saying that it was easy (42/51, 82%) and convenient (41/51, 80%) to use. Study attrition was high; 27.1% (39/144) and 8.3% (12/144) of the participants provided complete follow-up data and partial follow-up data, respectively, whereas the majority (93/144, 64.6%) did not complete follow-up measures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This preliminary evaluation demonstrated the potential of using electronic health (eHealth) tools to deliver self-management strategies to men with depressive symptoms. Man Central may meet the treatment needs of a subgroup of depressed men who are willing to engage with an e-mental health program. With further research, it may provide an acceptable option to those unwilling or unable to access traditional mental health services. Given the limitations of the study design, prospective studies are required, using controlled designs to further elucidate the effect of the program over time."

            "abstract": "Objectives Despite the existence of several online treatments for people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few studies have examined usage data for such interventions. Given the potential of the online modality to alleviate barriers limiting access to psychological help, it is important to document users' interactions with these tools in relation to the improvement of targeted symptoms. The objective of this study is to document usage data of the online treatment platform RESILIENT by people evacuated from the Fort McMurray, Alberta (Canada) fires, and to examine their association with the effectiveness of treatment on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia and depression, and adherence to treatment, as measured by the number of modules accessed by participants. Methods Ninety-seven people evacuated from the Fort McMurray fires with symptoms of PTSD, insomnia and depression were included in this study. Participants were invited to use the RESILIENT platform, an online therapist-assisted self-help treatment program that targets PTSD symptoms, sleep and mood, and includes 12 modules offering evidence-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) strategies. Both objective (e.g., number of modules accessed) and subjective (e.g., level of effort invested) usage data were collected. Results In order to predict the reduction in PTSD, depression and insomnia symptoms, as well as the number of modules accessed by participants, sequential regression models were conducted, with statistical control for pretreatment symptoms, age and gender. The final models revealed that a reduction in PTSD, depression and insomnia symptoms was significantly predicted by the number of modules accessed (β = -.41; -.53; -.49 respectively, all p <.001) as well as the mean self-reported level of effort at module 7 (midway) (β = -.43; p <.001; β = -.38; p = .005 and β = -.36; p = .007 respectively). The number of modules accessed, on the other hand, was significantly predicted by the number of words in the 4th module (β = .34; p <.001) and 7th module (β = .44; p <.001) and the number of sleep diary entries (β = .28; p <.001). Conclusion These results confirmed that increased interaction with the platform positively influences treatment effectiveness and that increased use at the beginning of treatment appears to be a good predictor of treatment completion. This study confirms the importance of sustaining participants' commitment to online treatment in order to optimize its effectiveness."

            "title": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for dementia.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the application of an electrical current through electrodes attached to the skin. The commonest clinical application of TENS is pain control. TENS is also used occasionally for the treatment of a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions including drug and alcohol dependence, headaches, and depression. TENS is rarely used for the treatment of dementia. However, since the early 1990s a number of studies carried out by a group in the Netherlands, and one study carried out by a group in Japan, suggest that TENS applied to the back or head may improve cognition and behaviour in patients with Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. It was claimed that applying TENS could benefit patients with dementia by altering the activity of various neurotransmitters, or by increasing brain activity and thereby retarding neural degeneration and stimulating regenerative processes. It is claimed that application of TENS to the head may also alleviate the sleep disorders associated with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the treatment of dementia. Secondary objectives of this review are to determine whether any effect of treatment of dementia with TENS is influenced by any treatment parameters or patient features, including: the duration of treatment, electrical waveform, current amplitude, pulse duration and frequency and the patient's type or severity of cognitive impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 10 December 2002 using the terms TENS, transcutaneous, \"transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\", and \"electric stimulation\". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      All RCTs in which TENS was used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in this review. This included peripherally applied transcutaneous electrical stimulation as well as transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied to the head (also known as cranial electrical stimulation (CES)).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      All RCTs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review and for which sufficient data were available were included in this meta-analysis. Two reviewers extracted the data from the included trials. All except one of the included trials used similar outcome measures. Data of the same outcome measures were combined for analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Eight trials were included in the review but only 3 trials could be included in the meta-analysis. Sufficient data to include the other trials in the meta-analysis could not be obtained. From this limited analysis it appears that TENS produced a statistically significant improvement directly after treatment in: delayed recall of 8 words in one trial, face recognition in two trials and motivation in one trial however, no effect of TENS was found on any of the many other neuropsychological and behavioural measures evaluated either directly after TENS treatment or 6 weeks after treatment was completed.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although a number of studies suggest that TENS may produce short lived improvements in some neuropsychological or behavioural aspects of dementia, the limited presentation and availability of data from these studies does not allow definite conclusions on the possible benefits of this intervention. Since most of the currently published studies are well designed, although the numbers of subjects in each study is small, analysis of the complete original data from these and/or future studies may allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn."
