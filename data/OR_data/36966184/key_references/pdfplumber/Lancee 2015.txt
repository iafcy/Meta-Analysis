Abstract.Severaltrialshavedemonstratedtheefficacyofonlinecognitivebehavioraltherapy(CBT)
for insomnia. However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the
cognitivemodelofinsomnia.Identificationofmodifiablemechanismsbywhichthetreatmentworks

has two aims: (1) to replicate the finding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test
putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we
conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to
either online CBT for insomnia (n¼36) or a waiting-list control group (n¼27). Baseline and
posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors,
dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments
were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically significant
effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures,
sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviorsmediatedtheeffectsoftreatmentoninsomniaseverityandsleepefficiency.Together,these
findings corroborate the efficacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were
produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for
insomnia may specifically be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of
sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments. Key words: beliefs; CBT;
insomnia;online;safetybehaviors.
