39 Abstract
40 Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) for insomnia
41 comprising different sleep-related cognitive and behavioral interventional components has
42 shown some promise. However, it is not known which components are necessary for a good
43 treatment outcome.
T
44 Method: People suffering from insomnia (N = 104) without any other comorbid psychiatric
P
45 disorders were randomized (2:2:1) to two guided internet-based self-help interventions for
I
46 insomnia (multi-component cognitive behavioral self-help intervention [MRCT]; sleep
47 restriction intervention for insomnia [SRT]), and care as usual [CAU]. In all three conditions,
C
48 additional care or treatment was allowed. The primary outcome was insomnia severity
S
49 measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at eight weeks. Furthermore, the two active
U
50 conditions were compared regarding sleep efficacy from daily diary data over the eight
51 weeks, and other measures from the daily protocols. SeconNdary outcomes included sleep
52 quality, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, aAnd quality of life at post-treatment
53 (eight weeks) and follow-up (six months after randomization).
M
54 Results: Both conditions were more effective than CAU at post-treatment, with medium to
D
55 large between-group effect sizes on the primary outcome (ISI; MCT: Cohen's d = -1.15; SRT:
56 d = -0.68) and small to medium betweeEn-group effect sizes for secondary outcomes.
57 Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Active conditions did not differ from
T
58 each other on all measures from pre to post, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and
P
59 sleep protocol data throughout the intervention. Participants in MCT were significantly more
E
60 satisfied with the intervention than participants in SRT.
C
61 Conclusions: Results of the present study indicate that CAU + MCT and CAU + SRT are
C
62 both effective compared to CAU. There were no statistical differences regarding efficacy
A
63 between the two active conditions, but participants in MCT reported to be more satisfied with
64 the intervention.

69 1. INTRODUCTION
70 Insomnia is a significant public health problem, with one-third of the adult population
71 reporting symptoms of insomnia, and approximately 10% meeting diagnostic criteria for an
72 insomnia disorder (Ohayon, 2002, Simon and VonKorff, 1997, Morin and Jarrin, 2013).
73 Problems related to sleep, affect daily cognitive performance as well as mood, which in turn
T
74 affect quality of life as well as work productivity (Walsh, 2004). Insomnia has been proposed
P
75 to be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of many mental health disorders (Harvey
I
76 et al., 2011). As a consequence, insomnia is responsible for high social costs and the
R
77 economic burden of insomnia is very high, with the largest proportion of all expenses
C
78 attributable to insomnia-related work absences and reduced productivity (Daley et al., 2009).
S
79 Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychological treatment that targets
U
80 the maladaptive behaviors and dysfunctional thoughts that perpetuate sleep problems. CBT-I
N
81 is one of the most effective treatments for insomnia (Trauer et al., 2015, van der Zweerde et
A
82 al., 2018). A so-called multi-component therapy consisting of several aspects is recommended
83 by the current guidelines of both the American andM European sleep societies (Riemann et al.,
84 2017, Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008). Typically, CBT-I consists of several components such as
85 stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygDiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive
86 restructuring (Perlis et al., 2010, Morin et al., 2006, Okajima et al., 2011). Of note, CBT-I has
E
87 also shown to have considerable treatment effects for depression comorbid with insomnia
T
88 (Cunningham and Shapiro, 2018, Wu et al., 2015).
P
89 Although a multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown to be effective, it is not
E
90 clear which components of a multi-component therapy are most helpful to treat insomnia
C
91 successfully. For example, there is empirical evidence that psychoeducation and sleep
C
92 hygiene are not likely to be effective components of a successful insomnia treatment (Morin
93 et al., 1994). A
94 Several studies have investigated which components specifically contribute to treatment
95 outcome. In dismantling studies in a face-to-face setting, sleep restriction has shown to be one
96 of the most effective of these components (Spielman et al., 1987, Youngstedt and Kripke,
97 2004, Morin et al., 2006, Harvey et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2014). A recent review concluded
98 that sleep restriction is an effective single behavioral intervention for the treatment of
99 insomnia for sleep diary variables (Miller et al., 2014). Epstein and colleagues (Epstein et al.,
100 2012) conducted a dismantling study in older adults suffering from insomnia to compare
4
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
101 multi-component therapy, sleep restriction alone, and stimulus control alone, to a waitlist
102 control group. They found initial evidence that stimulus control, sleep restriction, and multi-
103 component therapy are equally efficacious. However, multicomponent therapy showed higher
104 remission rates and should, therefore, be recommended. Similarly, a study by Harvey et al.
105 (Harvey et al., 2014) compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with cognitive therapy
106 (CT) and behavior therapy (BT) in chronic insomnia and showed significant improvTements
107 across all three treatment conditions. The authors found the greatest improvement for
P
108 insomniacs in the CBT group, while improvements in the BT group were fastIer but less
R
109 enduring and in the CT group improvements were delayed in action but more sustained.
C
110 Unfortunately, the availability of CBT-I is severely limited for many reasons, including lack
S
111 of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, expense,
U
112 and inaccessibility to treatment and clinicians (e.g., van Straten and Cuijpers, 2009). Online
113 interventions represent a potential solution to overcome seNveral of the barriers to treatment
114 access (Andersson and Titov, 2014). Several randomized controlled studies of internet-based
A
115 self-help treatments for insomnia (iCBT-I) have shown its efficacy (e.g., van Straten et al.,
M
116 2014, Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ritterband et al., 2009), and recent meta-analyses (Seyffert et al.,
117 2016, Zachariae et al., 2016, Ye et al., 2016) show good results with large effects on insomnia
D
118 severity, and medium effects for sleep efficiency and sleep quality. There is evidence that
119 guided self-help interventions show beEtter results compared to unguided interventions,
120 irrespective of whether it is interneTt-based or not (Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ho et al., 2014).
P
121 Regarding dismantling studies in online interventions, Kaldo and colleagues (Kaldo et al.,
E
122 2015) compared eight weeks of a guided multi-component iCBT-I with an active internet-
123 based control treatmentC consisting of components with less empirical support for the
124 treatment of insomnia such as sleep hygiene, relaxation, mindfulness, and general stress
C
125 management. Notably, these components were only presented in an abbreviated form, and
A
126 there was no guidance. Multi-component ICBT was significantly more effective after eight
127 weeks. However, the two conditions did not differ anymore after 12 months due to a
128 continuous decrease in ISI among controls. A very recent study showed that a multi-
129 component therapy is more efficacious than online sleep education across a range of
130 demographic groups (Cheng et al., 2018).
131 In summary, even though a considerable number of studies show positive effects for guided
132 internet interventions for insomnia, there is still a lack of knowledge about which components
133 of a multicomponent treatment are essential for the positive effects, and whether all
5
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
134 components are necessary for an effective treatment. The current study aims to compare sleep
135 restriction, which is one crucial behavioral component of CBT-I, and a multi-component
136 cognitive behavioral treatment with an active waiting list control group. Furthermore, it aims
137 to compare the two active conditions. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that
138 compare two different forms of guided iCBT-I and the first study that investigates guided
139 internet-based sleep restriction. T
P
140 2. METHODS
I
R
141 2.1 Study design
C
142 This study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two immediate
S
143 treatment groups to an active waiting list control group. All groups had access to CAU and
U
144 the waiting list control group was enrolled in the iCBT-I program after the active treatment
145 groups had completed the programme (after eight weeks). NThe immediate treatment group
146 was followed up for six months after randomization. We wanted to be able to detect a
A
147 standardized between-group effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.35. Smaller effect sizes were
M
148 considered to be irrelevant from a clinical point of view. A power analysis based on an
149 anticipated drop-out rate of 25% revealed tha t approximately 90 participants were needed per
D
150 active treatment group to show such an effect with a power (1-β) of .80 compared to the
E
151 control condition. Furthermore, 40 participants were estimated to be sufficient for the control
T
152 condition because effect sizes between the control condition and treatment groups were
153 assumed to be largely based onP the previous trials, resulting in a sample size of 225
154 participants. For practicality reasons, we had to finish the recruitment procedure when 104
E
155 participants were randomized, therefore limiting our ability to detect small to medium
C
156 between-group effect sizes.
C
157 2.2 Participants and Procedure
A
158 Participants were recruited from June 2016 to July 2017 through newspaper advertisements,
159 online postings, flyers, and physician referrals. Inclusion criteria were a) age of 18 years or
160 older, b) meeting criteria for acute or chronic insomnia according to the International
161 Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014), c)
162 having access to the internet, d) good knowledge of the German language. Exclusion criteria
163 were a) known organic insomnia (e.g., due to restless legs syndrome, breathing-related sleep
164 disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), b) psychiatric comorbidities according to the
6
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
165 MINI interview (Ackenheil et al., 1999), and c) acute suicidality. After consenting to study
166 participation and meeting the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria (assessed via the
167 baseline online questionnaire and an interview via telephone), participants were randomly
168 assigned to one of the three conditions (2:2:1). The allocation list was made using a
169 computerized random number generator and was concealed from the investigators and
170 participants. After the randomization, the participants received an email regarding thTeir
171 allocation. All participants in the active conditions were advised to work through one session
P
172 per week and to start a new session after receiving weekly feedback by their Iguide. After
R
173 eight weeks, all participants were asked to fill out the post-assessment questionnaires online
174 and to participate in a second telephone interview to re-evaluate their dCiagnostic status. The
175 assessors could not be kept blind regarding group allocation because some participants
S
176 revealed information about the treatment during the interview. Six months after the beginning
U
177 of treatment, participants were contacted via email and asked to fill out the questionnaires
N
178 again and to take part in another interview. The trial was registered with
179 www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03110263) and was approAved by the Ethics Committee of the
180 Canton of Bern, Switzerland (2016-00295). M
181 2.3 Primary outcome measures
D
182 The primary outcome of the present study was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for the
E
183 comparisons between the three conditions. Also, we used sleep efficacy (SE) reported by the
T
184 participants during the intervention in the morning protocol for the comparison between the
P
185 two active conditions.
E
186 Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Insomnia severity was assessed with the Insomnia Severity
C
187 Index (ISI) (Bastien et al., 2001). Participants indicate the severity of sleep onset difficulties,
C
188 sleep maintenance difficulties, early morning awakening, satisfaction with current sleep,
A
189 interference with daytime functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to sleep
190 problems, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem for the previous
191 week. The German version of the ISI has shown acceptable psychometric properties (Gerber
192 et al., 2016). Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. Cronbach’s alpha at post was .83.
193 Sleep efficacy (SE). Participants in the two active conditions were asked to fill out an evening
194 and a morning protocol daily during the intervention phase to assess different parameters of
195 their sleep and its consequences. The protocols were in line with the protocols of the German
7
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
196 Association for Sleep Research and Sleep medicine (DGSM). We assessed SE with data from
197 the morning protocol for every night during the treatment period.
198 2.4 Secondary outcome measures
199 Secondary outcomes included the following measures: Overall sleep quality was measured
T
200 with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989, Riemann and Backhaus,
201 1996). To assess maladaptive beliefs in insomnia, we used the 16-item version oPf the
202 Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) scale (Morin et al., I2007, Weingartz
R
203 and Pillmann, 2009). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the German short version of the
204 Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (RadloCff, 1977), the
205 “Allgemeine Depressions‐Skala – Kurzform” (ADS-K) (Hautzinger and Bailer, 1993). To
S
206 assess the quality of life participants were asked how good or bad their health is on a visual
U
207 analog scale (QoL-VAS) from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health
N
208 you can imagine) (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman et al., 2011). At post-treatment, we assessed an
A
209 adapted version of a patient satisfaction questionnaire, the ZUF-8 (Schmidt et al., 1989). This
210 brief and reliable instrument was originally develoMped as a translation of the Client
211 Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson and Greenfield, 2004). As well, user
212 satisfaction was measured via the System UDsability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996).
E
213 Sleep protocol. As described above, we assessed different variables with 1-item Likert-scale
T
214 questions in both active conditions using daily morning and evening protocols by the German
215 Association for Sleep ResearchP and Sleep medicine (DGSM) within each of the internet-based
216 programs. Sleep quality (1 “very good” – 5 “very bad”), recovery (1 “very recovered” – 5
E
217 “very unrecovered”) and tiredness before going to bed (1 “not tired at all” – 5 “very tired”)
C
218 were assessed in the morning protocol. Daytime tiredness (1 “no daytime tiredness” – 8
C
219 “strong daytime tiredness”), concentration (1 “very unconcentrated” – 8 “very concentrated”),
A
220 mood (1 “very bad mood” – 8 “very good mood”), and relaxation (1 “unrelaxed” – 8 “very
221 relaxed”) were assessed in the evening protocol.
222 Diagnostic measures. Assessors interviewed participants via telephone at baseline (M.I.N.I
223 and ICSD-3). The German Version of the M.I.N.I. (Ackenheil et al., 1999) screened for
224 possible psychiatric comorbidities. The ICSD-3 (American Academy of Sleep Medicine,
225 2014) provides specific coding information for an insomnia diagnosis (Mayer et al., 2015).
226 Participants were interviewed at post-intervention to check whether they still fulfilled the
227 criteria for insomnia. Eight advanced master students in clinical psychology and the second
8
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
228 author conducted the interviews. All of the assessors had been trained in using the interviews
229 in a workshop including test interviews and feedback and were supervised by the second
230 author.
231 2.5 Description of conditions
T
232 Multicomponent internet-based guided treatment (MCT). The self-help program consists of
233 eight text-based sessions and tasks (see Table 1) and is based on interventions bPy Perlis et al.
234 (Perlis et al., 2006). The psychoeducational component covers information abIout the
R
235 processes of sleep, sleep hygiene and general information on stress management. The
236 behavioral techniques include sleep restriction (i.e., reducing the sleepC window to enhance
237 sleep consolidation), stimulus control (e.g., getting out of bed after a certain time of
S
238 wakefulness), and relaxation (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation). The cognitive techniques
U
239 included belief restructuring (e.g., targeting unrealistic beliefs about sleep). Comparable
N
240 MCTs have already been successfully evaluated in other studies (Holmqvist et al., 2014,
A
241 Blom et al., 2015, van Straten et al., 2014). All participants received guidance during 8-weeks
242 of treatment. Guidance consisted of weekly messaMges in an integrated secured environment of
243 guides who monitored the participant’s progress in the program and provided feedback and
244 structure. The participants could also use thDe integrated message function to contact their
245 guide whenever they felt the need to and were informed that the guide would answer within
E
246 three working days. The main aim of the guides’ messages was to reinforce the independent
T
247 program use and maintain the participant’s motivation. When a participant was inactive for a
P
248 week, the guide offered support with the respective module.
E
249 Internet-based guided sleep restriction treatment (SRT). The 8-week treatment program
C
250 mainly consists of sleep restriction instructions that are embedded in an introductory and
C
251 psychoeducational module (see Table 1). Sleep restriction induces mild sleep deprivation to
A
252 enhance the endogenous sleep drive. A sleep window was proposed depending on the time a
253 participant wanted to get up. Every week, a new sleep window was calculated based on the
254 participants’ sleep diary data together with the participant to select the timing of the window
255 (e.g., earlier versus later in the night). A more lenient sleep window was suggested for
256 moderate-to-severe tiredness. The sleep window was regularly reviewed at each module after
257 it had been introduced. If the sleep diary data indicate a sleep efficiency of 90% or higher, the
258 participant was advised to add 30 min to the sleep window (Morin et al., 2006, Perlis et al.,
259 2010, Riemann and Spiegelhalder, 2015). The minimum sleep window for this intervention
9
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
260 was set at six hours (Müller and Paterok, 2010). Guidance was the same as in the
261 multicomponent internet-based treatment (see also below).
262 Care as usual (CAU). Participants in the control group received access to the MCT program
263 after a waiting period of 8 weeks, at post-treatment of the active treatment conditions.
264 Because participants were allowed to use other resources from the healthcare system during
T
265 the study, we labeled this group as care-as-usual (CAU).
P
266 2.6 Guidance I
R
267 The guides were one psychologist with a Master’s degree in clinical psychology in his first
C
268 year of a post-graduate CBT training program and eight Master students who were in their
S
269 last term of a graduate program in clinical psychology. All guides had an introduction to both
U
270 online interventions and training of the principals of iCBT. Furthermore, they were supervised
271 by the second and the last author and received support regNarding email correspondence when
272 needed. For this, the guides contacted the second and the last author when needed. In the case
A
273 of uncertainties, the co-authors from the Sleep-Wake-Epilepsy-Center were asked for
M
274 additional advice. To ensure adherence, the second author regularly screened the content of
275 all messages sent. Participants were consecut ively allocated to guides without randomization
D
276 to minimize waiting times. All guides provided guidance in both conditions.
E
277 2.7 Statistical analyses
T
278 All statistical analyses were pePrformed with SPSS or R (R Core Team, 2018) and the
279 packages nlme (Pinheiro etE al., 2018). ANOVAs and ??2-tests were used to detect differences
280 in baseline data. To compare the two active treatments with the waiting list, we analyzed all
C
281 primary and secondary outcome measures with mixed-effect models using unstructured
C
282 covariance matrices and restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with time-points
A
283 nested within subjects. This approach uses all available data of each subject without
284 substituting missing values and allows the inclusion of all participants in the analyses,
285 following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The models were further examined using
286 contrast analyses. Within- and between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated based
287 on estimated means and the pooled standard deviation from the observed means. We
288 compared the two active treatments on the basis of daily diary entries (max. 56) in the
289 program during the eight weeks (scaled from 0 to 1). Within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d)
290 were calculated based on the estimated means at the beginning and after eight weeks and the
10
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
291 pooled SD throughout the 56 days. Within-group changes in outcome scores from post-
292 treatment to follow-up were analyzed with mixed-effect models and REML for the active
293 conditions only, as the CAU group was offered the online intervention after eight weeks.
294 Participants were considered responders if their ISI change score compared with baseline was
295 greater than seven at post, and treatment remitters if their absolute ISI score at post was less
296 than eight, following previous recommendations (Morin et al., 2009). Applying a T
297 conservative approach, we defined all missing data for response, remission and diagnostic
P
298 status as unchanged from baseline, i.e., first observation carried forward. I

313 quality of life assessed with the QoL-VAS. Bonferroni-corrected consecutive contrast
314 analyses for models with a significant interaction effect, showed that both active treatments
315 were significantly superior to CAU on all involved measures except depressive symptoms and
316 quality of life. Regarding depressive symptoms assessed with the ADS-K, only the MCT
317 condition proved to be significantly superior to CAU (p = .012) while the SRT was not
318 significantly different from CAU (p = .168). Regarding quality of life, the MCT group
319 significantly differed from CAU (p = .020) while the SRT group did not differ from CAU (p
320 = .207). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the active conditions on
11
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
321 primary and secondary outcomes, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep assessed with
322 the DBAS-16. Here, the MCT group showed significantly lower scores indicating less

328 group comparisons revealed large effect sizes in MCT (d = 1.62) and SRT (d = 1.41), and a
329 medium effect size for CAU (d = 0.64). C
S
330 3.5 Response, remission, and deterioration
U
331 Regarding response (change in ISI > 7), 9.5% of the participants in the CAU (n = 2), 31.7% in
N
332 the SRT (n = 13), and 40.5% (n = 17) in the MCT condition were considered responders at
A
333 post-treatment. Significantly more cases in the MCT showed response compared to CAU,
334 ??2(1, n=63) = 6.37, p = .012, V = 0.32. This was nM ot the case for the SRT group compared to
335 CAU, ??2(1, n=62) = 3.73, p = .054, V = 0.25. However, the two active conditions did not
336 significantly differ between each other
??2(1D
, n=83) = 0.69, p = .41, V = 0.09.
E
337 Regarding remission (ISI post score < 8), 4.8% of the participants in the CAU (n = 1), 24.4%
T
338 in the SRT (n = 10), and 38.1% (n = 16) in the MCT condition were considered remitted at
339 post-treatment. Significantly mPore cases in the MCT remitted compared to the CAU, ??2(1,
340 n=63) = 7.90, p = .005, V =E 0.35. This was not the case for the SRT group compared to the
341 CAU, ??2(1, n=62) = 3.67, p = .056, V = 0.24. Again, the two active groups did not differ
C
342 from each other ??2(1, n=83) = 1.81, p = .178, V = 0.15.
C
343 No participant iAn any condition showed a reliable deterioration on the ISI (difference of 8 or
344 more) at post compared to the baseline score.
345 3.6 Diagnostic status at post-treatment
346 In total, 86 participants could be reached for a second clinical interview after the treatment
347 (MCT: n = 35 [83.3%]; SRT: n = 31 [75.6%]; and CAU: n = 20 [95.2%]). Results in the
348 intention-to-treat sample indicated that 81% (n = 17) in CAU, 52.4% (n = 22) in MCT, and
349 48.8% (n = 20) in SRT still fulfilled the criteria for an insomnia according to the ICSD-3
350 criteria at post-assessment. The groups differed significantly regarding the diagnostic status at
12
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
351 post, ??2(2, N=104) = 6.40, p = .04, V = 0.25. Both active groups showed fewer people still
352 suffering from insomnia than in the control condition, p’s < .028. The two treatments did not
353 significantly differ from each other at post-assessment, ??2(1, n=83) = 0.11, p = .74, V = -0.04.
354 3.7 Comparing the two active treatments based on daily protocols
T
355 Participants in both active conditions were instructed to complete a daily protocol. Based on
356 these daily assessments we ran separate mixed models analyses with group and Pdays (0-55),
357 recoded as Time from 0 to 1, and its interaction from baseline to post-assessmIent (eight
R
358 weeks) assuming a linear change for all protocol items. Results are presented in Table 4. All
C
359 interactions regarding the primary (sleep efficacy) and most secondary outcomes (sleep
360 quality, feeling unrecovered, daytime tiredness, concentration, mood, and relaxation) were
S
361 non-significant (all p’s > .10). An exception was tiredness when going to bed (p = .003),
U
362 which remained stable in MCT but increased significantly in SRT. Within- and between-
N
363 group effect sizes were mostly in the small to medium range and can be seen in Table 4.
A
364 3.8 Maintenance of treatment effects at 6-month follow-up
M
365 All analyses in this section only include the two active conditions, as the CAU group had
D
366 already received access to the treatment after eight weeks. Mixed models analyses including
367 pre, post and follow-up scores (see TabEle 3) showed significant time effects for all scales
368 assessed at follow-up (ISI, PSQI, ADS-K, EQ_VAS), all ps < .027. Contrast analyses indicate
T
369 that follow-up scores improved from baseline, and post hoc tests using Bonferroni-correction
P
370 indicate stability from post-treatment to follow-up, as no significant differences were
E
371 detected. All Time X Group interactions were non-significant, F(2, 54.56-68.00) = 0.15-1.00,
C
372 all ps ≥ .35, therefore through all time points, neither of the conditions proved to be
373 significantly superiCor.
A
374 3.9 Diagnostic status at follow-up
375 Regarding insomnia diagnostic status at follow-up, 30 of 42 (71.4%) in the MCT and 24 of
376 41(58.5%) in the SRT condition could be reached for a diagnostic interview. Again using a
377 conservative approach defining missings as unchanged from baseline, 20 participants of 42
378 (47.6%) in the MCT condition and 25 of 41 participants (61.0%) in the SRT condition
379 fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at follow-up. This difference, however, was not statistically
380 significant, ??2(1, n=83) = 1.49, p = .22, V = 0.13.

381 3.10 Patient Satisfaction
382 Regarding the ZUF-8 assessed after eight weeks, participants in the MCT (M = 3.42, SD =
383 0.55) condition showed significantly higher levels of satisfaction than participants in the SRT
384 (M = 2.99, SD = 0.57), t(65.92)=3.23, p = .002. Regarding usability assessed with the SUS,
385 the two interventions were rated equally, MCT: M = 4.39, SD = 0.60; SRT: M = 4.18, SD =
T
386 0.64; t(66)=1.43, p = .16.
P
387 3.11 Program usage I
R
388 The average of completed modules in MCT was 6.66 (SD = 2.12) out of eight, mean
C
389 completed modules in SRT was 4.61 (SD = 0.80) out of five, over the eight weeks. For time
S
390 spent in the program, the median was 7.57 h in MCT, and 5.32 h in SRT. Using a non-
U
391 parametric U-test, this difference was statistically significant p = .008.
N
392 Regarding the usage of the sleep restriction module, the median for time spent in this module
A
393 was 14.7 min in MCT and 13.0 min in SRT for all participants. Using a U-Test, this
M
394 difference was not significant, p = .45. Relatedly, for the number of adjustments of the sleep
395 window, the median was three in the MCT and two in the SRT. This difference was also not
D
396 significant, p = .57.
E
397 3.12 Guidance
T
398 On average, therapists wrote 9.66 messages (SD = 3.19, Md = 10) in MCT and 10.05
P
399 messages (SD = 3.38, Md = 10) in SRT. This difference was not significant, U = 757.5, p =
E
400 .44. Participants wrote on average 5.44 messages (SD = 4.10, Md = 5) in MCT and 6.12 in
C
401 SRT (SD = 5.81, Md = 5). This difference was not statistically significant, U = 836.0, p = .97.
402 The two groups furCthermore did not differ regarding the number of words written by
403 participants (MACT: Md = 508; SRT: Md = 427; U = 755.0, p = .43) nor by therapists (MCT:
404 Md = 1484; SRT: Md = 1494; U = 820.0, p = .85).
405 4. DISCUSSION
406 The current study set out to compare two guided internet-based interventions to a waiting-list
407 control group for people suffering from insomnia. Both active groups showed significant
408 differences compared to the control group regarding the primary outcome. As such, the
409 present study adds to the growing literature of the efficacy of internet-based interventions for
410 insomnia also in people not suffering from other psychiatric conditions. Quality of life did not
14
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
411 increase compared to the waiting-list control condition in both active conditions. One reason
412 could be that potential participants with comorbid psychological disorders were excluded.
413 However, this finding has been reported in a previous study on iCBT-I with or without phone
414 support in which comorbid psychological disorders were not excluded and not assessed (Ho et
415 al., 2014).
T
416 Concerning the comparison of the two active conditions, the results of the present study
P
417 provide preliminary evidence that a multicomponent treatment (MCT condition) is not
I
418 superior with regard to insomnia severity to an intervention that focuses on sleep restriction
R
419 and omits working on dysfunctional cognitions (SRT condition). This was the case for
C
420 comparisons of insomnia severity at post as well as at follow-up assessment. However, results
S
421 indicate that the MCT group benefited significantly more regarding dysfunctional sleep-
U
422 related beliefs. The additional module on cognitive restructuring could have caused this
423 difference. Additionally, on a descriptive level but not at aN statistical level more people in
424 MCT compared to the SRT condition no longer fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at six
A
425 months. This is in line with results found in traditional CBT-I (Epstein et al., 2012, Harvey et
M
426 al., 2014).
427 Regarding depressive symptoms, only MCTD proved to be superior to the control condition;
428 this was not the case for SRT. This might also be due to the extra module on cognitive
E
429 restructuring. However, the results of the present study on comorbid depressive symptoms
T
430 may be underestimated, if comorbid major depression had been permitted in the present
P
431 study. Nevertheless, the result that MCT may have a stronger effect on depressive symptoms
E
432 seems important because a recent RCT in people suffering from symptoms of depression and
433 insomnia revealed that CICBT-I is effective in the reduction of depressive symptoms (van der
434 Zweerde et al., 2018). This result is also consistent with another study showing that patients
C
435 who suffer from insomnia and depression profit highly from insomnia treatment (Blom et al.,
A
436 2017). The result of the present study suggests that cognitive restructuring may play an
437 important role.
438 A sleep restriction module was part of both active interventions. A review of treatment studies
439 for insomnia showed that the absolute minimal sleep window – also called “minimal time in
440 bed” – can vary considerably (Kyle et al., 2015). This is important since sleep restriction
441 treatment can be associated with reduced objective total sleep time, increased daytime
442 tiredness, and objective performance impairment (Kyle et al., 2014). In the present study, we
443 set the minimum sleep window at six hours. It cannot be ruled out that a shorter sleep window
15
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
444 – although bearing more “pain” - would have led to more “gain” regarding treatment response
445 (Kyle et al., 2011). However, to minimize the risk of negative effects, we decided to use a
446 comparably long minimal time in bed. Future studies should systematically test the
447 association of different minimal time windows and treatment response.
448 All comparisons of different variables of sleep diary data, such as sleep efficacy, revealed no
T
449 significant differences between the two active conditions (all p-values > .10). However, it is
P
450 striking that - on a descriptive level - daytime tiredness decreased in MCT while it increased
I
451 in SRT throughout the interventions. Therefore, it can be assumed that more statistical power
R
452 would have led to a statistically significant difference between the two conditions regarding
C
453 daytime tiredness. More daytime tiredness should be considered a negative side effect of the
S
454 SRT condition. Of note, although participants had the same module on sleep restriction with
U
455 the same instructions and although usage of the sleep restriction module in both conditions
456 was similar, in MCT daytime tiredness decreased. One expNlanation for this finding could be
457 that if participants in a sleep intervention can choose from different interventions, they apply
A
458 the ones that work best for them or have fewer side effects. More research on which specific
M
459 interventions of internet-based treatments participants do apply and maintain in daily life is
460 needed.
D
461 Note that from a user perspective, participants in MCT were significantly more satisfied with
E
462 the intervention than participants in SRT. Also, more participants reported that they have a
T
463 specific preference for MCT (32.7%) than for SRT (5.8%) before the intervention started.
P
464 Considering that the amount of guidance and therefore the use of resources did not differ
E
465 between the two conditions, in sum, results from a patient perspective are in favor of MCT.
466 However, treatment preCferences that may be associated with treatment outcome expectancies
467 could have influenced the results of the present study (Constantino et al., 2007).
C
A
468 There are some important limitations of the present study that have to be considered. First,
469 due to clinical considerations, we excluded participants if they met the criteria for a
470 psychiatric disorder. On the one hand, this limits the generalizability of our results, on the
471 other hand, the results of the present study have a higher internal validity for people suffering
472 from insomnia. Second, apart from a diagnostic interview, all measures were based on mere
473 self-report. Third, the power of the present study was not sufficient to yield significant small
474 to medium effects between the two active conditions. A future study to find significant
475 differences between these active conditions should be powered adequately. We assume that
476 small significant effects could be expected in a replication of the present study with more
16
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
477 power. The recruitment for the present study had to be discontinued since recruitment was
478 slower than expected. A reason for this slow recruitment could be that most people only seek
479 support to cope with insomnia when additional problems such as depression or anxiety arise.
480 Since we advertised that people with comorbid psychological disorders could not be included
481 in the present study, these people did not contact us. Fourth, we did not systematically assess
482 the negative effects associated with the two interventions apart from reliable deteriorTation.
P
483 Taken together, both active conditions, MCT and SRT, proved to be efficacious compared to
I
484 CAU alone. Also, there is preliminary evidence that MCT might be more efficient regarding
R
485 dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, probably due to the additional cognitive module included in
C
486 MCT. Furthermore, participants in MCT were more satisfied with the treatment compared to
S
487 participants in SRT. Considering the equally-used resources (e.g., messages sent, number of
U
488 words used in the messages) in both conditions, one could argue that MCT should be the
489 internet-based treatment of choice for people suffering froNm insomnia.
A
490 Highlighting the high potential health-economic benefit of providing low-threshold internet-
491 based interventions for insomnia, two recent RCTsM showed that improvements in insomnia
492 symptoms mediate improvements in functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-
493 related quality of life (Espie et al., 2018) anDd psychotic experiences and other psychological
494 symptoms (Freeman et al., 2017). Despite these encouraging results of internet-based
E
495 interventions for insomnia one has to bear in mind that not all people suffering from insomnia
T
496 can profit from internet-based interventions. In the current study, in the MCT condition,
P
497 around 60% did not fulfill the self-report-based criterion for remission regarding insomnia
E
498 severity and around 50 % still fulfilled the criteria for insomnia in a diagnostic interview at
499 post-treatment. As a coCnsequence, research that improves existing interventions seems
500 necessary, or people who do not profit from internet-based interventions should be offered
C
501 complementary or other interventions in different settings. Related to the latter point, more
A
502 research on stepped care approaches in insomnia seems necessary. Likewise, generally more
503 research is needed in routine practice settings, such as in primary care or sleep clinics, to
504 generalize the encouraging results of internet-based treatments for insomnia.

Highlights
• Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) is effective in insomnia
• An abridged iCBT-I focusing on sleep restriction is effective in insomnia
• The treatment gains remained stable up to 6-month follow-up
• The effects of the two versions of iCBT-I did not differ from each other
• Patients were more satisfied with the full version of iCBT-I
