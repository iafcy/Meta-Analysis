pre- and post-treatment, with 9- and 18-month follow-ups. Feasibility was assessed post-treatment and one
month later. Most parents reported positive effects of the treatment. The intervention group improved signifi-
cantly from pre- to post-treatment and had a significantly larger reduction of insomnia when analyzed over all
four time-points (Wald χ2 =30.0, p <0.001), although the effect at post-treatment was very small (d =0.1) for
insomnia. Thus, iCBT-i was feasible and was related to reduced insomnia and psychological distress in bereaved
parents, both short- and long-term, but the results regarding the treatment effect are preliminary due to the small
sample size.
