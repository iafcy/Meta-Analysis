Abstract
Background: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing insomnia.
Objective: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT],
theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among
insomnia patients.
Methods: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly
assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n=156) or a control group that received
only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months
postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes
toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring,
behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in
outcomes between the two groups and across time.
Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months,
and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral
control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of
the intervention on outcomes.
Conclusions: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients.
