Abstract
Study Objectives: We sought to examine the impact of digital cognitive behavioural therapy
(dCBT) for insomnia on both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive
performance.
t
p
i
r
Methods: The DISCO trial was an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of
c
dCBT versus wait-list control. Participants were aged 25 years and older, met DSM-5
s
diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and reported duifficulties with concentration or
memory. Assessments were carried out online at banseline, and 10 and 24 weeks post-
randomisation. The primary outcome measure awas self-reported cognitive impairment,
assessed with the British Columbia CognitivMe Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI). Secondary
outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia symptoms, cognitive failures,
d
fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.
e
t
p
Results: 410 participants with insomnia were recruited and assigned to dCBT (N = 205) or
e
wait-list control (N = 205). At 10 weeks post-randomisation the estimated adjusted mean
c
differencec for the BC-CCI was -3.03 [95% CI: -3.60,-2.47; p<.0001, d = -0.86], indicating that
A
participants in the dCBT group reported less cognitive impairment than the control group.
These effects were maintained at 24 weeks (d = -0.96) and were mediated, in part, via
reductions in insomnia severity and increased sleep efficiency. Treatment effects in favour of
dCBT, at both 10 and 24 weeks, were found for insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, cognitive
failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. We found no between-group
differences on objective tests of cognitive performance.

Statement of significance
We conducted the first study to investigate the effects of CBT, delivered via digital
technology, on subjective and objective cognitive function in people with both insomnia and
cognitive complaints. We found that CBT improves self-reported cognitive impairment
relative to a waitlist control group at both post-treatment and 6 months follow-up, and that
t
such differences are mediated in part via reduction in insomnia symptoms. pWe found no
i
benefit of CBT on objective cognitive performance measured by computerised tasks.

Introduction
Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and second-most prevalent psychiatric
disorder in Europe1,2. People with insomnia report significant impairments to quality of life3
and cite cognitive impairment as one of the chief consequences of sleep disruption4. Self-
reported cognitive impairment manifests as difficulties with concentration, memory, attention
t
p
and decision-making. While the literature on objective cognitive performance (assessed via
i
neuropsychological tasks) is characterised by conflicting findings5-7, mreta-analyses reveal
c
small-to-moderate deficits in working memory, inhibitory control, episodic memory and
s
problem-solving8,9. More recent studies suggest that complex attention may be particularly
u
affected10. Both objective and self-reported cognitive impairment may explain, at least in
n
part, reduced work productivity and increased accident risk in those with insomnia11,12.
a
M
Sleep is known to play a central role in brain plasticity, memory consolidation and optimal
d
cognitive engagement13. Insomenia, therefore, is proposed to lead to impairment in cognition
through its adverse effetcts on brain structure and function14. Indeed, insomnia is an
p
independent risk-factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease15,16, and may
e
contribute to cognitive impairment observed in other highly co-morbid neuropsychiatric
c
disorders17.
c
A
Rescue of self-reported cognitive impairment through treatment is clearly important to
patients4 but to date few studies have assessed cognitive function in trials of cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT), the recommended first-line treatment. A recent review of this
small literature18 found that studies 1) assessed self-reported cognitive impairment using
low-resolution questionnaire items; 2) rarely included objective performance measures of
cognitive function; 3) evaluated cognitive function as secondary or exploratory outcomes;

and 4) often recruited small samples, with potentially confounding co-morbidities. The effect
of CBT on cognitive function remains largely uncharacterized in adequately-designed
studies. The present study, therefore, was specifically designed to examine the potential
impact of an established digital CBT programme for insomnia (dCBT), relative to waitlist-
control (WLC), upon both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive
performance. We also aimed to determine whether change in insomnia symptoms mediates
t

change in cognitive outcomes.

Methods
Study Design
t
p
The DISCO [Defining the Impact of Sleep improvement on Cognitive Outcomes] study was
i
r
an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of dCBT versus WLC. Participants
c
meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder were recruited from the community and
s
screened, consented, assessed and randomised on a 1:1u basis to intervention or control
using the online platform, Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.comn). Participants in the intervention arm
received access to the dCBT programme, Sleeapio (www.sleepio.com)19, while the WLC
M
group received access to the same programme on completion of study follow-up (24 weeks).
The study was conducted in the UK and approved by the University of Oxford Medical
d
Sciences Inter-divisional Research Ethics Committee (R46116/RE001). The trial was
e
prospectively registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN89237370) and the trial protocol

c
Participancts
A
We aimed to recruit 404 participants and achieved a final sample size of 410 (205 in each
arm). Participants were recruited from the community through multiple channels; for
example, the study web-link was sent to contact lists of people who had previously
expressed an interest in taking part in sleep research, and advertised on websites and social
media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Inclusion criteria were: 1) aged 25 years and
over; 2) meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder according to the Sleep Condition
Indicator21; 3) report difficulties with concentration or memory22; 4) have reliable internet

condition; c) take prescribed sleep medication on >2 nights in the past two weeks; d)
currently receiving psychological treatment for insomnia; e) report a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; f) report suicidal ideation with intent24; g) planned major

Randomisation and Masking
a
Simple randomisation with an allocation ratio Mof 1:1 was carried out using the randomisation
function within Qualtrics Survey Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA) on completion of
baseline measures. The research tdeam therefore had no access to future allocations and
e
were unable to influence randomisation. Other than the trial coordinator, who emailed
t
participants their allocation, the research team remained blind to allocation. Contact between
p
trial coordinator and participants was limited to standardised information, detailing
e
instructions focr dCBT access and completion of assessments, and did not cover therapy
content orc support.
A
Procedures
dCBT was delivered via the Sleepio programme, the efficacy of which has been established
in several RCTs19,25,26. Detailed information is available elsewhere19 but in brief, intervention
ingredients, covering key cognitive and behavioural strategies, are introduced by an
animated virtual therapist in a personalized but automated manner over six 15-20 minute

sessions. Participants also have access to a library of sleep-related articles and online
community forum, and can participate in weekly live discussions with a sleep expert.
Participants randomised to the wait-list control arm were informed that they would be
provided with access to dCBT at the end of the study (24 week follow-up). For both arms
t
there was no restriction on what treatments or support participants could accepss during the
trial, for sleep or any other health problem. i

Outcomes
n
Demographic data were collected at baseline. Major assessments of primary and secondary
a
outcomes were conducted at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks post-randomisation) and
M
follow-up (24 weeks post-randomisation). Participants received vouchers for completion of
assessments (£5 for baseline; £10 fdor post-treatment; £15 for follow-up).
e
t
p
The primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, was assessed with the British
e
Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI27), a six-item questionnaire assessing
c
perceived cognitive problems in the past 7 days. Items are scored on a 0-3 scale (range = 0-
c
18) and probe difficulties with concentration, memory, expressing thoughts, word-finding,
A
slow thinking speed and problem-solving. Higher scores indicate greater perceived cognitive
impairment.
Secondary outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia severity, sleep
efficiency, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.

Cognitive performance was assessed via web-based test battery. The battery was
developed by the UK Biobank Cognitive Psychology Sub-Group for Cognitive Assessments
and comprised 6 tasks. Participants were advised to complete the tasks in a distraction-free
environment and, where possible, at the same clock-time (across assessments), using the
same device (across assessments). Snap task (simple attention): In this task, two cards
(matching or non-matching) appear side-by-side on the screen. Participants are instructed to
t
p
respond as quickly as possible when they see two matching cards, and withhold responses
i
to non-matching cards (dependent variable: mean RT [msec] for correct responses on
r
c
matching trials). Trail making task (visual search, motor speed, mental flexibility): In the first
s
part of this task (TRAILS-A) participants are required to join numbered circles in sequential
u
order (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and number of errors). In part b
n
(TRAILS-B) participants are asked to join together numbered circles and lettered circles in
a
sequential order, shifting between sets (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and
M
number of errors). Reverse digit span task (working memory): In this task participants are
presented with a series of numbersd on the screen, increasing in string length across trials.
Number strings disappear ande participants are asked to insert the number string in reverse
order using a mouse-clickt keypad (dependent variable: longest correct string of numbers).
p
Pairs matching task (episodic memory): In this task 6 pairs of cards (level 1, 3x4 matrix) or 8
e
pairs of cards (level 2, 4x4 matrix) are flashed on the screen and then disappear.
c
Participancts are asked to remember their location and subsequently identify matching pairs
of caArds (dependent variable: number of errors when matching pairs for levels 1 and 2).
Progression to level 2 is contingent on achieving ≤ 1 error on level 1. Symbol-digit
substitution task (complex processing speed): In this task participants are asked to match a
series of symbols to digits (dependent variable: number of correct matches in a 1-minute
interval).

Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)28 and through
calculation of sleep efficiency (%; derived from three items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index, PSQI29). Fatigue was measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI30),
which comprises five sub-scales covering general, physical and mental fatigue, and reduced
motivation and reduced activity; sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale (ESS31); everyday failures in perception, memory and motor function were measured
t
with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ32); depression was measurep d with Patient
i
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-933); and anxiety was measured using two items from the
r
c
General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-234).

u
n
We report four outcomes beyond those that were pre-registered. We measured groups on
a
the use of prescribed sleep medication and non-prescription sleep remedies at baseline, 10
M
and 24 weeks. Participants were asked to indicate how many nights in the last two weeks
have you taken…(1) sleeping pills prescribed by your doctor; and (2) non-prescription sleep
d
remedies. The cognitive test battery also included a test of reasoning (fluid intelligence task)
e
at baseline, 10 and 24 weeks, where participants were presented with a series of problem-
t
p
solving questions (dependent variable: total number of correct answers in 2-minute period).
e
We measured proportion meeting ‘caseness’ for depression (defined as PHQ ≥10) at
c
baseline, 10 and 24 weeks.
c
A
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded if the research team were made aware of
them, and were defined as death, suicide attempt, admission to hospital, or formal
complaints about the dCBT intervention. We collected information on the following pre-
defined adverse effects at 10 weeks using a standardised scale35: low mood, fatigue and/or
exhaustion, extreme sleepiness, feeling agitated, bodily pain, headache and/or migraine,

euphoria and/or intense increase in mood, reduced motivation and/or energy, changes in
hunger and/or appetite, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling irritable.
Statistical analysis
The study was powered at 90% to detect a minimum standardised effect size of 0.42 at post-
t
p
treatment (week 10) at a 5% level of significance, accounting for 40% attrition from baseline.

Analyses followed intention to treat (ITT) principles and are reported according to the
u
CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological interventions36. All analysis was conducted
n
by the trial statisticians as partially blind (groups labelled A/B until analysis complete) using
a
Stata version 14 (StataCorp). Summary statistics (means and standard deviations for
M
continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical variables) are
presented by randomised group withdout testing for baseline differences.

p
A linear mixed effects model was estimated using maximum likelihood for the primary
e
outcome of self-reported cognitive impairment, measured by the BC-CCI. The outcomes at
c
10 and 24 weeks were included as the response. The baseline score was included as a
c
covariate in the model along with time point (10 or 24 weeks), randomised group (dCBTi or
A
WLC), and a patient specific random intercept to account for repeated measures. An
interaction between time point and randomised group was included to estimate the treatment
effect - the mean difference in scores between the dCBT group and the WLC group -
separately at each time point. Of primary interest is the treatment effect at 10 weeks. 95%
confidence intervals and two-sided p-values (significance level of ≤ .05) are reported with
estimated effects. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals where there was
evidence of heteroscedasticity. Cohen’s d statistics were calculated as the adjusted

treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation of the BC-CCI for the combined
treatment groups. Unadjusted means by the two randomised groups are also reported.
Secondary outcomes were analysed in the same way. For binary secondary outcomes, for
which a linear model was not deemed appropriate, a logistic mixed model was estimated.
Missing outcomes were assumed to be missing at random, conditional on the covariates in
the model. Moderation of the cognitive functioning outcomes (BC-CCI, cognitive test battery)
t

was assessed by including age at baseline in a three-way interaction in the linear mixed

models. This enabled estimation of the difference in treatment effect associated with an

For cognitive variables showing a treatment effect at 24 weeks, causal mediation methods

were used to investigate if changes in these outcomes at 24 weeks were mediated by
M
changes in insomnia severity and sleep efficiency, respectively, at 10 weeks. Parametric
regression models adjusting for the mediator measure at 10 weeks were used to test for the
d
direct effect of the intervention on the outcome at 24 weeks. The indirect effect was

estimated by multiplying the effect of the intervention on the mediator at 10 weeks and the

effect of the mediator at 10 weeks on the outcome at 24 weeks, and bootstrapping was used

to produce standard errors for the direct and indirect effects. Adjustment was made for

No adjustment was made for multiple testing for the analyses performed on the primary and
secondary outcomes as these hypotheses are pre-specified, correlated and related to each
other37.
Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of the primary outcome analysis to different
t
assumptions regarding departures from randomisation policies and missing dpata. A pattern
mixture model was applied to the data which estimates the treatment effeict under scenarios
r
where the missing outcomes at 10 weeks are imputed as being hcigher or lower than the

randomised (205 in each arm). Principal reasons for exclusion were not meeting insomnia
criteria, shift work, possible sleep apnoea and possible restless legs syndrome (see Figure

dCBT group less likely to provide outcome data than control (at 10 weeks: 76% for dCBT vs.
88% for control/ at 24 weeks: 66% for dCBT vs. 81% in control). An administrative error
meant that 43 participants (n=28 dCBT, n=15 WLC), who did not complete outcome
assessments at 10 weeks, were not sent a follow-up invitation at 24 weeks. In the dCBT
arm, 60% of participants completed all 6 online treatment sessions, 73% completed ≥ 3

At both 10 and 24 weeks dCBT was associated with less depressive symptoms compared to
the control group (d = -0.68 and d = -0.64, respectively). Exploratory analyses, focusing on

depression ‘caseness’ (defined as PHQ9 score ≥10), found a reduced likelihopod of meeting

We tested the extent to which treatment effects for cognitive variables at 24 weeks were
mediated by change in insomnia symptoms and sleep efficiency at 10 weeks. Since there
were no group differences on the objective cognitive tests we only assessed mediation for
self-reported cognitive impairment (BC-CCI). The mediators (ISI scores and sleep efficiency)
showed large treatment effects at 10 weeks (see Table 3). The proportion of the effect of the
intervention on BC-CCI at 24 weeks that was mediated by change in sleep efficiency was

Discussiocn
A
Uptake of the dCBT intervention was high and, similar to previous trials26,38, led to large
reductions in insomnia severity, indexed via sleep efficiency and global ratings of insomnia
symptoms. These sleep-related changes were accompanied by less frequent use of non-
prescription sleep remedies in the dCBT arm versus control. We observed large treatment
effects in favour of dCBT for our primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, at
both post-treatment (d = -0.86) and follow-up (d = -0.96). Group differences in self-reported
cognitive impairment at follow-up were mediated, in part, by change in sleep efficiency and

global insomnia severity ratings at 10 weeks, suggesting a potential causal pathway to
improved cognitive function via reduction in insomnia symptoms. Our secondary
questionnaire measures (cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety) similarly
showed treatment effects in favour of dCBT at both post-treatment and follow-up. In contrast,
we did not observe treatment effects on any of our objective cognitive tests (see Figure 2).

This is the first trial to assess self-reported cognitive impairment as a primary outcome post-
n
dCBT for insomnia. We recruited insomnia participants with cognitive complaints at baseline,
a
reflecting perceived difficulty with memory and/or concentration. Baseline scores on the BC-
M
CCI in our sample exceeded those observed in patients with major depression27, while
scores on the CFQ (everyday cogniti ve failures) were higher than those found in patients
d
with multiple sclerosis39. Large improvements on both the BC-CCI and CFQ, and medium-to-
e
large improvements on the mental fatigue sub-scale of the MFI, suggest dCBT effectively
t
p
reduces perceived cognitive impairment; and these benefits are sustained at 6 months
e
follow-up. This is an important finding because perceived cognitive impairment is one of the
c
most salient concerns for patients with chronic insomnia, impacting upon a range of quality
c
of life domains, including work performance and safety12,40. Further research is needed to
A
determine whether the management of insomnia in the context of specific neurological and
psychiatric conditions has the potential to improve self-reported cognitive and functional
outcomes.
Although robust effects were observed in the subjective domain we found no evidence that
dCBT engenders change in cognitive performance indexed via computerised tasks.

Divergent findings for subjective and objective cognitive function are common across a
range of neuropsychiatric disorders, with reported impairment often not supported by task
performance41,42. Subjective reports and task performance may probe different aspects of
cognitive health43. It is important to note that subjective cognitive complaints, even in the
absence of objective task-related impairment, have been associated with increased amyloid-
β deposition, evolution of objective impairment over time, and subsequent dementia
t
diagnosis44,45. While it is possible that our participants did not have objecp tive cognitive
i
impairment at baseline - and, therefore, limited capacity for change - we attempted to
r
c
mitigate this by recruiting participants with persistent insomnia disorder plus cognitive
s
complaints, a group more likely to display performance deficits46. Nevertheless, without a
u
control group of normal sleepers (or normative data for comparison) we cannot confirm the
n
presence of baseline impairment in objective cognitive performance. Below we offer several
a
(non-exclusive) explanations for the null findings.
M
d
Our tasks map onto widely used neuropsychological measures that have shown sensitivity to
e
insomnia (versus controls) in previous studies9,47,48, but they were relatively simple, brief,
t
p
and may not unmask subtle cognitive deficits49. For example, several studies reveal
e
impairment (only) when cognitive load is high, particularly for the domain of attention10,50. A
c
related point is that tests were performed outside of the laboratory, over the internet, and at
c
a time convenient for participants. While we advised participants to maintain standard testing
A
conditions (i.e. same device, clock-time, and distraction-free environment) across
assessment points, variability introduced by the testing environment may have further
reduced signal-to-noise ratio.
At least seven RCTs38,51-55 have assessed the effect of CBT on objective cognitive
performance in adult insomnia samples, four of which (including the present study) find no

evidence of benefit38,54,55. It is important to note that our study is the largest to date to test
cognitive performance through objective computerised tasks, with the power to detect even
modest effects. Impairments, if they reliably exist, may be trait-like and unresponsive to CBT.
Alternatively, CBT may not sufficiently modify sleep physiology in order to bring about
improvements in cognitive performance, consistent with findings from a recent meta-
analysis56. These possibilities require dedicated interrogation in future studies.

Limitations of this work should be considered. We employed a wacitlist control arm, which
s
may slightly inflate effect size differences compared to a minimally active arm (e.g., sleep
u
hygiene education), or behavioral placebo. Nevertheless, several studies show that the
n
dCBT programme used in the present study convincingly out-performs sleep hygiene26 and
a
placebo19 with respect to both sleep and daytime outcomes. Our sample was recruited
M
online and may not be representative of treatment-seeking patients in clinical practice. For
example, our sample was well-educated, with the majority holding a university degree, and
d
the vast majority (87%) were female. We required participants to report cognitive complaints
e
to enter the trial, which may have resulted in an over-representation of participants
t
p
concerned about the effects of sleep disruption on cognitive function. However, research
e
shows that perceived cognitive impairment is one of the most common consequences of
c
insomnia.4 We also excluded frequent users of hypnotics at baseline in order to limit
c
confounding effects on our cognitive dependent measures; the extent to which our findings
A
apply to those who regularly take sleep medication requires testing in future studies. Our
sample included people from a broad age range (26-82 years), potentially introducing
marked between-subject variability in the nature of sleep disruption, cognitive function and
health (and their interaction). However, our aim was to conduct a randomised trial in a large
sample of people with insomnia and perceived cognitive impairment; and we found no clear
pattern of moderation by age. A key strength of our study is inclusion of people with common
mental and physical health problems. For example, the majority of our sample met clinical

cut-offs for depression at baseline. Participants treated with dCBT were 62% less likely to
meet ‘caseness’ at post-treatment, and 51% less likely at follow-up, relative to control. These
results are consistent with emerging evidence showing that CBT for insomnia may exert anti-
depressant effects57. Improvement in mood may represent an additional mechanistic
pathway to restoration of cognitive function. Future study designs, capable of disentangling
temporal changes in sleep, mood, and cognitive function, should be considered. A final point
t
p
is that given the online nature of our trial we were not able to record sleep physiology and
i
therefore the sleep profile of our sample is unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that
r
c
insomnia disorder in combination with objective short sleep duration may have the most
s
pronounced effects on cognitive performance8,58. Future stratification based on objective
u
sleep parameters will help determine whether insomnia phenotypes have differential
n
response on cognitive outcomes.
a
M
In conclusion our study finds that dCBT robustly improves self-reported cognitive impairment
d
and that such improvements may operate via increased sleep efficiency and reduced
e
insomnia severity. We found no evidence that dCBT improves objective cognitive
t
p
performance relative to control, across a range of tasks and domains. The field requires
e
rigorously-designed studies, incorporating sensitive measures of performance and sleep
c
physiology in order to further delineate the effects of insomnia treatment on cognitive health.
