Study Objectives: To compare the efficacy of guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list
condition.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial comparing three conditions: guided online; face-to-face; wait-list. Posttest measurements were administered to
all conditions, along with 3- and 6-mo follow-up assessments to the online and face-to-face conditions. Ninety media-recruited participants meeting the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for insomnia were randomly allocated to either guided online CBT-I
(n = 30), individual face-to-face CBT-I (n = 30), or wait-list (n = 30).
Results: At post-assessment, the online (Cohen d = 1.2) and face-to-face (Cohen d = 2.3) intervention groups showed significantly larger treatment effects
than the wait-list group on insomnia severity (insomnia severity index). Large treatment effects were also found for the sleep diary estimates (except for total
sleep time), and anxiety and depression measures (for depression only in the face-to-face condition). Face-to-face treatment yielded a statistically larger
treatment effect (Cohen d = 0.9) on insomnia severity than the online condition at all time points. In addition, a moderate differential effect size favoring
face-to-face treatment emerged at the 3- and 6-mo follow-up on all sleep diary estimates. Face-to-face treatment further outperformed online treatment on
depression and anxiety outcomes.
Conclusions: These data show superior performance of face-to-face treatment relative to online treatment. Yet, our results also suggest that online
treatment may offer a potentially cost-effective alternative to and complement face-to-face treatment.

Significance
This is the first published study to compare guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list
condition. Whereas both treatments were significantly more effective than the wait-list condition, face-to-face treatment outperformed online treatment.
These findings may guide clinicians in choosing the right treatment format for patients with insomnia if both treatments are available to the patient. Yet, if
access to face-to-face treatment is limited, online treatment may be considered as it can significantly reduce insomnia complaints. However, our results
need to be seen as preliminary until replicated in future clinical trials.
