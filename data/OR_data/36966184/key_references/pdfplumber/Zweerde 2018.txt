were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow-up. We did not find significant post-test effects
on fatigue or total sleep time.
Conclusions. Findings indicate that guided online CBT-I is not only effective for insomnia
complaints but also for depressive symptoms. The effects are large and comparable with
those of depression therapy. Clinical trial registration number: NTR6049 (Netherlands Trial

Introduction
Insomnia and depression are both prevalent, severe disorders. Insomnia is characterized by
difficultyinitiatingormaintaining sleepforthreenightsper weekfor 3months, causing dis-
tress and impaireddaily functioning(American Psychiatric Association,2013). Depression is
diagnosedwhensomeoneexperiencesdepressedmoodand/orlossofinterestindailyactivities
for 2 weeks and shows four or more other specific symptoms (e.g. inactivity, concentration
problems)alongwithimpairedfunctioning(APA,2013).Insomniaanddepressionarehighly
disturbing to a person’s life and present significant financial burdens to society due to
increased care consumption and decreased work productivity (Léger et al., 2001; Daley
et al., 2009; Watkins et al., 2009). Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception; around
40% of people with insomnia suffer from clinical depression (Taylor et al., 2005, 2007) and
around 80% of depressed individuals suffer from insomnia symptoms (Ohayon, 2002;
Szuba et al., 2003; Franzen and Buysse, 2008).

Despite the high comorbidity between insomnia and depression, it is still unclear which
disorder should be treated (first) or whether combination treatments are more effective.

Discussion
Our primary aim was to investigate effects of online CBT-I on
depressive symptoms in a sample of people with insomnia and
at least a subclinical level of depression. We hypothesized that
the online intervention i-Sleep would be more effective than no
treatment (sleep diary monitoring only). Our findings convin-
cingly show online CBT-I, reduces symptoms of depression and
insomnia in people experiencing both.
Overall, the large effect sizes that we observed on depressive
symptoms (PHQ-9, d =−1.05; PHQ-WS, d =−0.76)

contrast with two face-to-face studies published in the past,
which did not observe an effect on depression (Wagley et al.,
2013; Norell-Clarke et al., 2015). The effects we found are larger
than those observed in two meta-analyses on effects of (online)
CBT-I for depressive symptoms (SMD=−0.36; Ye et al., 2015a;
