Summary
Background In view of the high co-occurrence of depression and insomnia, a novel way to reduce the risk of escalating 
depression might be to oﬀ er an insomnia intervention. We aimed to assess whether an online self-help insomnia 
program could reduce depression symptoms.
Methods We did this randomised controlled trial at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Internet users 
(aged 18–64 years) with insomnia and depression symptoms, but who did not meet criteria for major depressive disorder, 
were randomly assigned (1:1), via computer-generated randomisation, to receive SHUTi, a 6 week, modular, online 
insomnia program based on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, or HealthWatch, an interactive, attention-matched, 
internet-based placebo control program. Randomisation was stratiﬁ ed by age and sex. Telephone-based interviewers, 
statisticians, and chief investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was depression symptoms at 
6 months, as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The primary analysis was by intention to treat. 
This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12611000121965.
Findings Between April 30, 2013, and June 9, 2014, we randomly assigned 1149 participants to receive SHUTi (n=574) or 
HealthWatch (n=575), of whom 581 (51%) participants completed the study program assessments at 6 weeks and 504 
(44%) participants completed 6 months’ follow-up. SHUTi signiﬁ cantly lowered depression symptoms on the PHQ-9 at 
6 weeks and 6 months compared with HealthWatch (F[degrees of freedom 2,640·1]=37·2, p<0·0001). Major depressive disorder was 
diagnosed in 22 (4%) participants at 6 months (n=9 in the SHUTi group and n=13 in the HealthWatch group), with no 
superior eﬀ ect of SHUTi versus HealthWatch (Fisher’s exact test=0·52; p=0·32). No adverse events were reported.
Interpretation Online cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia treatment is a practical and eﬀ ective way to reduce 
depression symptoms and could be capable of reducing depression at the population level by use of a fully automatised 
system with the potential for wide dissemination.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder is preventable in 25% of cases 
with use of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).1 However, 
prevention of depression is hugely challenging. Most 
depression cases have an onset in young people unaware 
that they are at risk;2 furthermore, the causal pathways are 
poorly understood and are not associated with any speciﬁ c 
biomedical or psychosocial marker, doctors do not 
routinely detect depression risk, help seeking is low,3 and 
CBT can be diﬃ  cult to access.
One promising strategy to prevent depression in people 
at risk might be to target insomnia, in view of the high co-
occurrence of the two disorders. Evidence suggests that 
insomnia is associated with, but distinct from, depression, 
and is also linked to other psychiatric and behavioural 
disorders, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and suicide.4 
Nevertheless, depression is the highest comorbid disorder:5 
35–47% of people with insomnia have clinically signiﬁ cant 
depression and 60–84% of people with major depressive 
disorder have signiﬁ cant insomnia symptoms.6,7 Insomnia 
is also a strong risk factor for the development of 
depression, commonly preceding its development.8 
Insomnia complicates depression treatment,9 does not 
necessarily remit when depression improves,8 and 
increases risk of depression relapse,10 suggesting that it is 
an independent problem. Insomnia treatments for people 
with insomnia can be eﬀ ective in reducing depressive 
symptoms independently of their direct eﬀ ects on sleep 
symptoms, although the evidence is not conclusive.
To date, there have been four trials11–14 of CBT for 
insomnia (CBT-I) interventions targeting insomnia in 
patients with residual or concurrent depression. The main 
aim of these trials was to establish whether residual 
insomnia symptoms could be relieved in individuals with 
diagnosed depression. Two trials11,12 reported statistically 
signiﬁ cant reductions in both insomnia and depression. 
The other two trials13,14 had no signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings, but 
showed eﬀ ects in the predicted direction. In a trial15 of 43 
adults that examined the eﬀ ectiveness of CBT-I versus 
depression CBT, both delivered via the internet, in patients 
with a dual diagnosis of major depressive disorder and 
insomnia, CBT-I was as eﬀ ective as depression CBT in

reducing depression symptoms. Despite these ﬁ ndings, 
the mechanisms by which insomnia treatment might 
aﬀ ect depression are unclear. The treatment might act 
artifactually by simply reducing insomnia symptoms that 
contribute to measured depression scores, or it might 
reverse prolonged disruption of 24 h sleep–wake, activity, 
and neuro hormonal and metabolic cycles.
No trial has yet assessed whether depression can be 
prevented in people with both subclinical depression 
symptoms and insomnia. Thus, we did the GoodNight 
Study to establish whether insomnia could be a primary 
preventive target for individuals with high depression 
symptomatology, but not meeting criteria for a diagnosis of 
major depressive disorder. To maximise access and the 
potential for dissemination, we used an internet-based 
automated intervention, SHUTi, which focuses on sleep 
restriction and consolidation, rather than the direct 
modiﬁ cation of depression, anxiety, or rumination.16 We 
speculated that an insomnia intervention would be more 
acceptable to the public, on the basis of evidence that people 
frequently seek help from family doctors for insomnia.17 
Although several reasons exist as to why people with 
insomnia might not seek help, stigma is reported to be the 
reason in only 17% of cases.18 By contrast, stigma is the most 
frequently cited reason for not seeking help for depression.3
We recruited adults with depression symptom levels 
that were elevated but subclinical (indicated sample), who 
concurrently 
had 
insomnia 
(selective 
sample). 
We predicted that people given the SHUTi intervention 
would have fewer depression symptoms at the end than at 
the beginning of the intervention, and at 6 weeks and 
6 months, and that the intervention would reduce major 
depressive disorder, suicide risk, and anxiety, and improve 
disability at these timepoints.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this randomised controlled trial at the Australian 
National University in Canberra, Australia. Community-
dwelling adults aged 18–64 years were recruited through 
the internet by use of advertisements on a social 
networking site (Facebook), websites of sleep or mental 
health associations, and media releases. Initial inclusion 
criteria, via online screening, were the presence of 
subclinical depression, as measured by a score of between 
4 and 20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),19 
and the presence of insomnia, as measured by a score of 
3 or more on at least one of the ﬁ rst four items of the 
Bergen Insomnia Scale and a score of 3 or more on at 
least one of the last two items.20 Absence of a 2 week 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder or lifetime bipolar 
disorder, and diagnostic conﬁ rmation of insomnia, were 
established 
via 
the 
telephone-administered 
Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).21 In the 
diagnostic telephone interview, participants had to meet 
criteria for insomnia on Morin’s modiﬁ ed diagnostic 
insomnia interview.22
Exclusion criteria included shift work, pregnancy, or 
work, family, or other commitments that interfered with 
regular night-time sleep patterns, and if time of 
awakening was outside the hours of 0400 h and 1000 h, 
or bedtime was outside the hours of 2000 h and 0200 h, 
more than twice a week. Other exclusion criteria were 
absence of reliable internet access; diﬃ  culty reading 
English; a reported diagnosis of psychosis, schizophrenia, 
or bipolar disorder by a psychiatrist; or current 
involvement in a non-medication treatment programme 
for insomnia with a health professional. We also excluded 
individuals with an untreated sleep disorder other than 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 2012, and Aug 12, 2015, 
for new randomised controlled trials of depression prevention 
in adults published after Van Zoonen and colleagues’ 
systematic review in 2012. Our search terms were

AND depress*[Title]. We also searched for randomised 
controlled trials in which an insomnia treatment was given to 
individuals diagnosed with depression from 2012 onwards, to 
ascertain whether any trials were missed in our original search. 
Search terms for this additional search were 
((((((((insomnia[Title]) OR sleep*[Title]) AND depress*[Title])

(“2012/01/01”[Date - Publication] : 
“2015/08/12”[Date - Publication]). We identiﬁ ed no trials that 
focused on an insomnia intervention to prevent depression.
Added value of this study
We have shown for the ﬁ rst time that depression, suicidal 
ideation, and anxiety symptoms can be reduced in individuals 
at risk for depression by use of a behavioural online sleep 
program.
Implications of all the available evidence
An insomnia intervention could be the preferred method to 
prevent depression in individuals with insomnia because it is 
eﬀ ective, has low stigma, and can be disseminated through the 
internet to the appropriate population. Long-term follow-up 
results will provide more evidence for any continuation of the 
preventive eﬀ ect. Larger trials are needed to establish eﬀ ects on 
the incidence of major depressive disorder.

insomnia, medication changes in the past 3 months, a 
medical disorder accounting for their insomnia, or 
reported suicidal plans or attempts in the previous 
2 weeks identiﬁ ed by the MINI interview. Participants 
who did not complete ten online sleep diaries within a 
14 
day 
period, 
within 
21 
days 
of 
sleep-diary 
commencement, could not proceed to randomisation. 
The study was approved by the Australian National 
University Human Ethics Committee (protocol number 
2011/041). The study protocol has been published 
elsewhere.23 All participants provided informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Immediately after completion of the pre-assessment 
sleep-diary phase, participants were randomly assigned 
(1:1), via computer-generated randomisation integrated 
into the trial management software, to receive either 
SHUTi, a 6 week, modular, online insomnia program 
based on CBT-I, or HealthWatch, an interactive, attention-
matched, internet-based placebo control program. 
Randomisation was stratiﬁ ed by age and sex. Telephone-
based interviewers, statisticians, and chief investigators 
were masked to group allocation.
Procedures
Participants visited a web portal that managed screening, 
consent, randomisation, delivery of the assessment 
sleep diaries, baseline and endpoint surveys, and 
delivery of HealthWatch and link to SHUTi. Participants 
submitted sleep diaries for a period of 2 weeks before 
randomisation and start of the study program. All 
assessment surveys were completed online, except for 
the diagnostic interviews, which were administered via 
telephone.
SHUTi provides six sequential modules consisting of 
an overview of insomnia, and two behavioural modules 
focusing on sleep restriction and stimulus control, 
cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse 
prevention. An 11 item daily sleep diary is required to 
advance from the ﬁ rst to the second module so the 
system can establish an algorithmically deﬁ ned sleep 
window. The HealthWatch program has no speciﬁ c 
mental health or sleep-related content and is not 
associated with therapeutic reductions in depression, 
and can therefore be regarded as an excellent control 
condition.24 Modules contained information about 
environmental health, nutrition, heart health, activity, 
medication, oral health, blood pressure and cholesterol, 
calcium, and back pain, in addition to weekly surveys of 
these topics. Once a participant was randomly assigned, 
an email contact regimen was implemented to remind 
participants about completion of sleep diaries, and 
availability of program modules and assessments. 
Manual email reminders were sent to participants who 
did not complete 6 month follow-up assessments, and a 
telephone call was made to non-responders at the time of 
the 6 month follow-up MINI assessment.
Outcomes
The prespeciﬁ ed primary outcome was depression 
symptoms at 6 months, as measured with the PHQ-9. We 
tested the eﬀ ects of the insomnia intervention with 
inclusion and exclusion of sleep items in the PHQ-9. 
Secondary outcomes were current major depressive 
disorder and suicidal ideation at 6 months, as measured 
with the Psychiatric Symptom Frequency scale (PSF).25 
Additionally, at baseline and 6 month follow-up, we 
measured the proportion of participants in each group 
according to PHQ depression category (mild, moderate, 
moderate to severe, or severe). Other secondary outcomes 
included 
insomnia 
symptoms, 
generalised 
anxiety 
symptoms, disability, cognitive functioning, and help 
seeking. We assessed insomnia symptoms with the 
Insomnia Severity Index,26 a seven item scale with scores 
ranging from 0 to 28; scores of 15 or more are indicative of 
clinical insomnia. We measured symptoms of generalised 
anxiety disorder with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
7-item scale (GAD-7),27 with scores ranging from 0 to 21. We 
measured sleep-related and depression-related disability 
with the 12 item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.28
Because poor concentration is a key complaint of people 
with depression and insomnia, we measured cognitive 
functioning with the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by 
Telephone,29 assessed at baseline and 6 months only by 
trained clinical interviewers. We measured intended and 
actual help seeking to establish whether participants 
sought additional professional help for, separately, 
emotional problems or insomnia. Speciﬁ cally, intentions 
to seek professional help were measured with the General 
Help-Seeking Questionnaire,30 with scores ranging from 0 
to 12 based on intentions to seek help from a family doctor 
or mental health professional (higher scores indicating 
greater intentions) for either sleep problems or emotional 
problems. We assessed help-seeking behaviours with the 
Actual Help-Seeking Questionnaire,31 scored as a count of 
sources reported for help with either sleep problems or 
emotional problems. Participant preference for the 
allocated 
treatment 
program 
was 
also 
recorded. 
Participants were asked which of the two conditions they 
preferred: “Monitoring your sleep activity and then doing 
online training so that you can change your sleep routine” 
or “Monitoring your sleep activity, being provided with 
health information, and being asked your views about the 
possible causes of your sleep problems”, or could choose 
“No preference”. Medication use was based on the Client 
Service Receipt Inventory.32
Statistical analysis
Although our primary outcome variable was depression 
symptoms assessed with the PHQ-9, we calculated that 
with 80% power and a 40% reduction in risk in a 
sample with a baseline incidence of 15%, a total sample 
size of 972 participants was needed to detect our 
secondary outcome of major depressive disorder. We 
reasoned that our technology would allow us to recruit

up to 1600 in the allocated trial delivery window. 
However, recruitment was restricted by the planned 
release of new technological developments within our 
research platform, and the necessity to complete the 
18 month follow-up by 2016, when these changes would 
come into place. 
We used mixed model repeated measures ANOVA33 to 
account for missing data and to include all available data 
for participants analysed in the trial. This approach yields 
unbiased estimates of intervention eﬀ ects in the 
assumption that data were missing at random. We used an

alongside F-test statistics and t statistics. We did sensitivity 
analyses with removal of the sleep item from the PHQ-9 to 
control for reduction of depression symptoms scores 
arising solely from improved sleep. Additionally, we 
categorised individuals on the basis of four categories of 
depression, based on PHQ-9 cutoﬀ s at baseline, 6 weeks, 
and 6 month follow-up, and examined shifts in categories 
as a function of severity. The primary analysis was by 
intention to treat. We did analyses with SPSS (version 20), 
and used Stata IC (version 10) for categorical analysis. 
Ordinal mixed models for depression category and suicidal 
ideation were based on the gllamm procedure in Stata. 
This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand

Results
Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁ le. Between April 30, 2013, 
and June 9, 2014, we randomly assigned 1149 participants 
to receive SHUTi (n=574) or HealthWatch (n=575), of 
whom 581 (51%) participants completed the study 
program assessments at 6 weeks and 504 (44%) 
participants completed 6 months’ follow-up (ﬁ gure 1). 
At baseline, levels of employment, education, depression 
severity, anxiety, or sleep disturbance were similar between 
groups (table 1). Only six participants reported taking 
medication related to moods and emotions (depression or 
anxiety): three (1%) from the SHUTi group and three (1%) 
from the HealthWatch group. The preferred program was 
SHUTi (table 1). Mean PHQ-9 scores were in the mild 
range (table 1), a level of symptoms that is consistent with 
a clinical approach of watchful waiting. On average, 
3·5 (58%) of the six SHUTi modules (SD 2·5) and 4·7 
(52%) of the nine HealthWatch modules (3·5) were 
completed. Attrition from assessment was signiﬁ cantly 
greater in the SHUTi group at 6 weeks (Fisher’s exact test 
p<0·0001) and 6 months (Fisher’s exact test p=0·0015).
Depression symptoms were signiﬁ cantly reduced 
from baseline in patients in the SHUTi group compared 
with those in the HealthWatch group (table 2, ﬁ gure 2), 
and at both 6 weeks (t[724·5]=–8·2; p<0·0001) and 6 months 
(t[665·6]=–10·1; p<0·0001). At 6 weeks and 6 month 
follow-up, the mean PHQ-9 score for patients receiving 
the SHUTi intervention was no longer in the depressed 
range, whereas the score for patients in the HealthWatch 
group registered in the lower range of mild depression 
(table 2). Between-group eﬀ ect sizes (Cohen’s d) were 
0·69 at 6 weeks and 0·48 at 6 months. Within-group 
eﬀ ect sizes for the change from baseline to 6 weeks were 
1·34 for SHUTi and 0·41 for HealthWatch, and for the 
change to 6 months were 1·17 and 0·59, respectively. 
The depression eﬀ ects were consistent for participants 
with few and elevated depression symptoms (PHQ-9 
score <10 at baseline: F[2,453·7]=25·5, p<0·0001; PHQ-9 ≥10 
at baseline: F[2,166·5]=15·4, p<0·0001) The eﬀ ects did not 
change after omission of item three from the PHQ 
score: “How much have you been bothered in the last 
two weeks by trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping 
too much” (F[2,644·71]=28·1; p<0·0001). When age and sex

eﬀ ects were shown in favour of the insomnia intervention 
on depression category at 6 weeks (Z=–7·77; p<0·0001) 
and 6 months (–4·85; p<0·0001).
Not receiving the preferred condition did not aﬀ ect 
outcomes. Among participants who completed four or 
more cores (modules) of SHUTi (n=310), we recorded a 
signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect relative to the complete HealthWatch 
group (n=575; F[2,594·9]=32·6; p<0·0001), reﬂ ected in 
signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences at 6 weeks (t[685·0]=–8·05; p<0·0001) 
and at 6 months (t[612·4]=–4·98; p<0·0001). However, 
among participants who completed fewer than four 
modules (n=264), SHUTi had no overall signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect 
compared with HealthWatch (F[2,625·4]=2·8; p=0·060), but 
had a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect at 6 weeks (t[429·2]=–2·33; p=0·020) 
albeit not at 6 months (t[368·8]=–0·8; p=0·411).
On the basis of the MINI assessment at 6 month follow-
up, we identiﬁ ed 22 cases of depression: nine (2%) in the 
SHUTi group and 13 (2%) in the HealthWatch group. 
SHUTi had no superior eﬀ ect on diagnosis of major 
depressive disorder (Fisher’s exact test 0·52; p=0·32). 
Suicidal ideation was reduced at 6 weeks (t[69·3]=–2·5, 
Cohen’s d=0·14; p=0·012), but not at 6 months (Cohen’s 
d=0·08; p=0·390; ﬁ gure 3). Because the PSF was skewed, 
we also examined outcomes with an ordinal mixed model. 
The eﬀ ect of the SHUTi intervention on PSF score 
remained signiﬁ cant at 6 weeks (Z=–3·11; p=0·002), but 
not 6 months (–1·45; p=0·148).
We recorded signiﬁ cant eﬀ ects of the SHUTi 
intervention on all other secondary outcomes, except for 
help-seeking 
intentions 
for 
emotional 
problems. 
Speciﬁ cally, generalised anxiety disorder and insomnia 
symptoms were reduced at 6 weeks (Cohen’s d=0·50 and 
1·10, respectively; p<0·0001 for both) and 6 months 
(0·36 and 0·83, respectively; p<0·0001 for both), and 
disability was reduced at 6 weeks (Cohen’s d=0·33; 
p<0·0001) and 6 months (0·23; p=0·0071) with SHUTi 
versus HealthWatch. SHUTi had no signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on 
cognition (table 2). Intentions to seek professional help 
for insomnia decreased more in the SHUTi group than 
in the HealthWatch group at 6 months (Cohen’s d=0·10; 
p=0·013), but not at 6 weeks (p=0·064), whereas 
intentions to seek professional help for emotional 
problems did not diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly. The number of 
sources of help used also decreased more in the SHUTi 
group than in the HealthWatch group, both for sleep 
problems (Cohen’s d=0·24, p=0·0002 at 6 weeks; 0·23,

p=0·0015 at 6 months) and emotional problems (0·26, 
p=0·0001 at 6 weeks; 0·20, p=0·0113 at 6 months).
In dropout analysis, participants who completed the 
6 month assessment were signiﬁ cantly more likely to be 
married (χ²=16·6, df=5; p=0·0052), and were older 
(F[1,1147]=29·5; 
p<0·0001), 
less 
depressed 
(F[1,1147]=9·7; 
p=0·0019), less anxious (F[1147]=14·0; p=0·0004), and had 
less severe insomnia (F[1147]=10·0; p=0·0016) than did those 
who remained in the study. Participants in the SHUTi 
group were signiﬁ cantly less likely to complete the 
6 month assessment than were those in the HealthWatch 
group (χ²=10·1, df=1; p=0·001). However, completers of 
the 6 month assessment did not diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly from 
non-completers on the basis of sex, education, 
employment status, location (rural vs urban), suicidal 
ideation, suicidal behaviours, or condition preference. 
The eﬀ ects on PHQ-9 (and PHQ-8 and all other signiﬁ cant 
outcomes) remained after adjustment for characteristics 
that were diﬀ erentially associated with dropout. That is, 
after adjustment for relationship status, age, anxiety 
symptoms, and insomnia symptoms at baseline, the eﬀ ect 
of SHUTi on reducing depression symptoms remained 
signiﬁ cant (F[2,635·7]=34·5; p<0·0001), with signiﬁ cant 
diﬀ erences at 6 weeks (t[741·4]=–8·29; p<0·0001) and 
6 months (t[655·9]=–4·86; p<0·0001). No adverse events were 
reported in either study group.
Discussion
Our ﬁ ndings show that an internet-based intervention 
for insomnia eﬀ ectively reduced symptoms of depression 
in people with insomnia and subclinical depression at 
the end of the intervention and at 6 months’ follow-up, 
taking participants in the SHUTi group from a status of 
mild depression to one of no depression, according to 
PHQ-9 categories. This eﬀ ect persisted even after 
elimination of the insomnia item on the PHQ-9, taking 
account 
of 
diﬀ erential 
dropout 
and 
participant 
preference. The eﬀ ect was present in participants with 
both higher and lower depression symptoms at baseline, 
in line with ﬁ ndings reported by Bower and colleagues,34 
who recorded eﬀ ects at all levels of depression in an 
analysis of 16 datasets of low intensity interventions. The 
SHUTi intervention was delivered by an automated 
platform, with human contact occurring only during 
assessment to obtain telephone-based diagnoses and 
cognitive functioning at baseline and 6 month follow-up. 
Anxiety, insomnia, and disability all improved in 
participants in the SHUTi group, and participants were 
signiﬁ cantly less likely to intend to seek help (for 
insomnia) than were those in the HealthWatch group, 
and reported fewer contacts with professionals for 
emotional or sleep problems. The lower level of contact 
with professionals in the SHUTi group might be due to 
the actual beneﬁ t they gained from the intervention.
The size of the eﬀ ect on depression symptoms was 
similar in magnitude to internet-based psychological 
interventions designed speciﬁ cally to lower depression 
symptoms or major depressive disorder. For example, 
electronic health interventions of all types have been 
found to achieve an average endpoint eﬀ ect of 0·72 
(95% CI 0·55–0·90)35 in children and young people up 
to the age of 25 years, similar to our reported level of 
0·69. In adults, automated or unsupported depression 
interventions, such as ours, normally report eﬀ ect sizes 
of about 0·25. The eﬀ ect size of 0·69 approaches the 
size of that reported for face-to-face transdiagnostic 
interventions in adults with depression (0·80).36 It is 
diﬃ  cult to interpret the relative magnitude of these 
eﬀ ect sizes because the samples are likely to be very 
diﬀ erent and the purposes of the studies diﬀ er. 
Nevertheless, the eﬀ ect sizes achieved are substantial 
and clinically meaningful. Indeed, the eﬀ ect of SHUTi 
on depression seems to be stronger than that of non-
supported internet-based CBT program for depression 
in adolescents and adults.

A clear secondary goal was to establish whether cases of 
major depressive disorder would be fewer in participants 
in the SHUTi group than in those in the HealthWatch 
group. We did not record a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect; however, 
few cases of major depressive disorder developed over the 
6 month period, nine (2%) in the SHUTi group and 
13 (2%) in the HealthWatch group. This result was despite 
our prediction of at least 86 (15%) cases in the 
HealthWatch group, an estimate based on data from a 
subsample of participants in the PATH Through Life 
study,23 with similar initial depression scores, adjusting 
for the length of observation (6 months for the present 
study vs 4 years for PATH). However, if a less robust 
assessment of major depressive disorder is used, the 
PHQ cutoﬀ s suggest that cases of depression were fewer 
in the SHUTi group, with fewer SHUTi participants 
experiencing less moderate, or moderate to severe, 
depression at 6 weeks and 6 months compared with 
HealthWatch participants. The incidence of depression 
was 13·5% lower with SHUTi than with HealthWatch at 
6 months (4·6% vs 4·0%). These ﬁ gures were similar to, 
albeit lower than, the overall percentage reduction of 21% 
in a meta-analysis of 32 depression prevention trials of 
psychological interventions.1 Long-term follow-up results 
at 12 months and 18 months will provide more evidence 
for any continuation of the preventive eﬀ ect.
Suicidal ideation at 6 weeks was reduced in the SHUTi 
group. This is a notable ﬁ nding, particularly because 
participants had relatively low levels of suicidal ideation 
because individuals were excluded from the trial if they 
reported any suicide plans or attempts in the previous 
2 weeks or met criteria for major depressive disorder. We 
did not identify any prevention studies that used an 
insomnia treatment alone to address suicidal ideation, 
although studies have reported a link between suicidal 
ideation and insomnia.37 Our ﬁ nding of reduced eﬀ ects 
on suicide at 6 weeks but not 6 months is unclear, but the 
eﬀ ects were in the same direction, suggesting that the 
eﬀ ect dissipated rather than ceased. The ﬁ ndings 
reinforce observations that, although suicidal ideation 
and depression can both respond to an intervention, they 
represent diﬀ erent conditions with diﬀ erent trajectories. 
Suicidal ideation is clearly also linked to insomnia and, if 
not mediated directly by depression, might be mediated 
by stress, hyperarousal, or broader circadian disruptions.
We recorded an increase of less than 2% in development 
of major depressive disorder overall, but were expecting 
a conversion rate of about 15% on the basis of our 
epidemiological data. We did not recruit 1600 participants 
as per the protocol, reducing power to detect new cases of 
major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, our trial size of 
1149 represents the largest randomised controlled trial of 
an internet-based insomnia program to date. The lower 
than expected rate of major depressive disorder diagnosis 
might indicate a diﬀ erence in sample characteristics 
between 
study 
participants, 
unmeasured 
factors 
associated with good prognosis, dropout, or that our 
participants had a lower severity of symptoms than those 
in other studies and might have had some remission 
from symptoms before randomisation.
Although we had current diagnostic data, we did not 
have 
data 
for 
previous 
depression 
diagnosis. 
Consequently, participants might have included a mix of 
those experiencing depression for the ﬁ rst time, those 
seeking help for persistent subclinical symptoms, and 
those in remission. Very few participants reported taking 
medication for moods or emotions before recruitment, 
suggesting that our sample was relatively naive to 
medication and, perhaps, largely medically untreated for 
depression. This population represents individuals either 
with depression who might not seek treatment, or those 
who prefer not to take medication.
Although the dropout rate was about 50%, and higher 
in the SHUTi group, the ﬁ ndings were signiﬁ cant, even 
when accounting for diﬀ erential dropout. Diﬀ erential 
dropout is often greater in active conditions than control 
conditions in treatment trials, and can be interpreted as 
due to the additional psychological eﬀ ort required in the 
active group or to attainment of treatment goals.
It is increasingly recognised that prevention will reduce 
the prevalence of depression. Many people have both 
insomnia and depressive symptoms. If delivered widely, 
insomnia interventions might oﬀ er non-stigmatised 
assistance that could revolutionise public health 
depression eﬀ orts. To our knowledge, the present study 
is the ﬁ rst to show that depression symptoms can be 
prevented in people with depression and insomnia by 
use of an insomnia intervention. This ﬁ nding is notable 
given that the intervention used was a fully automated 
system involving no human support.
