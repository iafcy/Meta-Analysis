Background. Insomnia is a prevalent problem with a high burden of disease (e.g. reduced quality of life, reduced work
capacity) and a high co-morbidity with other mental and somatic disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
is effective in the treatment of insomnia but is seldom offered. CBT delivered through the Internet might be a more acces-
sible alternative. In this study we examined the effectiveness of a guided Internet-delivered CBT for adults with insomnia
using a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Method. A total of 118 patients, recruited from the general population, were randomized to the 6-week guided Internet
intervention (n=59) or to a wait-list control group (n=59). Patients ﬁlled out an online questionnaire and a 7-day sleep
diary before (T0) and after (T1) the 6-week period. The intervention group received a follow-up questionnaire 3 months
after baseline (T2).
Results. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) of the patients completed the whole intervention. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis
showed that the treatment had statistically signiﬁcant medium to large effects (p<0.05; Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 1.06),
and resulted more often in clinically relevant changes, on all sleep and secondary outcomes with the exception of sleep
onset latency (SOL) and number of awakenings (NA). There was a non-signiﬁcant difference in the reduction in sleep
medication between the intervention (a decrease of 6.8%) and control (an increase of 1.8%) groups (p=0.20). Data on
longer-term effects were inconclusive.
Conclusions. This study adds to the growing body of literature that indicates that guided CBT for insomnia can be
delivered through the Internet. Patients accept the format and their sleep improves.

Introduction
Insomnia is characterized by difﬁculty initiating or
maintaining sleep or non-restorative sleep. The dis-
order often persists for many years (Morin et al.
2009a) and is an important public health issue. The
prevalence is high, with about a third of the population
suffering from insomnia symptoms and about 10%
fulﬁlling the criteria for a sleep disorder (Ohayon,
2002; Morin et al. 2006b). Insomnia also has a high bur-
den of disease. People with insomnia often report
a decline in cognitive abilities and mood swings due
to fatigue, which impacts their daily life in various
domains (Roth & Ancoli-Israel, 1999; Kyle et al. 2010).
Not only is insomnia a signiﬁcant public health pro-
blem in itself, but also many people with insomnia
have co-morbid (mental) health problems or will
develop co-morbid disorders in the future. Most
often reported is the association with depression
(Taylor et al. 2005; Staner, 2010). In addition, research
over the past decade provides increasing evidence
that insomnia contributes to the risk of developing
heart disease (Redline & Foody, 2011) and is associated
with increased mortality (Gallicchio & Kaleson, 2009).
The societal costs due to insomnia are substantial.
These costs are caused by increased health-care use,
which is about three times higher among poor sleepers

than among good sleepers. Most of the societal costs of
insomnia (75%) stem from work absenteeism and poor
work productivity (Daley et al. 2009b). In total, poor
sleepers cost society about 10 times more than good
sleepers (Daley et al. 2009a).
Treatment frequently consists of sleep medication
such as benzodiazepines. Several meta-analyses have
shown that benzodiazepines are effective in enhancing
sleep in the short term (Buscemi et al. 2007), but also
that there are important side-effects such as drowsiness,
dizziness and light headedness. These side-effects
increase the risk of (trafﬁc) accidents and, especially
in the elderly, the risk of falls. The other treatment
option for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT). It has been demonstrated convincingly that
CBT is at least as effective as benzodiazepines in the
short term, whereas in the longer term CBT is more
effective than sleep medication (Smith et al. 2002;
Morin et al. 2009b). However, although CBT is the pre-
ferred
treatment
according
to
several
guidelines
(Siebern & Manber, 2011), it is often unavailable.
There is a shortage of CBT therapists, and professionals
are often unaware of the treatment facilities that do
exist. Moreover, CBT is relatively costly in the short
term compared with medication, even though the
costs in the longer term (e.g. days away from work)
may be reduced by CBT.

is to deliver the treatment over the Internet. During the
past decade eHealth has been introduced in mental
health care in general. Many Internet-delivered pro-
grammes have been developed for different disorders
such as depression, alcohol and anxiety disorders
(Andrews et al. 2010; Grifﬁths et al. 2010; Riper et al.
2011) and meta-analyses have demonstrated that these
programmes are effective (Cuijpers et al. 2010). How-
ever, they seem to be much more effective when
delivered with some form of guidance and coaching
(Spek et al. 2007). Recently, the beneﬁts of coaching in
self-help treatments have also been demonstrated for
insomnia (Jernelöv et al. 2012).
In a previously performed meta-analysis on self-help
CBT for insomnia (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009), we
showed medium effects (e.g. sleep efﬁciency, Cohen’s
d=0.42). However, of the 10 included studies, only
one
provided
the
self-help
through
the
Internet
(Ström et al. 2004). Other studies on Internet-delivered
CBT (Suzuki et al. 2008; Ritterband et al. 2009; Vincent
& Lewycky, 2009; Espie et al. 2012; Lancee et al. 2012)
have concluded that this treatment has positive effects,
although the interventions in these studies were pro-
vided without personal guidance or coaching and
some studies had small sample sizes.
In the current study we examined the effectiveness
of an Internet-delivered CBT guided by a personal
coach for adults with insomnia using a randomized
controlled trial (RCT).
Method
Design
In our RCT people were randomized to either the inter-
vention (Internet-based CBT) or to a wait-list control
group. The wait-list control group received the inter-
vention immediately after the post-test assessment.
Recruitment of patients
In a previous trial, for recruitment purposes, we
created a popular scientiﬁc website on insomnia
(www.insomnie.nl; Lancee et al. 2012). Because of the
overwhelming response to this website, we had to
create a waiting list. For the current trial we approached
those on this waiting list (about 1 year later) by email, in
batches of 100 to 200 people to prevent overloading
the coaches. The email contained a link to a website
with information on this particular trial. On this web-
site, people could register for participation. We sent
emails to the ﬁrst 1500 people on this list as this was
the maximum number of patients we could coach.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were: age 518 years and suffering
from insomnia. Insomnia was deﬁned according to
DSM-IV criteria as difﬁculty initiating sleep or difﬁculty
maintaining sleep and based on self-report. To be
included people had to be awake for at least 30 min
a night, for at least three nights a week, for at least 3
months (APA, 2000). Exclusion criteria were: severe
symptoms of anxiety or depression. Anxiety was
assessed with the anxiety subscale of the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Spinhoven et al.
1997; Bjelland et al. 2002; Andersson et al. 2003), which
contains seven items. Depression was assessed with
the Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression
scale (CES-D; Beekman et al. 1997). People with a
HADS score of 510 or a CES-D score of 530 were
excluded. Use of sleep medication was allowed.
Procedure
A total of 275 people (18.3%) registered on the trial
website (Fig. 1). They were sent an information folder,
a consent form, a link to the baseline questionnaire and
a 7-day sleep diary. Of these 275 who had registered,
137 (49.8%) returned the informed consent form, the
sleep diary and the questionnaire. Of these 137 people,
19 (13.9%) exceeded the cut-off score for depression
or anxiety and were excluded. The remaining 118

people (7.9% of the 1500 initially invited) were
included in the trial. Half of them (n=59) were ran-
domized to the guided Internet-based intervention
and the other half (n=59) were randomized to the wait-
list control group. Six weeks later they all received
another email with a link to the post-test questionnaire
and a 7-day sleep diary. Two weeks later the people in
the wait-list control group could start the intervention.
Eight weeks later we asked the intervention group to
again complete a questionnaire and a sleep diary. At
this time, the controls were only asked to complete a
questionnaire about their experiences with the treat-
ment.

The trial was registered on nederlandstrialregister.nl
(number NTR2132).
Power and randomization
For pragmatic reasons we were not able to recruit for
more than 5 months. Initially, we expected to be able
to include only about 50 patients in this period. In
other words, we expected to carry out a pilot study
and hence no formal power analysis was performed.
However, because recruitment was easier than ex-
pected, we continued inclusion until we met our full
capacity to coach the patients in the intervention.

Guided Internet-delivered CBT for insomnia
1523

A randomization schedule was generated by the
study coordinator (A.v.S.) by computer. We used
blocks of 10 to enhance equal distribution between
the groups. The actual randomization was performed
by an independent researcher. All patients were in-
formed by email about the randomization outcome.
Primary outcome measure
The patients were asked to complete a sleep diary for
7 days pre- and post-test, and at follow-up for the inter-
vention group. From these diaries we calculated the
sleep efﬁciency (SE), total sleep time (TST), sleep
onset
latency
(SOL)
and number of awakenings
(NA). SE is calculated by dividing TST by the total
time the person spent in bed (×100%). This SE might
be considered as the true primary outcome because
this measure can be used for patients presenting with
different
types
of
sleep
problems
(Morin,
2003).
Patients were also asked to rate daily how sound their
sleep had been the previous night and how refreshed
they felt in the morning. Both questions could be
answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not
sound/refreshed at all) to 10 (very sound/refreshed).
Other outcome measures
All patients were asked to complete an online ques-
tionnaire pre- and post-test, and at follow-up for the
intervention group. With this questionnaire we me-
asured (along with demographics): the duration of
sleep problems, overall sleep quality, use of sleep
medication, anxiety, depression and quality of life.
Overall sleep quality was measured with the Dutch
version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
The
questionnaire
is
well
validated
in
different
languages (Buysse et al. 1989; Backhaus et al. 2002)
but Dutch validation studies are lacking. The PSQI
is a self-rating questionnaire with 19 questions, and
consists of seven subscales (sleep quality, sleep latency,
sleep duration, habitual sleep efﬁciency, sleep disturb-
ance, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunc-
tion). Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. The
subscale scores can be summed to a total score ranging
from 0 (good quality of sleep) to 21 (very poor quality
of sleep). As mentioned earlier, the symptoms of
anxiety were measured with the HADS and the symp-
toms of depression with the CES-D. The total score
of the seven HADS items range from 0 (no symptoms
of anxiety) to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety).
The total score of the 20 CES-D items range from 0
(no symptoms of depression) to 60 (severe symptoms
of depression). Quality of life was assessed with one
question (on a the visual analogue scale, VAS), which
is
part
of
the
EuroQoL,
in
which
the
patients
rate their quality of life on a scale from 0 (poor) to
100 (excellent) (Brooks, 1996). Online administration
of questionnaires has been found to generate valid
and
reliable
data
with
maintained
psychometric
properties.
After the treatment period all patients were asked to
rate the intervention on several aspects. They could
give an overall rating score for the treatment itself,
and the feedback as provided by the coaches, each
on a scale between 1 (very poor) and 10 (excellent).
For each of the six lessons we asked whether the in-
formation in that particular lesson had been useful
(yes/no). We also proposed two statements (‘I gained
new insights because of this treatment’ and ‘I’m better
able to cope with my sleep problems because of the
treatment’) and asked if the patient agreed with those
statements (answers on a ﬁve-point scale ranging
from ‘fully disagree’ to ‘fully agree’). These questions
were developed by the research group.
The treatment
The Internet intervention was written (information,
examples
and
assignments)
by
the
ﬁrst
author
(A.v.S.). It is based on a collection of other self-help
materials for insomnia, textbooks and research litera-
ture. The ﬁrst version of the intervention was discussed
with the co-authors and several other sleep experts.
The treatment consisted of six weekly lessons and
included the different elements that are commonly in-
corporated in face-to-face CBT for insomnia (Edinger &
Wolgemuth, 1999; Morin & Espie, 2003; Edinger &
Means, 2005; Verbeek & Klip, 2005; Espie, 2006;
Table 1). Every lesson contained information, examples
of other people carrying out the treatment, and home-
work.
After
ﬁnishing
the
homework,
the
coach
received a notiﬁcation. Within 3 working days the
coach provided online feedback on the homework.
Patients could also send separate emails, for example
when they had a question about the information pro-
vided. At the start of the study, feedback took about
20–30 min per person per lesson. During the study,
as the coaches became more experienced, feedback
took on average 15 min per person per lesson. The
coaching was performed by A.v.S., four master’s
students in psychology, and one experienced CBT
therapist (J.E.) who also trained and supervised the
others. The aim of the feedback was to comment on
the exercise, clarify information and motivate the
patient to persist in carrying out the course and the
requested behavioural changes.
Analysis
All
post-test
analyses
were
performed
on
the
intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. Missing values were
imputed using the multiple imputation procedure
1524
A. van Straten et al.

implemented in SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., USA). We
created 20 imputation sets. We then used statistical
analyses to create pooled estimates of the 20 datasets.
Standard deviations for the post-test mean scores
were calculated separately because SPSS does not pro-
vide them. These were calculated by taking the natural
logarithm of the standard deviation of each dataset,
and taking the exponent of the summed result divided
by the 20 datasets.
Comparisons between baseline values for the inter-
vention and control groups were made with χ2 tests
(for dichotomous variables) or independent t tests
(for continuous variables). To test the effectiveness of
the intervention we ﬁrst tested the differences in the
post-test
scores
between
the
groups
with
linear
regression while controlling for baseline scores and
gender. The differences between the two groups were
then expressed in effect sizes. We calculated Cohen’s
d by dividing the difference in post-test scores of
the two groups by the pooled standard deviation.
Cohen’s d can thus be interpreted as the number of
standard deviations the intervention group scores
better than the control group (Cohen, 1988). A Cohen’s
d of 0.00–0.32 can be considered as small, 0.33–0.55
as medium, and>0.56 as large (Lipsey, 1990; Lipsey
& Wilson, 1993).
Next, we wanted to test the clinical relevance of the
intervention by comparing the intervention and con-
trol groups with regard to the percentage of patients
who had (1) improved between baseline and post-test
and (2) recovered post-test. However, no consensus
consists on the deﬁnitions of ‘improved’ or ‘recovered’
for many of the variables studied. Instead of not study-
ing clinical relevance at all, we arbitrarily deﬁned
‘improvement’ and determined post-test thresholds
as a proxy for recovery. For the PSQI we deﬁned an
improvement as a decrease in score of 53 points.
A score>5 is usually considered an indicator of rel-
evant sleep disturbances (Buysse et al. 1989; Backhaus
et al. 2002). However, only very few people scored
below this cut-off. We therefore set the threshold at
a score of 8. For SOL we deﬁned improvement as a
decrease of 530 min. The post-test threshold for SOL
was set at 30 min because there is some consensus
that this can be considered ‘normal’ (Lichstein et al.
2003). Improvement for TST was deﬁned as sleeping
at least 1 h longer and the threshold was set at 6 h.
For SE improvement was deﬁned as at least a 10%
increase and the threshold was set at 80%. For NA
we deﬁned improvement as waking up at least one
time less and the threshold was deﬁned as two awaken-
ings. Feeling refreshed and soundness of sleep were
both scored on a scale of 1 to 10. Improvement was
deﬁned as scoring at least 1 point higher and we set
the threshold at 6. Improvement for anxiety was
deﬁned as 53 points and for depression and quality
of life as 55 points. For the anxiety score on the
HADS we used a threshold of 47 (Olsson et al. 2005),
for the depression score on the CES-D 416 (Beekman
et al. 1997) and for quality of life (EuroQoL) 560.
Finally, we tested the robustness of the longer-term
effects of the intervention. We did not impute the miss-
ing values of the follow-up scores but only used the
data as provided by patients. We calculated the effects
between post-test and follow-up within the interven-
tion group with Cohen’s d.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Most of the patients were female (70.3%), living with
a partner (63.6%), born in The Netherlands (84.7%),
had a high educational level (58.5%) and a paid job
(70.3%; Table 2). There were signiﬁcantly less females
in the intervention group (59.3%) than in the wait-list
control group (81.4%, p<0.01). There were also less
people living with a partner in the intervention group
(55.9%) than in the control group (71.2%), but this differ-
ence only reached borderline signiﬁcance (p=0.09).

Guided Internet-delivered CBT for insomnia
1525

On average, it took patients almost an hour to fall
asleep (mean SOL=57.1 min), they slept for 5½ h
(TST), woke almost twice during the night (NA=1.9)
and slept 67.5% of the time that they were in bed
(SE). They rated the soundness of sleep and the feeling
of being refreshed as insufﬁcient (5.7 and 5.5 respect-
ively). On average, their sleep problems had existed
for 11.8 years (S.D.=10.2).
In general, it took people in the intervention group
longer to fall asleep (SOL 68.7 min) than those in the
control group (45.4 min; p<0.01), mainly because the
number of people lying awake for a very long time
(5 2 h) was higher in the intervention group (n=10)
than in the control group (n=2). Furthermore, people
in the intervention group woke less often during
the night (NA=1.7) than people in the control group
(p=0.02). There were no signiﬁcant differences with
respect to the use of sleep medication, depression,
anxiety or quality of life.
Adherence and satisfaction
Three of the 59 patients (5.1%) in the intervention
group did not start the treatment, six (10.2%) com-
pleted one or two lessons, seven (11.9%) completed
between three and ﬁve lessons, and the majority
(72.9%; n=43) completed all six lessons. Most of the
patients that dropped out of treatment did not provide
any reasons. Some indicated that they were too busy.
The treatment was rated as a 7.3 (S.D.=1.2) on a scale
from 1 to 10, and the feedback as a 7.6 (S.D.=1.2). The
third lesson, which was about stimulus control and
sleep restriction, was viewed as useful most often
(by 79.6% of the patients). All the other lessons were
viewed as useful by about 60% of the patients. About
two-thirds (61.2%) of the patients agreed with the
statement ‘I gained new insights because of this treat-
ment’, and about two-thirds (65.3%) agreed with the
statement ‘I’m better able to cope with my sleep pro-
blems because of the treatment’.
Post-test effects of the intervention: continuous
outcomes
The overall post-test response was 86.4% (n=102) for
the questionnaire, and 71.2% (n=84) for the sleep
diary. The non-response for the sleep diary was signiﬁ-
cantly higher in the intervention group (n=22; 37%)
than in the control group (n=12; 20%; p=0.04).
Furthermore, those who returned the sleep diary
were more often born in The Netherlands (89%
v. 74%, p=0.03) and they had a shorter SOL at baseline
(48.9 min v. 78.0 min, p<0.01). There were no other
signiﬁcant differences between the responders and

other health outcomes, after correcting for baseline
values and gender, with the exception of SOL (p=0.14)
and NA (p=0.15; Table 3). The effect sizes for overall
sleep quality (the PSQI score), TST, SE, soundness of
sleep and quality of life were large (Cohen’s d=1.06,
0.57, 0.95, 0.88 and 0.58 respectively). The effect sizes
for NA, feeling refreshed, anxiety and depression
were medium (Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 0.54). The
effect size for SOL was almost absent (d=0.04). The
95% conﬁdence intervals around the effect sizes
are all fairly wide.
Post-test data on the use of sleep medication were
available for 102 (86.4%) of the 118 included patients.
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
response between those patients who used sleep medi-
cation at baseline (response rate 91.7%) and those that
did not (response rate 84.1%; p=0.27). In the interven-
tion group the use of sleep medication decreased
from 28.8% at baseline to 22.4% at post-test (−6.4%).
In the control group it increased from 32.2% at baseline
to 34.0% at post-test (+1.8%). The post-test difference
between the intervention and control group did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance (p=0.20).
Clinical relevant changes: percentage of patients who
improved or scoring below a threshold
We arbitrarily deﬁned improvement, and set thresh-
olds for each of the outcome variables as proxy meas-
urements for recovery. The effects were largest on
overall sleep quality and SE: about 60% of the pa-
tients in the intervention group improved compared
to
around
15%
in the control group (Table 4).
Furthermore, about 50% of the patients in the interven-
tion group scored below the post-test cut-off whereas
this was the case for only 9.5% (sleep quality) and
18% (SE) of the control group. The percentage of
patients scoring below the cut-off for TST, feeling
refreshed and sleeping soundly were also signiﬁcantly
higher in the intervention than in the control group,
and they also improved more often. For SOL, NA
and anxiety, the differences between the groups were
not statistically signiﬁcant. Patients in the intervention
group did improve more often on depression and qual-
ity of life than patients in the control group but there
was no difference in the percentage of patients scoring
below the threshold as this percentage was already
high in the control group.
Effects at follow-up
The response at follow-up was 49% (n=29) for the
sleep diary and 73% (n=43) for the questionnaire.

Guided Internet-delivered CBT for insomnia
1527

There were no statistically signiﬁcant baseline differ-
ences between the group who did complete a sleep
diary at follow-up and those who did not, although
people who did not return the diary had borderline
signiﬁcantly higher anxiety and depression scores
(p=0.09 and p=0.10 respectively).
We compared the observed follow-up scores for
patients in the intervention group with post-test scores
to obtain some indication of the robustness of effects
in the long term (Table 5). None of the improvements
or deteriorations were statistically signiﬁcant and all
were very small. Most notable were the continued
small improvements in overall sleep quality and qual-
ity of life (Cohen’s d=0.25 and 0.21 respectively).
Discussion
In this RCT we studied the effectiveness of a guided
Internet-based CBT for adults with insomnia. First,
we showed that adherence was good (72.9% completed
the intervention) and that the patients were satisﬁed
with the information they received, the assignments,

the feedback from the coaches and the effects of
the intervention. Second, we did not ﬁnd any effect
of the intervention on SOL and NA, possibly because
of baseline differences and because SOL had some out-
liers. Third, the treatment had signiﬁcant effects
(p<0.05) on all the remaining sleep estimates (sleep
quality,
TST,
SE,
sleeping
soundly
and
feeling
refreshed in the morning) and on the secondary out-
comes (symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality
of life). The effect sizes were medium to large
(Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 1.06). Patients in the inter-
vention group more often improved and reached
recovery than those in the control group. The use of
medication decreased in the intervention group by
6.8% and increased in the control group by 1.8%.
However, these analyses were performed on the
sample of completers and were not statistically signiﬁ-
cant. Finally, the completers-only sample did not show
any signiﬁcant improvement or deterioration in the
longer term (3 months).
There were some baseline differences between the
intervention and baseline groups (gender, SOL, NA).
We therefore used gender as a covariate in all the stat-
istical tests on post-test differences, and we also
included baseline values as covariates. The post-test
response was high, with 88.1% of the patients provid-
ing some or all of the data. Although there were some
baseline differences between post-test responders and
non-responders, the risk of bias is probably low
because the non-response percentage was small and
these data were estimated using multiple imputation.
However, the follow-up data should be interpreted
with caution. As the non-response percentage for the
sleep diary was 51%, we decided not to impute the
data but to show the results for the responders only.
Hence these data may be biased, and suggest that
more research on the longer-term effects of Internet
treatments for insomnia is necessary.
We recruited our patients through a waitlist, which
comprised people who had indicated 1 year earlier
that they were interested in participating in an insom-
nia study. Those people that responded to our invita-
tion were still, or again, suffering from insomnia.
Thus, it is thus likely that our sample was skewed
towards higher insomnia severity. Baseline sleep esti-
mates indeed indicate severe problems: SOL of almost
1 h, TST of 5.5 h and SE of 68%, which on average had
lasted for 12 years. Even though this might indicate
that our group is not representative for all insomnia
patients, it might consist of the patients most in need
for treatment.
The effects of our intervention are promising. Two
previous meta-analyses on self-help for insomnia
showed, for example, an effect size of 0.40 (Cheng &
Dizon, 2012) and 0.42 (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009)
for SE whereas in the current study the SE effect size
was much higher (d=0.95). One reason for our positive
results might be that the patients in the intervention
received regular weekly feedback from their personal
coach. This might also have been responsible for our

Guided Internet-delivered CBT for insomnia

high adherence rates and overall satisfaction with
the intervention. In general, higher effects are de-
monstrated for guided web-based interventions than
for unguided ones (Spek et al. 2007; Richards &
Richardson, 2012). However, it has been argued that
unguided interventions might in future become as
beneﬁcial as guided interventions once the websites
are more interactive and technically better, for example
including automated personalized feedback based on
text or answers on quizzes and questionnaires. Some
studies on unguided Internet-delivered insomnia treat-
ments also show promising results (e.g. Ritterband
et al. 2009; Espie et al. 2012) but, to date, only one
study has compared guided with unguided self-help
for insomnia (Jernelöv et al. 2012). That study supports
the notion that guidance increase effectiveness. We rec-
ommend replication of that study using Internet-guided
treatment and also examining the cost-effectiveness of
the two approaches.
The effects of face-to-face treatments for insomnia are
well studied and their results are summarized in
reviews (e.g. Morin et al. 2006a). Although no formal
meta-analysis has been performed and no overall esti-
mate for face-to-face treatments is available, the effects
seem to be of the same order of magnitude as those of
our study. Unfortunately, there are very few studies
that directly compare face-to-face treatments with self-
help or Internet treatments. In our previous meta-
analysis on self-help, we demonstrated that those few
studies that exist do not demonstrate a clear difference
in effect (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009). The compar-
ability of effects between face-to-face treatments and
self-help (Internet) treatments has been demonstrated
for anxiety and depression (Cuijpers et al. 2010). We
need further studies examining accessibility, effects
and costs, to demonstrate which intervention should
be used when and for whom.
In our opinion people with co-morbidity should be
included in insomnia treatment trials because co-
morbidity tends to be the rule rather than the excep-
tion. In particular, co-morbidity with mental disorders
is very common. People with insomnia are about
10 times more likely to have depression and 17 times
more likely to have an anxiety disorder than people
without insomnia (Taylor et al. 2005). In our study
we excluded people with severe anxiety or depressive
disorders because the most effective treatment strategy
for people with co-morbid insomnia and more severe
mental health problems is not known. This is an
important topic that requires further investigation.
We did include people who reported moderate symp-
toms of anxiety and depression. These symptoms
improved during the intervention period with medium
effect sizes (Cohen’s d=0.53 and 0.44). This might indi-
cate that insomnia is one of the causes of mental health
problems or that there are other underlying mechan-
isms that lead to disruption of both mood and sleep
(Turek, 2005; Fairholme et al. 2012). This signiﬁcant
ﬁnding stresses the importance of insomnia treatment,
as it might be useful to reduce moderate symptoms of
depression or anxiety.
There are several limitations to this study. First, the
diagnosis of insomnia was based purely on self-report
and was not conﬁrmed by a clinician. This means that
it is possible that some people in our sample did not
suffer from full-blown insomnia or suffered other
sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea). In future we
would prefer this intervention to be delivered through
general practitioners (GPs). This means that the GPs
might screen out mild cases and those with other
serious sleep or medical disorders. However, we
would like to stress that our method of recruitment
did not result in a sample of only mild cases. The
fact that 72.9% of the patients completed the interven-
tion (and put in considerable effort in completing the
exercises) seems to indicate that those people were
indeed in need of help. A second limitation is that
the sleep estimates were based on sleep diaries and
not on more objective measures such as polysomnogra-
phy or actigraphy. The use of both subjective and
objective measures has been recommended because
people with insomnia often over- or underestimate
their actual sleep time (Buysse et al. 2006; Van den
Berg et al. 2008). However, using polysomnography
is costly and imposes a burden on the patients.
Therefore, sleep diaries are currently the most widely
used outcome measure in insomnia treatment studies
(Morin, 2003). Sleep diaries are also generally well
accepted because it is the subjective complaint that
prompts patients to seek treatment. The third limit-
ation is that we did not measure daytime consequences
of insomnia. As it is already an effort for patients to
keep a sleep diary, we wanted to keep the number of
remaining questions as low as possible. However,
now that this intervention has proved to be effective
with regard to sleep estimates, a next step would be
to investigate the consequences of these improvements
for daytime functioning. This is ultimately the most
important outcome for patients but is also essential
in demonstrating possible cost-effectiveness. Almost
two-thirds of our sample had a paid job, and loss of
work productivity is one of the most common conse-
quences of insomnia but also the most costly (Dailey
et al. 2009a). The self-help study of Jernelöv et al.
(2012) is one of the few to demonstrate positive effects
on daytime functioning after self-help treatment.
In summary, this study adds to the growing body of
literature that indicates that guided CBT for insomnia
can be delivered through the Internet. We suggest
that it is time for large-scale implementation projects.
