Abstract
Background: Digital, self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions circumvent many barriers to in-person
therapy for young people (aged 12-24 years), although adherence to these interventions is low. The absence or insufficient
disclosure of recommendations or instructions for appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not
self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree of treatment.
Objective: This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital CBT for depression and anxiety in young people
to describe how appropriate use has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe how adherence
has been measured, and to determine the associations between adherence and treatment outcomes.
Methods: A systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) extracting data independently. Overall, 4
electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met
the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting
depression or anxiety, and reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. Studies that evaluated
non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using
the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs.
Results: There were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths).
Definitions of appropriate use varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, duration and frequency
of use, and the features used to support engagement and adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use
definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing components of appropriate use or providing
information on how recommendations for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were derived from
the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention
completion; however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little evidence of an association between degree
of use and outcomes in the 9 studies that examined this.
Conclusions: Definitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT intervention. However, statements of appropriate
use are not systematically reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for use are communicated
to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically operationalized
as the degree of intervention completion and was not consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote
systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions to provide guidance to users and to assist the
development of appropriate and nuanced measures of adherence.

Introduction
Background
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a structured, skills-based
psychotherapy, typically delivered in-person by a trained
clinician over a duration of 12 to 18 weeks [1,2]. It is the gold
standard psychological treatment for anxiety and depression [3]
in both adults and young people, defined here as people aged
between 12 and 24 years, consistent with the Australian Institute
of Health and Welfare [4-7]. To safeguard the integrity of CBT
and ensure that efficacy is maintained [8], CBT manuals provide
clinicians with explicit instructions on administration. These
manuals detail indications of who will benefit, the treatment
targets and goals, the number and duration of sessions required,
sequence of content delivery, and between-session practice and
real-world enactment of skills (ie, homework [9]). Clinicians
also adapt various engagement strategies to promote adherence
to CBT, including developing a therapeutic alliance through
collaborative goal setting, communicating and enhancing
treatment expectancies, and clarifying concepts to ensure that
treatment processes and rationale are well understood
[1,2,5-7,10,11]. Some CBT manuals also differentiate the
critical, core treatment components from optional modules and
strategies to measure symptoms and treatment outcomes [1].
To summarize, the components of CBT manuals that guide
clinicians’administration as intended are as follows: recipients,
target condition, number and duration of sessions, sequence of
content, homework activities, engagement-promoting strategies,
core therapeutic components, assessment and monitoring, and
crisis management.
Despite its efficacy, the uptake of in-person CBT is suboptimal
across all ages [12-15]. In young people, this is due in part to
the affordability and availability of trained practitioners,
perceived stigma, poor mental health literacy, and a preference
for self-reliance [16-18]. Among the young people who do seek
help, most do not receive CBT [19,20]. Improving access and
uptake of CBT is particularly critical for young people, as
three-quarter of depression and anxiety cases emerge by late
adolescence [21], and these disorders are a leading cause of
disability in this age group [22,23]. The transition of CBT from
in-person professional administration to digital, self-directed
delivery was hypothesized to overcome many of the treatment
barriers faced by young people [24]. A recent systematic review
and meta-analysis of internet- and computer-delivered CBT for
youth confirmed the positive effects of these interventions on
symptom reduction [25]. However, adherence to many of these
interventions is low despite the alignment of digital CBT with
young people’s help-seeking preferences [24].
Although personal factors such as motivation may account for
low adherence, reliance on the young person to appropriately
self-administer digital CBT interventions with none to limited
clinician guidance or supervision may also contribute. Thus,
similar to any self-administered treatment, it is essential that
the young person is provided with clear instructions to ensure
appropriate use; that is, to ensure that the intervention is used
in a way that generates optimal clinical benefit. Unlike in-person
CBT, where instructions for engaging with the treatment are
well documented within manuals and directly relayed to youth
through their clinician, it is unclear whether instructions or
recommendations for the appropriate use of digital CBT are
provided to users or consistently documented in the literature.
Instructions for use may be provided during intervention
onboarding or guided via explicit or implicit software design
features. For example, many digital CBT interventions have
used the design feature, “tunnelling,” to replicate the structure
of in-person CBT, whereby therapeutic modules are presented
sequentially to guide users through the content in an appropriate
sequence [26,27]. Other software design features, such as
tailoring content in response to user input, automated feedback,
rewards and encouragement, and reminders and notifications,
have also been used to replicate clinician guidance and
supervision [28]. An understanding of how digital CBT
interventions define appropriate use and how instructions for
use are relayed to youth requires examination to determine their
adequacy in supporting appropriate self-administration.
In addition to ensuring optimal outcomes, clear instructions for
the use of digital CBT interventions are required for researchers
and clinicians to operationalize users’ adherence to these
interventions. Adherence is defined as a meaningful measure
of the extent to which individuals’intervention use corresponds
with creators’recommendations, instructions, and expectations
of appropriate use [29,30]. For example, if the recommendation
is to complete all modules within a digital intervention,
adherence is measured by determining the number of modules
completed. Alternatively, if the recommendation is to engage
with a particular intervention activity on a specified occasion
(eg, complete a mindfulness mediation upon waking), adherence
is measured by determining the frequency of this event. In this
way, adherence provides a measure of the validity of treatment
administration. Thus, clear instructions for appropriate use and
corresponding adherence measures are crucial for ensuring that
the necessary standards of quality, safety, and efficacy are met.
Despite the importance of this, in a review of the literature,
Christ et al [25] found that many studies on digital CBT for
youth generically operationalized adherence as program
completion, heterogeneously reported as the proportion of
participants who completed all treatment modules or the average
number of modules completed across the sample. Several studies
failed to report any adherence data, and definitions of
appropriate use were not examined in the study by Christ [25].
Similar variability in the reporting of adherence has been found
in reviews of adult digital health interventions. One systematic

review found that almost three-quarter of studies (45/62, 73%)
operationalized adherence as the degree of intervention use,
reported as the number of completed modules and activities,
log-ins, or time spent in the intervention [31]. Furthermore,
statements on instructions for use were only reported in one-third
(23/62, 37%) of studies, giving little indication of how
interventions defined appropriate use [31]. Inadequate reporting
of instructions for use and significant heterogeneity in reporting
of adherence are further demonstrated in at least 5 systematic
and narrative reviews of adherence to digital psychological
interventions in adults [32-36]. Collectively, adherence appears
to be operationalized in the absence of adequately reported
definitions of appropriate use or is generically operationalized
as adherence to total intervention exposure, based on the notion
of “the more, the better” rather than explicitly measuring the
accordance between recommended use and actual use. Studies
have provided little justification for this approach [31].
Furthermore, studies of adults and youth have not consistently
supported a linear relationship between adherence and outcomes
[25,29,37-39].
Despite the prevalence of digital CBT interventions for youth
[25], little is known about how young people have been
instructed to use these interventions, how adherence to
interventions has been operationalized, or whether measures of
adherence adequately determine differences between actual and
recommended use. It is important to examine this, as young
people have different patterns of engagement with technology,
preferences, and expectations compared with adults [40-42].
Clearer expectations of use may not only improve the
effectiveness of digital CBT but also assist young people in
selecting interventions most suited to their circumstances, while
also facilitating greater endorsement and dissemination by
mental health professionals. Establishing protocols for the
disclosure of appropriate use and the operationalization of
adherence is imperative for improving the uptake, adherence,
and effectiveness of digital CBT among youth.
Objectives
The primary aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the
published literature on digital CBT interventions for depression
and anxiety in young people to investigate the definitions of
appropriate use and the disclosure of instructions for use to
users. To this end, descriptions, recommendations or instructions
of appropriate use, or intervention features guiding use were
extracted from the included studies and mapped onto the 10
components within CBT manuals that typically guide
administration as a means of determining definitions of
appropriate use. A specific focus on digital CBT differentiated
our review from recently published reviews on engagement in
digital health interventions that incorporated CBT and non-CBT
interventions. This review also aimed to examine how adherence
to recommended use has been operationalized and measured
and to determine the associations between digital CBT
intervention use and outcomes among young people. This
information will improve our understanding of how young
people have been instructed to self-administer digital CBT
interventions and will determine whether the measures of
adherence used by researchers have accurately captured the
degree to which young people complied with instructions for
use.
Methods
Protocol and Registration
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses) was used to ensure the quality and
consistency of the procedure and reporting [43]. The review
protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020208668).
We deviated from the original protocol to exclude cognitive-
and behavioral-only interventions and mindfulness-based and
acceptance and commitment therapy interventions to confine
the focus to digital CBT. In addition, we found that the study
manuscripts rarely reported on the instructions of appropriate
use. We acknowledge that this information may have been
provided to users within the intervention itself, but this is not
clear. As such, we derived the information on appropriate use
from the study protocols and intervention features.
Ethical Considerations
Conducting a systematic review or peer-reviewed literature is
not listed as a research activity that requires human ethics
approval by the UNSW Research Ethics Board. As such, ethics
approval was not applied for.
Eligibility Criteria
Participants
Participants were young people aged between 12 and 24 years.
This age range was selected to cover the full spectrum of youth,
as defined by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [4].
Where the age range of participants extended 12 to 24 years,
studies were excluded if the total sample contained <80% of
participants in the target range. In the absence of age range data,
a judgment was made based on the recruitment setting (eg,
secondary school) and the reported mean age. Diagnostic status
was not used as an eligibility criterion for samples.
Interventions
Eligible interventions included those directly targeting anxiety
or depression (including transdiagnostic interventions) via a
predominantly CBT-based psychological treatment delivered
by a computer, smartphone, or internet platform. Interventions
were also required to be used on more than one occasion. Purely
cognitive or behavioral interventions alone were not included,
nor were treatments aimed solely at problem-solving.
Interventions that were not predominantly CBT, such as
mindfulness-based interventions, acceptance and commitment
therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy, were excluded.
Nonpsychological interventions, including exercise or physical
activities, 
music, 
and 
art 
therapy, 
were 
excluded.
Gratitude-based therapies and journaling were also excluded.
Comparison Groups
No restriction was imposed on the type or use of control or
comparison groups.

Outcomes
Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression or anxiety
measured using standardized, validated, and reliable instruments
or scales, suitable for adolescents. Included studies were
required to report at least one measure of adherence and any of
the following: descriptions, statements, or instructions for
appropriate use or recommendations of use; descriptions of
intervention features supporting appropriate use, including
adherence-promoting features; or the association between
adherence and depression outcomes and adherence and anxiety
outcomes.
Studies
Studies were included if they were written in English, published
in peer-reviewed journals, and published after January 1, 1991.
Studies were not excluded based on study type or quality; both
controlled and uncontrolled studies (eg, pre-post studies without
a control group) were included. Case studies were excluded.
Search Strategy
Overview
The electronic databases, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and
Cochrane Library, were searched for articles published from
January 1, 1991, to April 7, 2021. The start date was selected
to coincide with the year in which the World Wide Web was
introduced. The following search terms were used in the title,
abstract, and keywords: (adolescent* OR youth OR child* OR
teen* OR young adult) AND (online OR digital OR internet
OR app OR mHealth OR eHealth OR web OR web-based OR
smartphone OR smart phone OR computer*) AND (anx* OR
depress* OR affect OR mood) AND (cognitive therapy OR
cognitive behavioural therapy OR cognitive behavior therapy
OR cognitive behavioral therapy OR CBT). Additional sources
were included through a hand search that comprised examining
reference lists of key articles and systematic reviews and
authors’ knowledge of manuscripts related to digital CBT for
youth. Furthermore, the details from included studies were used
to conduct a search to identify relevant manuscripts reporting
on secondary or adherence outcomes from the included studies’
data sets.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
Articles were identified from the search strategy, and after
duplicates were removed, titles and then abstracts were reviewed
for relevance by the first author (SHL). A second reviewer
(AWS) independently screened 10% of the identified studies
to ensure the reliability of the eligibility criteria. Full texts of
the remaining studies (n=174) were appraised by 2 reviewers
(SHL and MRA) to determine eligibility. Reasons for exclusion
were discussed, and consensus for eligibility was confirmed for
6 articles. In cases where a consensus between the 2 reviewers
could not be reached, a third reviewer (MSK) assessed for
eligibility and a consensus was reached. The 2 reviewers (SHL
and MRA) independently performed the data extraction using
a data extraction template (Multimedia Appendix 1) designed
to identify information, including the following: study details,
sample details, intervention details, and outcomes of interest.
It is worth noting that, for delivery mode, interventions were
categorized as sequential where modular content was presented
sequentially or explicitly delivered in a sequential order with
content only becoming available when preceding modules were
completed, or nonsequential where content was unrestricted
allowing complete self-navigation.
Study outcomes of interest included the following: descriptions,
statements, or instructions of appropriate use for young people;
measures of adherence; and associations between adherence
and symptom outcomes. We relied only on the information
provided in the study manuscripts. Using the components of
manualized CBT, we identified information on appropriate use
pertaining to the following: intended recipient of the
intervention, intended target condition, intended number of
modules to be completed, intended duration and frequency of
use, instructions regarding real-world enactment of skills
(homework), adherence-promoting features (embedded within
the intervention), core components, and symptom assessment
and monitoring. We also extracted data on when and how users
were recommended to access in-person support, excluding risk
management procedures that constituted the study protocol. In
lieu of specific descriptions of appropriate use, we extracted
any information on intervention design features or other study
details that implied appropriate use. This included the following:
inclusion and exclusion criteria to indicate intended recipients,
duration of intervention access to indicate intended duration of
use, and tunneling to indicate intended sequence of content use.
The sources of information used to derive aspects of appropriate
use were recorded (trial protocol, feature description, or a
statement in the study manuscript). Post hoc determination of
the number of modules needed to achieve benefits was not
considered as constituting any aspect of appropriate use.
Adherence-promoting features included those explicitly used
by the authors to improve adherence or those that fit within the
following categories: supported use defined as use that involves
support, encouragement or guidance from a person, reminders,
rewards, gamification, social or peer support, tailoring defined
as the capacity to tailor content to meet an individual’s
requirements, personalized feedback including system-generated
personalized feedback, customization of visual features such as
avatars and color schemes, and interactive content defined as
content requiring active inputs from the user. These categories
were derived from past literature that endorsed supported use
as an effective adherence promoter [44] and systematic reviews
of user preferences [24,45]. Supported use was further
categorized into autonomous, supported, or intervention-led
blended, using the definitions provided by Fairburn and Patel
[46] (Table 1). Interventions delivered in schools were
categorized as supported, unless otherwise specified, and studies
that did not specify support in the use of the intervention were
recorded as autonomous. Interactive content was further coded
as follows: activities, quizzes, homework activities, and
multimedia content. The same intervention delivered under
different conditions (eg, with or without additional in-person
therapy sessions) was treated as 2 separate interventions and is
presented in different rows in the tables. It is worth noting that,
we elected to categorize personal feedback from a clinician or
support person as supported use, not tailoring, as supported use
is likely to have an element of personalization that does not
necessarily involve tailored delivery of the intervention content.

In addition, the included studies were screened for references
to registered or published protocols. Where protocols were
identified, they underwent the same data extraction and synthesis
procedure as the study manuscripts to supplement data on
descriptions, statements, or instructions for appropriate use.
Finally, the number of aspects of digital self-administration
described in each study was tallied to show the degree to which
aspects of self-administration were disclosed.

Methodological Quality Assessment
The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed
using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) Tool for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) [77] and the Integrated Quality Criteria
for the Review of Multiple Study Designs [78] for other study
designs. Quality ratings were determined independently by 2
reviewers (SHL and JRB) and then compared to resolve
differences. Studies were considered methodologically sound
if they met the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of

Overview of Included Studies
Overview
The search resulted in 4641 studies, of which 174 full-text
articles were identified. A total of 32 studies met all inclusion
criteria and were included in the systematic review. The
screening process and reasons for exclusion are presented in
Figure 1. Table 1 summarizes the study, sample, and
intervention characteristics of the 32 included manuscripts. On
3 occasions, >1 manuscript was produced from a single study;
as such, these manuscripts were reported together, leaving a
total of 28 independent studies.

Figure 1. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram.
Study Design and Country of Origin (Setting)
Of the 28 studies, most were RCTs (n=22, 78%), and the others
were open trials (n=3, 10%), feasibility trials (n=11, 39%), 1
(3%) non-RCT, and 1 (3%) factorial design. The majority were
conducted in Australia and New Zealand (11/28, 39%), Europe
and the United Kingdom (9/28, 32%), and the United States
(5/28, 17%), with others in Canada (2/28, 7%) and Hong Kong
(1/28, 3%).
Sample Characteristics
Across the 28 studies, 16,578 participants received the
intervention. Sample sizes varied considerably among studies,
ranging from 10 to 9079 (mean 592.07, SD 1857.44; median
61). Overall, 42% (12/28) of studies had sample sizes <50, and
57% (16/28) had sample sizes >50. Regarding gender
representation, 75% (21/28) of studies had >55% of their sample
as girls or women, 10% (3/28) of studies had between 45% and
55% of the sample girls or women, 7% (2/28) of studies had
<45% of the sample as girls or women, and 7% (2/28) of studies
did not disclose gender representation of their samples. The girl
or woman representation within the samples ranged from 41%
to 100%. Across all studies, the mean age was 15.74 years
(range 12.95-22.60), with a total age range of 7 to 24 years. A
total of 10% (3/28) of studies did not report the mean age of
the participants, and 14% (4/28) of studies did not report the
age range.
Intervention Characteristics
Intervention characteristics are presented in Table 2. A total of
20 interventions from 28 studies were identified and included
in the review, with the same intervention used in several studies:
SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts;
University of Auckland; n=4), MoodGYM (Australian National
University; n=3), Brave Online (University of Queensland;
n=2), CATCH-IT (University of Illinois; Competent Adulthood
Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and
Interpersonal Training; n=2, not including the modified version),
and Breathe (University of Alberta; Being Real, Easing Anxiety:
Tools Helping Electronically; n=2). A total of 28% (8/28) of
interventions targeted depression, 25% (7/28) targeted
depression and anxiety, 10% (3/28) targeted unspecified anxiety,
and 7% (2/28) targeted a specific anxiety disorder (obsessive
compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder). The digital
delivery formats included web-based (n=11), computer or
CD-ROM (n=6), multiplatform (n=1), weblinks viewed on a
smartphone (n=1), and 1 smartphone app (n=1). Several
interventions included elements of other therapeutic approaches
in addition to CBT, such as interpersonal therapy (2/28, 7%),
family systems therapy (1/28, 3%), and positive psychology
(1/28, 3%). The total number of modules ranged from 4 to 15
(mean 8.15, SD 2.74). A total of 10% (3/28) studies did not
specify the number of modules contained in the intervention.
Most interventions (14/20, 70%) were sequential, 10% (2/20)
were nonsequential (WeClick and MoodHwb), and 20% (4/20)
were undetermined.

aCBT: cognitive behavioral therapy.
bIPT: interpersonal psychotherapy.
cSPARX-R is a revised version of the original Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor (SPARX) intervention. The content of SPARX-R is essentially
the same; however, it is framed as a preventive intervention for young people who feel down, stressed, or angry rather than focusing exclusively on
depression.
dThe Grasp Opportunity intervention removed all face-to-face components from CATCH-IT, including the motivational interview or brief advice
component, and IPT modules were also excluded.
eOCD: obsessive compulsive disorder.
fCOPE: Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment.
gBreathe: Being real, easing anxiety: tools helping electronically.
hContent covered in both interventions seems to be the same; however, Radomski et al 2020 [64] reported 6 modules and O’Connor et al 2020 [61]
reported 8 modules.
iTFD: think, feel, do.
jMotivational interviewing was classified as a form of supported use.
Methodological Quality
All 6 non-RCT studies met the methodological quality criteria
for inclusion. Of the 22 RCTs included in the review, 9 (41%)
were assessed as having a low ROB, 9 (41%) as having some
concerns, and 4 (18%) as having a high ROB. All these studies
were included in the analysis.
Digital Self-administration Guidelines as Disclosed in
Study Manuscripts
Overview
The aspects of digital self-administration extracted from the
included studies are contained in Table 3 and Multimedia
Appendix 2 [26,27,47-76]. Only 1 study (the study by O'Dea
et al [62]) reported how instructions for appropriate use were
relayed to young people. In this study, an animation was used
to inform young people that they could use the intervention as
they wished.

Intended Recipients and Target Condition
A total of 7% (2/28) of study manuscripts contained explicit
statements of the intended intervention recipients: adolescents
with mild to moderate depression [65] and adolescents with
clinically significant risk of depression [72]. For all other
manuscripts, intended recipients were derived from the
participant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, intended
recipients were required to meet the diagnostic criteria for an
anxiety disorder in 17% (5/28) of studies, were symptomatic
(anxiety, depression, or both) in 32% (9/28) of studies, were at
risk of developing depression in 17% (5/28) of studies (ie,
symptomatic and/or history of depression), and were
asymptomatic in 3% (1/28) of studies. Symptom level was not
relevant to intended users in 21% (6/28) of studies (universal
sample) and symptom details were not provided in 7% (2/28)
of studies. A total of 39% (11/28) of study manuscripts described
the intended target condition. For the remaining 43% (17/28)
of studies, the intended target condition was derived from the
study protocol (primary outcome measure). Depression was the
target condition in 50% (14/28) of studies, anxiety in 32% (9/28)
and both anxiety and depression in 17% (5/28). Finally, 7%
(2/28) of studies provided statements on the intervention’s
therapeutic goals; both of the goals were to reduce unhelpful
cognitions and behaviors, consistent with a CBT approach.
Intended Degree of Completion, Duration and Frequency
of Use, and Sequence of Use
A total of 17% (5/28) of studies stated that all intervention
modules should be completed, and 3% (1/28) of studies stated
that half the modules should be completed. The remaining 82%
(23/28) of studies did not provide this information. Although
not explicitly stated as intended use by the study authors, 10%
(3/28) of studies examined noncompleters and completers. These
concepts appeared to be derived post hoc for analytical purposes.
Definitions of the latter included those who completed ≥4
modules out of 8 [64], ≥3 modules out of 5 [63], and more than
one-third of all activities [50].
None of the studies explicitly stated the intended duration of
intervention use. This information was derived from the duration
of intervention access in 82% (23/28) of studies (range 4 weeks
to 12 months); however, 17% (5/28) of studies did not provide
any information on this (eg, duration between pre- and
postintervention assessments). Intended frequency of use was
stated in 60% (17/28) of studies and was derived from an
intervention feature in 3% (1/28) of studies. Of these 18 studies,
9 (50%) recommended that users complete 1 module per week,
2 (11%) recommended up to 2 modules per week, 1 (5%)
recommended 1 module per fortnight, and 1 (5%) recommended
that users read 2 messages per day. A total of 21% (6/28) of
studies stated that the frequency of intervention use was
unrestricted. There were 36% (10/28) of studies that did not
provide any information regarding the intended frequency of
use. The intended sequence of content was derived from
intervention features, including numbered modules, locked
content, or module display, in 64% (18/28) of studies, from the
study protocols of 11% (3/28) of studies (prescribed delivery
of content), and was stated in the manuscript in 3% (1/28) of
studies. Of these 22 studies, interventions were intended to be
completed sequentially in 20 (90%) studies, with 2 (10%)
allowing users unrestricted access to alternate between modules.
A total of 27% (6/28) of studies provided no information on the
intended sequence of the intervention content.
Intended Skill Enactment
A total of 50% (14/28) of studies described intervention features
that prompted homework activities. The remaining 50% (14/28)
provided no information regarding recommendations for skill
enactment.
Adherence-Promoting Features
Regarding supported use, 17% (5/28) of interventions were
autonomous, 42% (12/28) were supported, 21% (6/28) were
both supported and intervention-led blended, and 10% (3/28)
were intervention-led blended only. A total of 28% (8/28) of
interventions used reminders (eg, email or SMS text message),
3% (1/28) implemented rewards (a snack upon completion of
a module), and 21% (6/28) contained gamified concepts (eg,
leveling up). Regarding interactive content, 82% (23/28) of
studies described interventions that used interactive features,
including 20 with interactive activities, 8 with quizzes, 7 with
homework activities, and 18 with multimedia content. A total
of 10% (3/28) of studies used tailoring, 10% (3/28) used
personalized feedback, and 14% (4/28) used customization of
visual features. None of the interventions were reported to
contain peer-support features.
Only 10% (3/28) of studies have examined the influence of an
adherence-promoting strategy on adherence to recommended
use. Van Voorhees et al [71] examined supported use as an
adherence promoter by combining the digital intervention with
3 in-person motivational interviewing sessions. These were
found to significantly increase site visits, time in intervention,
proportion of exercises completed, and number of characters
typed into interactive exercises. Berg et al [47] evaluated 2
strategies: supported use via chat sessions with a therapist and
learning support, which included short summaries, pedagogical
pictures, videos, and quizzes. These strategies, alone or
combined, did not lead to greater adherence when compared
with the control condition. Finally, Lillevoll et al [57] evaluated
the influence of personalized email reminders on adherence to
MoodGYM compared with standard email reminders and no
reminders. Neither form of reminder affected adherence to the
intervention.
Core Therapeutic Components, Symptom Monitoring,
and Accessing Crisis Support
A total of 14% (4/28) of studies reported core therapeutic
components, including exposure therapy, exposure and response
prevention therapy, behavioral therapy, and cognitive
restructuring. The remaining 85% (24/28) of studies did not
identify any. A total of 42% (12/28) of studies described
intervention features for monitoring mood and assessing safety.
Of these, 50% (6/12) of studies described symptom monitoring
that occurred every few days or weekly. The remainder (6/12,
50%) did not provide any information regarding the frequency
of mood monitoring. Furthermore, 28% (8/28) of study
manuscripts described intervention features that assessed suicide
risk and responded with helping-seeking information. The

remaining 85% (24/28) of studies did not provide any
information on when users were recommended to seek crisis
support.
Reporting on Aspects of Intended Use
Of the 10 aspects of appropriate use identified to inform
instructions for use (presented in Figure 1), no study manuscript
reported on all 10 aspects. The average number of aspects
reported was 6.29 (SD 1.33) with a range of 3 to 8. Descriptions
of intervention features and study protocol details were relied
upon heavily to infer aspects of appropriate use (Table 3 and
Multimedia Appendix 2).
Measures of Adherence
The measures of adherence used in the included studies are
presented in Table 4. To support a clearer interpretation of the
results, adherence measures were coded as follows: module
completion, intervention visits or log-ins, time spent in
intervention, activity or homework completion and practice,
and total content completion. Study attrition was not considered
to be an appropriate measure of intervention adherence, as it
was not possible to differentiate the noncompletion of study
assessments from adherence to the intervention. Almost all the
studies (24/28, 85%) measured module completion, which was
reported as either mean (and SD) module completion or as
percentage of the sample completing a defined number of
modules (eg, 14/28, 50% of study manuscripts reported the
percentage of the sample completing all modules). Moreover,
21% (6/28) of studies reported intervention visits or log-ins,
either as the mean or as the percentage of the sample visiting
on a defined number of occasions. Furthermore, 25% (7/28) of
studies reported time spent in the intervention, either as the
mean total intervention time or as the mean time spent per event
(eg, visit or module). A total of 32% (9/28) of studies reported
activity completion as either the mean, percentage of all
activities completed, percentage of the sample that completed
a set number of activities, or percentage who engaged in any of
the activities. Just under half of all studies (13/28, 46%) reported
>1 measure of adherence, indicating multidimensional
operationalizations of the construct.

Association Between Adherence and Outcomes
The heterogeneity of adherence measures, the different statistical
methods used to determine an association between adherence
and outcomes, and incomplete reporting of results made it
difficult to extract comparable data for a meta-analysis.
Associations are, instead, reported descriptively. A total of 19
(67%) studies did not report on the association between
adherence and symptom reduction. Of the remaining 8 studies,
6 (21%) examined the relationship between adherence to the
intervention and treatment outcomes for depression. A total of
4 studies, 2 (7%) of which compared outcomes for completers
and noncompleters (as defined by the authors), found no
association between adherence and depression outcomes.
Furthermore, 7% (2/28) of studies found an association between
depression and adherence, but in opposing directions, such that
depression decreased as time in intervention increased as per
Ip et al [53], whereas Clarke et al [51] found that depression
reduced when the total time spent in intervention decreased.
Moreover, 14% (4/28) of studies examined the association
between adherence and anxiety outcomes: 10% (3/28) found
no association, and 3% (1/28) found a negative association
between symptom reduction and total time spent in intervention,
whereby more time in the intervention was associated with
lower anxiety symptoms [53]. None of the studies that used
multiple measures of adherence examined the independent
associations of these measures with treatment outcomes.
Discussion
Principal Findings
This systematic review aimed to synthesize how appropriate
use has been defined in digital CBT interventions for youth,
how instructions for use are relayed to young people and
reported in studies, and how adherence to appropriate use has
been operationalized and measured. This review found that none
of the included studies systematically described definitions of
appropriate use, which were instead derived from the study
protocol or intervention features. Despite all interventions being
based on CBT, the derived definitions of appropriate use varied
widely among studies, particularly in terms of intended
recipients, frequency and duration of use, and use of
adherence-promoting features. The only component of use with
some consistency among studies was the sequence of use, with
71% (n=20) of the 28 studies using interventions intended to
be used sequentially. Nearly all included studies neglected to
disclose how the instructions or recommendations for
appropriate intervention use were relayed to young people, with
only 3% (1/28) of studies providing such information [62]. The
results showed that most studies (24/28, 85%) operationalized
adherence as the degree of intervention completion, with
significant heterogeneity in how this was measured, regardless
of how appropriate use was defined. The most consistently
reported measure of adherence was the percentage of the sample
that completed the entire intervention (14/28, 50%). There was
little evidence of an association between degree of use and
improved outcomes.
Appropriate self-administration of digital CBT is critical for
achieving the therapeutic goals. Therefore, a lack of reporting
on both definitions of appropriate use and how instructions for
use are provided to users is somewhat surprising. Indeed, an
understanding of how the intervention creators desired the
intervention to be used by youth had to be derived from the
study protocol and intervention features for almost all
components of appropriate use, with the frequency of use the
only component explicitly stated in studies. These findings
suggest that inadequate consideration has been given to
developing nuanced definitions of appropriate use. As early
digital CBT interventions were direct translations of in-person
CBT, this omission may stem from the assumption that
engagement with CBT should be consistent regardless of the
delivery mode (ie, full program completion). However, given
the current innovative approaches to CBT delivery, particularly
the movement away from sequential delivery and expectations
of full program completion [38], it is imperative to investigate
patterns of digital CBT use that produce the greatest
improvements in defining appropriate use. There is also little
evidence that young users of digital CBT for depression and
anxiety are provided with adequate instructions for use. The
impact of this on young people’s treatment uptake, engagement,
response, and attitudes toward digital mental health care remains

unknown. Poorly relayed instructions for appropriate use to
young people, their guardians, and health professionals may
contribute to poor intervention adherence in digital CBT. It is
possible that more nuanced definitions of appropriate use and
clearly delivered instructions on use could improve intervention
adherence and ultimately have beneficial effects on the
outcomes.
The resulting lack of guidance on how to operationalize and
measure adherence is an additional consequence of poorly
defined recommendations for appropriate use. Specifically, the
degree to which actual use aligns with appropriate use can only
be determined if the appropriate use is adequately defined. We
found that adherence was most often operationalized as the
degree of program completion, demonstrating a lack of
correspondence among definitions of appropriate use, which
varied widely, and operationalization of adherence. This
indicates that definitions of appropriate use are either inadequate
or not being used to operationalize adherence. This finding is
also consistent with findings in the adult literature, where
appropriate use is often undefined but nevertheless
operationalized generically as the more use, the better [31], with
significant heterogeneity in how the amount of use is measured
[29,79,80]. Our conceptualization of the appropriate use of
digital CBT is made up of 10 components (based on in-person
CBT manuals) and is therefore multidimensional. This suggests
that the measurement of adherence should be multidimensional
and nuanced enough to capture adherence to each aspect of
appropriate use. Taken together, adherence definitions and
measures that provide a meaningful indication of the extent to
which interventions are used appropriately are lacking, and
require refinement in future studies.
We found little evidence to suggest an association between
amount of use and symptom improvement. Most studies did
not examine or report a dose-response effect for the intervention
being evaluated. However, of those that did, most found no
association between use and either depression or anxiety
outcomes, regardless of the type of measure used. This finding
demonstrates that the pervasive notion of the more use, the
better is unsupported for digital CBT. A tenuous association
between use and outcomes is consistent with findings reported
in a recent meta-analysis of youth digital CBT interventions,
which found no association between adherence (measured as
the amount of use) and outcomes [25]. It is also somewhat
consistent with a review of adult literature, which found that
the association between use and depression outcomes depended
on the usage measure used [29]. The lack of association between
use and outcomes is, however, in contrast to in-person CBT
interventions, where there are clear associations between
intervention attendance and therapeutic benefits [81,82].
There are several possible explanations for the lack of
association between adherence and outcomes. First, it is possible
that measuring adherence as the degree of intervention
completion or use does not capture the complexity to which a
person may or may not adhere to various aspects of appropriate
self-administration. Specifically, current one-dimensional
measures of adherence are unlikely to quantify adherence to
other components of appropriate use that may be more critical
to intervention outcomes such as skill enactment or accessing
crisis support. However, as digital CBT has been shown to be
effective in well-controlled trials, outcomes are unlikely to be
completely unrelated to intervention use [80,83]. Another
explanation is that users simply stop using the intervention when
sufficient benefits have been obtained. This point within the
intervention would be expected to vary among individuals, so
no association between the amount of intervention use and
benefits would be evident. This notion is supported by a study
that used graphical modeling to identify a subset of users who
showed the greatest improvement in depressive and anxiety
symptoms despite spending less time in the intervention than
other groups of users [37]. Finally, some critical components
of the intervention—the active ingredients— may drive the
therapeutic response, and it is completion of these components,
rather than completion of the whole intervention per se that is
associated with outcomes. These explanations suggest that the
current narrow definitions of appropriate use as the degree of
intervention completion or use are too generic, and a more
nuanced approach to the measurement of adherence is required.
Poorly defined recommendations for appropriate use may have
several 
practical 
implications, 
including 
the 
reduced
effectiveness of digital CBT because of inappropriate
self-administration. Given the low uptake of evidence-based
interventions [19,20], this presents a significant missed
opportunity to improve young people’s mental health. It may
also prevent the self-selection of interventions that are best
suited to an individual’s circumstances and limit endorsement
and dissemination by mental health professionals. Currently,
there is little information in the scientific literature to guide the
development of definitions of appropriate use or the disclosure
of instructions for the use of digital CBT. In response to our
findings and to rectify poorly defined appropriate use and
generic operationalization of adherence, we developed a
framework to support the development and disclosure of
definitions of appropriate use and instructions for the
self-administration of digital CBT. The results are presented in
Table 5. It is based on the components of manualized CBT
designed to guide clinicians in delivering in-person CBT and
mapped onto definitions of intended use (the purpose of the
product), indications for use (who will be using the product and
why it will be used), and instructions for use (how to use the
product) as defined in the medical arena [84]. The use of this
framework to develop nuanced instructions for use could
optimize the therapeutic benefits of interventions. Finally, we
suggest an active evaluation of appropriate definitions and their
refinement based on the outcomes of the evaluation. For
example, a method to evaluate the extent to which the degree
of completion, duration, and frequency of use incorporated in
definitions of appropriate use produces therapeutic benefits is
to conduct a survival analysis [85,86]. Comparing instructions
for use related to degree of completion, duration, and frequency
of use with those demonstrated to produce reliable and clinically
significant reductions in symptoms, as determined by the
survival analysis, will contribute to the refinement of the
appropriate use definition. The proposed development,
evaluation, and refinement of definitions of appropriate use and
instructions for use is represented in Figure 2.

Limitations
In this review, we limited our search to CBT for depression and
anxiety, making it difficult to generalize our findings to other
interventions or mental health conditions. Future studies could
include other interventions and conditions to develop an
understanding of how appropriate use and instructions for use
have been defined and disclosed more broadly in digital health
interventions. Moreover, our data failed to account for the
possibility that appropriate use may have been defined or
instructions for use provided to participants, but not documented
in the study manuscripts or published protocols. However,
consistently generic operationalization of adherence across
studies suggests that this explanation is unlikely, and adequate
and systematic documentation of these constructs is,
nevertheless, required.
Conclusions
This review has contributed to our understanding of how
appropriate self-administration of digital CBT has been defined,
relayed to users, measured, and associated with outcomes across
various digital CBT interventions targeting depression and
anxiety in young people. Overall, there is a lack of systematic
reporting of nuanced definitions of appropriate use, and
measures of adherence rarely provide adequate information on
the degree of actual use corresponding to recommended
appropriate use. There is little evidence that the degree of
program completion or use is associated with intervention
benefits. Our findings may, in part, explain low engagement in
digital CBT; however, more work is required to better
understand engagement with digital CBT and find ways to
enhance it. A framework to assist in the development of
guidelines for the self-administration of digital CBT has been
provided.
