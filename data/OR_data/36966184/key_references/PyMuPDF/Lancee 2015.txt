Abstract. Several trials have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
for insomnia. However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the
cognitive model of insomnia. Identiﬁcation of modiﬁable mechanisms by which the treatment works
may guide efforts to further improve the efﬁcacy of insomnia treatment. The current study therefore
has two aims: (1) to replicate the ﬁnding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test
putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we
conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to
either online CBT for insomnia (n ¼ 36) or a waiting-list control group (n ¼ 27). Baseline and
posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors,
dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments
were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically signiﬁcant
effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures,
sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors mediated the effects of treatment on insomnia severity and sleep efﬁciency. Together, these
ﬁndings corroborate the efﬁcacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were
produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for
insomnia may speciﬁcally be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of
sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments. Key words: beliefs; CBT;
insomnia; online; safety behaviors.

Insomnia, that is, problems of getting to
sleep and/or staying asleep, affects about 10%
of the general population (Ohayon, 2002). In
order to meet the criteria for a DSM-5
disorder, these sleep complaints need to be
present for at least three months, cannot be
better explained by another disorder, and have
negative daytime consequences (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Among these daytime negative conse-
quences, studies have documented low con-
centration, fatigue, and impaired cognitive
functioning (Espie, Kyle, Hames, Cyhlarova,
& Benzeval, 2012; Kyle, Morgan, & Espie,
2010; LeBlanc et al., 2007; Roth & Drake,
2004), as well as an increased likelihood of
experiencing physical complaints such as
coronary artery disease (Mallon, Broman, &
Hetta, 2002), diabetes (Mallon, Broman, &
Hetta, 2005), and high blood pressure (Suka,
Yoshida, & Sugimori, 2003). Furthermore,
insomnia is related to an increased risk of
developing other mental disorders such as
depression and anxiety (Baglioni et al., 2011;
Taylor, Lichstein, Durrence, Reidel, & Bush,
2005). In addition, insomnia is associated with

substantial societal costs due to higher work
absenteeism
and
decreased
productivity
(Daley, Morin, LeBlanc, Gregoire, & Savard,
2009).
Several meta-analyses showed that sleeping
problems can be effectively treated with
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
(CBT-I; Irwin, Cole, & Nicassio, 2006; Morin
et al., 2006; Morin et al., 1999). CBT-I is as
effective as sleep medication in the short term,
and has more support for its efﬁcacy in the
long term (Rieman & Perlis, 2009; Smith et al.,
2002). Moreover, CBT-I comes without the
adverse side effects often associated with
medication, such as headaches, drowsiness,
and dizziness (Glass, Lanctot, Herrmann,
Sproule, & Busto, 2005).
To reach a larger group of people and to
create easier access to CBT-I, online versions
of CBT-I for insomnia have been developed.
Two meta-analyses demonstrated that self-
help treatment for insomnia yields small to
moderate effects (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; van
Straten & Cuijpers, 2009), while a recent meta-
analysis reported moderate to large effects
(Ho et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies
showed that the efﬁcacy of these online
treatments is enhanced when patients received
motivational feedback via the e-mail on their
exercises and progress (Lancee, van den Bout,
Sorbi, & van Straten, 2013), especially for the
subgroup
with
depressive
comorbidity
(Lancee, Sorbi, Eisma, van Straten, & van
den Bout, 2014).
While the evidence for (online) CBT-I is
mounting, support for mechanisms by which
the treatment works remains scarce. Indeed, in
their recent meta-analysis on mediators of
CBT-I, Schwartz and Carney (2012) con-
cluded that although CBT-I appears to target
the risk factors of insomnia, more research is
needed to establish whether CBT-I works
according to proposed mediators.
In a cognitive model of insomnia, Harvey
(2002a) argued that thinking repetitively
about possible sleep deﬁciencies and the
consequences of impaired sleep contributes
to arousal and distress, which consequently
lead to selective attention and increased
monitoring of sleep-related threats. These
processes in turn result in an overestimation
of the consequences of sleep difﬁculties, which
causes even more impairment in sleep and
daytime functioning. According to Harvey
(2002a), dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors fuel and exacerbate these processes
and are therefore important maintaining
factors of insomnia. This paper therefore
aims to test the singular and joint meditational
potency of these two constructs in the context
of a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
comparing online CBT-I and a waiting-list
control condition.
Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are erro-
neous assumptions, such as unrealistic expec-
tations about sleep requirements, wrong
attributions to the causes of insomnia, and
unrealistic beliefs about the consequences of
insomnia (Morin & Espie, 2003). These
dysfunctional beliefs are hypothesized to
trigger negative emotions that in turn lead to
impaired sleep. For example, a patient that
holds the belief “I need eight hours of sleep to
adequately function during the day” will start
to worry during the night if less than eight
hours of available sleeping time remains.
Following Harvey’s (2002a) model, this
worry/excessive toned cognitive activity will
lead to distress which will result in a delay in
sleep onset.
Most authors recognize the importance of
dysfunctional beliefs and therefore identifying
and challenging these beliefs are nowadays a
standard component of CBT-I (Harvey et al.,
2014; Harvey, Sharpley, Ree, Stinson, & Clark,
2007; Morin & Espie, 2003). Multiple trials
measured the effect of insomnia treatment on
dysfunctional beliefs and found that such
beliefs were indeed ameliorated by therapy
compared to control conditions (Edinger,
Wohlgemuth, Radtke, Marsh, & Quillian,
2001; Harvey et al., 2007). More importantly,
changes in dysfunctional beliefs were corre-
lated with treatment effect (Edinger et al., 2001;
Espie, Inglis, & Harvey, 2001; Jansson-Froj-
mark & Linton, 2008; Morin, Blais, & Savard,
2002). However, only two groups performed
speciﬁc mediation analyses (Espie et al., 2014;
Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, & Inoue, 2014).
Surprisingly, Espie et al. (2014) found that
dysfunctional beliefs mediated effects of treat-
ment on a general insomnia measure, but not
on
sleep
efﬁciency.
Another
research
group found no mediating effect of dysfunc-
tional beliefs on the effects of treatment on
insomnia severity (Okajima et al., 2014). Stated
differently, while there is substantial support
for the relationship between dysfunctional

beliefs and insomnia, speciﬁc evidence for its
mediating role in CBT-I remains inconclusive.
Safety behaviors, that is, subtle avoidance
behaviors intended to prevent a feared out-
come, provide relief from distress in the short
term, but eventually have negative conse-
quences in the long term (Salkovskis, 1991).
According to models in the anxiety literature
(Clark, 1999; Kamphuis & Telch, 1998;
Salkovskis, 1991) and Harvey’s (2002a)
insomnia-based model, safety behaviors pre-
vent disconﬁrmation of patients’ dysfunc-
tional beliefs. For example, the belief that
one needs eight hours a night to sleep may lead
to the safety behavior of going to bed early so
that there is an increased chance of sleeping
for eight hours. This safety behavior will have
the short-term beneﬁt of being more rested in
the morning, but it also prevents falsiﬁcation
of the belief that one needs eight hours of
sleep for adequate functioning during the next
day. The safety behavior thereby blocks
opportunities to gain new insights about
sleep learning by misattributing the prevention
of sleep problems to the safety behavior.
Notably, this may not apply to all safety
behavior; for example, recent evidence shows
that the careful use of safety behaviors can
have beneﬁcial effects for treatment (e.g.,
allowing some safety behaviors can motivate
patients to do their exercises; Levy &
Radomsky, 2014). In insomnia, these safety
behaviors can occur both during the day and
at night, and are not exclusively aimed at
controlling overt behavior but also at control-
ling thoughts and imagery (Harvey, 2002a).
Safety behaviors in insomnia have only
recently become the object of empirical
scrutiny. Upon identiﬁcation of safety beha-
viors in insomnia (Harvey, 2002b), it was
demonstrated that people with insomnia
report engaging in more safety behavior than
people without insomnia (Jansson-Frojmark,
Harvey, Norell-Clarke, & Linton, 2012; Ree &
Harvey, 2004). Also, the need to engage in
safety behavior (but not the intensity at which
people engage in it) was associated with
insomnia severity (Hood, Carney, & Harris,
2011). Moreover, two treatment studies
showed that safety behaviors were amelio-
rated by CBT-I (Harvey et al., 2007; Jernelov
et al., 2012). On the other hand, Woodley and
Smith (2006) found insomnia severity unre-
lated to the use of safety behaviors and
Gosling, Batterham, and Christensen (2012)
reported that safety behaviors were not
associated with the onset of sleep disturbance
when controlling for ruminative style and
somatic sensitivity. No mediation analyses
have yet been conducted relating change in use
of safety behaviors to treatment outcome.
In sum, both dysfunctional beliefs and
safety behaviors are proposed as key mechan-
isms in the negative cognitive cycle of
insomnia (Harvey, 2002a), but these assertions
yielded inconclusive evidence (i.e., dysfunc-
tional beliefs), or have not been tested
empirically (i.e., safety behaviors) in therapy
effect studies.
In the current investigation, we therefore
aimed to (1) replicate the ﬁnding that online
CBT-I is effective in the treatment of insomnia
and (2) test the hypotheses that dysfunctional
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect
of CBT-I. Accordingly, we conducted an RCT
comparing online CBT-I to a waiting-list
control group. Speciﬁc hypotheses include:
(1) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list
in
ameliorating
insomnia
severity
and
sleep impairment assessed with a sleep diary,
(2) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list
in ameliorating dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors about sleep, and (3) dysfunctional
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect
of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep
measures.

were:
(1)
possible
sleep
apnea
(measured with the SLEEP-50 where the
apnea subscale has a cutoff of .15; Spoor-
maker, Verbeek, van den Bout, & Klip,
2005), (2) shift-work, (3) earlier CBT for
insomnia, (4) starting other psychotherapy
in the last six months, (5) alcohol abuse
(more than three glasses of alcohol a day for
at least 21 days a month) or marijuana
abuse (use more than once a week), (6) a
diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, and
(7) current suicidal plans. Of the remaining
76
people,
13
did
not
complete
the
questionnaires or failed to complete their
diary on more than one day (out of seven).

resulted
in
a

Power
This study was originally powered to include
100 participants (a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8
to detect Cohen’s d effect sizes of 0.6 with a
20% dropout). However, due to ﬁnancial and
practical limitations we were forced to
stop inclusion at 63 participants. Based on
the posttest questionnaire data, in the current
study we now achieved a power of 0.8 for an
effect size of d ¼ 0.65.
Materials
Online questionnaires. For online question-
naires, Thorndike et al. (2009) demonstrated
the validity of both single-item and multiple-
item presentation per webpage. We used
multiple items per webpage (but never more
than 15 items per webpage).

Insomnia severity was measured with a
Dutch translation of the seven-item ISI. The
ISI is a widely used measure to index changes
in insomnia severity, and favorable psycho-
metric properties are documented (internal
consistency a ¼ 0.78; Bastien, Vallie` res, &
Morin, 2001; Morin, 1993). The total score
ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe
insomnia). The internal consistency (Cron-
bach’s a) in the present study was 0.60 (which
was comparable to the a ¼ 0.61 that was
found in a validation study of the online
version of the ISI; Thorndike et al., 2011).
A cutoff of 10 was previously offered as the
optimal indicator for clinical levels of insom-
nia in a community sample (Morin et al., 2011)
and was used in this study.
Dysfunctional beliefs were assessed with the
Dutch translation of the 16-item brief Dys-
functional
Belief
and
Attitudes
about
Sleep scale—DBAS (Lancee & Kamphuis, in
preparation; Morin, Vallieres, & Ivers, 2007).
The English version of the DBAS shows
adequate internal consistency (a ¼ 0.79; in the
current study: a ¼ 0.81) and was signiﬁcantly
correlated with self-report measures of insom-
nia severity, anxiety, and depression. The sum
of the DBAS score is averaged so that the total
score ranges from 0 (no dysfunctional beliefs)
to 10 (severe dysfunctional beliefs).
Sleep safety behaviors were measured with
the Dutch translation of the 32-item Sleep-
Related Behaviors Questionnaire—SRBQ
(Lancee & Kamphuis, in preparation; Ree &
Harvey, 2004). The total score ranges from 0
(no safety behaviors) to 128 (severe safety
behaviors). The English version showed good
internal consistency (a ¼ 0.92; in the current
study: a ¼ 0.83) and could discriminate
normal sleepers from people with insomnia.
Furthermore, the SRBQ is correlated with
daytime
and
nighttime
complaints
of
insomnia.
Depression was measured using a Dutch
translation of the 20-item Centre of Epidemio-
logical Studies Depression scale (CES-D,
range ¼ 0—no depressive symptoms to 60—
severe depressive symptoms; Bouma et al., 1995;
Radloff, 1977). This scale has good internal
consistency (a ¼ 0.79–0.92), and the validity of
the Dutch scale is comparable to that of the
original version (Bouma et al., 1995; Radloff,
1977). Cronbach’s a was 0.89 in the current
study.
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the
Dutch version of the seven anxiety items of the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS; Spinhoven et al., 1997; Zigmond &
Snaith, 1983). The total score ranges from 0
(no symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe

symptoms of anxiety). The reliability of the
HADS is good (a ¼ 0.80–0.84; in the current
study: a ¼ 0.85), as is the test–retest corre-
lation (r ¼ 0.89; p , 0.001).
The SLEEP-50 (Spoormaker et al., 2005) was
used
to
exclude
patients
with
possible
sleep apnea. The apnea subscale has eight
items (a ¼ 0.51) and the total scale ranges from
8 (no apnea indication) to 32 (severe apnea
indication). A cutoff of $15 is optimal with a
sensitivity of 0.85 and a speciﬁcity of 0.88.
Online sleep diary. We used a Dutch
translation of the consensus sleep diary
(Carney et al., 2012). Participants kept a
sleep diary for seven days and recorded time to
bed, time they tried to go to sleep, time of ﬁnal
awakening, time out of bed, sleep onset
latency
(SOL),
wake
after
sleep
onset
(WASO), terminal wakefulness (TWAK),
number of nightly awakenings, sleep quality
(1 ¼ “very bad” to 5 ¼ “very good”), and use
of sleep medication. From these variables, the
time in bed (TIB ¼ ﬁnal arising time 2 time to
bed), total sleep time (TST ¼ TIB 2 SOL 2 -
WASO), and sleep efﬁciency (SE ¼ [TST/
TIB] £ 100) were calculated.
Intervention
The online CBT-I treatment protocol that was
administered was based on treatment manuals
for face-to-face CBT-I (e.g., Morin & Espie,
2003; Verbeek & Klip, 2005). This treatment
packaged the following modules: (1) psycho-
education; (2) progressive muscle relaxation; (3)
sleep hygiene; (4) sleep restriction—restricting
TIB to actual sleeping time; and (5) cognitive
exercises—challenging the misconceptions
about sleep. The treatment comprised six
weekly sessions that each covered one or more
modules. The basic treatment sessions spanned
six weeks, but participants who took longer to
complete the treatment (e.g., because of holi-
day) received feedback up to eight weeks. For a
more elaborate description of the treatment
content, please see Lancee, van den Bout, van
Straten, and Spoormaker (2012).
The online program, ﬁrst described in a
study of Lancee et al. (2013), features an
integrated diary that gives visual feedback on
participants’ sleep efﬁciency and total time
spent awake. The online program enables the
provision of feedback on treatment progress
and assigned exercises. In a previous study
(Lancee et al., 2013), motivational feedback
proved
to
enhance
treatment
effects
(reminding and motivating are the most
important aspects of the feedback). In the
current study, similar feedback was provided
by master’s students of psychology under
supervision of the ﬁrst author. On average, the
students spent 56.5 minutes (SD ¼ 31.1) on
giving feedback per participant for the full
online treatment (i.e., all six lessons).
Procedure
The participants who met study criteria
completed a questionnaire and received an
online sleep diary, e-mailed to them at 6:00 am
for seven consecutive days. After completing
the diary, participants were randomized to
either online CBT-I or the waiting-list con-
dition. Twelve weeks later, both the CBT-I and
waiting-list group received posttest question-
naires and a sleep diary. After completing the
posttreatment sleep diary, participants in the
waiting-list condition received an online CBT-I
treatment. Participants in the online CBT-I
condition also received three- and six-month
follow-up questionnaires and diaries. The
study was conducted in line with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki, approved by the internal
Ethical Review Board of the University of
Amsterdam, and registered at Clinicaltrials.
gov (NCT01955928).
Statistical analysis
The effects of the intervention were tested using
multilevel
regression
analysis.
Multilevel
regression analysis is an intention-to-treat
procedure that also allows participants with
only one measurement in the analyses (Hox,
2002). One-way ANOVAs and chi-square tests
showed that participants did not differ on any of
the demographic or outcome variables at base-
line (all ps . 0.2). However, participants in the
online condition who did not respond to the
posttest sleep diary had lower average scores on
total sleep time at baseline (284min versus
353min). Therefore, total sleep time was added
as a covariate in the multilevel regression
analyses regarding the pretest–posttest measure-
ments. At the three- and six-month follow-up no
variables were associated with nonresponse. One
outlier was removed from the diary analyses, as
this respondent’s sleep diary scores were below a
z-score of 3.29 (sleep efﬁciency of this participant
was 6.9% on average).

Because total sleep time was associated with
nonresponse in the CBT-I condition, we used a
multiple imputation procedure based on the
missing at random assumption (Sterne et al.,
2009). We used a monotone predictive mean
matching procedure to generate 10 separate
datasets and insert missing cases on the
questionnaire and diary data. The posttest scores
in Table 2 are the imputed values. To provide a
comprehensive overview and to further show the
possible inﬂuence of missing values on our
analyses, we also included a completers analysis.
Within-group Cohen’s ds were calculated on
the imputed and completers data with (Mpre1 2
Mpost1)/spooled. Between-group Cohen’s ds were
calculated on the difference in change scores
divided by the pooled baseline standard devi-
ation of the groups (Morris, 2008). A Cohen’s d
of 0.20 is generally considered small, that of 0.50
moderate, and that of 0.80 large (Cohen, 1988).
A signiﬁcance level of p , 0.05 (two-sided) was
used throughout our study.
For the mediation analyses we used the
bootstrapping method in the SPSS PROCESS
tool of Hayes (2013). Bootstrapping is a
nonparametrical procedure that produces an
estimate of the sample based on several
resamples. Mediation was tested by evaluating
the 95% conﬁdence interval of the indirect effect.
The above procedure is preferred above the
Sobel’s test since often the sampling of the
indirect effect is non-normally distributed
(Hayes, 2013).
More speciﬁcally, we modeled our procedure
after Vincent and Walsh (2013), that is, we used
n ¼ 5000 bootstrap resamples and the pretreat-
ment level of the dependent variable (i.e., ISI,
SE, WASO, SQ) was added as a covariate in the
model to predict posttreatment levels of the
dependent variable. In view of the limited
observed power, we performed both single
(using either dysfunctional beliefs or safety
behavior as mediator) and multiple mediation
analyses (including both mediators). Our
procedure differed from Vincent and Walsh
(2013) in that we also added the pretreatment
score of the mediator under investigation as
covariate(s). We also calculated the effect sizes
of the indirect effect with: 1 2 c0/c. With this
formula the proportion of the effect of the
independent variable on the dependent variable
that is accounted for by the mediator is
calculated. Possible values lie between 0 and 1
(MacKinnon,
Fairchild,
&
Fritz,
2007).
In Figure 2, the mediation model is shown.
Results
Completion of modules
A module was deemed completed if the last
exercise of this module was saved by the user.
Twenty-seven (75.0%) of the participants in
the CBT-I condition completed an adequate
dose of the intervention (at least four modules;
Lancee et al., 2013) and 17 (47.2%) completed
all sessions of the intervention.
Baseline differences and nonresponse
Thirty-three (88.9%) participants in the CBT-
I condition and 22 (81.5%) in the waiting-list
condition completed the posttest question-
naire. The posttest diary was completed by 25

(66.7%) in the waiting-list condition. In the
CBT-I condition, the three- and six-month
questionnaires were completed by 25 (69.4%)
and 21 (58.3%) participants, respectively, and
the three- and six-month diaries by 17 (47.2%)
and 18 (50.0%), respectively.
As mentioned previously, people in the CBT-
I condition who did not ﬁllout the posttest diary
had a lower score on total sleep time at baseline
(284min versus 353 min). There were no other
statistically signiﬁcant differences with respect
todemographicorclinicalvariables betweenthe
responders and nonresponders.
Efﬁcacy: intention-to-treat analyses
Table 2 displays the imputed mean scores and
correspondingCohen’sdeffectsizes.At posttest,
we found signiﬁcant interaction effects (Time

b ¼ 27.89;
SE ¼ 2.92;

p ¼ 0.010. These effects indicate that CBT-I is
more effective than the waiting-list condition.
The effects in the CBT-I condition were
maintained or improved at three- and six-
month follow-ups. The improvements between
posttest and six-month follow-up were most
notable for insomnia severity, anxiety, and
depressive symptoms (Table 3).

Clinical signiﬁcant change
At baseline, all participants had clinical levels
of insomnia based on the ISI (cutoff $10)
(Morin et al., 2011). Of the participants that
completed the posttest, 12 (37.5%) scored
below the cutoff in the CBT-I condition and 3
(13.6%) in the waiting-list condition. The
proportions of the two conditions attaining
scores below the cutoff were not signiﬁcantly
different, x 2 [1] ¼ 3.70; p ¼ 0.14. On the
follow-ups, 13 (52.0%; three-month) and 12
participants (57.1%; six-month) scored below
cutoff in the CBT-I condition.
A change of eight or more on the ISI is
considered a clinical meaningful change in
insomnia severity (Morin et al., 2011). Of the
participants that completed the posttest, a
trend emerged showing that CBT-I partici-
pants were more likely to achieve a meaningful
change in insomnia with 13 participants
(40.6%) meeting criteria for meaningful
change in the CBT-I condition, and 4

the ISI and in the waiting-list group 7 (31.8%).
None of the deteriorations were clinical mean-
ingful (change ISI $ 8). Furthermore, no
patients reported adverse events; however, we
only asked the people that dropped out from

during therapy.
Mediation analysis
We conducted mediation analyses for the
dependent sleep variables that showed a
signiﬁcant interaction effect (Time £ Group)
at
posttest
(i.e.,
insomnia
severity,
sleep efﬁciency, WASO, sleep quality). Dys-
functional beliefs and safety behaviors were
the mediator variables in two separate
analyses (please see Supplemental Table S2
for the zero-order correlations).
As can be seen in Table 5, dysfunctional
beliefs (proportion of the effect explained
by the mediation 94%) and safety beha-
viors (92%) mediated the treatment effects
of CBT-I on insomnia severity (ISI), as well
as on sleep efﬁciency (proportion explained
respectively 45% and 41%). No mediation
effects
were
found
on
WASO
or
on
sleep quality. Mediation effect size esti-
mates are based
on MacKinnon
et al.
(2007).
For insomnia severity and sleep efﬁciency we
also conducted joint meditational analyses,
including both potential mediators in a single
model
(Table
5).
Dysfunctional
beliefs,
b ¼ 23.67, 95% BI [29.12, 0.16] and safety
behaviors, b ¼ 21.57, 95% BI [26.96, 2.31],
were not signiﬁcant mediators on sleep efﬁciency
in this model. However, together they mediated
the effect, b ¼ 25.25, 95% BI [212.03, 20.72],
proportion explained: 54%. For insomnia
severity, the total mediation effect, b ¼ 4.43,
95% BI [2.08, 7.03], proportion explained 80%,
was carried by safety behaviors, b ¼ 3.06, 95%
BI [1.18, 5.80], and not by dysfunctional beliefs,
b ¼ 1.37, 95% BI [20.42, 3.86].
Discussion
A ﬁrst aim of the present study was to test
whether online CBT-I was effective in treating
insomnia. We found that online CBT-I
showed moderate to large statistically signiﬁ-
cant
effects
on
insomnia
severity,
sleep efﬁciency, sleep quality, anxiety, and
depression scores compared to a waiting list.
Moreover, this CBT-I treatment format also
ameliorated
dysfunctional
beliefs
and
sleep safety behaviors. After treatment,
40.6% of the participants in the CBT-I
condition achieved a clinical meaningful
change on the ISI against 18.2% in the
waiting-list condition. The effects of online
CBT-I were maintained at the three- and six-
month follow-up.
A second aim was to test the extent to which
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors
might mediate the effects of CBT-I on
insomnia severity and sleep diary measures.
The singular mediator analyses indicated that
both dysfunctional beliefs and safety beha-
viors mediated the effect of CBT-I on
insomnia severity (ISI) and sleep efﬁciency,
but not WASO and sleep quality.
The observed treatment outcomes are in line
with previous studies on online treatment of
insomnia (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; Ho et al.,
2014; van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009). However,
the effects appeared somewhat smaller than
effects in a couple of recent studies (Espie,
Kyle, Williams, et al., 2012; Lancee et al.,
2012; Ritterband et al., 2009; van Straten
et al., 2014), as well as in a recent study using
the same treatment program (e.g., posttest
within-group Cohen’s d on insomnia severity
of 1.6 versus 1.2; Lancee et al., 2013).
A possible explanation could be that in the
current study feedback was provided by
master’s students of psychology instead of by
an insomnia expert such as in a previous
investigation (Lancee et al., 2013). However,
in another similar study (van Straten et al.,
2014) large results were acquired with student-
based feedback. Furthermore, no signiﬁcant
interaction effects were observed for total
sleep time, number of nightly awakenings,
TWAK, and SOL, possibly due to power
issues. In addition, the proportion achieving a
clinical meaningful change (18%) in the
waiting list was rather high, conceivable as a
consequence of the high percentage (30%)
seeking other treatment during the trial.
Our mediation analyses provided additional
support for the hypothesis that change in
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors
explains CBT-I’s treatment effects. As such,
they fall in line with ﬁndings observed by
several authors regarding dysfunctional beliefs
(Edinger et al., 2001; Espie et al., 2001; Harvey
et al., 2007; Jansson-Frojmark & Linton,
2008; Morin et al., 2002) and safety behaviors
(Espie et al., 2014; Harvey et al., 2007;
Jernelov et al., 2012). They are in contrast to
the null ﬁndings on insomnia severity reported
by
Okajima
et
al.

sleep efﬁciency reported by Espie et al. (2014).
When testing the joint model, i.e., when
including both dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors into the mediation analyses, only
safety
behaviors
remained
a
signiﬁcant
mediator for insomnia severity.
These ﬁndings underscore the importance
of paying attention to safety behaviors in
insomnia treatment. To challenge these safety
behaviors, Harvey and Eidelman (2011)
advocated the use of behavioral experiments.
They described several useful experiments,
such as the use of clock-watching at night.
In this exercise, patients are asked to act as
usual for the ﬁrst three nights (i.e., watching
their clock when they are awake). In the
subsequent three nights, they are asked to
refrain from their clock-watching. Before
conducting the experiment patients write
down their predictions and afterwards the
outcomes are discussed. These experiments
help the patients to understand that the safety
behavior and underlying beliefs are not helpful
and, in most cases, fuel insomnia. Since our
data point toward the importance of these
safety behaviors we think further investigation
of such behavioral experiments is warranted.
Some limitations need to be acknowledged
when appraising the present ﬁndings. We used
a pre–post change score for the mediator
variables (dysfunctional beliefs/safety beha-
vior). Arguably, our argument would be less
theoretical if the mediators were measured at a
separate time-point that succeeded the inde-
pendent variable (group) and preceded the
dependent variable (i.e., ISI). Furthermore,
with the present level of power (i.e., a 0.8
probability to detect an effect size of 0.65), no
signiﬁcant treatment effects were detected for
SOL,
TWAK,
or
total
sleep
time.
We therefore did not conduct mediation
analyses for these variables. Future studies
on CBT-I may include more participants to
allow for mediational analyses on these diary
sleep variables. Likewise, the predominance of
the meditational potency of safety behaviors
over dysfunctional belief needs to be cross-
validated in future studies.
Other methodological limitations of this
study were that we did not include objective
measurements (e.g., polysomnography), that
insomnia was not diagnosed by a clinician,
and that we had a self-selected sample of
people interested in an online treatment study.
On the other hand, we note that subjective
measurements (i.e., diaries) are the standard
outcome measures in most treatments trials
(Buysse, Ancoli-Israel, Edinger, Lichstein, &
Morin, 2006), and we believe that the
inclusion of objective measurements and/or
clinician-based diagnoses would have wea-
kened the ecological validity of the online
design. Furthermore, we made an effort to use
the best possible online selection criteria by
using DSM-5 insomnia criteria in addition to
a score of 10 on the ISI (Morin et al., 2011).
Likewise, one could argue that the present
sample was a self-selected set of individuals
who were online and interested in treatment.
Again, this may be the case, but this likely
reﬂects the potential users of these treatment
formats.
Also, this trial suffered from some dropout.
We had 11–19% missing data in the posttest
questionnaire and 31–33% in the diary. These
missing data may have inﬂuenced the results
because participants in the CBT-I condition
with low total sleep time scores dropped out
more often from the posttest measurements.
Our multilevel and multiple imputation inten-
tion-to-treat analyses mitigate these concerns
somewhat (Hox, 2002; Sterne et al., 2009).
However, from a clinical viewpoint, it is
particularly important that individuals with
the most severe insomnia do complete the
treatment. This may be particularly important
for total sleep time since insomniacs that
sleep the fewest hours have a higher risk for
hypertension (Vgontzas, Liao, Bixler, Chrou-
sos, & Vela-Bueno, 2009). Limiting these
dropouts in the future is therefore of major
importance.
Finally, as these mediation analyses were
performed in an online treatment study, we
cannot be sure that our ﬁndings generalize to
face-to-face therapy. These concerns are
mitigated by the fact that both types of
treatment use the same protocol, it is likely
that the treatments achieve their effects in a
similar manner.
Taken together, this study contributes to
the now substantial evidence for the efﬁcacy
of online CBT for insomnia. Future studies
may compare online CBT-I to active treat-
ments, including face-to-face treatments, and
focus more on the mechanisms of change.
Indeed, we hold that the main contribution of
this paper lies in the identiﬁcation of two
418

potential mediating factors of treatment
effectiveness: dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors. As a primary candidate variable
deserving more attention, we would like to
nominate the (fading out of the) use of safety
behaviors.
