Abstract 
39 
Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) for insomnia 
40 
comprising different sleep-related cognitive and behavioral interventional components has 
41 
shown some promise. However, it is not known which components are necessary for a good 
42 
treatment outcome. 
43 
Method: People suffering from insomnia (N = 104) without any other comorbid psychiatric 
44 
disorders were randomized (2:2:1) to two guided internet-based self-help interventions for 
45 
insomnia (multi-component cognitive behavioral self-help intervention [MCT]; sleep 
46 
restriction intervention for insomnia [SRT]), and care as usual [CAU]. In all three conditions, 
47 
additional care or treatment was allowed. The primary outcome was insomnia severity 
48 
measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at eight weeks. Furthermore, the two active 
49 
conditions were compared regarding sleep efficacy from daily diary data over the eight 
50 
weeks, and other measures from the daily protocols. Secondary outcomes included sleep 
51 
quality, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, and quality of life at post-treatment 
52 
(eight weeks) and follow-up (six months after randomization). 
53 
Results: Both conditions were more effective than CAU at post-treatment, with medium to 
54 
large between-group effect sizes on the primary outcome (ISI; MCT: Cohen's d = -1.15; SRT: 
55 
d = -0.68) and small to medium between-group effect sizes for secondary outcomes. 
56 
Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Active conditions did not differ from 
57 
each other on all measures from pre to post, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and 
58 
sleep protocol data throughout the intervention. Participants in MCT were significantly more 
59 
satisfied with the intervention than participants in SRT. 
60 
Conclusions: Results of the present study indicate that CAU + MCT and CAU + SRT are 
61 
both effective compared to CAU. There were no statistical differences regarding efficacy 
62 
between the two active conditions, but participants in MCT reported to be more satisfied with 
63 
the intervention.

1. INTRODUCTION 
69 
Insomnia is a significant public health problem, with one-third of the adult population 
70 
reporting symptoms of insomnia, and approximately 10% meeting diagnostic criteria for an 
71 
insomnia disorder (Ohayon, 2002, Simon and VonKorff, 1997, Morin and Jarrin, 2013). 
72 
Problems related to sleep, affect daily cognitive performance as well as mood, which in turn 
73 
affect quality of life as well as work productivity (Walsh, 2004). Insomnia has been proposed 
74 
to be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of many mental health disorders (Harvey 
75 
et al., 2011). As a consequence, insomnia is responsible for high social costs and the 
76 
economic burden of insomnia is very high, with the largest proportion of all expenses 
77 
attributable to insomnia-related work absences and reduced productivity (Daley et al., 2009). 
78 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychological treatment that targets 
79 
the maladaptive behaviors and dysfunctional thoughts that perpetuate sleep problems. CBT-I 
80 
is one of the most effective treatments for insomnia (Trauer et al., 2015, van der Zweerde et 
81 
al., 2018). A so-called multi-component therapy consisting of several aspects is recommended 
82 
by the current guidelines of both the American and European sleep societies (Riemann et al., 
83 
2017, Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008). Typically, CBT-I consists of several components such as 
84 
stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive 
85 
restructuring (Perlis et al., 2010, Morin et al., 2006, Okajima et al., 2011). Of note, CBT-I has 
86 
also shown to have considerable treatment effects for depression comorbid with insomnia 
87 
(Cunningham and Shapiro, 2018, Wu et al., 2015). 
88 
Although a multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown to be effective, it is not 
89 
clear which components of a multi-component therapy are most helpful to treat insomnia 
90 
successfully. For example, there is empirical evidence that psychoeducation and sleep 
91 
hygiene are not likely to be effective components of a successful insomnia treatment (Morin 
92 
et al., 1994).  
93 
Several studies have investigated which components specifically contribute to treatment 
94 
outcome. In dismantling studies in a face-to-face setting, sleep restriction has shown to be one 
95 
of the most effective of these components (Spielman et al., 1987, Youngstedt and Kripke, 
96 
2004, Morin et al., 2006, Harvey et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2014). A recent review concluded 
97 
that sleep restriction is an effective single behavioral intervention for the treatment of 
98 
insomnia for sleep diary variables (Miller et al., 2014). Epstein and colleagues (Epstein et al., 
99 
2012) conducted a dismantling study in older adults suffering from insomnia to compare 
100 

MANUSCRIPT

5
multi-component therapy, sleep restriction alone, and stimulus control alone, to a waitlist 
101 
control group. They found initial evidence that stimulus control, sleep restriction, and multi-
102 
component therapy are equally efficacious. However, multicomponent therapy showed higher 
103 
remission rates and should, therefore, be recommended. Similarly, a study by Harvey et al. 
104 
(Harvey et al., 2014) compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with cognitive therapy 
105 
(CT) and behavior therapy (BT) in chronic insomnia and showed significant improvements 
106 
across all three treatment conditions. The authors found the greatest improvement for 
107 
insomniacs in the CBT group, while improvements in the BT group were faster but less 
108 
enduring and in the CT group improvements were delayed in action but more sustained. 
109 
Unfortunately, the availability of CBT-I is severely limited for many reasons, including lack 
110 
of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, expense, 
111 
and inaccessibility to treatment and clinicians (e.g., van Straten and Cuijpers, 2009). Online 
112 
interventions represent a potential solution to overcome several of the barriers to treatment 
113 
access (Andersson and Titov, 2014). Several randomized controlled studies of internet-based 
114 
self-help treatments for insomnia (iCBT-I) have shown its efficacy (e.g., van Straten et al., 
115 
2014, Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ritterband et al., 2009), and recent meta-analyses (Seyffert et al., 
116 
2016, Zachariae et al., 2016, Ye et al., 2016) show good results with large effects on insomnia 
117 
severity, and medium effects for sleep efficiency and sleep quality. There is evidence that 
118 
guided self-help interventions show better results compared to unguided interventions, 
119 
irrespective of whether it is internet-based or not (Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ho et al., 2014). 
120 
Regarding dismantling studies in online interventions, Kaldo and colleagues (Kaldo et al., 
121 
2015) compared eight weeks of a guided multi-component iCBT-I with an active internet-
122 
based control treatment consisting of components with less empirical support for the 
123 
treatment of insomnia such as sleep hygiene, relaxation, mindfulness, and general stress 
124 
management. Notably, these components were only presented in an abbreviated form, and 
125 
there was no guidance. Multi-component ICBT was significantly more effective after eight 
126 
weeks. However, the two conditions did not differ anymore after 12 months due to a 
127 
continuous decrease in ISI among controls. A very recent study showed that a multi-
128 
component therapy is more efficacious than online sleep education across a range of 
129 
demographic groups (Cheng et al., 2018). 
130 
In summary, even though a considerable number of studies show positive effects for guided 
131 
internet interventions for insomnia, there is still a lack of knowledge about which components 
132 
of a multicomponent treatment are essential for the positive effects, and whether all 
133

6
components are necessary for an effective treatment. The current study aims to compare sleep 
134 
restriction, which is one crucial behavioral component of CBT-I, and a multi-component 
135 
cognitive behavioral treatment with an active waiting list control group. Furthermore, it aims 
136 
to compare the two active conditions. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that 
137 
compare two different forms of guided iCBT-I and the first study that investigates guided 
138 
internet-based sleep restriction. 
139 
2. METHODS 
140 
2.1 Study design 
141 
This study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two immediate 
142 
treatment groups to an active waiting list control group. All groups had access to CAU and 
143 
the waiting list control group was enrolled in the iCBT-I program after the active treatment 
144 
groups had completed the programme (after eight weeks). The immediate treatment group 
145 
was followed up for six months after randomization. We wanted to be able to detect a 
146 
standardized between-group effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.35. Smaller effect sizes were 
147 
considered to be irrelevant from a clinical point of view. A power analysis based on an 
148 
anticipated drop-out rate of 25% revealed that approximately 90 participants were needed per 
149 
active treatment group to show such an effect with a power (1-β) of .80 compared to the 
150 
control condition. Furthermore, 40 participants were estimated to be sufficient for the control 
151 
condition because effect sizes between the control condition and treatment groups were 
152 
assumed to be largely based on the previous trials, resulting in a sample size of 225 
153 
participants. For practicality reasons, we had to finish the recruitment procedure when 104 
154 
participants were randomized, therefore limiting our ability to detect small to medium 
155 
between-group effect sizes. 
156 
2.2 Participants and Procedure 
157 
Participants were recruited from June 2016 to July 2017 through newspaper advertisements, 
158 
online postings, flyers, and physician referrals. Inclusion criteria were a) age of 18 years or 
159 
older, b) meeting criteria for acute or chronic insomnia according to the International 
160 
Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014), c) 
161 
having access to the internet, d) good knowledge of the German language. Exclusion criteria 
162 
were a) known organic insomnia (e.g., due to restless legs syndrome, breathing-related sleep 
163 
disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), b) psychiatric comorbidities according to the 
164 

MANUSCRIPT

7
MINI interview (Ackenheil et al., 1999), and c) acute suicidality. After consenting to study 
165 
participation and meeting the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria (assessed via the 
166 
baseline online questionnaire and an interview via telephone), participants were randomly 
167 
assigned to one of the three conditions (2:2:1). The allocation list was made using a 
168 
computerized random number generator and was concealed from the investigators and 
169 
participants. After the randomization, the participants received an email regarding their 
170 
allocation. All participants in the active conditions were advised to work through one session 
171 
per week and to start a new session after receiving weekly feedback by their guide. After 
172 
eight weeks, all participants were asked to fill out the post-assessment questionnaires online 
173 
and to participate in a second telephone interview to re-evaluate their diagnostic status. The 
174 
assessors could not be kept blind regarding group allocation because some participants 
175 
revealed information about the treatment during the interview. Six months after the beginning 
176 
of treatment, participants were contacted via email and asked to fill out the questionnaires 
177 
again and to take part in another interview. The trial was registered with 
178 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03110263) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
179 
Canton of Bern, Switzerland (2016-00295). 
180 
2.3 Primary outcome measures 
181 
The primary outcome of the present study was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for the 
182 
comparisons between the three conditions. Also, we used sleep efficacy (SE) reported by the 
183 
participants during the intervention in the morning protocol for the comparison between the 
184 
two active conditions. 
185 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Insomnia severity was assessed with the Insomnia Severity 
186 
Index (ISI) (Bastien et al., 2001). Participants indicate the severity of sleep onset difficulties, 
187 
sleep maintenance difficulties, early morning awakening, satisfaction with current sleep, 
188 
interference with daytime functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to sleep 
189 
problems, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem for the previous 
190 
week. The German version of the ISI has shown acceptable psychometric properties (Gerber 
191 
et al., 2016). Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. Cronbach’s alpha at post was .83. 
192 
Sleep efficacy (SE). Participants in the two active conditions were asked to fill out an evening 
193 
and a morning protocol daily during the intervention phase to assess different parameters of 
194 
their sleep and its consequences. The protocols were in line with the protocols of the German 
195 

MANUSCRIPT

8
Association for Sleep Research and Sleep medicine (DGSM). We assessed SE with data from 
196 
the morning protocol for every night during the treatment period. 
197 
2.4 Secondary outcome measures 
198 
Secondary outcomes included the following measures: Overall sleep quality was measured 
199 
with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989, Riemann and Backhaus, 
200 
1996). To assess maladaptive beliefs in insomnia, we used the 16-item version of the 
201 
Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) scale (Morin et al., 2007, Weingartz 
202 
and Pillmann, 2009). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the German short version of the 
203 
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977), the 
204 
“Allgemeine Depressions‐Skala – Kurzform” (ADS-K) (Hautzinger and Bailer, 1993). To 
205 
assess the quality of life participants were asked how good or bad their health is on a visual 
206 
analog scale (QoL-VAS) from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health 
207 
you can imagine) (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman et al., 2011). At post-treatment, we assessed an 
208 
adapted version of a patient satisfaction questionnaire, the ZUF-8 (Schmidt et al., 1989). This 
209 
brief and reliable instrument was originally developed as a translation of the Client 
210 
Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson and Greenfield, 2004). As well, user 
211 
satisfaction was measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996). 
212 
Sleep protocol. As described above, we assessed different variables with 1-item Likert-scale 
213 
questions in both active conditions using daily morning and evening protocols by the German 
214 
Association for Sleep Research and Sleep medicine (DGSM) within each of the internet-based 
215 
programs. Sleep quality (1 “very good” – 5 “very bad”), recovery (1 “very recovered” – 5 
216 
“very unrecovered”) and tiredness before going to bed (1 “not tired at all” – 5 “very tired”) 
217 
were assessed in the morning protocol. Daytime tiredness (1 “no daytime tiredness” – 8 
218 
“strong daytime tiredness”), concentration (1 “very unconcentrated” – 8 “very concentrated”), 
219 
mood (1 “very bad mood” – 8 “very good mood”), and relaxation (1 “unrelaxed” – 8 “very 
220 
relaxed”) were assessed in the evening protocol. 
221 
Diagnostic measures. Assessors interviewed participants via telephone at baseline (M.I.N.I 
222 
and ICSD-3). The German Version of the M.I.N.I. (Ackenheil et al., 1999) screened for 
223 
possible psychiatric comorbidities. The ICSD-3 (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 
224 
2014) provides specific coding information for an insomnia diagnosis (Mayer et al., 2015). 
225 
Participants were interviewed at post-intervention to check whether they still fulfilled the 
226 
criteria for insomnia. Eight advanced master students in clinical psychology and the second

author conducted the interviews. All of the assessors had been trained in using the interviews 
228 
in a workshop including test interviews and feedback and were supervised by the second 
229 
author. 
230 
2.5 Description of conditions 
231 
Multicomponent internet-based guided treatment (MCT). The self-help program consists of 
232 
eight text-based sessions and tasks (see Table 1) and is based on interventions by Perlis et al. 
233 
(Perlis et al., 2006). The psychoeducational component covers information about the 
234 
processes of sleep, sleep hygiene and general information on stress management. The 
235 
behavioral techniques include sleep restriction (i.e., reducing the sleep window to enhance 
236 
sleep consolidation), stimulus control (e.g., getting out of bed after a certain time of 
237 
wakefulness), and relaxation (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation). The cognitive techniques 
238 
included belief restructuring (e.g., targeting unrealistic beliefs about sleep). Comparable 
239 
MCTs have already been successfully evaluated in other studies (Holmqvist et al., 2014, 
240 
Blom et al., 2015, van Straten et al., 2014). All participants received guidance during 8-weeks 
241 
of treatment. Guidance consisted of weekly messages in an integrated secured environment of 
242 
guides who monitored the participant’s progress in the program and provided feedback and 
243 
structure. The participants could also use the integrated message function to contact their 
244 
guide whenever they felt the need to and were informed that the guide would answer within 
245 
three working days. The main aim of the guides’ messages was to reinforce the independent 
246 
program use and maintain the participant’s motivation. When a participant was inactive for a 
247 
week, the guide offered support with the respective module. 
248 
Internet-based guided sleep restriction treatment (SRT). The 8-week treatment program 
249 
mainly consists of sleep restriction instructions that are embedded in an introductory and 
250 
psychoeducational module (see Table 1). Sleep restriction induces mild sleep deprivation to 
251 
enhance the endogenous sleep drive. A sleep window was proposed depending on the time a 
252 
participant wanted to get up. Every week, a new sleep window was calculated based on the 
253 
participants’ sleep diary data together with the participant to select the timing of the window 
254 
(e.g., earlier versus later in the night). A more lenient sleep window was suggested for 
255 
moderate-to-severe tiredness. The sleep window was regularly reviewed at each module after 
256 
it had been introduced. If the sleep diary data indicate a sleep efficiency of 90% or higher, the 
257 
participant was advised to add 30 min to the sleep window (Morin et al., 2006, Perlis et al., 
258 
2010, Riemann and Spiegelhalder, 2015). The minimum sleep window for this intervention 
259

10
was set at six hours (Müller and Paterok, 2010). Guidance was the same as in the 
260 
multicomponent internet-based treatment (see also below). 
261 
Care as usual (CAU). Participants in the control group received access to the MCT program 
262 
after a waiting period of 8 weeks, at post-treatment of the active treatment conditions. 
263 
Because participants were allowed to use other resources from the healthcare system during 
264 
the study, we labeled this group as care-as-usual (CAU). 
265 
2.6 Guidance 
266 
The guides were one psychologist with a Master’s degree in clinical psychology in his first 
267 
year of a post-graduate CBT training program and eight Master students who were in their 
268 
last term of a graduate program in clinical psychology. All guides had an introduction to both 
269 
online interventions and training of the principals of iCBT. Furthermore, they were supervised 
270 
by the second and the last author and received support regarding email correspondence when 
271 
needed. For this, the guides contacted the second and the last author when needed. In the case 
272 
of uncertainties, the co-authors from the Sleep-Wake-Epilepsy-Center were asked for 
273 
additional advice. To ensure adherence, the second author regularly screened the content of 
274 
all messages sent. Participants were consecutively allocated to guides without randomization 
275 
to minimize waiting times. All guides provided guidance in both conditions. 
276 
2.7 Statistical analyses 
277 
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS or R (R Core Team, 2018) and the 
278 
packages nlme (Pinheiro et al., 2018). ANOVAs and ??2-tests were used to detect differences 
279 
in baseline data. To compare the two active treatments with the waiting list, we analyzed all 
280 
primary and secondary outcome measures with mixed-effect models using unstructured 
281 
covariance matrices and restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with time-points 
282 
nested within subjects. This approach uses all available data of each subject without 
283 
substituting missing values and allows the inclusion of all participants in the analyses, 
284 
following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The models were further examined using 
285 
contrast analyses. Within- and between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated based 
286 
on estimated means and the pooled standard deviation from the observed means. We 
287 
compared the two active treatments on the basis of daily diary entries (max. 56) in the 
288 
program during the eight weeks (scaled from 0 to 1). Within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) 
289 
were calculated based on the estimated means at the beginning and after eight weeks and the 
290

11
pooled SD throughout the 56 days. Within-group changes in outcome scores from post-
291 
treatment to follow-up were analyzed with mixed-effect models and REML for the active 
292 
conditions only, as the CAU group was offered the online intervention after eight weeks. 
293 
Participants were considered responders if their ISI change score compared with baseline was 
294 
greater than seven at post, and treatment remitters if their absolute ISI score at post was less 
295 
than eight, following previous recommendations (Morin et al., 2009). Applying a 
296 
conservative approach, we defined all missing data for response, remission and diagnostic 
297 
status as unchanged from baseline, i.e., first observation carried forward. 
298 
3. RESULTS 
299 
3.1 Baseline differences 
300 
Participants did not differ in primary and secondary outcomes or any demographic or 
301 
diagnostic variables (see Table 2) between the three conditions. 
302 
3.2 Study dropout analysis 
303 
In total, 16 of 104 participants (15.4%) did not complete the post-assessment questionnaires, 
304 
although they had been invited three times at weekly intervals via email. Non-completion 
305 
rates did not differ with respect to experimental group, ??2(2, n=104) = 2.34, p = .31, V = 
306 
0.15, nor demographic data, nor baseline symptomatology (all p’s > .40). 
307 
3.3 Overall effects and pairwise comparisons at post-treatment 
308 
Observed and estimated means for all self-report measures assessed at baseline and post are 
309 
presented in Table 3. Linear mixed models with group as a fixed factor and time as a repeated 
310 
factor (pre--post) were fitted separately for each of the dependent measures. Significant group 
311 
x time interaction effects were found for all primary and secondary outcomes, except for 
312 
quality of life assessed with the QoL-VAS. Bonferroni-corrected consecutive contrast 
313 
analyses for models with a significant interaction effect, showed that both active treatments 
314 
were significantly superior to CAU on all involved measures except depressive symptoms and 
315 
quality of life. Regarding depressive symptoms assessed with the ADS-K, only the MCT 
316 
condition proved to be significantly superior to CAU (p = .012) while the SRT was not 
317 
significantly different from CAU (p = .168). Regarding quality of life, the MCT group 
318 
significantly differed from CAU (p = .020) while the SRT group did not differ from CAU (p 
319 
= .207). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the active conditions on 
320

12
primary and secondary outcomes, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep assessed with 
321 
the DBAS-16. Here, the MCT group showed significantly lower scores indicating less 
322 
dysfunctional beliefs compared to the SRT group (p = .045).  
323 
3.4 Effect sizes at post-treatment 
324 
Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are presented in Table 3. For the ISI, the between-group effect sizes 
325 
at post-treatment were d = -0.46 for MCT vs. SRT (in favor of MCT), d = 1.15 for MCT vs. 
326 
CAU (in favor of MCT), and d = -.68 for SRT vs. CAU (in favor of SRT). For the ISI, within-
327 
group comparisons revealed large effect sizes in MCT (d = 1.62) and SRT (d = 1.41), and a 
328 
medium effect size for CAU (d = 0.64). 
329 
3.5 Response, remission, and deterioration 
330 
Regarding response (change in ISI > 7), 9.5% of the participants in the CAU (n = 2), 31.7% in 
331 
the SRT (n = 13), and 40.5% (n = 17) in the MCT condition were considered responders at 
332 
post-treatment. Significantly more cases in the MCT showed response compared to CAU, 
333 
??2(1, n=63) = 6.37, p = .012, V = 0.32. This was not the case for the SRT group compared to 
334 
CAU, ??2(1, n=62) = 3.73, p = .054, V = 0.25. However, the two active conditions did not 
335 
significantly differ between each other ??2(1, n=83) = 0.69, p = .41, V = 0.09. 
336 
Regarding remission (ISI post score < 8), 4.8% of the participants in the CAU (n = 1), 24.4% 
337 
in the SRT (n = 10), and 38.1% (n = 16) in the MCT condition were considered remitted at 
338 
post-treatment. Significantly more cases in the MCT remitted compared to the CAU, ??2(1, 
339 
n=63) = 7.90, p = .005, V = 0.35. This was not the case for the SRT group compared to the 
340 
CAU, ??2(1, n=62) = 3.67, p = .056, V = 0.24. Again, the two active groups did not differ 
341 
from each other ??2(1, n=83) = 1.81, p = .178, V = 0.15. 
342 
No participant in any condition showed a reliable deterioration on the ISI (difference of 8 or 
343 
more) at post compared to the baseline score. 
344 
3.6 Diagnostic status at post-treatment 
345 
In total, 86 participants could be reached for a second clinical interview after the treatment 
346 
(MCT: n = 35 [83.3%]; SRT: n = 31 [75.6%]; and CAU: n = 20 [95.2%]). Results in the 
347 
intention-to-treat sample indicated that 81% (n = 17) in CAU, 52.4% (n = 22) in MCT, and 
348 
48.8% (n = 20) in SRT still fulfilled the criteria for an insomnia according to the ICSD-3 
349 
criteria at post-assessment. The groups differed significantly regarding the diagnostic status at 
350 

MANUSCRIPT

13
post, ??2(2, N=104) = 6.40, p = .04, V = 0.25. Both active groups showed fewer people still 
351 
suffering from insomnia than in the control condition, p’s < .028. The two treatments did not 
352 
significantly differ from each other at post-assessment, ??2(1, n=83) = 0.11, p = .74, V = -0.04. 
353 
3.7 Comparing the two active treatments based on daily protocols 
354 
Participants in both active conditions were instructed to complete a daily protocol. Based on 
355 
these daily assessments we ran separate mixed models analyses with group and days (0-55), 
356 
recoded as Time from 0 to 1, and its interaction from baseline to post-assessment (eight 
357 
weeks) assuming a linear change for all protocol items. Results are presented in Table 4. All 
358 
interactions regarding the primary (sleep efficacy) and most secondary outcomes (sleep 
359 
quality, feeling unrecovered, daytime tiredness, concentration, mood, and relaxation) were 
360 
non-significant (all p’s > .10). An exception was tiredness when going to bed (p = .003), 
361 
which remained stable in MCT but increased significantly in SRT. Within- and between-
362 
group effect sizes were mostly in the small to medium range and can be seen in Table 4.  
363 
3.8 Maintenance of treatment effects at 6-month follow-up 
364 
All analyses in this section only include the two active conditions, as the CAU group had 
365 
already received access to the treatment after eight weeks. Mixed models analyses including 
366 
pre, post and follow-up scores (see Table 3) showed significant time effects for all scales 
367 
assessed at follow-up (ISI, PSQI, ADS-K, EQ_VAS), all ps < .027. Contrast analyses indicate 
368 
that follow-up scores improved from baseline, and post hoc tests using Bonferroni-correction 
369 
indicate stability from post-treatment to follow-up, as no significant differences were 
370 
detected. All Time X Group interactions were non-significant, F(2, 54.56-68.00) = 0.15-1.00, 
371 
all ps ≥ .35, therefore through all time points, neither of the conditions proved to be 
372 
significantly superior. 
373 
3.9 Diagnostic status at follow-up  
374 
Regarding insomnia diagnostic status at follow-up, 30 of 42 (71.4%) in the MCT and 24 of 
375 
41(58.5%) in the SRT condition could be reached for a diagnostic interview. Again using a 
376 
conservative approach defining missings as unchanged from baseline, 20 participants of 42 
377 
(47.6%) in the MCT condition and 25 of 41 participants (61.0%) in the SRT condition 
378 
fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at follow-up. This difference, however, was not statistically 
379 
significant, ??2(1, n=83) = 1.49, p = .22, V = 0.13.

3.10 Patient Satisfaction 
381 
Regarding the ZUF-8 assessed after eight weeks, participants in the MCT (M = 3.42, SD = 
382 
0.55) condition showed significantly higher levels of satisfaction than participants in the SRT 
383 
(M = 2.99, SD = 0.57), t(65.92)=3.23, p = .002. Regarding usability assessed with the SUS, 
384 
the two interventions were rated equally, MCT: M = 4.39, SD = 0.60; SRT: M = 4.18, SD = 
385 
0.64; t(66)=1.43, p = .16. 
386 
3.11 Program usage 
387 
The average of completed modules in MCT was 6.66 (SD = 2.12) out of eight, mean 
388 
completed modules in SRT was 4.61 (SD = 0.80) out of five, over the eight weeks. For time 
389 
spent in the program, the median was 7.57 h in MCT, and 5.32 h in SRT. Using a non-
390 
parametric U-test, this difference was statistically significant p = .008. 
391 
Regarding the usage of the sleep restriction module, the median for time spent in this module 
392 
was 14.7 min in MCT and 13.0 min in SRT for all participants. Using a U-Test, this 
393 
difference was not significant, p = .45. Relatedly, for the number of adjustments of the sleep 
394 
window, the median was three in the MCT and two in the SRT. This difference was also not 
395 
significant, p = .57. 
396 
3.12 Guidance 
397 
On average, therapists wrote 9.66 messages (SD = 3.19, Md = 10) in MCT and 10.05 
398 
messages (SD = 3.38, Md  = 10) in SRT. This difference was not significant, U = 757.5, p = 
399 
.44. Participants wrote on average 5.44 messages (SD = 4.10, Md = 5) in MCT and 6.12 in 
400 
SRT (SD = 5.81, Md = 5). This difference was not statistically significant, U = 836.0, p = .97. 
401 
The two groups furthermore did not differ regarding the number of words written by 
402 
participants (MCT: Md = 508; SRT: Md = 427; U = 755.0, p = .43) nor by therapists (MCT: 
403 
Md = 1484; SRT: Md = 1494; U = 820.0, p = .85). 
404 
4. DISCUSSION 
405 
The current study set out to compare two guided internet-based interventions to a waiting-list 
406 
control group for people suffering from insomnia. Both active groups showed significant 
407 
differences compared to the control group regarding the primary outcome. As such, the 
408 
present study adds to the growing literature of the efficacy of internet-based interventions for 
409 
insomnia also in people not suffering from other psychiatric conditions. Quality of life did not

15
increase compared to the waiting-list control condition in both active conditions. One reason 
411 
could be that potential participants with comorbid psychological disorders were excluded. 
412 
However, this finding has been reported in a previous study on iCBT-I with or without phone 
413 
support in which comorbid psychological disorders were not excluded and not assessed (Ho et 
414 
al., 2014). 
415 
Concerning the comparison of the two active conditions, the results of the present study 
416 
provide preliminary evidence that a multicomponent treatment (MCT condition) is not 
417 
superior with regard to insomnia severity to an intervention that focuses on sleep restriction 
418 
and omits working on dysfunctional cognitions (SRT condition). This was the case for 
419 
comparisons of insomnia severity at post as well as at follow-up assessment. However, results 
420 
indicate that the MCT group benefited significantly more regarding dysfunctional sleep-
421 
related beliefs. The additional module on cognitive restructuring could have caused this 
422 
difference. Additionally, on a descriptive level but not at a statistical level more people in 
423 
MCT compared to the SRT condition no longer fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at six 
424 
months. This is in line with results found in traditional CBT-I (Epstein et al., 2012, Harvey et 
425 
al., 2014). 
426 
Regarding depressive symptoms, only MCT proved to be superior to the control condition; 
427 
this was not the case for SRT. This might also be due to the extra module on cognitive 
428 
restructuring. However, the results of the present study on comorbid depressive symptoms 
429 
may be underestimated, if comorbid major depression had been permitted in the present 
430 
study. Nevertheless, the result that MCT may have a stronger effect on depressive symptoms 
431 
seems important because a recent RCT in people suffering from symptoms of depression and 
432 
insomnia revealed that ICBT-I is effective in the reduction of depressive symptoms (van der 
433 
Zweerde et al., 2018). This result is also consistent with another study showing that patients 
434 
who suffer from insomnia and depression profit highly from insomnia treatment (Blom et al., 
435 
2017). The result of the present study suggests that cognitive restructuring may play an 
436 
important role. 
437 
A sleep restriction module was part of both active interventions. A review of treatment studies 
438 
for insomnia showed that the absolute minimal sleep window – also called “minimal time in 
439 
bed” – can vary considerably (Kyle et al., 2015). This is important since sleep restriction 
440 
treatment can be associated with reduced objective total sleep time, increased daytime 
441 
tiredness, and objective performance impairment (Kyle et al., 2014). In the present study, we 
442 
set the minimum sleep window at six hours. It cannot be ruled out that a shorter sleep window 
443

16
– although bearing more “pain” - would have led to more “gain” regarding treatment response 
444 
(Kyle et al., 2011). However, to minimize the risk of negative effects, we decided to use a 
445 
comparably long minimal time in bed. Future studies should systematically test the 
446 
association of different minimal time windows and treatment response. 
447 
All comparisons of different variables of sleep diary data, such as sleep efficacy, revealed no 
448 
significant differences between the two active conditions (all p-values > .10). However, it is 
449 
striking that - on a descriptive level - daytime tiredness decreased in MCT while it increased 
450 
in SRT throughout the interventions. Therefore, it can be assumed that more statistical power 
451 
would have led to a statistically significant difference between the two conditions regarding 
452 
daytime tiredness. More daytime tiredness should be considered a negative side effect of the 
453 
SRT condition. Of note, although participants had the same module on sleep restriction with 
454 
the same instructions and although usage of the sleep restriction module in both conditions 
455 
was similar, in MCT daytime tiredness decreased. One explanation for this finding could be 
456 
that if participants in a sleep intervention can choose from different interventions, they apply 
457 
the ones that work best for them or have fewer side effects. More research on which specific 
458 
interventions of internet-based treatments participants do apply and maintain in daily life is 
459 
needed. 
460 
Note that from a user perspective, participants in MCT were significantly more satisfied with 
461 
the intervention than participants in SRT. Also, more participants reported that they have a 
462 
specific preference for MCT (32.7%) than for SRT (5.8%) before the intervention started. 
463 
Considering that the amount of guidance and therefore the use of resources did not differ 
464 
between the two conditions, in sum, results from a patient perspective are in favor of MCT. 
465 
However, treatment preferences that may be associated with treatment outcome expectancies 
466 
could have influenced the results of the present study (Constantino et al., 2007). 
467 
There are some important limitations of the present study that have to be considered. First, 
468 
due to clinical considerations, we excluded participants if they met the criteria for a 
469 
psychiatric disorder. On the one hand, this limits the generalizability of our results, on the 
470 
other hand, the results of the present study have a higher internal validity for people suffering 
471 
from insomnia. Second, apart from a diagnostic interview, all measures were based on mere 
472 
self-report. Third, the power of the present study was not sufficient to yield significant small 
473 
to medium effects between the two active conditions. A future study to find significant 
474 
differences between these active conditions should be powered adequately. We assume that 
475 
small significant effects could be expected in a replication of the present study with more 
476

17
power. The recruitment for the present study had to be discontinued since recruitment was 
477 
slower than expected. A reason for this slow recruitment could be that most people only seek 
478 
support to cope with insomnia when additional problems such as depression or anxiety arise. 
479 
Since we advertised that people with comorbid psychological disorders could not be included 
480 
in the present study, these people did not contact us. Fourth, we did not systematically assess 
481 
the negative effects associated with the two interventions apart from reliable deterioration. 
482 
Taken together, both active conditions, MCT and SRT, proved to be efficacious compared to 
483 
CAU alone. Also, there is preliminary evidence that MCT might be more efficient regarding 
484 
dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, probably due to the additional cognitive module included in 
485 
MCT. Furthermore, participants in MCT were more satisfied with the treatment compared to 
486 
participants in SRT. Considering the equally-used resources (e.g., messages sent, number of 
487 
words used in the messages) in both conditions, one could argue that MCT should be the 
488 
internet-based treatment of choice for people suffering from insomnia.  
489 
Highlighting the high potential health-economic benefit of providing low-threshold internet-
490 
based interventions for insomnia, two recent RCTs showed that improvements in insomnia 
491 
symptoms mediate improvements in functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-
492 
related quality of life (Espie et al., 2018) and psychotic experiences and other psychological 
493 
symptoms (Freeman et al., 2017). Despite these encouraging results of internet-based 
494 
interventions for insomnia one has to bear in mind that not all people suffering from insomnia 
495 
can profit from internet-based interventions. In the current study, in the MCT condition, 
496 
around 60% did not fulfill the self-report-based criterion for remission regarding insomnia 
497 
severity and around 50 % still fulfilled the criteria for insomnia in a diagnostic interview at 
498 
post-treatment. As a consequence, research that improves existing interventions seems 
499 
necessary, or people who do not profit from internet-based interventions should be offered 
500 
complementary or other interventions in different settings. Related to the latter point, more 
501 
research on stepped care approaches in insomnia seems necessary. Likewise, generally more 
502 
research is needed in routine practice settings, such as in primary care or sleep clinics, to 
503 
generalize the encouraging results of internet-based treatments for insomnia.

Highlights 
 
• Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) is effective in insomnia 
• An abridged iCBT-I focusing on sleep restriction is effective in insomnia 
• The treatment gains remained stable up to 6-month follow-up 
• The effects of the two versions of iCBT-I did not differ from each other 
• Patients were more satisfied with the full version of iCBT-I
