Abstract 
Study Objectives: We sought to examine the impact of digital cognitive behavioural therapy 
(dCBT) for insomnia on both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive 
performance. 
 
Methods: The DISCO trial was an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of 
dCBT versus wait-list control. Participants were aged 25 years and older, met DSM-5 
diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and reported difficulties with concentration or 
memory. Assessments were carried out online at baseline, and 10 and 24 weeks post-
randomisation. The primary outcome measure was self-reported cognitive impairment, 
assessed with the British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI). Secondary 
outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia symptoms, cognitive failures, 
fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.  
 
Results: 410 participants with insomnia were recruited and assigned to dCBT (N = 205) or 
wait-list control (N = 205). At 10 weeks post-randomisation the estimated adjusted mean 
difference for the BC-CCI was -3.03 [95% CI: -3.60,-2.47; p<.0001, d = -0.86], indicating that 
participants in the dCBT group reported less cognitive impairment than the control group. 
These effects were maintained at 24 weeks (d = -0.96) and were mediated, in part, via 
reductions in insomnia severity and increased sleep efficiency. Treatment effects in favour of 
dCBT, at both 10 and 24 weeks, were found for insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, cognitive 
failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. We found no between-group 
differences on objective tests of cognitive performance.

Statement of significance 
 
We conducted the first study to investigate the effects of CBT, delivered via digital 
technology, on subjective and objective cognitive function in people with both insomnia and 
cognitive complaints. We found that CBT improves self-reported cognitive impairment 
relative to a waitlist control group at both post-treatment and 6 months follow-up, and that 
such differences are mediated in part via reduction in insomnia symptoms. We found no 
benefit of CBT on objective cognitive performance measured by computerised tasks.

Introduction 
 
Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and second-most prevalent psychiatric 
disorder in Europe1,2. People with insomnia report significant impairments to quality of life3 
and cite cognitive impairment as one of the chief consequences of sleep disruption4. Self-
reported cognitive impairment manifests as difficulties with concentration, memory, attention 
and decision-making. While the literature on objective cognitive performance (assessed via 
neuropsychological tasks) is characterised by conflicting findings5-7, meta-analyses reveal 
small-to-moderate deficits in working memory, inhibitory control, episodic memory and 
problem-solving8,9. More recent studies suggest that complex attention may be particularly 
affected10. Both objective and self-reported cognitive impairment may explain, at least in 
part, reduced work productivity and increased accident risk in those with insomnia11,12.  
 
Sleep is known to play a central role in brain plasticity, memory consolidation and optimal 
cognitive engagement13. Insomnia, therefore, is proposed to lead to impairment in cognition 
through its adverse effects on brain structure and function14. Indeed, insomnia is an 
independent risk-factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease15,16, and may 
contribute to cognitive impairment observed in other highly co-morbid neuropsychiatric 
disorders17.   
 
Rescue of self-reported cognitive impairment through treatment is clearly important to 
patients4 but to date few studies have assessed cognitive function in trials of cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT), the recommended first-line treatment. A recent review of this 
small literature18 found that studies 1) assessed self-reported cognitive impairment using 
low-resolution questionnaire items; 2) rarely included objective performance measures of 
cognitive function; 3) evaluated cognitive function as secondary or exploratory outcomes;

and 4) often recruited small samples, with potentially confounding co-morbidities. The effect 
of CBT on cognitive function remains largely uncharacterized in adequately-designed 
studies. The present study, therefore, was specifically designed to examine the potential 
impact of an established digital CBT programme for insomnia (dCBT), relative to waitlist-
control (WLC), upon both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive 
performance. We also aimed to determine whether change in insomnia symptoms mediates 
change in cognitive outcomes.      
 
The primary hypothesis for the trial was: 
1. dCBT will reduce self-reported cognitive impairment at the end of treatment 
(10 weeks) relative to WLC 
 
The secondary hypotheses were: 
2. dCBT will reduce self-reported cognitive impairment at follow-up (24 weeks) 
relative to WLC 
3. dCBT will improve objective cognitive performance (in the following domains: 
simple attention, visual attention, episodic memory, working memory, and 
complex processing speed), relative to WLC (10 and 24 weeks) 
4. dCBT will reduce insomnia severity and improve sleep efficiency relative to 
WLC (10 and 24 weeks) 
5. Change in insomnia severity and sleep efficiency at week 10 will mediate 
change in self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive 
performance at week 24

6. dCBT will lead to improvements in fatigue, sleepiness, self-reported cognitive 
failures, depression and anxiety, relative to WLC (weeks 10 and 24) 
 
Methods 
Study Design 
The DISCO [Defining the Impact of Sleep improvement on Cognitive Outcomes] study was 
an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of dCBT versus WLC. Participants 
meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder were recruited from the community and 
screened, consented, assessed and randomised on a 1:1 basis to intervention or control 
using the online platform, Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com). Participants in the intervention arm 
received access to the dCBT programme, Sleepio (www.sleepio.com)19, while the WLC 
group received access to the same programme on completion of study follow-up (24 weeks). 
The study was conducted in the UK and approved by the University of Oxford Medical 
Sciences Inter-divisional Research Ethics Committee (R46116/RE001). The trial was 
prospectively registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN89237370) and the trial protocol 
published20.  
      
Participants 
We aimed to recruit 404 participants and achieved a final sample size of 410 (205 in each 
arm). Participants were recruited from the community through multiple channels; for 
example, the study web-link was sent to contact lists of people who had previously 
expressed an interest in taking part in sleep research, and advertised on websites and social 
media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Inclusion criteria were: 1) aged 25 years and 
over; 2) meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder according to the Sleep Condition 
Indicator21; 3) report difficulties with concentration or memory22; 4) have reliable internet

access; 5) read and understand English; and 6) currently reside in the United Kingdom. 
Exclusion criteria were: a) screen positive for or report diagnosis of additional sleep 
disorder23; b) report a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, dementia or neurological 
condition; c) take prescribed sleep medication on >2 nights in the past two weeks; d) 
currently receiving psychological treatment for insomnia; e) report a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; f) report suicidal ideation with intent24; g) planned major 
surgery; h) life expectancy < 6 months; and i) habitual night, evening, or rotating shift-work. 
Participants with other mental and physical health problems, or receiving other types of 
treatments, were eligible to take part.  
 
Randomisation and Masking 
Simple randomisation with an allocation ratio of 1:1 was carried out using the randomisation 
function within Qualtrics Survey Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA) on completion of 
baseline measures. The research team therefore had no access to future allocations and 
were unable to influence randomisation. Other than the trial coordinator, who emailed 
participants their allocation, the research team remained blind to allocation. Contact between 
trial coordinator and participants was limited to standardised information, detailing 
instructions for dCBT access and completion of assessments, and did not cover therapy 
content or support. 
 
Procedures 
dCBT was delivered via the Sleepio programme, the efficacy of which has been established 
in several RCTs19,25,26. Detailed information is available elsewhere19 but in brief, intervention 
ingredients, covering key cognitive and behavioural strategies, are introduced by an 
animated virtual therapist in a personalized but automated manner over six 15-20 minute

sessions. Participants also have access to a library of sleep-related articles and online 
community forum, and can participate in weekly live discussions with a sleep expert.  
 
Participants randomised to the wait-list control arm were informed that they would be 
provided with access to dCBT at the end of the study (24 week follow-up). For both arms 
there was no restriction on what treatments or support participants could access during the 
trial, for sleep or any other health problem. 
 
Outcomes 
Demographic data were collected at baseline. Major assessments of primary and secondary 
outcomes were conducted at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks post-randomisation) and 
follow-up (24 weeks post-randomisation). Participants received vouchers for completion of 
assessments (£5 for baseline; £10 for post-treatment; £15 for follow-up).    
 
The primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, was assessed with the British 
Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI27), a six-item questionnaire assessing 
perceived cognitive problems in the past 7 days. Items are scored on a 0-3 scale (range = 0-
18) and probe difficulties with concentration, memory, expressing thoughts, word-finding, 
slow thinking speed and problem-solving. Higher scores indicate greater perceived cognitive 
impairment.  
 
Secondary outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia severity, sleep 
efficiency, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.

Cognitive performance was assessed via web-based test battery. The battery was 
developed by the UK Biobank Cognitive Psychology Sub-Group for Cognitive Assessments 
and comprised 6 tasks. Participants were advised to complete the tasks in a distraction-free 
environment and, where possible, at the same clock-time (across assessments), using the 
same device (across assessments). Snap task (simple attention): In this task, two cards 
(matching or non-matching) appear side-by-side on the screen. Participants are instructed to 
respond as quickly as possible when they see two matching cards, and withhold responses 
to non-matching cards (dependent variable: mean RT [msec] for correct responses on 
matching trials). Trail making task (visual search, motor speed, mental flexibility): In the first 
part of this task (TRAILS-A) participants are required to join numbered circles in sequential 
order (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and number of errors). In part b 
(TRAILS-B) participants are asked to join together numbered circles and lettered circles in 
sequential order, shifting between sets (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and 
number of errors). Reverse digit span task (working memory): In this task participants are 
presented with a series of numbers on the screen, increasing in string length across trials. 
Number strings disappear and participants are asked to insert the number string in reverse 
order using a mouse-click keypad (dependent variable: longest correct string of numbers). 
Pairs matching task (episodic memory): In this task 6 pairs of cards (level 1, 3x4 matrix) or 8 
pairs of cards (level 2, 4x4 matrix) are flashed on the screen and then disappear. 
Participants are asked to remember their location and subsequently identify matching pairs 
of cards (dependent variable: number of errors when matching pairs for levels 1 and 2). 
Progression to level 2 is contingent on achieving ≤ 1 error on level 1. Symbol-digit 
substitution task (complex processing speed): In this task participants are asked to match a 
series of symbols to digits (dependent variable: number of correct matches in a 1-minute 
interval).

Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)28 and through 
calculation of sleep efficiency (%; derived from three items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index, PSQI29). Fatigue was measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI30), 
which comprises five sub-scales covering general, physical and mental fatigue, and reduced 
motivation and reduced activity; sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS31); everyday failures in perception, memory and motor function were measured 
with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ32); depression was measured with Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-933); and anxiety was measured using two items from the 
General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-234). 
 
We report four outcomes beyond those that were pre-registered. We measured groups on 
the use of prescribed sleep medication and non-prescription sleep remedies at baseline, 10 
and 24 weeks. Participants were asked to indicate how many nights in the last two weeks 
have you taken…(1) sleeping pills prescribed by your doctor; and (2) non-prescription sleep 
remedies. The cognitive test battery also included a test of reasoning (fluid intelligence task) 
at baseline, 10 and 24 weeks, where participants were presented with a series of problem-
solving questions (dependent variable: total number of correct answers in 2-minute period). 
We measured proportion meeting ‘caseness’ for depression (defined as PHQ ≥10) at 
baseline, 10 and 24 weeks.             
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded if the research team were made aware of 
them, and were defined as death, suicide attempt, admission to hospital, or formal 
complaints about the dCBT intervention. We collected information on the following pre-
defined adverse effects at 10 weeks using a standardised scale35: low mood, fatigue and/or 
exhaustion, extreme sleepiness, feeling agitated, bodily pain, headache and/or migraine,

euphoria and/or intense increase in mood, reduced motivation and/or energy, changes in 
hunger and/or appetite, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling irritable.  
 
Statistical analysis 
The study was powered at 90% to detect a minimum standardised effect size of 0.42 at post-
treatment (week 10) at a 5% level of significance, accounting for 40% attrition from baseline.  
 
Analyses followed intention to treat (ITT) principles and are reported according to the 
CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological interventions36. All analysis was conducted 
by the trial statisticians as partially blind (groups labelled A/B until analysis complete) using 
Stata version 14 (StataCorp). Summary statistics (means and standard deviations for 
continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical variables) are 
presented by randomised group without testing for baseline differences. 
 
A linear mixed effects model was estimated using maximum likelihood for the primary 
outcome of self-reported cognitive impairment, measured by the BC-CCI. The outcomes at 
10 and 24 weeks were included as the response. The baseline score was included as a 
covariate in the model along with time point (10 or 24 weeks), randomised group (dCBTi or 
WLC), and a patient specific random intercept to account for repeated measures. An 
interaction between time point and randomised group was included to estimate the treatment 
effect - the mean difference in scores between the dCBT group and the WLC group - 
separately at each time point. Of primary interest is the treatment effect at 10 weeks. 95% 
confidence intervals and two-sided p-values (significance level of ≤ .05) are reported with 
estimated effects. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals where there was 
evidence of heteroscedasticity. Cohen’s d statistics were calculated as the adjusted

treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation of the BC-CCI for the combined 
treatment groups. Unadjusted means by the two randomised groups are also reported. 
Secondary outcomes were analysed in the same way. For binary secondary outcomes, for 
which a linear model was not deemed appropriate, a logistic mixed model was estimated. 
Missing outcomes were assumed to be missing at random, conditional on the covariates in 
the model. Moderation of the cognitive functioning outcomes (BC-CCI, cognitive test battery) 
was assessed by including age at baseline in a three-way interaction in the linear mixed 
models. This enabled estimation of the difference in treatment effect associated with an 
increase in 1 year of age at both 10 and 24 weeks.    
 
For cognitive variables showing a treatment effect at 24 weeks, causal mediation methods 
were used to investigate if changes in these outcomes at 24 weeks were mediated by 
changes in insomnia severity and sleep efficiency, respectively, at 10 weeks. Parametric 
regression models adjusting for the mediator measure at 10 weeks were used to test for the 
direct effect of the intervention on the outcome at 24 weeks. The indirect effect was 
estimated by multiplying the effect of the intervention on the mediator at 10 weeks and the 
effect of the mediator at 10 weeks on the outcome at 24 weeks, and bootstrapping was used 
to produce standard errors for the direct and indirect effects. Adjustment was made for 
baseline measures of the mediator and the outcome.  
 
Differences in the frequency of self-reported adverse effects at 10 weeks were calculated 
and compared using chi-squared tests. The total number of adverse effects was also 
compared in a Mann-Whitney test.

No adjustment was made for multiple testing for the analyses performed on the primary and 
secondary outcomes as these hypotheses are pre-specified, correlated and related to each 
other37.  
 
Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of the primary outcome analysis to different 
assumptions regarding departures from randomisation policies and missing data. A pattern 
mixture model was applied to the data which estimates the treatment effect under scenarios 
where the missing outcomes at 10 weeks are imputed as being higher or lower than the 
observed mean outcome. Additionally, it was assessed whether including baseline variables 
associated with missingness of the primary outcome at 10 weeks in the main analysis model 
changed the estimated treatment effect of the intervention on the primary outcome.

Results 
Recruitment commenced 18th October, 2016 and stopped on the 21st March, 2017 after the 
planned sample size was achieved. 2947 individuals were screened online; 509 were 
deemed eligible, while 410 participants completed baseline and were subsequently 
randomised (205 in each arm). Principal reasons for exclusion were not meeting insomnia 
criteria, shift work, possible sleep apnoea and possible restless legs syndrome (see Figure 
1). Retention was 82% at 10 weeks and 74% at 24 weeks, and differed by group, with the

dCBT group less likely to provide outcome data than control (at 10 weeks: 76% for dCBT vs. 
88% for control/ at 24 weeks: 66% for dCBT vs. 81% in control). An administrative error 
meant that 43 participants (n=28 dCBT, n=15 WLC), who did not complete outcome 
assessments at 10 weeks, were not sent a follow-up invitation at 24 weeks. In the dCBT 
arm, 60% of participants completed all 6 online treatment sessions, 73% completed ≥ 3 
sessions, while 17% did not access the intervention at all.  
 
[INSERT FIGURE 1: TRIAL FLOW] 
 
The sample was predominately in middle-age (52.4 yrs, SD = 11.5; range 26-82), of white 
ethnic background (98%), comprised of females (87%), and the majority were university-
educated (54%; see Table 1). Consistent with inclusion criteria, insomnia severity scores 
(ISI) were in the clinical range (mean = 18.2, SD = 3.7; see Table 2), and the majority of 
participants (62%) met ‘caseness’ for depression on the PHQ-9 (score of ≥10). At baseline, 
only 17% of the sample progressed to level 2 on the pairs-matching task so we did not 
analyse this variable as an outcome at 10 and 24 weeks.

see Table 3). These large treatment effects were maintained at 24 weeks [estimated 
adjusted mean difference = -3.41, 95% CI: -4.06,-2.76; p<.0001, d = -0.96], with the dCBT 
group (unadjusted mean = 5.51, SD = 3.69) reporting less cognitive impairment than the 
control group (8.98, SD = 4.23). Effects were robust across sensitivity analyses investigating 
assumptions regarding missingness mechanisms for the outcome (see Supplementary 
Information). 
 
 [INSERT TABLES 3 & 4 – SECONDARY OUTCOMES] 
 
Large treatment effects were observed for insomnia severity (ISI) at 10 weeks (d = -1.57) 
and 24 weeks (d = -1.60), and for sleep efficiency at 10 weeks (d = 0.91) and 24 weeks (d = 
0.72), with the dCBT group reporting less insomnia symptoms and higher sleep efficiency 
scores (Table 3). 
 
For objective cognitive performance, there were no significant group differences at 10 or 24 
weeks, on any of the performance tests (d range = -0.09 to 0.11; see Table 4). 
 
Treatment effects were observed for all five subscales (and total score) of the 
multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), at both 10 weeks (d range = -0.34 to - 0.70) and 24 
weeks (d range = -0.42 to -0.76; see Table 3), with the dCBT group reporting lower levels of 
fatigue. Similarly, the dCBT group reported significantly lower levels of sleepiness (ESS) at 
10 weeks (d = -0.42) and 24 weeks (d = -0.44). Consistent with the primary outcome, large 
treatment effects were found for self-reported cognitive failures (CFQ), with significantly

lower values in the dCBT group compared to control at 10 weeks (d = -0.83) and 24 weeks 
(d = -0.98). 
 
At both 10 and 24 weeks dCBT was associated with less depressive symptoms compared to 
the control group (d = -0.68 and d = -0.64, respectively). Exploratory analyses, focusing on 
depression ‘caseness’ (defined as PHQ9 score ≥10), found a reduced likelihood of meeting 
‘caseness’ in the dCBT group at both 10 weeks (adjusted risk ratio = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21, 
0.54) and 24 weeks (adjusted risk ratio=0.49, 95% CI: 0.28,0.70). For anxiety symptoms, 
dCBT was associated with significantly lower scores on the GAD-2 at 10 weeks (d = -0.39) 
and 24 weeks (d = -0.37). 
 
Groups did not differ with respect to proportion using prescribed sleep medication (defined 
as ≥1 night in the past 14 days) at 10 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.13,1.98] 
or 24 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.07,1.79]. Compared to the control group, 
significantly fewer participants in the dCBT arm reported using non-prescription sleep 
remedies (defined as ≥1 night in the past 14 days) at both 10 [adjusted odds ratio = 0.20, 
95% CI: 0.06,0.66] and 24 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03,0.39].  
 
We tested the extent to which treatment effects for cognitive variables at 24 weeks were 
mediated by change in insomnia symptoms and sleep efficiency at 10 weeks. Since there 
were no group differences on the objective cognitive tests we only assessed mediation for 
self-reported cognitive impairment (BC-CCI). The mediators (ISI scores and sleep efficiency) 
showed large treatment effects at 10 weeks (see Table 3). The proportion of the effect of the 
intervention on BC-CCI at 24 weeks that was mediated by change in sleep efficiency was

29.5% (see Table 5). The proportion of the effect of the intervention on BC-CCI at 24 weeks 
that was mediated by change in insomnia severity (ISI) was 60.4%.   
 
[INSERT TABLE 5 – MEDIATION] 
 
There was no evidence of moderation by age for the BC-CCI at 10 or 24 weeks, or for any 
cognitive task at 10 weeks (see Table S3). There was some evidence of moderation for two 
of the cognitive tasks at 24 weeks, although direction was not consistent. One task (simple 
attention) showed magnification of group differences with increasing age, while the other 
(episodic memory) showed attenuation. None of these effects were statistically significant 
after conservative adjustment for multiple testing. 
 
There were no reported SAEs. For the 12 pre-specified adverse effects, there were no 
statistically significant group differences and the total number of endorsed adverse effects 
was similar in both arms (Table S4). 
 
Discussion 
Uptake of the dCBT intervention was high and, similar to previous trials26,38, led to large 
reductions in insomnia severity, indexed via sleep efficiency and global ratings of insomnia 
symptoms. These sleep-related changes were accompanied by less frequent use of non-
prescription sleep remedies in the dCBT arm versus control. We observed large treatment 
effects in favour of dCBT for our primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, at 
both post-treatment (d = -0.86) and follow-up (d = -0.96). Group differences in self-reported 
cognitive impairment at follow-up were mediated, in part, by change in sleep efficiency and

global insomnia severity ratings at 10 weeks, suggesting a potential causal pathway to 
improved cognitive function via reduction in insomnia symptoms. Our secondary 
questionnaire measures (cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety) similarly 
showed treatment effects in favour of dCBT at both post-treatment and follow-up. In contrast, 
we did not observe treatment effects on any of our objective cognitive tests (see Figure 2). 
 
[INSERT FIGURE 2 – FOREST PLOT] 
 
This is the first trial to assess self-reported cognitive impairment as a primary outcome post-
dCBT for insomnia. We recruited insomnia participants with cognitive complaints at baseline, 
reflecting perceived difficulty with memory and/or concentration. Baseline scores on the BC-
CCI in our sample exceeded those observed in patients with major depression27, while 
scores on the CFQ (everyday cognitive failures) were higher than those found in patients 
with multiple sclerosis39. Large improvements on both the BC-CCI and CFQ, and medium-to-
large improvements on the mental fatigue sub-scale of the MFI, suggest dCBT effectively 
reduces perceived cognitive impairment; and these benefits are sustained at 6 months 
follow-up. This is an important finding because perceived cognitive impairment is one of the 
most salient concerns for patients with chronic insomnia, impacting upon a range of quality 
of life domains, including work performance and safety12,40. Further research is needed to 
determine whether the management of insomnia in the context of specific neurological and 
psychiatric conditions has the potential to improve self-reported cognitive and functional 
outcomes. 
 
Although robust effects were observed in the subjective domain we found no evidence that 
dCBT engenders change in cognitive performance indexed via computerised tasks.

Divergent findings for subjective and objective cognitive function are common across a 
range of neuropsychiatric disorders, with reported impairment often not supported by task 
performance41,42. Subjective reports and task performance may probe different aspects of 
cognitive health43. It is important to note that subjective cognitive complaints, even in the 
absence of objective task-related impairment, have been associated with increased amyloid-
β deposition, evolution of objective impairment over time, and subsequent dementia 
diagnosis44,45. While it is possible that our participants did not have objective cognitive 
impairment at baseline - and, therefore, limited capacity for change - we attempted to 
mitigate this by recruiting participants with persistent insomnia disorder plus cognitive 
complaints, a group more likely to display performance deficits46. Nevertheless, without a 
control group of normal sleepers (or normative data for comparison) we cannot confirm the 
presence of baseline impairment in objective cognitive performance. Below we offer several 
(non-exclusive) explanations for the null findings. 
 
Our tasks map onto widely used neuropsychological measures that have shown sensitivity to 
insomnia (versus controls) in previous studies9,47,48, but they were relatively simple, brief, 
and may not unmask subtle cognitive deficits49. For example, several studies reveal 
impairment (only) when cognitive load is high, particularly for the domain of attention10,50. A 
related point is that tests were performed outside of the laboratory, over the internet, and at 
a time convenient for participants. While we advised participants to maintain standard testing 
conditions (i.e. same device, clock-time, and distraction-free environment) across 
assessment points, variability introduced by the testing environment may have further 
reduced signal-to-noise ratio.  
 
At least seven RCTs38,51-55 have assessed the effect of CBT on objective cognitive 
performance in adult insomnia samples, four of which (including the present study) find no

evidence of benefit38,54,55. It is important to note that our study is the largest to date to test 
cognitive performance through objective computerised tasks, with the power to detect even 
modest effects. Impairments, if they reliably exist, may be trait-like and unresponsive to CBT. 
Alternatively, CBT may not sufficiently modify sleep physiology in order to bring about 
improvements in cognitive performance, consistent with findings from a recent meta-
analysis56. These possibilities require dedicated interrogation in future studies.  
   
Limitations of this work should be considered. We employed a waitlist control arm, which 
may slightly inflate effect size differences compared to a minimally active arm (e.g., sleep 
hygiene education), or behavioral placebo. Nevertheless, several studies show that the 
dCBT programme used in the present study convincingly out-performs sleep hygiene26 and 
placebo19 with respect to both sleep and daytime outcomes. Our sample was recruited 
online and may not be representative of treatment-seeking patients in clinical practice. For 
example, our sample was well-educated, with the majority holding a university degree, and 
the vast majority (87%) were female. We required participants to report cognitive complaints 
to enter the trial, which may have resulted in an over-representation of participants 
concerned about the effects of sleep disruption on cognitive function. However, research 
shows that perceived cognitive impairment is one of the most common consequences of 
insomnia.4 We also excluded frequent users of hypnotics at baseline in order to limit 
confounding effects on our cognitive dependent measures; the extent to which our findings 
apply to those who regularly take sleep medication requires testing in future studies. Our 
sample included people from a broad age range (26-82 years), potentially introducing 
marked between-subject variability in the nature of sleep disruption, cognitive function and 
health (and their interaction). However, our aim was to conduct a randomised trial in a large 
sample of people with insomnia and perceived cognitive impairment; and we found no clear 
pattern of moderation by age. A key strength of our study is inclusion of people with common 
mental and physical health problems. For example, the majority of our sample met clinical

cut-offs for depression at baseline. Participants treated with dCBT were 62% less likely to 
meet ‘caseness’ at post-treatment, and 51% less likely at follow-up, relative to control. These 
results are consistent with emerging evidence showing that CBT for insomnia may exert anti-
depressant effects57. Improvement in mood may represent an additional mechanistic 
pathway to restoration of cognitive function. Future study designs, capable of disentangling 
temporal changes in sleep, mood, and cognitive function, should be considered. A final point 
is that given the online nature of our trial we were not able to record sleep physiology and 
therefore the sleep profile of our sample is unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that 
insomnia disorder in combination with objective short sleep duration may have the most 
pronounced effects on cognitive performance8,58. Future stratification based on objective 
sleep parameters will help determine whether insomnia phenotypes have differential 
response on cognitive outcomes. 
 
In conclusion our study finds that dCBT robustly improves self-reported cognitive impairment 
and that such improvements may operate via increased sleep efficiency and reduced 
insomnia severity. We found no evidence that dCBT improves objective cognitive 
performance relative to control, across a range of tasks and domains. The field requires 
rigorously-designed studies, incorporating sensitive measures of performance and sleep 
physiology in order to further delineate the effects of insomnia treatment on cognitive health.
