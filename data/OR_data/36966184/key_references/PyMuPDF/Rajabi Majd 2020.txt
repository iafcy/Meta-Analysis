Abstract
Background: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing insomnia.
Objective: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT],
theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among
insomnia patients.
Methods: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly
assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n=156) or a control group that received
only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months
postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes
toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring,
behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in
outcomes between the two groups and across time.
Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months,
and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral
control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of
the intervention on outcomes.
Conclusions: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients.

Introduction
Sleep and Insomnia
Inadequate sleep and sleep disorders are among the most
frequent problems worldwide [1]. Insomnia is the most common
sleep disorder affecting approximately one-third of the general
population [2]. It can have negative consequences on one or
several spheres in daily life: psychosocial (eg, depression,
daytime dysfunction, reduced quality of life), occupational
functioning (eg, job absence, reduced ability to do tasks, poor
job satisfaction, and inappropriate decisions and choices), or
elevated burden to society (eg, increased health costs, reduced
job productivity) [3-5]. Insomnia is described as a dissatisfying
sleep associated with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep
or early morning awakening despite good opportunities for sleep
leading to various daytime symptoms.
Introducing good sleep hygiene practices is often one of the
first steps in treating insomnia. Sleep hygiene refers to a variety
of behaviors that promote sleep quality [6]. Sleep promoting
behaviors include avoiding going to bed hungry or thirsty,
avoiding stress and anxiety, avoiding physical activity before
going to bed, preparing a bedroom that provides a relaxed
environment, and limiting activities in the bedroom to sleep and
sexual activities [7]. However, behavioral modifications to
improve sleep quality can be hard to achieve; many patients
with insomnia report they have tried to modify their poor sleep
habits without any effect. Dysfunctional or unrealistic sleep
expectations and excessive worrying over sleep loss appear to
contribute to poor sleep hygiene. For instance, a Japanese study
found that sleep hygiene behaviors are confounded by sleep
beliefs [8]. Additionally, due to the rise of mobile technologies,
many individuals now use electronic devices in bed, and this
may restrict individuals with insomnia from practicing good
sleep hygiene (eg, being too excited to sleep due to the use of
media) [9]. Consequently, interventions are needed to help
individuals with insomnia actually practice sleep hygiene.
Simply providing intervention on sleep hygiene behaviors for
individuals with insomnia is insufficient. A review paper of
qualitative studies showed that individuals suffering from
insomnia observe the inefficiency of sleep hygiene education
delivered by health care providers. In particular, health care
providers are found to have limited knowledge in sleep hygiene
(ie, they only know a few basic principles), and most providers
are unable to incorporate theoretical models or techniques to
deliver sleep hygiene [10]. Therefore, interventions concerning
sleep hygiene behaviors should incorporate robust and effective
theoretical models. Indeed, in a systematic review and
meta-analysis, Webb et al [11] found that using theories as a
framework in designing online interventions led to a substantial
effect on outcome variables. Theoretical models can help to
select the components of the intervention and help in evaluation
of the intervention’s impact [12-22]. By designing interventions
based on empirically derived theoretical principles, researchers
can identify the most powerful determinants of a given construct
[23]. Despite evidence-based recommendations that support the
utility of theory-based approaches for designing interventions
[21], very few studies have considered this aspect [22,24].
Therefore, studies using theory to support treatment efficacy
are much needed.
There are four empirically validated theoretical models
(cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior
[TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control
theory [CT]) that may assist individuals with insomnia in
engaging good sleep hygiene.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
CBT focuses on the effect of individuals’beliefs, thoughts, and
attitudes on their feelings and behaviors. The purpose of CBT
is to educate individuals on how to proactively deal with
problems or events during their lives [25]. CBT for insomnia
(CBT-I) relies on the general principles of CBT and is designed
to relieve insomnia symptoms [26]. The efficacy of CBT-I has
been demonstrated in studies [27,28], and a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) found that CBT-I outperformed
medication in the long run [28]. The principles of CBT are
presented to insomnia patients as a set of scientific methods
with assessed efficacy [29]. The principles of CBT-I include
behavioral modifications such as stimulus control, sleep
restriction, sleep hygiene, relaxation training, and cognitive
therapy. The goal is to adjust sleeping habits using cognitive
strategies to improve thoughts, feelings, and expectations
concerning sleep [30,31]. CBT-I can be held in group, individual
face-to-face, or online (eg, app-based) sessions based on the
therapist’s priority, patient’s progress, or both [32]. Although
the efficacy of online CBT-I has been well established for
general populations [25], there is a lack of understanding of
how the efficacy of online CBT-I is explained by psychological
mechanisms [33,34]. Therefore, this study incorporated CBT-I
techniques using an app and investigated the underlying
psychological mechanisms in the effectiveness of CBT-I, for
which evidence has been extensively presented in the literature
[26,28-33].
Theory of Planned Behavior
TPB is one of the most widely applied sociocognitive theories.
According to TPB, behavioral intention—an individual’s
expression of their decisions to perform or not perform a specific
behavior—is the most proximal determinant of an individual’s
behavior. Behavioral intention, in turn, is determined by three
constructs: attitudes toward the behavior (ie, whether an
individual prefers or values the specific behavior), subjective
norms (ie, the opinions of the individual’s significant others on
the specific behavior), and perceived behavioral control (ie,
how confident the individual feels in performing the specific
behavior) [35]. The TPB has been used for understanding a
variety of behaviors including sleep hygiene behaviors [7,36-38].
Based on TPB, health care providers may try to improve the
attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control of
individuals on their sleep hygiene behaviors. Subsequently, the
individual may have elevated intention to practice good sleep
hygiene.
Health Action Process Approach
Despite the success of TPB, there is evidence that intentions do
not necessarily translate into actual behavior (ie, there is an
intention-behavior gap) [39]. For this reason, HAPA proposes
J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 4 | e15841 | p. 2

a series of volitional, or postintentional, processes that aim to
bridge the intention-behavior gap. HAPA focuses more on
postintentional processes than TPB. The volitional phase
specifies both action planning and coping planning as mediators
of the intention-behavior relationship. Action planning indicates
how individuals move their intention into action (in this case,
sleep hygiene behaviors). More specifically, individuals make
plans to practice their sleep hygiene behavior. Coping planning
indicates how individuals design any plan to overcome the
possible obstacles in the intended behavior (again in this case,
sleep hygiene). More specifically, individuals make plans to
avoid any potential obstructions that hinder their sleep hygiene
behaviors [38]. Using action and coping planning, individuals
can better equip their intention to initiate sleep hygiene
behaviors. Health care providers may assist individuals with
insomnia to facilitate action and coping plans to ensure that
individuals’ sleep hygiene behaviors can be implemented and
actualized.
Control Theory
CT explains self-regulation systems, which are critical elements
in analyzing human behaviors. The fundamental idea of CT is
the negative feedback loop, and a behavior is performed when
the discrepancy between current state (eg, drink a cup of tea
before sleep) and reference value (eg, should not drink caffeine
prior to sleep) is observed by individuals [40]. In order to assess
the discrepancy, the technique of self-monitoring can be
incorporated to the theoretical models mentioned above (CBT,
TPB, and HAPA) to enhance the behavioral intention in
performing sleep hygiene behaviors.
Related Work on App
The insomnia intervention was delivered via a smartphone app
to make it available and accessible to meet population needs;
app-based interventions overcome some of the pragmatic
problems of the face-to-face therapy, including time limitations
and high costs [41,42]. Indeed, app-based programs have been
developed with highly personalized, tailored, and fully
automated features [43-45]. In relation to exposure of in-person
contact, a CBT-I app can be used as supplementary support to
in-person therapy or as a primary intervention for insomnia
through fully automated CBT-I (ie, the therapeutic program can
be offered without any human support) [45]. The app designed
in this study is similar to the CBT-i Coach [46]. More
specifically, the app used in this study was designed to increase
patients’ knowledge and skills using CBT-I (for detailed
information please refer to the app overview section in the
Methods). Both apps attempt to reduce insomnia symptoms.
Although 
the 
CBT-i 
Coach 
includes 
sleep 
hygiene
recommendations in the session, the app used in our study
directly addresses practicing sleep hygiene behaviors.
Specifically, some theoretical constructs (eg, behavior change
techniques [BCTs]) for changing participants’ sleep behaviors
were applied. Also, some techniques derived from behavioral
theories (eg, action planning and coping planning) were used
to help participants achieve behavioral goals [47]. The app used
in this study focuses on changing people’s sleep behaviors
whereas other available sleep apps emphasize sleep mentoring
[44]. Additionally, the apps summarized by Choi et al [44]
generally assess sleep quantitatively (eg, sleep efficacy, sleep
time) rather than taking sleep quality into account.
Study Aims
This study aimed to determine the long-term treatment efficacy
of a theory-based app using CBT, TPB, HAPA, and CT on sleep
hygiene among insomnia patients. The primary evaluation
involved comparing sleep hygiene behaviors and sleep quality
with a control group that received patient education (PE).
Methods
Design
A 2-arm single-blind parallel-group RCT was launched to
compare CBT-I and PE groups via an app over a 6-month
period. Potential participants were included after initial
screening and signing informed consent forms. The flowchart
of the study design is shown in Figure 1. Primary and secondary
outcomes were assessed online at baseline, 1 month
postintervention, 3 months postintervention, and 6 months
postintervention.

Setting, Participants, and Recruitment
This Iranian-based study was advertised using brochures and
posters at 3 universities, 5 colleges, and 10 general physicians’
offices as well as on social media. Interested participants were
asked to access an online platform specifically designed for the
study to complete a screening questionnaire assessing insomnia
symptoms comprising the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), sleep
characteristics, and medical history as well as their time spent
on computers and online. If participants met the initial criteria
and expressed interest, a phone appointment was scheduled to
conduct additional eligibility assessments. All telephone
interviews were performed by three research assistants who had
been trained by an experienced sleep medicine specialist during
two 3-hour sessions. The sleep medicine specialist observed
each research assistant during three actual patient encounters.
The sleep medicine specialist and research assistant scored the
patients independently. The scores were then compared to ensure
that data collection procedures were consistent. There was more
than 98% agreement between the sleep medicine specialist and
research assistant in all cases.
Selection Criteria
The inclusion criteria were (1) being age 18 years or older, (2)
having insomnia disorder according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
[48], (3) having an ISI score of 10 or higher [49], (4)
understanding Persian, and (5) having access to a smartphone
and/or desktop computer with internet access.
Participants were excluded if they (1) had an uncontrolled
medical condition that interfered with sleep or required
immediate treatment (eg, obstructive sleep apnea requiring
continuous positive airway pressure treatment), (2) did shift
work, (3) were pregnant, (4) were participating in other research
and/or clinical trials, (5) had received psychotherapy in the past
6 months, (6) had current major depressive disorder based on
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 disorders, (7) had
a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, (8)
showed evidence of alcohol abuse (more than 3 glasses of
alcohol per day at least 21 days a month), (9) misused marijuana
(use more than once per week), (10) appeared suicidal, or (11)
had children aged under 2 years. After baseline assessments,
participants were randomly assigned to a control group receiving

PE or a treatment group receiving CBT-I. Both study groups
had access to their related content on the app.
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size was estimated based on previous studies on
internet-based self-help insomnia interventions with a moderate
effect size [42,50]. Using a 2-tailed test with a small-to-medium
effect size (Cohen d=0.40) and significance level of P=.05, a
total sample size of 266 (ie, 133 per group) had 90% power. To
include an estimated dropout rate of 15%, entire sample size
was increased from 266 to 312 participants (ie, 156 per group).
Randomization and Allocation Procedures
Participants who met the inclusion criteria and signed the
informed consent were randomly assigned to a control group
(PE) or a treatment group (CBT-I) at a 1:1 ratio. Randomization
was performed by an independent researcher via a random list
generated using SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp). Because
blinding participants from treatment condition was impossible,
the study blinded the data analyst using a code system for
treatment condition. Moreover, the data analyst did not have
access to the key document. Participants in both groups received
assistance from a trained research assistant to help them install
and unlock the app. To avoid contamination, participants in the
PE group could not access the CBT-I content, which was locked
using a personal code.
App Overview
The app was designed based on a combination of TPB, HAPA,
and CBT-I [29] and used the self-help concept [19] in order to
treat insomnia. Several BCTs are integrated in the app, including
information about health consequences, information about social
and environmental consequences, habit formation, habit reversal,
pros and cons of performing sleep hygiene behaviors,
reconstructing the physical environment, reconstructing the
social environment, self-monitoring of behavior, action planning,
and problem solving [51]. The intervention contents were
designed across 6 weeks, with exercises and subtutorials
automatically provided each week (Table 1). Detailed
information with screenshots is provided in Multimedia
Appendix 1.
The content of the CBT-I was designed for treating patients
with insomnia individually using weekly sessions, with each
session lasting approximately 1 hour. However, participants
could complete their sessions more quickly (ie, less than 1 hour)
if they improved faster. The content of session 1 was provided
for participants using plain text. For sessions 2 and 3, we used
a variety of relaxation tools via audio guided meditation
exercises as well as images. Session 4 provided correct
information concerning sleep in plain text and tables, addressing
incorrect information about insomnia participants may have
heard. In sessions 5 and 6, plain text and tables were used to
help participants plan their sleep hygiene behaviors. A sleep
diary was used along with the ISI completed by participants to
help them understand their daily sleep improvements.
Development of the current app is still at an early stage, and
customizing content to suit individual specific situations is under
consideration for an updated version of the app. The current
version does not have individually tailored content.
Access to the app content was provided to the participants each
week; participants could not view the app content for weeks 2
through 6 (ie, sessions 2-6) when they were in week 1 of the
intervention, but as participants continued, previous sessions
remained unlocked. Every week, there was homework or an
exercise, and participants were encouraged to complete it
weekly. The content in the next session was opened the
following week. Most of the participants used the app as
recommended, and a reminder text message was sent to those
who did not open the session content on time.

reduce time in bed, get up at the same time every day, go to bed
only if sleepy, and do not stay in bed unless asleep; week 4),
and changing lifestyles to promote sleep health (week 5). The
information was presented as separate content from the CBT-I

in the app. This weekly information was unlocked for
participants on a weekly basis. Participants in the PE group
were informed that they could access the CBT-I content on the
app at the end of the study (6 months after completing the
intervention).
Measures
All participants completed a sociodemographic profile
questionnaire (age, gender, educational status, occupational
status) at the baseline assessment and primary and secondary
outcomes were assessed. The complete measures used to assess
primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Multimedia
Appendix 2.
Primary Outcomes
Sleep Hygiene Behavior
Sleep hygiene behavior was assessed using three items. The
participants were asked to report how many days they had good
sleep hygiene behavior over the past week (How many days did
you make your bedroom restful over the past week?), whether
they avoided going to bed feeling hungry or thirsty, and whether
they avoided anxiety and stress-provoking activity before bed.
Participants were asked to respond on an 8-point scale ranging
from 0 to 7. The internal consistency of the three items was
found to be acceptable in a previous study (α=.78) [38].
Insomnia Severity Index
The ISI is a 7-item self-report scale that assesses participant
level of insomnia over the past 2 weeks. All items are rated on
a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0=no problem to 4=very
severe problem. A total score is generated by summing all 7
items ranging from 0-28 with 5 subscores: 0-7 (absence of
insomnia), 8-14 (subthreshold insomnia), 15-21 (moderate
insomnia), and 22-28 (severe insomnia). The ISI has been
translated into Persian, and its psychometric properties have
been documented among Iranian adults [52].
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a subjective
measure of sleep quality and disturbances over the past month
that contains 19 items grouped into 7 separate component scores:
subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual
sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication,
and daytime dysfunction. Scores are summed to provide a global
sleep quality score. The Persian version of the PSQI has been
validated and described in detail [53].
Secondary Outcomes
Attitude
Attitude toward good sleep hygiene was assessed using 5-point
evaluative semantic differential scales (eg, “To make my
bedroom/sleep environment restful would be: unpleasant-
pleasant, good-bad, wise-foolish, correct-incorrect, unenjoyable-
enjoyable, satisfying-unsatisfying, useful-useless”). Internal
consistency of this 12-item scale has been found acceptable in
previous studies [24,38].
Perceived Behavioral Control
Perceived behavioral control was assessed using three items
(eg, “I am confident that every day I can prevent
anxiety-provoking activity before bedtime”). All items were
scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1=totally disagree
to 5=totally agree. The scale has been proved internally
consistent in previous studies [24,38].
Behavioral Intention
Behavioral intention was assessed using 6 items (eg, “Over the
next week, I intend to make my bedroom restful”). All items
were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=totally
disagree to 5=totally agree. Internal consistency of this scale
has been found acceptable in previous studies [24,38].
Action Planning
Action planning was assessed using 4 items. The participants
were asked to indicate if they have made a detailed plan
regarding (1) when, (2) where, (3) how, and (4) how often they
will perform sleep hygiene behaviors over the next 6 months.
All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
1=totally disagree to 5=totally agree. The internal consistency
of this scale has been found acceptable in previous studies
[24,38,54].
Coping Planning
Coping planning was assessed using 5 items (eg, “I have made
a detailed plan regarding what to do if something interferes with
my plans”). All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 1=totally disagree to 5=totally agree. Internal
consistency of this scale has been found acceptable in previous
studies [24,38,55].
Self-Monitoring
Self-monitoring was assessed by 3 items (“I keep track of how
much time I spend sleeping,” “I pay attention to how tired or
rested I feel each day,” and “I take care to note the time that I
go to bed and wake each day”). Responses were rated on a scale
ranging from 1=never to 5=always.
Self-Report Behavioral Automaticity Index
The extent to which sleep hygiene behaviors are habitual for an
individual was assessed using the Self-Report Behavioral
Automaticity Index (SRBAI). The SRBAI contains 4 items that
start with the stem “Sleep hygiene behavior is something...”
followed by “I do automatically,” “I do without having to
consciously remember,” “I do without thinking,” and “I start
doing before I realize I’m doing it.” The reliability of the Persian
SRBAI has been reported [56].
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a 14-item scale
that assesses anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) in
patients with both somatic and mental problems. All items were
scored on a 0 to 3 scale with higher score representing higher
levels of anxiety and depression. The Iranian version of the
scale has been validated in different clinical patients [57].

Data Management
All data were collected and stored using the FileMaker Pro 15
(Claris International Inc) database. Participants’ names, phone
numbers, and addresses were recorded. Each participant received
a unique code. All data were password protected and encrypted
to ensure that confidentiality of the data was maintained
throughout the study. The study was monitored (via quality
control and audits) by the Social Determinants of Health
Research Center at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences to
ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable regulations
was maintained and data were collected in a timely, accurate,
and complete manner.
Statistical Methods
All statistical analyses were performed in accordance with
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
guidelines. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed to take
care of attrition. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
the characteristics of the participants. To evaluate the magnitude
of changes in primary and secondary outcomes over time across
the two groups, linear mixed models (PROC MIXED) were
performed controlling for baseline variables and other covariates
that may relate to the outcome. The mixed modeling approach
is a powerful statistical tool to evaluate group differences over
time with unequal numbers of participants at baseline and
follow-up. It is also a helpful way to handle missing data using
full information maximum likelihood estimation. The analysis
incorporated two between-participant effects (between groups
and 
between 
participants 
within 
groups) 
and 
three
within-participant effects (between times, group by time
interactions, and random variation). All P values were 2-sided
and were evaluated as statistically significant at the .05 level.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute Inc).
Ethics and Dissemination
This study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
Qazvin University of Medical Sciences (IR.QUMS.REC.
1396.455) 
and 
is 
registered 
with 
ClinicalTrials.gov
[NCT03605732], last updated July 2018. This study was
performed based on the Helsinki Declaration principles.
Required permissions were obtained from authorities of Qazvin
University of Medical Sciences. After research assistants
expressed objectives and assured participants about the
confidentiality of their data and possibility of withdrawing from
the study, informed consent forms were signed by those
participants willing to participate in this research.
Results
General Use of the App
App engagement was assessed using an online database that
recorded the number of log-ins and the duration of each log-in
for all participants. The results showed that over the 6-month
study period, the mean number of log-ins in both groups was
41.21 (SD 39.50). Participants in the CBT group had a higher
number of log-ins (mean 42.65 [SD 42.58]) as compared with
the PE group (mean 40.93 [SD 45.01]); however, this difference
was not statistically significant (P=.38). Mean length of time
using the app in all participants was 1580 minutes (SD 1460.37).
The participants in the CBT group had significantly longer
duration of app use (mean 1780.34 [SD 1770.07] minutes)
compared with the PE group (mean 1370 [SD 450.01] minutes;
P=.03).
Descriptive Statistics in Demographics, Primary
Outcomes, and Secondary Outcomes
Table 2 shows that both CBT-I and PE groups shared similar
demographic characteristics. Specifically, the mean age of the
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group was 36.21 (SD 5.81) years,
and the mean age of those in the PE was 35.29 (SD 5.76) years.
Slightly less than half of the participants were male in each
group (46.1% [72/156] in the CBT-I group and 42.3% [66/156]
in the PE group).
Table 3 describes the sleep quality (using PSQI), severity of
insomnia (using ISI), sleep hygiene behaviors, and health status
of both groups at baseline and 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month
follow-ups.

Effects of the Intervention on Primary Outcomes
The intervention had promising effects on the three primary
outcomes: sleep quality, severity of insomnia, and sleep hygiene
behaviors. Specifically, sleep quality was improved among
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group compared with those in
the PE at all follow-ups, as suggested by scores on the PSQI
(P<.001 for 1, 3, and 6 months). Similar improvements were
shown in severity of insomnia (ie, significant decrease in the
severity of insomnia among the CBT-I group compared with
those in the PE group at 1, 3, and 6 months following the
intervention, all P values <.001) and sleep hygiene behaviors
(insomnia patients in the CBT-I group significantly engaged in
more good sleep hygiene behaviors than those in the PE group
at 1 [P=.02], 3 [P=.04], and 6 [P=.02] months following the
intervention). Table 4 shows the findings of the linear mixed
models predicting primary outcomes between two groups after
controlling for their age, gender, and education.

Effects of the Intervention on Secondary Outcomes
In terms of secondary outcomes, analyses indicated that
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group had better attitude (P=.03
at 1 month; P=.04 at 3 months; P=.03 at 6 months), stronger
perceived behavioral control (P values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6
months), higher intention (P values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months)
to develop good sleep hygiene behavior, and were more likely
to have formed relevant action and coping plans (P values <.001
at 1, 3, and 6 months; Table 5). Additionally, insomnia patients
in the CBT-I group had higher behavioral automaticity (P values
<.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months), better self-monitoring (P values
≤.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months), and less anxiety (P=.003 at 1
month and P<.001 at both 3 and 6 months), and depression (P
values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months) relative to those in the PE
group (Table 6).

Mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether the
effects of CBT-I on the primary outcome of sleep hygiene
behaviors were mediated by changes in relevant beliefs about
sleep hygiene behaviors as specified by the three proposed
theories (TPB, HAPA, and CT). Regarding sleep hygiene
behaviors at 3 months, only action planning was a significant
mediator (coefficient 1.11; 95% CI 0.54-1.69). Regarding sleep
hygiene behaviors at 6 months, perceived behavioral control
(coefficient 0.44; 95% CI 0.10-0.78), coping planning
(coefficient 0.24; 95% CI 0.12-0.36), self-monitoring
(coefficient 0.58; 95% CI 0.13-1.03), and behavioral
automaticity (coefficient 1.00; 95% CI 0.17-1.83) were
significant mediators (Table 7).

Discussion
Principal Findings
This research found that a theory-based intervention improved
sleep outcomes among insomnia patients in Iran, as evidenced
by improved sleep hygiene behaviors, increased sleep quality,
and decreased insomnia severity. These beneficial effects were
mediated by several changes in the putative determinants of
behavior, including perceived behavioral control in TPB, action
and coping planning in HAPA, and self-monitoring and
behavioral automaticity in CT. Moreover, the entire treatment
effects were guided by CBT (ie, the use of BCTs). Furthermore,
as a consequence of improvements in sleep, positive effects of
CBT-I were demonstrated by reduced anxiety and depression
among insomnia patients. Researchers and practitioners
interested in improving sleep quality, particularly among
insomnia patients, might draw on insights provided by several
components in TPB [7,35-38], HAPA [38,39], and CT [40] in
order to design effective interventions for insomnia patients.
Moreover, use of the CBT-I app may enhance the feasibility of
providing CBT-I treatments incorporating the components in
TPB, HAPA, and CT mentioned above.
The finding that the PE group did not have substantial
improvement could be due to the following barriers. The written
information (1) did not have interactive components, commonly
used in apps, and may not have triggered the motivation of
participants to obtain the information; (2) did not have any
psychological mechanism to support its use whereas the CBT-I
app incorporated and improved psychological components (eg,
attitudes) for participants to actively engage in sleep, and (3)
may have been hard to translate into daily practice for the PE
group. Consequently, use of the PE group as a control is
appropriate because PE only provides passive engagement and
does not have any psychological mechanism to support its use.
On the other hand, the CBT-I app involved active engagement
and included psychological mechanism to support its use.
Apart from illustrating the effectiveness of the CBT-I app, our
findings support the notion that the improvements in sleep
accrued (in part) from changes in several components specified
by TPB (perceived behavioral control), HAPA (action and
coping planning), and CT (self-monitoring and behavioral
automaticity). Therefore, our findings partially support the
notions from previous studies: health care providers may want
to use TPB to effectively understand the performance of sleep
hygiene behaviors [37,38]. Additionally, these findings go
beyond those correlational studies [37,38] and agree with
another RCT study [24] that used theory-based (TPB, HAPA,
and CBT) interventions to improve sleep hygiene behaviors
among adolescents. More specifically, changes in the putative
determinants of action lead to changes in the respective
behaviors (eg, sleep hygiene behaviors, sleep quality, and

severity of insomnia). Consequently, this research provides
experimental support for the combination of TPB, HAPA, CT,
and CBT as a framework for improving sleep among insomnia
patients.
Our results also support the idea that it is important for CBT-I
interventions to incorporate self-regulatory processes such as
those specified in HAPA and CT. More specifically, action
planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral
automaticity were significant mediators in this study.
Interestingly, mediated effects of action planning on sleep
hygiene behaviors were found at 3 months after completing the
CBT-I program but not at 6 months after completing the
program. In contrast, mediated effects of coping planning,
self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity on sleep hygiene
behaviors were observed at 6 months after completing the CBT-I
program but not at 3 months after completing the program.
A possible explanation is the cognitive progress during the
CBT-I program. Insomnia patients first need to generate
effective strategies (ie, using action planning) to assist them in
developing good sleep hygiene behaviors because they do not
have sufficient ability to devise good strategies [24]. Therefore,
action planning was an important mediator for sleep hygiene
behaviors at 3 months. Meanwhile, coping planning,
self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity are not mediators
at this stage because insomnia patients put all their efforts in
action planning and do not have additional efforts to work on
coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity.
In terms of sleep hygiene behaviors at 6 months, insomnia
patients are very likely to have satisfactory capability in action
planning. Therefore, action planning loses its importance as
mediator because insomnia patients can use the good strategies
they have generated. In contrast, insomnia patients need to deal
with all the unforeseen barriers and keep their practice.
Therefore, coping planning (ie, thinking ahead to tackle possible
barriers) [39], self-monitoring (ie, reflection on the difference
between preferred and actual performance) [40], and behavioral
automaticity (ie, developing the behaviors into habitual pattern)
[56] become important mediators at this stage.
This study’s findings on self-regulatory processes also support
those of correlational studies that point to the importance of
self-regulatory processes in predicting sleep hygiene behaviors
and related outcomes, although in a different population [38].
In their study with obstructive sleep apnea patients, Deng et al
[58] found that an intervention based on HAPA improved
participant sleep quality. Our study suggests that targeting
different 
cognitive 
processes 
(ie, 
motivational 
and
self-regulatory processes) specified in TPB, HAPA, and HAPA
can lead to changes in the respective behaviors (eg, sleep
hygiene in this study).
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, few trials using
psychological interventions built on empirically based theories
have been designed for sleep problems. Therefore, results
derived from this study provided information about relevant
mechanisms of change. Second, development of an app may
improve the effects of a sleep intervention in insomnia. More
specifically, providing a technology-based intervention could
be an effective and accessible way to overcome numerous
barriers to CBT-I, such as low access, high costs, time
constraints, social stigma, and the lack of therapists and trained
mental health experts, as well as providing an intervention
overcoming economic and geographical barriers. Third, this
study controlled for many potential biases. For example, the
blindness of the analyst and the avoidance of contamination
were addressed. Fourth, although all the measures were
self-reported, instruments used in this study had satisfactory
psychometric properties. Consequently, the reliability and
validity of outcome measures were ensured.
There are some limitations in the study. First, participants were
not representative of the entire population of Iranian patients
with insomnia. For example, participants in this study needed
to use the app to receive the intervention. Therefore, insomnia
patients who have little literacy in using smartphones or desktop
computers may not gain benefit from CBT-I. Given that the
mean age of the studied sample was mid-thirties; the possibility
to generalize our findings to all inhabitants and age groups is
low. Second, the use of self-report measures for sleep and mental
health outcomes could be biased by social desirability or
memory recall. Although mental health outcomes are hard to
measure using non-self-reports, future studies may want to use
objectively measured instruments on sleep quality (eg,
actigraphy). Third, participants could not be blinded because
the intervention was obvious to them. Therefore, placebo effects
were hard to exclude, especially because most of the outcome
measures were self-reported. However, given that the promising
effects were found across all outcome measures and placebo
effects would be unlikely to last 6 months after treatment ends,
we tentatively concluded that CBT-I is an effective program to
treat insomnia. Last, as the study only followed participants 6
months after completing the intervention, it is unclear whether
CBT-I can provide effects lasting longer than 6 months. Future
studies are thus warranted to examine the long-term effect of
CBT-I.
Conclusion
The theory-based CBT-I intervention shows promising effects
in treating sleep problems for insomnia patients. After receiving
the feasible and short (ie, 6 weeks) CBT-I, insomnia patients
showed improved sleep hygiene behaviors, enhanced sleep
quality, and less insomnia severity. Moreover, other
psychological distress outcomes (ie, anxiety and depression) of
the insomnia patients who received CBT-I showed improvement
lasting 6 months after the intervention ended.
