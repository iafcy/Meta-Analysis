The aim of this study was to compare guided Internet-delivered to group-delivered cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) for insomnia. We conducted an 8-week randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with 6-
months follow-up. Participants were forty-eight adults with insomnia, recruited via media. Interventions
were guided Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) and group-delivered CBT (GCBT) for insomnia. Primary
outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), secondary outcome measures were sleep diary
data, depressive symptoms, response- and remission rates. Both treatment groups showed signiﬁcant
improvements and large effect sizes for ISI (Within Cohen's d: ICBT post ¼ 1.8, 6-months follow-up ¼ 2.1;
GCBT post ¼ 2.1, 6-months follow-up ¼ 2.2). Conﬁdence interval of the difference between groups post-
treatment and at FU6 indicated non-inferiority of ICBT compared to GCBT. At post-treatment, two thirds
of patients in both groups were considered responders (ISI-reduction > 7p). Using diagnostic criteria, 63%
(ICBT) and 75% (GCBT) were in remission. Sleep diary data showed moderate to large effect sizes. We
conclude that both guided Internet-CBT and group-CBT in this study were efﬁcacious with regard to
insomnia severity, sleep parameters and depressive symptoms. The results are in line with previous
research, and strengthen the evidence for guided Internet-CBT for insomnia.
Trial registration: The study protocol was approved by, and registered with, the regional ethics review
board in Link€oping, Sweden, registration number 2010/385-31.

1. Introduction
Insomnia is a disorder of difﬁculty initiating and/or maintaining
sleep, with impaired daytime functioning as a consequence. It is a
common disorder with around 10e30% point prevalence reported
in various studies (Kim, Uchiyama, Okawa, Liu, & Ogihara, 2000;
Mellinger, Balter, & Uhlenhuth, 1985; Ohayon & Roth, 2003).
Insomnia causes serious suffering and is a substantial economic
burden to society due to sick leave and utilization of health care
resources (Daley, Morin, LeBlanc, Gregoire, & Savard, 2009;
Sivertsen, Overland, Bjorvatn, Maeland, & Mykletun, 2009; Walsh,
2004). There is also increasing evidence that disturbed sleep is a
predictor for many other health problems, of which depression,
anxiety and substance abuse are among the most studied (Baglioni
et al., 2011; Breslau, Roth, Rosenthal, & Andreski, 1996; Ohayon &
Roth, 2003; Taylor et al., 2007). Evidence based treatment for
insomnia consists of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy.
Pharmacotherapy has moderate to large effects but is mainly
intended for short term use (Nowell et al., 1997), and symptoms
often recur after treatment (Riemann & Perlis, 2009). Cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found effective both in the short
and long term (Okajima, Komada, & Inoue, 2014). Two reviews of
sleep medication and psychotherapies have concluded that sleep
medication and CBT are equally effective short term, but that CBT is
more effective in the long term (Mitchell, Gehrman, Perlis, &
Umscheid, 2012; Riemann & Perlis, 2009).

Even though CBT for insomnia is broadly considered treatment
of choice, few patients suffering from insomnia receive CBT due to a
lack of trained therapists (Edinger, 2009; Espie, 2009; Larsson,
Kaldo, & Broberg, 2010). Many studies have been conducted to
investigate new ways of disseminating CBT. Group therapy,
bibliotherapy, telephone therapy and Internet therapy have all
proven effective (Espie et al., 2007; Ho et al., 2015; Jansson &
Linton, 2005; Jernel€ov et al., 2012; Koffel, Koffel, & Gehrman,
2015; Str€om, Pettersson, & Andersson, 2004; van Straten et al.,
2013), also for insomnia comorbid with depression (Blom et al.,
2015). Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) is a growing ﬁeld (Hedman,
Ljotsson, & Lindefors, 2012). Therapist guided ICBT has a potential
to be more therapist-efﬁcient than both individual and group-CBT
(GCBT): less therapist time is normally needed per patient, thus
each therapist can treat more patients during a certain time period
(Andersson, 2009; Barak, Klein, & Proudfoot, 2009). Another
advantage of ICBT is that therapy is not restricted to a speciﬁc time
or geographical place. This implies that therapy is available also to
patients living far away from a clinic, or without the possibility to
come during ofﬁce hours (Andersson, 2014).
To further the evidence for ICBT, it needs to be compared
directly to traditional treatment. Previous studies on guided ICBT
for other conditions show that guided ICBT has been equivalent to
face-to-face treatment (Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, &
Hedman, 2014). Although a recent meta-analysis indicates that
self-help CBT for insomnia is as effective as face-to-face treatment
with CBT (Ho et al., 2015), to our knowledge, there are no published
studies directly comparing ICBT for insomnia to face-to-face
treatment.
The aim of this study was to compare guided Internet-delivered
CBT to group-CBT in a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial,
investigating treatment effects post treatment and after six
months. The primary aim was to investigate the effects on
insomnia, a secondary aim was to investigate the effects on par-
ticipants' level of depression and sleep medicine use. Given the
aforementioned results from previous research, the hypothesis was
that ICBT is not inferior to GCBT and that achieved results would be
sustained over the follow-up period.
2. Method
2.1. Participants and recruitment
This
study
was
open
to
adults
living
in
the
region
of
€Osterg€otland County, Sweden. The participants were recruited via a
national recruitment website (www.studie.nu), a radio program
and ads in local newspapers. The study protocol was approved by,
and registered with, the regional ethics review board in Link€oping,
Sweden, registration number 2010/385-31.
Inclusion criteria were:
a) 18 years or older
b) Insomnia diagnosis according to the research criteria from
the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (Edinger et al.,
2004), with more than 10 points on Insomnia Severity In-
dex, ISI (C.M. Morin, 1993), which is the recommended cutoff
to detect insomnia cases (C. M. Morin, Belleville, Belanger, &
Ivers, 2011)
c) Ability to participate in group meetings
d) Ability to read and write in Swedish.
Exclusion criteria were:
e) Comorbid sleep disorders urgently requiring other treatment
(sleep apnea or narcolepsy)
f) Ongoing alcohol or drug abuse
g) Change in antidepressant medication within the past 2
months
h) Comorbid disorders directly contraindicative of essential
interventions in insomnia treatment (e.g., bipolar disorder)
or urgently requiring other treatment (e.g. severe depression
and suicidal ideation, i.e. having >30 p on the self-report
version of the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS-S) (Montgomery & Asberg, 1979), (Svanborg &
Åsberg, 1994) or > 3 p on the suicide ideation item 9 or
diagnosed
with
severe
depression
or
suicidality
at
assessment)
i) Other on-going psychological treatment
j) Night-shift work
Comorbidities were allowed, apart from what is mentioned in
exclusion criteria e, f and h. There was no restriction on sleep
medication use.
2.1.1. Initial screening
Participants applied via a secure website, received information
about the study and gave their consent. They ﬁlled out a number of
screening questionnaires including: contact information, back-
ground data, speciﬁc questions on sleep related disorders, ques-
tions on other psychiatric and somatic disorders, ISI, MADRS-S and
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) (Saunders,
Aasland, Babor, De La Fuente, & Grant, 1993). AUDIT was input to
the assessment of alcohol and drug abuse.
2.1.2. Structured telephone interview
Participants not excluded after the initial screening were inter-
viewed by telephone. The interview encompassed: checking diag-
nostic criteria (inclusion criteria b) for insomnia using 1, an
interview version of ISI, 2, a question on adequate opportunity and
circumstance for sleep, and 3, questions on daytime fatigue
(Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS (Johns, 1991)); checking motivation
and ability to take part; a follow up on ﬁndings from the initial
screening regarding sleep related disorders, other psychiatric and
somatic disorders and use of medicines. Patients not excluded at
this stage were booked for a live assessment.
2.1.3. Live assessment
The live assessment took 15e50 min and focused on: checking
the diagnostic criteria for insomnia; asking about daytime func-
tioning using ESS; assessing depressive symptoms using the
depression section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV,
SCID-I (First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, & Benjamin, 1999). When
indicated in the initial screening or telephone interview partici-
pants were asked about suicidal ideation, alcohol consumption,
medication, bipolar disorder and sleep disorders other than
insomnia. All interviews were reviewed in a meeting where the
principal investigator, (GA) made the ﬁnal decision on inclusion
based on the interviews and screening data. Participants excluded
at this stage were offered to get the Internet version of the treat-
ment outside of the study, or referred to other caregivers when
relevant (see Fig. 1).
2.2. Randomization and assessment points
Treatment was provided in two arms, group therapy (GCBT) and
therapist guided Internet-delivered therapy (ICBT). Participants,
(n ¼ 48) were randomized to treatment conditions (n ¼ 24 per
group) by university staff not involved in the study, using a free
randomization service online (www.randomizer.org). The group
therapy participants were divided into three groups with 8, 9 and 7
K. Blom et al. / Behaviour Research and Therapy 70 (2015) 47e55
48

participants respectively. Sleep diaries and questionnaires were
ﬁlled out online by both ICBT and GCBT. Outcome measures were
assessed at treatment start (pre-assessment), after treatment (post-
assessment), and 6 months after treatment. MADRS-S and ISI were
also administered after 4 weeks of treatment in order to monitor
progress. If participants had increased depressive symptoms and/or
suicidal ideation according to MADRS-S, therapists would tele-
phone the participant to assess suicidal thoughts and plans.
Assessment would be made in conjunction with the principal
investigator who was responsible for patient safety. If needed, the
participant could then be referred to a local caregiver, or meet with
a psychiatrist involved in the study. This did, however, not happen.
2.3. Assessor and therapists training and adherence
Telephone interviews, live assessments and therapy were con-
ducted by ﬁnal-year students (n ¼ 4) of clinical psychology at
master level, with theoretical and practical training in CBT,
including at least 12 months of providing supervised face-to-face
psychotherapy. Assessments were supervised by a licensed clin-
ical psychologist/CBT-therapist involved in the study (principal
investigator, GA). A psychiatrist was available for consultations if
necessary. Assessors after treatment and at 6 months follow-up
were blind to treatment condition. Group treatment supervision
was provided by licensed clinical psychologists with expertise in
CBT and insomnia treatment, attending group sessions. Internet
therapy was supervised weekly, as well as in between sessions
when requested, by a licensed clinical psychologist involved in the
study (KB), with expertise in ICBT and insomnia treatment. Thera-
pists were introduced to Internet and group delivered CBT for
insomnia by the supervising psychologists before treatment start.
2.4. Outcome measures
2.4.1. Primary measures
2.4.1.1. Insomnia severity. Primary outcome measure was self-rated
insomnia severity as measured with the ISI. Psychometric proper-
ties of the ISI are adequate and it has been found sensitive to change
(Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 2001), also when administrated online
(Thorndike et al., 2011). Participants in both groups completed the
self-report measures online via a secure website.
As self-rated data can be difﬁcult to obtain from all participants
post-treatment, especially in Internet treatment research with
participants mostly off-site, data was also acquired by telephone at
all assessment points. This data was used as a basis for imputing
missing Internet-rated ISI-data, according to recommendations by
Hedman and colleagues (Hedman, Ljotsson, Blom, et al., 2013). To
keep the interview brief, ISI was shortened to include only the ﬁve
diagnosis-related questions (1a-c, 2 and 3). The questions were
asked exactly as in the original version and alternative answers
were read verbatim. The patients then chose one of the alterna-
tives, so the telephone-data would be as similar to the self-rated

online data as possible. More about this method is explained in the
section Statistical Analyses.
2.4.2. Secondary measures
2.4.2.1. Sleep diary. A sleep diary was used throughout treatment.
Data from the ﬁrst and last (eighth) week were used as pre- and
post-treatment
measurements.
Each
participant
registered
bedtime, time of falling asleep, night-time awakenings, time of
waking up, and time of getting out of bed. Also, subjective sleep
quality was rated daily on a ﬁve-point scale from very poor to very
good. From these data we calculated sleep efﬁciency, sleep onset
latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality.
2.4.2.2. Remitters and responders. Remission from insomnia was
measured at post-treatment and at the 6 months follow-up in two
ways: a) in a telephone interview using research criteria (Edinger
et al., 2004) to determine if the participant had the diagnosis, and
b) using the remission criteria stipulating that ISI score for the
participant should be less than 8 points (Morin & Espie, 2003).
Participants
were
considered
responders
if
the
ISI-score
decreased with 8 points or more (C. M. Morin et al., 2011).
2.4.2.3. Depressive
symptoms. Depressive
symptoms
were
measured with MADRS-S at all assessment points. MADRS-S is a
frequently used, validated instrument for measuring and detecting
changes in the severity of depression (Montgomery & Asberg,
1979), (Svanborg & Åsberg, 1994).
2.4.2.4. Sleep medication. Sleep medication usage was registered at
the live pre-assessment and in telephone interviews at post- and 6
months assessments.
2.5. Adherence, client satisfaction and adverse events
Adherence was measured by checking the number of modules
completed (ICBT) and group sessions attended (GCBT). The Client
Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves,
& Nguyen, 1979) was used to assess participants' satisfaction with
treatment. More than 7 points increase on ISI, regarded as a clini-
cally signiﬁcant worsening of symptoms (C. M. Morin et al., 2011),
was considered a negative effect. All participants were asked about
adverse events in the post-treatment telephone interview with the
question “Did the treatment have any negative consequences?” If
yes, they were asked to elaborate.
2.6. Interventions
Both treatments were based on the same manual, treatment
lasted 8 weeks and group and Internet therapy were conducted in
parallel.
2.6.1. Treatment content
The treatment was based on a self-help manual previously
published in a book (Jernel€ov, 2007), which has been tested in two
randomized clinical trials with large effect sizes (Blom et al., 2015;
Jernel€ov et al., 2012). The book was adapted and shortened into
eight modules, which were in turn used as treatment modules in
ICBT and as group therapy material (one module per session) in
GCBT. The main focus of the treatment was on sleep restriction and
stimulus control, which was emphasized throughout the treat-
ment. The other strategies and techniques in the manual were
introduced as a sort of “smorgasbord”, where the participants could
choose to work with the strategy they found most appealing. See
Table 1. Participants were instructed to ﬁll out a sleep diary online
every week of the treatment.
2.6.2. Group therapy
Group sessions were held during ofﬁce hours and lasted
120 min including a short break with refreshments (coffee/tea). A
designated therapist and one supervising co-therapist attended
each session. The therapists used the same presentations and hand-
out material. Sessions included going over the participants' sleep
diaries, the homework assignments of the past week, the contents
of the new treatment module and its exercises, and the new
homework assignment. There was also time for discussions, re-
ﬂections about the treatment and questions. The text material
handed out in each session was identical to the text in the corre-
sponding Internet treatment module for the same week. The in-
dividual sleep diaries, ﬁlled out online, were printed by the
therapist before each session and handed out with written com-
ments about, for example, sleep times and sleep hygiene. If patients
did not show up to group, they were contacted by the therapist by
telephone.
2.6.3. Therapist guided internet-delivered therapy
The Internet-delivered CBT included active support by trained
therapists, and was built up by the same eight modules as in GCBT,
only adapted to and accessed on a secure website. A module con-
sisted of text to read, questions to answer on theory, behavioral
assignments (e.g. sleep restriction), work sheets and a sleep diary.
The participants were recommended to complete one module per
week. Each module ended with the participant sending in a home-
work report via the secure messaging system. The therapist
received the message, and within 24 h on weekdays they reviewed
the homework assignments, gave written feedback and then gave
the participant access to the next module. The participants could
send questions to their therapist, which were answered within 24 h
on weekdays. If the participant was inactive for 7 days, the therapist
would send a mobile phone text message encouraging the partic-
ipant to get in touch and continue treatment. If there was no
response, the therapist would try to reach the patient by telephone.
2.7. Statistical Analyses
2.7.1. Baseline data and imputation method
t-test, c2 associations and Fisher Exact Test were used to
compare baseline data. When data was missing for the self-rated
primary outcome measures, they were replaced with self-rated
data acquired by the telephone interview, when available. A
linear regression formula was used to impute missing Internet
values (ISI) from telephone values (ISI-items 1a-c, 2, and 3). The
regression formula was calculated using post- and follow-up data
from 168 participants in two previous insomnia studies where the
telephone measure (independent variable) and the Internet mea-
sure (dependent variable) were scored within 1 w. These measures
were highly correlated (r ¼ 0.83, p < 0.0001). The interview version
of ISI had a Cronbach a of 0.83. Secondary outcome measures,
except Sleep diary, were analyzed using available data.
2.7.2. Mixed-effect model
We used linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate outcome
changes for primary outcome data (insomnia severity), as well as
for the secondary outcome data depressive symptoms and sleep
diary data. Using maximum likelihood estimation, linear-mixed
effect models incorporate all available data to estimate parame-
ters in the model, making it a full intent-to-treat analysis. Linear
mixed modeling is a frequently recommended method for superi-
ority as well as non-inferiority trials for its abilities to handle
missing data and correlated observations in repeated-measures
data (Gueorguieva & Krystal, 2004; Yoo, 2010). The best-ﬁtted
model to the data consisted of a linear and quadratic function of

50

time, ﬁxed effects of condition, condition by time interactions, and
correlated error terms. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 22 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA).
2.7.3. Non-inferiority margin and analysis
A critical part of doing a non-inferiority study is determining the
non-inferiority margin, or delta (Piaggio et al., 2006). To determine
whether the ICBT was inferior to GCBT the conﬁdence interval
approach was used (Piaggio et al., 2006; Yoo, 2010). If the lower-
limit of the two-sided 95% conﬁdence interval of mean difference
between conditions is less than the pre-speciﬁed non-inferiority
margin, non-inferiority is established.
We could only locate one report of a non-inferiority trial on
insomnia, using ISI as the primary outcome (Garland et al., 2014).
Thus, there is no established recommended delta. Yang and col-
leagues (Yang, Morin, Schaefer, & Wallenstein, 2009) used data
from a large randomized controlled trial (n ¼ 828) on the efﬁcacy of
eszopiclone for insomnia, to established a minimally important
difference (MID) in ISI score before and after treatment. They
compared ISI scores to a selection of items representing a change in
health, daytime functioning and quality of life. In the study from
Yang and colleagues, a score reduction of more than 4 points on ISI
was found representing a signiﬁcant predictor of decreased risk of a
negative treatment outcome, and was associated with an increase
in vitality and a decrease in fatigue. A score reduction of 6 points
was related to even more positive outcomes than 4, and was chosen
by the authors as the recommended MID for efﬁcacy studies, since a
more conservative MID reduces the risk of an overestimation of
treatment effects.
As a conservative estimate of MID for the purpose of this non-
inferiority trial, where a smaller margin is more conservative, we
chose a non-inferiority margin of 4 points on ISI for the analysis.
This means, that the mean difference between the groups should
not be more than 4 points in favor of GCBT, to establish non-
inferiority of ICBT. The chosen margin, 4 points, was also used by
Garland and colleagues in their non-inferiority study (Garland
et al., 2014), but with a slightly different motivation. We retrieved
the estimates (along with standard errors and conﬁdence intervals)
of the mean difference between groups at post-treatment and at
the 6 months follow-up from the mixed model analysis.
In accordance with recommendations for non-inferiority trials
(Piaggio et al., 2006; Yoo, 2010), we also performed a sensitivity
analysis of the primary outcome ISI for a per-protocol sample.
Participants were considered as per-protocol if they completed
more than ﬁve of the eight modules/sessions of the treatment. It
was deemed that this would correspond to a sufﬁcient dose of the
treatment, since the main treatment components had then been
introduced and exercises had commenced.
2.7.4. Power analysis
A power analysis was made according to the method recom-
mended by Tamayo-Sarver with colleagues (Tamayo-Sarver, Albert,
Tamayo-Sarver, & Cydulka, 2005). In the analysis we used 4 point as
the non-inferiority margin (d*), 8 points as the clinically signiﬁcant
difference (d) (C. M. Morin et al., 2011), 25 for variance (s ¼ 5), group
size (n) is 24 (total N ¼ 48) and a was set to 2.5% since our non-
inferiority analysis was calculated with a two-sided 95% conﬁ-
dence interval. This calculation resulted in a power of 0.79 for the
primary outcome analysis.
2.7.5. Effect sizes, remission, responders and sleep medication
Within group effect sizes were calculated with observed data
using Cohen's d for repeated measures (Dunlap, Cortina, Vaslow, &
Burke, 1996). We used c2 associations and the Fischer Exact Test to
test for differences between groups regarding responders, remis-
sion from diagnosis and use of sleep medicine pre-treatment to
post-treatment and 6 months follow-up.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics
The two groups showed no signiﬁcant differences on any of the
outcome measures before treatment and there were no differences
regarding baseline demographics, except for educational level
which was higher in the ICBT group (p ¼ 0.03). See Table 2.

Sensitivity analyses were executed to check for any primary
outcome effects of the difference in educational level (see primary
outcome section).
3.2. Attrition
At post-treatment assessment, overall missing data for the pri-
mary outcome measurement ISI was 2% (1 participant from GCBT).
This was after imputation from telephone interviews for 2 partic-
ipants (both in ICBT). At the 6 months follow-up, data was imputed
for 4 participants (1 in GCBT and 3 in ICBT), resulting in 27% missing
data overall, evenly distributed between the groups (6 in GCBT and
7 in ICBT).
Sleep diary compliance is presented in Fig.1. Missing data for the
other secondary measurements were as follows: MADRS-S, post-
treatment: 3 (GCBT:1, ICBT:2), 6 months follow-up: 17 (GCBT:7,
ICBT:10); Remitters and responders using ISI, remission using
diagnostic criteria and use of sleep medication, post-treatment: 1
(GCBT), 6 months follow-up: 13 (GCBT:6, ICBT:7).
3.3. Adherence and client satisfaction
No signiﬁcant difference between groups was found regarding
patient satisfaction (CSQ-8), GCBT mean value, M ¼ 27.5 (SD ¼ 5.1),
ICBT M ¼ 25.0 (SD ¼ 5.5). No signiﬁcant difference was found
regarding number of group meetings (GCBT) or modules (ICBT)
completed, GCBT M ¼ 6.8 (SD ¼ 2.1), ICBT M ¼ 6.1 (SD ¼ 2.8). Pa-
tients in ICBT had a weekly therapist time of M ¼ 23 min (SD ¼ 15)
whereas the group condition had 120 min per group session.
During treatment, at different time points, 13 participants (7 in
ICBT and 4 in GCBT) dropped out, i.e. stopped coming to sessions or
stopped being active on the Internet. Eight of these participants (5
from ICBT and 3 from GCBT) still completed post-treatment
assessment.
3.4. Primary outcome measures
Within group effect sizes are presented in Table 3. Mixed model
analyses showed that both treatment groups improved signiﬁ-
cantly from pre-to post-assessment, and improvements were sus-
tained at the 6 months follow-up (p < 0.001). See Fig. 2. There was
no signiﬁcant interaction effect of group and time (p > 0.58).
Estimated mean raw difference between the groups was 1.31 (95%
CI
¼
3.99e1.36)
at
the
post-assessment
and
0.88
(95%
CI ¼ 3.92e2.16) at the 6 months follow-up, both in favor of GCBT.
Hence, the lower limit of the 95% CI was within the speciﬁed non-
inferiority margin of 4 points both at post-treatment and at the 6
months follow-up.
The per-protocol sensitivity analysis encompassed 16 partici-
pants in ICBT and 20 in GCBT and was consistent with the intent-to-
treat analysis in terms of interaction, group differences and non-
inferiority (post: 95% CI ¼ 3.84 to 2.19; 6 months follow-up:
95% CI ¼ 3.62e2.88). Sensitivity testing for the baseline differ-
ence in educational level did not affect the model or outcomes
regarding signiﬁcance or non-inferiority.
3.5. Secondary outcome measures
3.5.1. Sleep diary
Both groups improved signiﬁcantly from pre to 6 months
follow-up on sleep efﬁciency, sleep latency and sleep quality
(p < 0.001, except sleep quality for ICBT which had p < 0.05). GCBT
improved signiﬁcantly on total sleep time (p < 0.05) whereas ICBT
did not. Within group effect sizes at post-treatment and at 6
months follow-up are presented in Table 3. Analysis with mixed
model showed no signiﬁcant group difference (p ¼ 0.4e0.8) nor
interaction of group and time (p ¼ 0.08e0.7) on any of the sleep
diary outcomes.
3.5.2. Remitters and responders
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the
groups
regarding remission from diagnosis when assessed via telephone
interview, using diagnostics criteria: 75% (18) in GCBT and 63% (15)
in ICBT no longer had the diagnosis post-treatment (c2 ¼ 1.39,
p ¼ 0.24), and at the 6 months follow-up 72% in GCBT were in
remission (13 out of 18 reached) and 76% (13 out of 17 reached) in
ICBT (Fischer Exact Test value ¼ 1, p ¼ 1.0).
When using the criteria that ISI should be below 8 points to
deﬁne patients in remission, the groups did not differ signiﬁcantly:
50% in both groups (12 out of 23 in GCBT and 12 out of 24 in ICBT)
were in remission at post-treatment (c2 ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.9). At the 6
months follow-up, the corresponding numbers were 44% in GCBT
(8 out of 18 reached) and 35% in ICBT (6 out of 17 reached), c2 ¼ 0.3,
p ¼ 0.6.
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the
groups
regarding number of responders: 67% in GCBT (16 out of 23) and
63% in ICBT (15 out of 24) had a >7 p reduction on ISI post-
treatment, and 55% in GCBT (10 out of 18) and 59% in ICBT (10
out of 17) at the 6 months follow-up (c2 ¼ 0.6, p ¼ 0.4 and c2 ¼ 0.02,
p ¼ 0.9, respectively). Assuming all participants with missing data
were non-responders and non-remitters, did not change overall
statistical inferences.
3.5.3. Depressive symptoms
Both
groups
improved
signiﬁcantly
regarding
depressive
symptoms measured with MADRS-S (p < 0.01). There was no sig-
niﬁcant group difference (p > 0.3) or interaction between group
and time (p > 0.3). Effect sizes are presented in Table 3.
3.5.4. Sleep medication use
The number of participants using sleep medicine at each time
point is presented in Table 3. There was no signiﬁcant difference
between groups pre to post, nor from pre to 6 months follow-up.
3.6. Negative effects and adverse events
No participants had a reliable change for the worse (>7 p

increase on ISI) post-treatment or at the 6 months follow-up. Two
participants in GCBT had a higher post-than pre-treatment score on
ISI (3 and 7 points increase respectively), no participants in ICBT
had a higher post-treatment score. One participant in each group
had a higher 6 months follow-up- than pre-treatment score (1
(GCBT) and 3 (ICBT) points increase).
The post-assessment question about negative consequences of
the treatment was answered afﬁrmatively by 9 participants (19%), 3
in GCBT and 6 in ICBT (non-signiﬁcant difference, Fischer exact
statistic test value ¼ 0.5, P ¼ 0.46). These participants had a 3e11
point decrease in ISI from pre-to post-treatment. Three of the
complaints (2 in GCBT and 1 in ICBT) were expected effects of in-
terventions, temporary and considered acceptable by the patients
(having to stop driving temporarily; being very sleepy during the
beginning of sleep restriction; not being allowed to read in bed).
One participant (ICBT) had high hopes for the treatment and was
disappointed, one found the treatment stressful and two became
more ﬁxated on sleep and had increased worry about sleep, one
had increased headache and a minor trafﬁc incident after getting
little sleep. One person in GCBT was worried about relapsing into
burnout syndrome.
4. Discussion
The main ﬁnding in this study was that both treatment groups
improved signiﬁcantly, with large effect sizes for the primary
outcome, insomnia severity. The secondary outcome measures
(sleep diary data, responders, remitters, sleep medicine use,
depressive symptoms) also showed positive results with small to
large effect sizes. Using a margin of 4 points on the ISI, the non-
inferiority analyses conﬁrmed that there was not a clinically
meaningful difference between the two treatment modalities. In
addition, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between
the groups on any outcome measure at post-treatment or 6 months
follow-up assessments. Two thirds of the participants in both
groups were regarded as treatment responders at post-treatment,
and the number of participants in remission was similar for both
groups.
Previous studies have found that insomnia treatment is effective
to reduce depressive symptoms, also when participants have a
depression diagnosis with moderate severity (Blom et al., 2015;
Manber et al., 2008; Okajima et al., 2014). The participants in this
study had, on average, mild depressive symptoms pre-treatment.
The results corroborate previous ﬁndings that insomnia treat-
ment can be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, both when
delivered in group format and as therapist guided Internet
treatment.
When benchmarking the outcome of the experimental treat-
ment against the results in other studies using ICBT or group
therapy, we ﬁnd that the Internet-delivered treatment in this study
fares well. Most of the previous group- or Internet-delivered ther-
apy studies did not use ISI as primary outcome measure, but when
comparing sleep diary data at post-assessment, guided ICBT in this
study did well compared to other guided and un-guided Internet-
treatments (Lancee, van den Bout, van Straten, & Spoormaker,
2012; Ritterband et al., 2009; Str€om et al., 2004; van Straten
et al., 2013). The effect of guided ICBT in this study is also compa-
rable to group therapies for insomnia in previous research. We ﬁnd,
for example, that the effect size for sleep efﬁciency in the group-

CBT meta-analysis by Koffel and colleagues (Koffel et al., 2015) was
0.52e1.65 at post-treatment, compared to 1.51 for guided ICBT in
this study. Furthermore, when comparing the effect of the group
therapy (GCBT) in this study to those in the same meta-analysis
(Koffel et al., 2015), it seems this particular group-therapy was
more
than
average
effective
(e.g.
effect
size
for
sleep
efﬁciency ¼ 1.78). Thus, it is unlikely that the non-inferiority of ICBT
observed is caused by poor delivery of the group treatment.
The design of this study does not permit drawing conclusions
about mechanisms of action, but some aspects are still of interest to
discuss. Researchers have highlighted that for ICBT it is most likely
important a) to make a thorough diagnosis, b) that the treatment is
comprehensive, c) that it is user friendly, and d) that therapist
support is provided and there is a deadline for the treatment
duration (Andersson, Carlbring, Berger, Almlov, & Cuijpers, 2009).
At least criteria a, b and d were fulﬁlled for ICBT in this study. The
group contingency may have had unusually comprehensive text
material for the participants, since it was the same as in the Internet
contingency. This may have affected outcome for GCBT in a positive
way compared to other group treatments. It is possible that there
are differences in the mechanisms of action for the different modes
of delivery: a supportive group climate might have had a positive
effect in GCBT, which may in turn be balanced by the fact that
participants in ICBT had the possibility to interact more frequently
with the therapist e something that has been found to increase
effects in depression research (Cuijpers, Huibers, Ebert, Koole, &
Andersson, 2013).
A strength of this study is that the treatment delivered was a
multi-component therapy. The treatment included both sleep re-
striction, stimulus control and cognitive reappraisal. Inclusion of
these interventions in CBT for insomnia was recommended most
recently by Miller with colleagues in a review of insomnia and its
treatments (Miller, Espie, & Kyle, 2014). Another strength of the
study is that the treatment length and materials were exactly the
same for both groups. Any differences between groups (or lack
thereof) are therefore likely to be dependent on the mode of
delivery.
There is increased interest in following up on adverse events in
psychotherapy (Kyle et al., 2014; Rozental et al., 2014). While
Rozental with colleagues provide guidelines for how to assess
adverse events in Internet interventions, Kyle with colleagues
investigate negative effects of sleep restriction in a sample with
insomnia. In our study, adverse events in the form of subjective
negative consequences of the treatment were reported for 9 par-
ticipants (19%). Among these were increased worry about sleep, a
minor trafﬁc accident (according to the patient due to sleepiness
during sleep restriction), increased fatigue and stress over doing
the treatment. The report by Kyle et al., together with the adverse
events reported here, imply that we may need to inform patients
more about what to expect during the early phases of doing sleep
restriction, and advice more clearly e.g. against driving. Future
research needs to investigate adverse events more thoroughly, and
also try to ﬁnd effective treatments that minimize negative events.
Interpretations of the non-inferiority analyses must consider
the relevance of the chosen non-inferiority margin. Still, the effect
sizes of both treatments were convincingly large, and there can be
no doubt that both ICBT and GCBT were efﬁcacious in this study. A
limitation of the study is the relatively small sample size, especially
since attrition was fairly large at the six months follow-up. Future
research would beneﬁt from larger comparisons in order to
generate more reliable estimates of treatment effects and indeed
non-inferiority.
Participants in this study were recruited through advertise-
ments in newspapers and on the radio, which raises the question of
generalizability. Since CBT for insomnia in regular care is scarce, at
best, it is difﬁcult to make direct comparisons of the sample studied
here and a population seeking regular care. There is, however, a
meta-analysis of patients with depression and anxiety, comparing
patients in regular care to patients in ICBT-studies (Andrews,
Cuijpers, Craske, McEvoy, & Titov, 2010). They reported that
symptom severity, chronicity and help-seeking patterns in the
ICBT-study samples resembled characteristics of patients at regular
clinics. Therapist guided ICBT for panic disorder, depression and
tinnitus has transferred well from research to regular care, as is
shown in several effectiveness studies (Andersson & Hedman,
2013; Hedman et al., 2014; Hedman, Ljotsson, Ruck, et al., 2013;
Kaldo-Sandstr€om, Larsen, & Andersson, 2004; Kaldo et al., 2013).
Thus, even if the generalizability of the results may be somewhat
limited, the contribution of ICBT to the insomnia population has the
potential to be substantial, should it become available in regular
care. Future studies on patients from regular clinics, as well as
effectiveness studies of ICBT, are needed to determine the
generalizability.
5. Conclusion
Both guided ICBT and group-delivered CBT were efﬁcacious in
this study. Effect sizes were comparatively large for insomnia
severity and small to large for sleep diary data and depressive
symptoms. Both treatments compared well to other studies of CBT
for insomnia. Results indicate that guided ICBT was not inferior to
GCBT. The results of this study are in line with previous research on
ICBT and strengthen the evidence for guided ICBT for insomnia as a
viable treatment alternative.
