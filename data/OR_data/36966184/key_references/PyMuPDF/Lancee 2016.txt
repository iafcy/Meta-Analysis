Study Objectives: To compare the efficacy of guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list 
condition.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial comparing three conditions: guided online; face-to-face; wait-list. Posttest measurements were administered to 
all conditions, along with 3- and 6-mo follow-up assessments to the online and face-to-face conditions. Ninety media-recruited participants meeting the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for insomnia were randomly allocated to either guided online CBT-I 
(n = 30), individual face-to-face CBT-I (n = 30), or wait-list (n = 30).
Results: At post-assessment, the online (Cohen d = 1.2) and face-to-face (Cohen d = 2.3) intervention groups showed significantly larger treatment effects 
than the wait-list group on insomnia severity (insomnia severity index). Large treatment effects were also found for the sleep diary estimates (except for total 
sleep time), and anxiety and depression measures (for depression only in the face-to-face condition). Face-to-face treatment yielded a statistically larger 
treatment effect (Cohen d = 0.9) on insomnia severity than the online condition at all time points. In addition, a moderate differential effect size favoring 
face-to-face treatment emerged at the 3- and 6-mo follow-up on all sleep diary estimates. Face-to-face treatment further outperformed online treatment on 
depression and anxiety outcomes.
Conclusions: These data show superior performance of face-to-face treatment relative to online treatment. Yet, our results also suggest that online 
treatment may offer a potentially cost-effective alternative to and complement face-to-face treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Insomnia is a common disorder with a prevalence of about 
10% in the general population.1 Individuals suffering from in-
somnia have difficulty initiating and/or staying asleep, have 
these complaints for at least 3 mo, and suffer from negative 
daytime consequences.2–5 Furthermore, insomnia is associated 
with an increased risk of anxiety and depression,6–8 suicid-
ality,9 and cardiovascular diseases.10
Sleep medication is the most widely used treatment option 
for insomnia. Although sleep medication is effective in the short 
term, it is also associated with side effects,11 and the long-term 
efficacy of sleep medication has not been established.12 An al-
ternative treatment option is cognitive behavioral treatment for 
insomnia (CBT-I); this psychological treatment has equal short-
term effects12,13 and superior long-term effects12 as medication. 
Recently it was demonstrated that the acute phase of sleep re-
striction in CBT-I is also associated with side effects such as day-
time sleepiness and objective performance impairment. However, 
these side effects are not maintained at 3-mo follow-up.14
Another issue with CBT-I is that it requires considerable 
time investment of trained psychologists that may not always 
be readily available.15 A possible solution to cut costs (i.e., time 
investment) and increase accessibility is to provide the CBT-I

Significance
This is the first published study to compare guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list 
condition. Whereas both treatments were significantly more effective than the wait-list condition, face-to-face treatment outperformed online treatment. 
These findings may guide clinicians in choosing the right treatment format for patients with insomnia if both treatments are available to the patient. Yet, if 
access to face-to-face treatment is limited, online treatment may be considered as it can significantly reduce insomnia complaints. However, our results 
need to be seen as preliminary until replicated in future clinical trials.
via the internet.15 In recent years several trials were published 
on online CBT-I. Overall the results were encouraging with re-
cent meta-analyses identifying moderate to large effects sizes 
for these online treatments.16,17 Furthermore, it was established 
that such online interventions should best be delivered in a 
guided format (i.e., with some form of Email support)18 and that 
this guidance is possible with a low level of clinical training.19 
For insomnia, several online treatment studies observed treat-
ment effects comparable to face-to-face treatment.20–23	
In other clinical domains there has been a surge in research 
on the comparison between face-to-face and online psycholog-
ical interventions. Recent meta-analyses on somatic and psy-
chiatric disorders have concluded that face-to-face and online 
treatments were equally effective.24,25 If these findings would 
also hold for insomnia, online treatments could be a major ad-
vancement in terms of accessibility and cost-effectiveness of 
interventions.
To our knowledge, only one published study directly com-
pared online CBT-I and face-to-face group treatments for in-
somnia, utilizing a noninferiority trial design.26 In line with 
the studies on somatic and psychiatric disorders, online CBT-I 
was found to be non-inferior to group-administered CBT-I. No 
published studies have reported on the comparison between

online CBT-I and individual face-to-face treatment. In this ar-
ticle, we report the results of a randomized wait-list controlled 
trial comparing online CBT-I to individual face-to-face CBT-I. 
We hypothesized that: (1) online and face-to-face treatment 
ameliorate insomnia complaints compared to a wait-list condi-
tion, and (2) online and face-to-face delivery methods do not 
differ considerably in treatment effect.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were recruited from April 2013 to January 2014 via 
a popular scientific website and a Facebook campaign. Enroll-
ment took place in October 2013 and January 2014. Inclusion 
criteria were: (1) insomnia disorder according to Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)2; (2) in-
somnia severity index (ISI) score of 10 or higher,27 (3) being 
awake subjectively for at least 30 min a night at least 3 nights 
a week, and (4) being 18 y or older. Exclusion criteria were: 
(1) possible sleep apnea (determined with a subscale of the 
SLEEP-50, cutoff > 1528), (2) shift work, (3) pregnancy, (4) ear-
lier CBT-I, (5) start of psychotherapy in the past 6 mo, (6) cur-
rent major depressive disorder based on the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV disorders (SCID-I; administered during 
the telephone screening), (7) alcohol abuse (more than three 
glasses of alcohol a day for at least 21 d/mo), (8) marijuana 
abuse (use more than once a week), (9) self-reported diagnosis 
of schizophrenia or psychosis, (10) or current suicidal plans. 
An initial group of 183 interested individuals completed an in-
formed consent form and started the online questionnaire.
Of these, 47 potential participants were excluded based 
on the online assessment. Next, a psychologist conducted a 
telephone screening interview that included an assessment 
on DSM-5 insomnia and the SCID-I for current depression. 
Figure 1 presents a flowchart of the recruitment, and details the 
reasons for exclusion. The final 90 participants were randomly 
assigned to online treatment (n = 30), face-to-face treatment 
(n = 30), or a wait-list condition (n = 30). Baseline character-
istics and descriptive statistics of the sample are displayed in 
Tables 1 and 2.
Power
This study was powered for the detection of a within-between 
interaction effect size of f 2 = 0.20. Based on an alpha of 0.05 
and a power of 0.8, detecting this effect size requires a cell size 
of n = 22. In consideration of an expected attrition rate, we 
included 30 participants per group.

Insomnia complaints were measured with a Dutch transla-
tion of the seven-item ISI. The ISI is a widely used measure 
to index changes in insomnia severity, and favorable psycho-
metric properties have been documented.29,30 The total score 
ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe insomnia). A cutoff 
of 10 was determined as optimal to indicate clinical levels of 
insomnia27 and was therefore used in this study. Surprisingly, 
in the current study the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) 
of the ISI was 0.22. After deleting the first item (regarding dif-
ficulty falling asleep), the Cronbach alpha rose to 0.57 (which 
is comparable to the α = 0.61 that was found in a validation 
study of the online version of the original ISI.31 For compara-
bility with other publications, we decided to report on the full 
ISI score. We also performed all the analyses without the first 
item of the ISI and these results were highly similar to the full 
seven-item ISI (see Tables S1 and S2, supplemental material).
Depressive symptoms were measured using a Dutch transla-
tion of the 20-item Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depres-
sion scale (CES-D, range = 0, no depressive symptoms, to 60, 
high depressive symptoms).32,33 The original scale has shown 
strong reliability, and the psychometric properties of the Dutch 
scale are comparable to that of the original version (α = 0.79–­
0.92).32,33 In the current study, the Cronbach alpha was 0.88.
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Dutch version 
of the seven anxiety items of the Hospital Anxiety and De-
pression Scale (HADS).34,35 The total score ranges from 0 (no 
symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety). The 
internal consistency of the HADS is good (α = 0.84 in the 
Dutch version34). In the current study, the Cronbach alpha was 
0.84.
A subscale of the SLEEP-5028 was used to exclude patients 
with possible apnea. The apnea subscale has eight items 
(α = 0.51), and the total scale ranges from 8 (no apnea indica-
tion) to 32 (severe apnea indication).
Online sleep diary
We used the Dutch translation of the consensus sleep diary.36 
Participants kept a sleep diary for 7 d and recorded time to 
bed, time they tried to go to sleep, time of final awakening, 
time out of bed, sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep 
onset (WASO), terminal wakefulness (TWAK), number of

nocturnal awakenings (NWAK), sleep quality (1 = “very bad” 
to 5 = “very good”), and use of sleep medication. From these 
variables, the time in bed (TIB = final arising time − time to 
bed), total sleep time (TST = TIB − SOL – WASO – TWAK), 
sleep efficiency (SE = [TST / TIB] × 100), and total wake time 
(TWT = SOL + WASO + TWAK) were calculated.
Interventions
The online and face-to-face CBT-I treatments had equal content 
and included the following modules of standard multicompo-
nent treatment for insomnia: (1) psychoeducation; (2) progres-
sive muscle relaxation; (3) sleep hygiene; (4) sleep restriction 
(i.e., restricting time in bed to actual sleeping time; the sleep 
restriction parameters37 are reported in Table S3, supplemental 
material); and (5) cognitive exercises (i.e., challenging the mis-
conceptions about sleep).38 The modules were offered in the 
same order in both treatment conditions.
The online program, first described in the study of Lancee 
and colleagues,18 features an integrated diary that gives visual 
feedback on participants’ SE and total time spent awake. It 
enables the provision of feedback on treatment progress and 
assigned exercises. The participants first read information 
regarding the module, then do their homework, and then fill 
out online forms based on their exercises. Access to the next 
module is gained only if the previous one is completed. Feed-
back is provided by Email based on these exercises, forms, and 
on the sleep diary. In the current study, personal feedback was 
provided by Master level students of psychology, and super-
vised by the first author.
The online treatment comprised six weekly sessions and 
participants received feedback up to 8 w. In the first session, 
participants started with psychoeducation and a sleep diary, 
which was continued throughout treatment. In the second ses-
sion, sleep hygiene and progressive muscle relaxation were 
covered. After reading the sleep hygiene section, participants 
wrote down their intentions for the following week; the coach 
used this for his/her feedback. Progressive muscle relaxation 
exercises were provided in mp3 downloads and participants 
reported their intended frequency. In the third session, partici-
pants started with sleep restriction. They used the guidelines to 
form their sleep window for the consecutive week. The coach 
assessed this sleep window and gave feedback based on the 
form and the sleep diary (e.g., “you are planning to spent 7 
h in bed the following week but based on your diary it may 
be better to spent 6 h a night in bed.”). For the remainder of 
the program the coach and participants discussed sleep win-
dows every week (up to 8 w). Cognitive exercises started in 
the fourth session. In these exercises common misconceptions 
were discussed and participants were asked to fill out a thought 
form with their original and challenged misconception (e.g., “I 
must sleep 8 h a night for full functioning next day” into “even 
if I sleep only 6 h tonight I will be able to work quite well 
tomorrow”). In the fifth session, again sleep restriction and 
cognitive exercises were covered. In the sixth and final session, 
sleep restriction was covered for the last time and a plan for the 
future was made.
In the face-to-face condition, all six individual treatment 
sessions were administered by a psychologist specialized in 
insomnia treatment. In total, six treatment sessions of 45 min 
were offered over a maximum time span of 12 w. The sessions 
followed the same order as the online treatment, with the only 
exception that in the face-to-face condition sleep hygiene was 
started in the first week. Furthermore, stimulus control was 
covered more elaborately in session two.
Procedure
Participants who met study criteria completed questionnaires, 
and an online sleep diary on 7 consecutive days. Participants 
were then randomized to either (1) guided online treatment; 
(2) individual face-to-face treatment; or (3) the wait-list condi-
tion. We used a block randomization procedure with blocks of 
30. Randomization results were not blinded to the investigators 
and participants. Twelve weeks after the randomization, par-
ticipants in all conditions were invited to complete post-assess-
ment questionnaires and again the 7-night sleep diary. After 
completing the post-assessment sleep diary, participants in the 
wait-list condition received the online CBT-I treatment. The 
people participating in the online and face-to-face condition 
also received 3- and 6-mo follow-up measurements. The study 
was approved by the internal Ethical Review Board of the Uni-
versity of Amsterdam and was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT01955850).
Statistical Analysis
The effects of the intervention were tested using multilevel re-
gression analysis, which lends itself well for intention-to-treat 
analyses, and enables the inclusion of participants with one 
measurement only.39
Analyses of variance detected baseline differences in de-
pressive symptoms, F (2, 80) = 4.25; P = 0.02. A post hoc test 
identified that participants in the wait-list group (mean = 21.5; 
standard deviation [SD] = 8.0) had higher scores on depres-
sive symptoms than people in the face-to-face condition 
(mean = 15.7; SD = 7.6; P = 0.02). Furthermore, participants 
in the online condition who completed the post-assessment 
questionnaire had lower depressive symptoms at baseline 
(mean = 16.0; SD = 6.5) than those who did not complete 
the questionnaire (mean = 27.3; SD = 9.3), F (1. 28) = 9.29; 
P = 0.005. This was also observed at the 6-month follow-
up (mean = 22.0; SD = 9.8 versus mean = 15.6; SD = 6.0), 
F (1. 28) = 4.86; P = 0.04. Therefore, baseline depressive 
symptoms were added as a covariate in the multilevel regres-
sion analyses.
We also used multiple imputations based on the missing 
at random assumption to insert missing cases on the ques-
tionnaire and diary data.40 Using a predictive mean matching 
procedure we generated 10 separate datasets. The values in 
Tables 2 and 3 are based on these imputed datasets. Between-
group Cohen ds were calculated on the difference in change 
scores divided by the pooled standard deviation of the change. 
A Cohen d of 0.20 indicates a small, 0.50 a moderate, and 0.80 
a large effect.43 To enhance comparability with other studies 
we also included the Cohen d based on the pooled baseline 
standard deviation in Table S4 (supplemental material). A sig-
nificance level of P < 0.05 (two-sided) was used throughout 
the study.

RESULTS
Treatment Preference
When asked about treatment preference be-
fore randomization, 47 participants (52.2%) 
named online treatment, 70 (77.8%) face-to-
face treatment, 39 (43.3%) treatment by the 
general practitioner, and 14 (15.6%) sleep 
medication as feasible options (checking 
more than one option was possible). Sig-
nificantly more participants were interested 
in receiving face-to-face treatment than in 
online treatment (P = 0.003).
Completion Rates, Satisfaction and Nonresponse
In the online condition, 15 completed all six sessions, four 
completed five sessions, three completed four sessions, one 
completed three sessions, five completed two sessions, and 
two completed zero sessions. Accordingly, 22 (73.3%) partic-
ipants completed at least four sessions (which has previously 
been described as an adequate dose of this intervention18), 
and 15 participants (50.0%) completed all six sessions. On 
average, the students spent 90.7 min (SD = 47.9) on giving 
feedback per participant for the full online treatment (i.e., all 
six lessons).
In the face-to-face condition, 21 followed all six sessions, 
five followed five sessions, two followed four sessions, one 
followed two sessions, and one followed zero sessions. Ac-
cordingly, 28 participants (93.3%) attended at least four 
sessions, with 21 (70.0%) attending all six sessions. This re-
sulted in an average treatment time of 241.5 min (SD = 60.8). 
The completion rates did not significantly differ between the 
online and face-to-face conditions, four session: χ2 (1) = 4.32; 
P = 0.08; all sessions: χ2 (1) = 2.50; P = 0.19. At post-assess-
ment, mean satisfaction ratings were statistically different, 
F (1. 50) = 17.71; P < 0.001 (range was 1, not satisfied at all, 
to 10, very satisfied), with a mean score of 6.8 (SD = 2.3) in 
the online condition, and of 8.8 (SD = 1.0) in the face-to-face 
condition.
The post-measure was completed by 87% to 97% of the 
participants. Figure 1 presents the percentages among groups 
and the completion rates for the diary and the follow-ups. As 
mentioned in the statistical analysis section of this article, 
participants in the online condition were less likely to fill out 
post-assessment questionnaires if they had high depressive 
symptoms at baseline.
Efficacy: Online and Face-to-Face Versus Wait-List
Both the online (Cohen d = 1.0; P < 0.001) and face-to-face 
(Cohen d = 2.3; P < 0.001) conditions showed stronger reduc-
tions at post-assessment on insomnia severity (ISI) than the 
wait-list condition (Figure 2). The same pattern was observed 
for anxiety (Cohen d = 0.8 / 1.2; P < 0.01), SE (Cohen d = 0.6 / 0.8; 
P < 0.05) and TWT (Cohen d = 0.8 / 0.9; P < 0.01). With regard 
to depressive symptoms, face-to-face treatment was associ-
ated with significantly lower scores at post-assessment (Cohen 
d = 1.2; P < 0.001) than the wait-list condition, whereas no 
significant difference was found between online treatment 
and wait-list at post-assessment. Finally, the active condi-
tions did not significantly differ from the wait-list condition at 
post-assessment regarding TST (Cohen d = 0.4, P = 0.17 and 
Cohen d = 0.3, P = 0.21 for online and face-to-face treatment, 
respectively). See Table 2 for all means, corresponding Cohen 
ds, and significance levels as well as Table S5 (supplemental 
material) for all regression analyses. The data on the treat-
ment completers sample showed highly similar effects to the 
intent-to-treat sample (Table S6, supplemental material). Other 
sleep diary measures are reported in the supplemental material 
(SOL, WASO, TWAK, NWAK and SQ; Table S1).

Online or Face-to-Face Treatment—Lancee et al.
Efficacy: Online Versus Face-to-Face
As compared to patients in the online condition, those in the 
face-to-face condition reported significantly lower ISI scores 
at post-assessment (Cohen d = 0.9), 3-mo (Cohen d = 0.8), 
and 6-mo follow-up assessments (Cohen d = 0.9 all Ps < 0.01), 
respectively (see Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). Further, face-to-
face treatment was significantly more effective in reducing 
comorbid depressive symptoms at post-assessment (Cohen 
d = 0.7; P < 0.05), and at the 6-mo follow-up assessment (Cohen 
d = 0.5; P < 0.05); for anxiety differences were marginally sig-
nificant at the post-assessment (Cohen d = 0.4; P = 0.06), and 
significant at the 3-mo follow-up (Cohen d = 0.5; P < 0.05). 
At post-assessment, no difference was observed for the sleep 
diary, but the face-to-face intervention was more effective at 
the 3-mo (SE: Cohen d = 0.6; TWT: Cohen d = 0.5; P < 0.05), 
and 6-mo follow-up assessments (SE: Cohen d = 0.5; P < 0.05; 
Tables 2, 3, S1, S2, S7, and S8, supplemental material).
Clinical Change
Table 4 displays the insomnia cutoff scores (ISI < 10) and ISI 
clinical change scores (ISI change ≥ 8) for all time points and 
conditions.
Medication and Use of Other Treatment during the Trial
Of the participants who completed the post-assessment, the 
following numbers used prescribed sleep medication: online, 
n = 6 (23.1%), face-to-face, n = 6 (20.7%), wait-list, n = 10 
(38.5%). The proportions did not significantly differ from each 
other, χ2 (2) = 2.51; P = 0.29.
The following participants sought other treatment during 
the trial: online, n = 4 (13.3%; one fitness, one a psychologist, 
and two sleep medication), face-to-face, n = 1 (3.3%; psycholo-
gist), wait-list, n = 8 (26.7%; four sleep medication, two a gen-
eral practitioner, one a psychologist, and one mindfulness).
Deterioration at Post-Assessment
At post-assessment, two participants (6.7%) in the online con-
dition and six participants (20.0%) in the wait-list condition 
reported higher ISI scores at posttreatment than at pretreat-
ment. None of the deteriorations were clinically meaningful 
(change ISI ≥ 8) and no participant in the face-to-face condi-
tion reported higher ISI scores at post-assessment. No adverse 
events were reported by any participant.
DISCUSSION
In this study we investigated the efficacy of a guided online 
treatment and a face-to-face treatment for insomnia. As ex-
pected, both interventions were more effective than the wait-
list group at post-assessment on insomnia severity (ISI), TWT, 
SE, and anxiety. Face-to-face treatment (but not online treat-
ment) was further effective in reducing comorbid depressive 
symptoms as compared to the wait-list. No differences were 
observed between the active conditions and the wait-list on TST.
Contrary to our expectation, face-to-face treatment yielded 
a much stronger effect on insomnia severity (ISI) than the on-
line treatment. Effect size differences between the two inter-
ventions were large at all three measurement points following 
treatment (Cohen d = 0.9). Face-to-face treatment was also su-
perior in terms of clinical change, with about 70% of the par-
ticipants achieving clinically meaningful changes compared 
to about 40% of the participants in the online treatment. The 
same pattern held for the remission rates. About 70% of the 
participants remitted in the face-to-face treatment, whereas 
20% to 40% did (depending on which measurement) in the on-
line treatment.
The effects on the sleep diary measures were less pro-
nounced. No differences emerged between the two interven-
tion conditions at post-assessment. However, follow-up results 
revealed that participants in the face-to-face treatment reported 
more favorable scores in SE (both 3 mo and 6 mo following 
treatment) and TWT (3 mo following treatment only) than par-
ticipants in the online intervention. To illustrate, these effect 
sizes translate to an 11% SE improvement at 6-mo follow-up 
in the online condition and an 18% improvement in the face-to 
face condition.
The superiority of face-to-face treatment was also observed 
with regard to comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. A 
direct comparison of the active conditions revealed that face-
to-face treatment was more effective in reducing depressive 
symptoms as measured at the end of treatment and 6 mo af-
terward (with no difference found 3 mo following treatment). 
Face-to-face treatment was found to be more effective than 
online treatment in addressing comorbid anxiety only at the 
3-mo follow-up.
Taken together, the results of this trial suggest that face-
to-face treatment was substantially more effective than the 
online counterpart. Accordingly, our findings are not in line 
with previous clinical trials on online treatment for somatic 
and other psychiatric disorders.24,25 Furthermore, they are at 
odds with several studies showing that online treatment effects 
for insomnia are up to par with face-to-face delivery,20–22 and 
a study26 comparing online and group treatment for insomnia 
directly. However, in the latter study,26 group treatment instead 
of face-to-face treatment was investigated, and whether group 
treatment is equivalent to face-to-face treatment remains un-
answered.42 A comparison of within-group effects indicated

that the online intervention in the study by Blom and col-
leagues26 was somewhat more effective than in the current 
study (Cohen d = 1.8 compared to Cohen d = 1.5 in the cur-
rent study), whereas the opposite was true for the face-to-face 
intervention (Cohen d = 2.1 compared to Cohen d = 2.8 in the 
current study).
To appraise the implications of these findings, several as-
pects of the current comparative trial warrant discussion. Con-
ceivably, the difference in efficacy between the online and 
face-to-face treatments in our study may be explained by the 
large difference in time investment associated with both ver-
sions of treatment (242 min face-to-face treatment versus 91 
min for online treatment). Another explanation may be that, 
prior to treatment, fewer participants were motivated for on-
line than for face-to-face treatment (52% and 78%, respec-
tively). Moreover, the face-to-face treatment was delivered 
by an insomnia expert, whereas the online treatment was pro-
vided by (supervised) graduate students with limited experi-
ence in psychotherapy.
Accordingly, the current study should not be mistaken for a 
true test of whether it is possible to achieve similar treatment 
effects with different delivery formats. However, we selected 
this design to examine the extent to which online treatment 
can produce significant treatment effects at low costs (i.e., lim-
ited time investment and low level of clinical training). More-
over, had we increased the time investment or used insomnia 
experts, we believe the ecological validity of the comparison 
would have suffered. Furthermore, our design was in line with 
previous online CBT-I trials, including our own, that found 
large treatment effects with feedback provided by students22 
or even fully automated feedback.20,21 Apart from the feedback 
delivery, available online treatments are rather similar with re-
gard to the content (albeit not with the same level of design and 
usage of media possibilities such as videos and animations). 
However, it should be noted that for insomnia self-help, provi-
sion of support seems essential to reaching large effects,18 and 
the effect of support appears to be mediated by an increased 
use of the most important treatment methods such as sleep re-
striction.43 In sum, the quality and intensity of the provided 
feedback may substantially affect outcome.
A further candidate explanation for the difference in treat-
ment effect may be that our online treatment was not up to 
par with previous reported studies. However, this seems un-
likely, as the current online treatment was tested in a previous 
trial18 and yielded treatment effects on insomnia severity that 
were large (Cohen d = 1.0), as compared to the wait-list condi-
tion, and commensurate with those reported in a meta-analysis 
concerning online treatment for insomnia (Cohen d = 0.9).16 
Moreover, we found effect sizes for the sleep diary that were 
also in line with the effects reported in two meta-analyses.16,17 
However, larger effects have been reported in other single trial 
studies.20,21,26 Additionally, the effects sizes regarding anxiety 
(Cohen d = 0.8) and depressive outcomes (Cohen d = 0.4) were 
similar or better than in previous studies.22,44–46
A final potential explanation for the differential effects 
might be that the observed effects in the face-to-face treat-
ment are exceptional. Indeed, the current face-to-face treat-
ment was delivered by an experienced insomnia expert under 
optimal conditions. The current treatment effects on insomnia 
severity (ISI) were superior to the already large effect in 
the group treatment in the study by Blom et al.26 and much 
larger than was found on a recent meta-analysis concerning 
CBT-I in persons with comorbid insomnia (between group 
Cohen d = 2.3 versus Cohen d = 1.2).47 However, treatment 
effects on insomnia severity similar to those observed in the 
current study have been reported previously48,49 and effects 
on the sleep diary were in line with the effects found in meta-
analyses.13,47 Notwithstanding, the use of only one therapist re-
duces the external validity and calls for a replication study in 
which the psychologists are not insomnia experts (but receive 
standard CBT-I training before the trial).
The following limitations of the study need to be addressed. 
First, the ISI scale suffered from low internal consistency in 
our sample. However, the analyses with one item left out pro-
duced a similar internal consistency result as the data on the 
original ISI. Second, as a result of the modest sample size, 
the presented study had limited power to detect differences, 
which may be particularly relevant to the sleep diary out-
comes. Third, a wait-list is not the optimal control condition. 
An online placebo treatment such as employed in the study of 
Espie and colleagues21 or a face-to-face placebo control (e.g., 
sleep hygiene) would have been very informative. Fourth, ob-
jective sleep measurements such as polysomnography would 
have enhanced our findings, but this measurement would have 
required some degree of additional interaction which could 
have compromised the online nature of the treatment. As the 
comparison of online versus face-to-face treatment was the 
primary purpose of this study, we chose to refrain from these 
measurements. Fifth, because restless legs syndrome is as-
sociated with insomnia,50 it could have been assessed in the 
screening. Sixth and finally, the study was conducted on a 
self-selected sample.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our current study shows 
that face-to-face treatment outperformed the online treatment. 
It cannot be ruled out that face-to-face treatment is more effec-
tive by mainly increasing the completion rates, although this 
explanation seems unlikely as the data on the treatment com-
pleters sample show highly similar effects to the intent-to-treat 
sample (Table S7 and S8, supplemental material). The first 
and most important step is now to replicate these results. We 
therefore encourage future studies with similar designs (pref-
erably with an active control condition) to examine whether 
individual face-to-face treatment is indeed more effective that 
online treatment for insomnia.
In conclusion, our results indicate that face-to-face treat-
ment for insomnia is more effective than online treatment. 
Yet, as online treatment also resulted in large effect sizes, our 
findings suggest that online treatment may offer a potentially 
cost-effective51 alternative and complement to face-to-face 
treatment. Indeed, large effect sizes were achieved by the on-
line treatment and these gains were achieved by low-cost labor 
in about 38% of the time investment associated with the face-to-
face treatment. Presumably, this means that the cost of online 
treatment is lower. Furthermore, specifically trained face-to-
face treatment providers may not be generally or sufficiently 
available (e.g., in remote areas). Accordingly, if face-to-face

treatment for individuals with insomnia is (perceived of as) 
not readily accessible, or if is not the client-preferred treat-
ment format, online treatment offers an effective alternative. 
An interesting question for future research is to identify which 
individuals benefit from online treatment versus those who do 
not, and who may require face-to-face treatment, but such re-
search would require (much) larger samples. Alternatively, one 
might envision a stepped care approach, in which individuals 
first receive online treatment and only if indicated subsequent 
face-to-face treatment.15
