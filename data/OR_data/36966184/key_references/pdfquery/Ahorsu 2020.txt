Purpose: Insomnia has adverse effects on people with epilepsy. We aimed to test a novel cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app-based intervention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors 
in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. 
Methods: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and comprised individuals diagnosed with 
epilepsy and having moderate to severe insomnia. A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, 
consisting of a treatment group (CBT-I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). Primary out- 
comes were self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep hygiene behavior and objective sleep char- 
acteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, 
action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and quality of 
life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except 
objective sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. Data were analyzed 
using linear mixed models. 
Results: Current ﬁndings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset 
latency were signiﬁcantly improved in the CBT-I group compared with the patient education group at all mea- 
surement points. Also, the CBT-I group had signiﬁcantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared 
with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that attitude, intention, coping planning, self-mon- 
itoring, and behavioral automaticity signiﬁcantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. 
Conclusion: Results support the use of the CBT-I app to improve sleep outcomes among people with epilepsy. 


Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases globally, 
affecting around 50 million people worldwide [1]. Individuals with epi- 
lepsy often have other physical and mental health conditions [2]. For ex- 
ample, higher incidences of anxiety, depression, and sleep–wake 
disorders are commonly observed in people with epilepsy [2], all of 
which have been shown to be associated with insomnia [2].

Insomnia is characterized by difﬁculty initiating or maintaining 
sleep or early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep 
despite good opportunities for sleep [3]. Insomnia can have signiﬁcant 
negative consequences on a person including disruptions to psychoso- 
cial functioning (e.g., depression, daytime dysfunction, reduced quality 
of life (QoL)) and occupational functioning (e.g., job absence, reduced 
ability to do tasks, lowered job satisfaction, poor decision-making), as 
well as an increased burden on society (e.g., increased health costs, re- 
duced job productivity) [2–4]. Several treatment options have been 
used to manage insomnia in people with epilepsy; however, treatments 
are often dependent on the seizure type, the person's age, preexisting 
medical conditions, and potential side-effect proﬁle [5]. Moreover, in 
Iran, the usual practice for improving sleep hygiene for those who 
have sleep difﬁculties is providing education through the provision of

information sheets [4]. This practice is similar to those used in more de- 
veloped countries, such as the US [6]. Given well-documented evidence 
that information provision alone is not sufﬁcient to change behavior, 
and the wide-spread use and popularity of smartphones, disseminating 
sleep information alongside behavioral change techniques (BCTs) using 
app-based methods, may be a useful way forward to improve the sleep 
of people with epilepsy. 
Indeed, the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app- 
based intervention (for details see Linardon et al. [7]) has shown to be 
effective in improving insomnia symptoms and that may overcome 
many of the challenges of treatment options for those with epilepsy. 
The CBT-I is a versatile program in that it can be held in individual or 
group sessions and either face-to-face or online (app-based), based on 
the therapist's priority, patient's progress, or both [8]. Currently, how- 
ever, there is a lack of evidence for the efﬁcacy of the smartphone-deliv- 
ered CBT-I among people with epilepsy [9], although studies have 
demonstrated promising results among individuals with mental ill- 
nesses [7,10]. 
Building on previous research using CBT-I [11], the aim of this study 
was to test the novel CBT-I app-based intervention on insomnia symp- 
toms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to ex- 
amine the possible mechanisms among the factors. It was expected that 
individuals randomized to the CBT-I group would exhibit greater im- 
provements in insomnia, sleep, and social psychological outcomes at 
the follow-up assessment points compared with participants in the con- 
trol (patient education) group. It was expected that the social psycho- 
logical factors would be higher at follow-up assessment points in the 
CBT-I group compared with the control group, and that relevant beliefs 
about sleep hygiene behaviors as speciﬁed by theory would serve as 
mediators between intervention conditions and sleep behavior at fol- 
low-ups. 

This double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 
people diagnosed with epilepsy who have moderate to severe insomnia 
from August 2018 to October 2019. All procedures were carried out in 
compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study was approved by 
the Regional Science Ethical Committee (Registration No. IR.QUMS. 
REC.1397.129) and preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03683381). 

This study used a two-armed randomized controlled trial design 
with four measurement points to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBT-I 
app-based intervention against a patient education only group on in- 
somnia, sleep, and social psychological outcomes in people with epi- 
lepsy. Participants were recruited from four neurology clinics in 



Tehran and Qazvin, Iran. A list of all people with epilepsy was obtained 
from the clinics. Potential participants were approached by a trained re- 
search assistant (nurse) using short message service (SMS) text and 
fully informed of the purpose of the research. Interested participants 
were then assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the study. Participants 
were eligible to enter the study if they met the following criteria: (1) a 
diagnosis of epilepsy according to the International League Against Ep- 
ilepsy criteria; (2) aged 18 years or older; (3) moderate or severe in- 
somnia as indicated by a score of 15 or higher on the Insomnia 
Severity Index (ISI); (4) speak, understand, and write in Persian; (5) 
no surgery planned in the next 6 months; (6) access to an Android 
smartphone or a desktop computer with Internet access; and (7) ab- 
sence of major cognitive impairment assessed using the Telephone ver- 
sion of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Participants were excluded 
if they (1) were diagnosed with a rapidly progressing neurological or 
medical disorder, (2) had an intellectual disability, (3) reported drug 
or alcohol misuse, (4) had untreated sleep apnea identiﬁed by an over- 
night (manually scored) polysomnography, or (5) were pregnant. 
The participants were ﬁrst screened through an online interest form 
followed by a 20-minute telephone screening and an in-person 
semistructured interview. Through the interview, the inclusion and ex- 
clusion criteria were checked. Eligible participants then received infor- 
mation about the purpose of the study and were invited to participate. 
Participants who returned their signed informed consent form were 
asked to complete online baseline assessments as well as wearing an 
actigraphy watch for a week. All selected participants received a unique 
login username and password to access the CBT-I App. A total of 973 po- 
tential participants were contacted and screened and 512 (52.6%) par- 
ticipants qualiﬁed for this study. The ﬂow of participants in the study 
is shown in Fig. 1. 

(Cohen d = 0.40), with 85% power, at α = 0.05 and 25% dropout rate 
(taken into consideration, at least, 1-month follow-up), a total of 320 
participants were recruited. 

Participants were randomly assigned to the CBT-I or patient educa- 
tion group using 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomization was stratiﬁed 
based on the clinics to avoid potential contamination. Randomization 
was performed by masked biostatistician using SAS 9.2 software. The 
participants, outcome assessors, and statisticians were blinded to 
group assignments. 

The intervention used the CBT-I mobile app [11], which was based 
on principles of prominent psychological theory [14] and self-help con- 
cepts [15]. Speciﬁc BCTs that mapped on to constructs underpinned in 
the theory were integrated into the mobile app, such as information 
about social and environmental consequences, advantages and disad- 
vantages of performing sleep hygiene behaviors, habit formation, 
habit reversal, reconstructing the physical environment, reconstructing 
the social environment, action planning, problem-solving, and self- 
monitoring of behavior. The intervention content was designed to be 
delivered over six weeks with exercises provided each week on the mo- 
bile app. All engagement was online, including any correspondence be- 
tween participant and support assistant (e.g., help needed to address 
challenges in accessing the program on the mobile phone) (see Majd 
et al. [11] for full details). Participants were instructed to engage in 
the content of the mobile app as it was released weekly to help treat 
their insomnia (see Tables 1 and 2 for BCTs and CBT-I content, 
respectively). 

The sample size was calculated based on the effect size of previous 
online interventional studies on insomnia and speciﬁcally ISI [12,13]. 
Hence, using a two-tailed test with a small-to-medium effect size 
The patient education group received standard information on in- 
somnia symptoms every week. This included information on physiolog- 
ical controls of sleep, sleep hygiene practices, healthy sleep behaviors,

Week 1: Providing evidenced-based information on sleep: Adults need more than 7–8 h of sleep per 
night to let the brain obtain full rest. Over one-third of adults have severe daytime sleepiness that 
interferes with work, driving, and social functioning. 
Week 1: Getting participants to think of and weigh-up the advantages of having sufﬁcient sleep and 
the disadvantages of insufﬁcient sleep. For example, sample sentences such as ‘If I sleep enough, I 
will have high performance’ and ‘If I sleep little, I will have health risk, such as high blood pressure’ 
are presented. 
Week 2: Getting participants to build sleep patterns. For example, participants are encouraged to go 
to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekdays and weekend days. Participants 
are also encouraged to make a comfortable bedroom for sleeping through listening to their bodies, 
eating healthy foods, drinking safely, and doing relaxation exercises before sleep. Participants are 
further requested to actively perform at least one of these sleep hygiene behaviors and to write 
down the behavior that they will adopt for the week. 
Week 3: Having participants imagine a comfortable place each night before bedtime. 
Week 2: Getting participants to actively make their bedrooms comfortable for sleeping, including 
appropriate lightening (e.g., dimmed light), temperature (e.g., 24 to 26 °C), and bed texture. 
Week 2: Advising participants to minimize their time usage on social media, and decrease their 
interactions with friends who have heavy drinking or smoking habits. 
Week 5: Getting participants to make two detailed plans regarding sleep hygiene behaviors. For 
example, specifying what the sleep hygiene behavior is, when (day) they will perform it, and where 
(place) they will perform it. 
Week 5: Getting participants to identify potential barriers regrading when they try to sleep. 
Participants then are required to generate strategies to overcome the barriers. For example, ‘If there 
is an important meeting the next day that disrupts my sleep, I will take a warm bath before I go to 
sleep’.

Week 1 focused on providing information. The importance of sleep, the amount of sleep needed, the main causes of insomnia, complications and outcomes of 
insufﬁcient sleep (including short- and long-term), insomnia treatments (e.g., CBT-I), and the prevalence of insomnia in Iran were given. Additionally, participants were 
asked to list the potential costs of poor sleep and the potential beneﬁts of good sleep. At the end of the ﬁrst week, participants were encouraged to use a notebook that 
incorporated in the app's front page to record their sleeping information, including sleep time, wake-up time, and time spent being in bed. 
Week 2 focused on developing good habits for healthy sleep. Participants were taught to identify negative habits which can disrupt sleep, such as smoking, caffeine 
intake close to bed, excessive worrying, and uncomfortable bedroom environment (e.g., a dark, calm, and cool bedroom). Participants were then encouraged to think up 
positive sleep habits to replace these negative sleep habits by reading a list of tips; for example, listening to their bodies, eating healthy foods, drinking safely, and 
engaging in relaxation exercises before sleep. Participants were requested to write down their new habits which they can use for practice in Week 2. Participants were 
also requested to list the habits that interrupt their sleep. At the end of this week, relaxation and meditation exercise techniques were provided in text and audio forms 
with music tracks for the participants to practice. Participants were requested to perform these exercises every night before going to bed in comfortable places (for 
example, in bed) without disturbance (e.g., setting their smartphones to silent mode). 
Week 3 continued relaxation practices. Participants were asked to try and imagine a place where they feel comfortable (e.g., a pleasant place) before bedtime each 
night. In addition, participants were taught how to link the bedroom only with sleep; that is, limiting the amount of time that they spend in bed. Thus, participants were 
taught how to generate a ‘sleep efﬁciency chart’ and use this chart to calculate the amount of time that they are awake at night. Participants were also asked to use this 
chart together with their sleep notes to monitor their sleep performance. At the end of each week (after Week 3), they were able to visualize their sleeping efﬁciency. 
At the beginning of Week 4, participants were asked to monitor their sleep efﬁciency, as was taught in Week 3. The aim of Week 4 was to change misconceptions on 
sleep. A list of common misconceptions with correct information about sleep was provided to participants. Participants were challenged for their misconceptions and 
reviewed the differences between their thoughts and feelings. In addition, participants were encouraged to identify their unhelpful thoughts by writing down the 
information regarding their last time efforts for sleeping in a table, including the situation, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. 
At the beginning of Week 5, participants were asked to review their sleep chart and check their sleep efﬁciency. In addition, participants were requested to write down 
two situations in which they had good or bad sleep in the past week. Moreover, their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that accompanied the situations were requested 
to be written down as well. Participants were then asked to think up plans specifying what (sleep hygiene behaviors), when (day), and where (place) they would sleep. 
They were asked to use a tabular form in the app to write down this information. The app also reminded participants regarding their plans in their recorded sleeping 
information (sleep time, wake up time, and time spent being in the bed) during past night. In addition, participants were encouraged to identify potential barriers that 
might jeopardize their sleep, as well as strategies to overcome the barriers. 
Week 6 focused on relating bed to sleep. Participants learned how to relate bed with sleep. All of the techniques learned in Weeks 1 to 5 (e.g., relaxation, sleep 
education, cognitive restructuring, action planning, and coping planning) were summarized for the participants in the app. During Week 6, paradoxical intention was 
used: participants were asked to sleep for fewer hours than normal sleep for one night to understand that sleep deprivation does not necessarily affect daily functioning. 
At the end of Week 6, participants were asked to keep a sleep diary. 

and changing lifestyle to promote healthy sleeping behaviors. This in- 
formation was presented as separate content from the CBT-I on the mo- 
bile app. Educational information was unlocked on a weekly basis for 
the participants to use and, as such, participants were asked to strictly 
follow the content of the mobile app as it was released weekly to help 
treat their insomnia. After the intervention, participants in control 
group were informed that they could access the CBT-I content of the 
app. 

Primary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality (this scale, Pitts- 
burgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was included after preregistering in 
the ClinicalTrials.gov to further enrich our data and to conform with 
the Iranian neurology clinic protocols), insomnia severity, and sleep hy- 
giene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by 
actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral 
control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automa- 
ticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and QoL. All outcomes were 
measured at baseline, and at one month, three months, and six months 
postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at base- 
line, and one month and six months postintervention. These time- 
frames were chosen to assess the short-, medium-, and long-term ef- 
fects of CBT-I on participant's outcomes, despite the program itself last- 
ing only 6 weeks—based on previous protocols (see Majd et al. [11]). All 
self-reported measures used in this study have been previously vali- 
dated in Persian [11,16–23]. Detailed information on each of the mea- 
sures is described below. Apart from the outcome measures described 
below, detailed information on participants' demographic characteristic 
and especially detailed information on their epileptic conditions such as 
type of seizure, age at onset, interventional types, type of antiepileptic 
drugs (mono/polytherapy), seizure frequency (30-day evaluation on 
both loss of awareness and aura in both partial and generalized sei- 
zures), seizure severity (using Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale), health 
literacy (using eHealth Literacy Scale), and comorbid conditions 
(using Charlson Comorbidity Index). 

The PSQI is a 19-item self-rating questionnaire that can be com- 
pleted within 5 to 10 min. It has seven component scores, which are 
made up of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep ef- 
ﬁciency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime 
dysfunction. Each of these component scores is weighted equally from 
0 to 3 (0, not in the past month; 1, less than once per week; 2, once or 
twice per week; and 3, three or more times per week). A global PSQI 
score is gotten from the sum of all the seven components yielding a 
score from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality 
[16,24]. 

The ISI is a seven-item self-report scale that assesses participants' 
level of insomnia over the past two weeks. All items are rated on a 
ﬁve-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (very se- 
vere problem). A total score is generated by summing up all seven 
items ranging from 0 to 28 with ﬁve subscores: 0–7 (absence of insom- 
nia), 8–14 (subthreshold insomnia), 15–21 (moderate insomnia), and 
22–28 (severe insomnia) [17]. The internal consistency of the ISI in 
this present study was acceptable (α = 0.83). 

Sleep hygiene behavior was assessed using a three-item scale devel- 
oped by Todd and Mullan [25]. The participants were asked to report 
how many days they had good sleep hygiene behavior over the past 
week (‘How many days did you make your bedroom restful over the 
past week?’) and then whether they avoided going to bed feeling hun- 
gry or thirsty, and avoided anxiety and stress-provoking activity before 
bed. Participants were asked to respond on an 8-point scale ranging 
from 0 to 7 [18]. The internal consistency of the sleep hygiene behavior 
scale in this present study was acceptable (α = 0.81). 



Objective sleep characteristics were measured using a wrist 
actigraphy (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc. USA). Actigraphy is a small 
and portable device that records information on movement in 1-minute 
epochs over extended periods of time. Sleep characteristics such as total 
sleep time and sleep efﬁciency were extracted from the wrist actigraphy 
using the Sadeh algorithm. Patients were asked to wear the Actigraph 
on their nondominant wrist for seven consecutive nights in three as- 
sessment periods (i.e., baseline, one month, and six months after base- 
line). A daily sleep diary was also completed assist in interpreting the 
wrist actigraph data. 

Behavioral intention was assessed using a six-item scale (e.g., ‘Over 
the next week, I intend to make my bedroom restful’), adapted from 
Kor and Mullan [26] and previous studies [4,18]. All items were scored 
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally 
agree). 

The extent to which the sleep hygiene behaviors are habitual for an 
individual was assessed using the Self-report Behavioral Automaticity 
Index (SRBAI) [19,27]. The SRBAI for the current study contained four 
items that started with the stem “Sleep hygiene behaviour is some- 
thing…” followed by “I do automatically’, ‘I do without having to con- 
sciously remember’, ‘I do without thinking’, and ‘I start doing before I 
realize I'm doing it’ as used in previous study. 

Action planning was assessed using four items adapted from previ- 
ous studies [4,18,20]. Participants were asked to indicate if they had 
made a detailed plan regarding (i) when, (ii) where, (iii) how, and 
(iv) how often they will perform sleep hygiene behaviors over the 
next six months. All items were scored on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, rang- 
ing from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). 

Coping planning was assessed using ﬁve items (e.g., ‘I have made a 
detailed plan regarding what to do if something interferes with my 
plans’) adapted from previous studies [4,18,20]. All items were scored 
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally 
agree). 

Perceived behavioral control was assessed using three items (e.g., ‘I 
am conﬁdent that every day I can prevent anxiety-provoking activity 
before bedtime’) adapted from previous studies [4,18]. All items were 
scored on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 
5 (totally agree). 

Self-monitoring of behavior was assessed using three items (i.e., “I 
keep track of how much time I spend sleeping”, “I pay attention to 
how tired or rested I feel each day”, and “I take care to note the time 
that I go to bed and wake each day) adapted from a previous study 
[11]. All items were scored on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 
(never) to 5 (always). 

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item scale 
that assesses anxiety (seven items) and depression (seven items) in pa- 
tients with both somatic and mental problems. All items were scored on 
a 0–3 response scale with higher score representing higher levels of 
anxiety and depression [21,22]. 

The Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Inventory (QOLIE-31) is a 31-item 
questionnaire clustered in seven multiitem scales being (a) overall QoL, 
(b) emotional well-being, (c) energy/fatigue, (d) cognitive functioning, 
(e) medication effects, (f) seizure worry, and (g) social functioning and 
one single item on overall health [23,28]. The QOLIE-31 overall score 
was obtained using a weighted average of the multiitem scale scores. 
The scale scores and overall score values range from 0 to 100, where 
higher values reﬂect more favorable states [23,28]. 

The study conformed to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were 
carried out to handle attrition. Descriptive statistics were used to sum- 
marize participant characteristics. To evaluate the magnitude of 
changes in primary and secondary outcomes over time across the two 
groups, linear mixed models (PROCMIXED) were performed. Moreover, 
the linear mixed models controlled for baseline variables and covariates 
(age, gender, education, and severity of seizure) that related to the out- 
come(s). Given the robust estimation (through full information maxi- 
mum likelihood estimation) that handles missing values common in 
repeated measured outcomes (e.g., loss-to-follow in posttreatment), 
the mixed modeling approach is a powerful statistical tool to evaluate 
group differences over time [29]. The analysis incorporated two be- 
tween-participant effects (between groups and between participants 
within groups) and three within-participant effects (between times, 
group by time interactions, and random variation). All p-values were 
two-sided and evaluated as statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level. All 
statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 

Table 3 shows that the demographic characteristics of both CBT-I 
and patient education groups were similar. Speciﬁcally, the mean age 
of the patients with insomnia in the CBT-I group was 38.37 ± 13.45 
years and the mean age of those in the patient education group was 
37.99 ± 9.88 years. Slightly less than half of the participants were

male in each group (39.4% in the CBT-I group and 43.8% in the patient 
education group). The time used by all participants on the mobile app 
was 280 ± 127.16 min, with participants in the CBT-I group evidencing 
signiﬁcantly longer duration of app use (mean 311 ± 154.39 min) com- 
pared with the patient education group (mean 250 ± 111.63 min; p = 
0.004). Thirty-ﬁve (21.88%) and 32 (20%) patients in CBT-I and patient 
education group, respectively were found to be seizure-free over a 30- 
day baseline period. 
The CBT-I group showed rapid improvement in all sleep outcomes 
over time. Further, there were improved health outcomes over time 
for the CBT-I group. The patient education group also showed gradual 
improvement in sleep outcomes over time. Further, there were slight 
differences in health outcomes over time for the patient education 
group (see Table 4). 
There were signiﬁcant intervention effects on the three primary out- 
comes: sleep quality (PSQI), severity of insomnia (ISI), and sleep hy- 
giene behaviors. Speciﬁcally, sleep quality was improved in the CBT-I 
group compared with those in the patient education group at all fol- 
low-up time points (ps b 0.001 for 1, 3, and 6 months). Similar improve- 
ments were observed in severity of insomnia (i.e., a signiﬁcant decrease 
in the severity of insomnia among the CBT-I group compared with those 
in the patient education group at 1, 3, and 6 months following the inter- 
vention, ps b 0.001). Again, for sleep hygiene behaviors, the CBT-I group 
signiﬁcantly engaged in more sleep hygiene behaviors compared with 
those in the patient education group at 1 month (p = 0.002), 3 months

(p = 0.001), and 6 months (p = 0.001) following the intervention. 
Table 5 shows the ﬁndings of the linear mixed models predicting pri- 
mary outcomes between two groups, controlling for age, gender, educa- 
tion, and severity of seizure. 
The results on objective measures of sleep revealed that the CBT-I 
group had better sleep onset latency (ps b 0.001 for 1 month and 6 
months), wake after sleep onset (p b 0.05 for 6 months), and sleep efﬁ- 
ciency (p b 0.01 for 6 months) compared with the patient education 
group. Table 6 shows the ﬁndings of the linear mixed models predicting 
the outcomes between two groups, controlling for age, gender, educa- 
tion, and severity of seizure. 
Regarding the secondary outcomes, analyses indicated that the CBT- 
I group had better outcomes than did the patient education group(for 
detailed information see Appendix Tables 1–5). Mediation analyses fur- 
ther showed that the effects of the CBT-I on the primary outcome of 
sleep hygiene behaviors were mediated by changes in relevant social 
psychological factors toward sleep hygiene behaviors as speciﬁed by 
theory (for detailed information see Appendix Table 6). 

The present study aimed to test a novel CBT-I app-based inter- 
vention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in 
people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms 
among the factors. Results demonstrated support for the CBT-I

intervention in improving sleep outcomes as well as improved social 
cognitions and mental health outcomes. These ﬁndings are consis- 
tent with results of previous studies, which reported that mobile 
apps or internet-delivered CBT-I (or therapy) can be an effective 
method in treating insomnia [7,10,13]. Speciﬁcally, there were mod- 
erate-to-large effect sizes for the self-reported sleep outcomes but 
small effects for the objective actigraphy outcomes. The aforemen- 
tioned ﬁndings indicate that the mobile app CBT-I improves sleep 
problems for people with epilepsy. Moreover, the improvements 
seem to be larger than prior studies using traditional CBT-I to treat 
insomnia for general populations or people with epilepsy [30]. A pos- 
sible reason is that the mobile app CBT-I is more feasible than tradi- 
tional CBT-I as a mobile app was not limited by time or space. 
Therefore, the participants in the present study might gain larger 
beneﬁts of the CBT-I than those using a traditional CBT-I. The ﬁnd- 
ings are important given previous research has demonstrated that 
insomnia impairs the psychosocial and occupational functioning of 
people with epilepsy [2–4]. Thus, it can be concluded that the mobile 
app CBT-I is an effective way to treat insomnia in people with epi- 
lepsy taking into consideration the effect of epilepsy severity, age 
at onset, and antiseizure medication on sleep. Also, current ﬁndings 
suggest effects last in the long-term (i.e., 6 months postinterven- 
tion), an important contribution to the extant literature in this con- 
text as long-term effects of interventions are often not tested. 
Moreover, this study provided novel understandings of the key de- 
terminants in this context. In particular, attitudes, perceived behav- 
ioral control, action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and 
behavioral automaticity were found to be signiﬁcant mediators of 
the intervention effect on sleep hygiene. 
This study has important implications for people with epilepsy 
who have insomnia and highlights that an app-based CBT-I interven- 
tion may be superior to providing information alone. Empirical evi- 
dence has shown that knowledge provision alone often does not 
always translate into behavior change and that interventions based 
on theory may be more effective than interventions that are atheo- 
retical [31]. Also, online interventions are ﬂexible and cost-effective 
to deliver wide-ranging health programs [7,13,32], and demonstrate 
comparable efﬁcacy to nononline interventions [33]. The ﬁndings 
from the current research support that an online, theory-based inter- 
vention is a promising approach to improving sleep and health out- 
comes of people with epilepsy; especially, those who can be 
trained to follow therapeutic instructions online or on the phone. 
In addition, this is the ﬁrst study that examined the possible mecha- 
nisms involved in treating insomnia/sleep problems among people 
with epilepsy [11]. Thus, in as much as the health or psychological 
state is important, clinicians may also look at their attitude, inten- 
tion, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity 
as they do mediate the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. 
These ﬁndings, adding to existing predictive factors of insomnia [34– 
36], would help clinicians such as epileptologists to appreciate the 
need for a holistic view during assessment and treatment. It is also 
worth mentioning that the participants (Iranians) are more collec- 
tivistic-centered and are, therefore, more willing to follow instruc- 
tions from authority ﬁgures than individuals from individualistic- 
centered society [37–39]. Thus, present ﬁndings may not translate 
to individuals from Western, individualistic cultures. 
Key strengths of the current study include the use of a rigorous 
randomized controlled trial design and the recruitment of a clinical 
sample who have moderate to severe insomnia. While the outcomes 
are an extensive range of behavioral and psychological variables 
established to predict sleep outcomes, participants were not repre- 
sentative of the population of Iranian people with epilepsy. For ex- 
ample, participants in the present study needed to use the app to 
receive the intervention. Therefore, people with epilepsy who have 
little literacy in using smartphone or desktop computer or have chal- 
lenges adhering to treatment protocols may not beneﬁt from this 
mobile app CBT-I intervention. However, the online platform was 
useful in that it enabled monitoring of participant progress electron- 
ically and, thus, may have contributed to maintaining participant 
engagement throughout the program. Further, the mean age of par- 
ticipants was around 38 years; thus, ﬁndings may not generalize to 
younger or older samples. In addition, although the participants 
were blinded to group assignment, they could not be blinded to the 
intervention. Therefore, placebo effects on results cannot be ex- 
cluded. However, given the sustained effects across the six-month 
follow-up, it is reasonable to conclude that the CBT-I is an effective 
program to treat insomnia among people with epilepsy. Future stud- 
ies would, therefore, beneﬁt from examining intervention effects 
among younger and older people with epilepsy. Furthermore, we 
did not assess change in antiepileptic drugs use across the interven- 
tion, which may provide informative knowledge to clinicians about 
the relationship between the intervention and antiepileptic drugs 
use, an area for future research to explore. 

The results of the present study demonstrated that CBT-I has promis- 
ing effects in treating sleep problems for people with epilepsy. The inter- 
vention proved successful in improving sleep quality, insomnia severity, 
sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency in those that received 
the CBT-I compared with those that only received patient education, 
and across all measurement points. Also, the CBT-I group had signiﬁcantly 
improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient educa- 
tion group. Further, mediation analyses showed attitude, intention, cop- 
ing planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity signiﬁcantly 
mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. Healthcare 


professional can, therefore, apply the CBT-I in their treatment programs 
with people with epilepsy that have insomnia.
