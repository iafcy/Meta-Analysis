Abstract 
Introduction: Guidelines recommend cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the first line of treatment for 
insomnia in general practice, but CBT-I is rarely available. 
Nurse-guided Internet-delivered CBT-I might be a solution 
to improve access to care. Objective: We aimed to determine 
the effectiveness of nurse-guided Internet-delivered CBT-I 
(I-CBT-I) on insomnia severity experienced by patients in 
general practice. Methods: Nurse-guided I-CBT-I (“i-Sleep”) 
was compared to care-as-usual (and I-CBT-I after 6 months) 
in 15 participating general practices among 134 patients 
( 
18 years old) with clinical insomnia symptoms. Assess- 
≥ 
ments took place at 8, 26 and 52 weeks. Primary outcome 
was self-reported insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity In- 
dex) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were sleep diary indi- 
ces, depression and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale), fatigue, daytime consequences of insom- 
nia, sleep medication and adverse events. Results: Two 
thirds of the 69 intervention patients (n = 47; 68%) complet- 
ed the whole intervention. At the posttest examination, 
there were large significant effects for insomnia severity (Co- 
hen’s d = 1.66), several sleep diary variables (wake after sleep 
onset, number of awakenings, terminal wakefulness, sleep 
efficiency, sleep quality) and depression. At 26 weeks there 
were still significant effects on insomnia severity (d = 1.02) 
and on total sleep time and sleep efficiency. No significant 
effects were observed for anxiety, fatigue, daily functioning 
or sleep medication. No adverse events were reported. Con- 
clusions: Nurse-guided I-CBT-I effectively reduces insomnia 
severity among general practice patients. I-CBT-I enables 
general practitioners to offer effective insomnia care in ac- 
cordance with the clinical guidelines.

With prevalence rates between 7 and 10% in the gen- 
eral population [1], clinical insomnia is the second most 
prevalent mental disorder [2]. In general practice, fatigue 
and sleeplessness are respectively the first and third most 
reported complaints, and insomnia is estimated to occur 
in as many as 30% of general practice patients [1, 3]. In- 
somnia leads to a high disease burden on its own but also 
increases the risks of developing other psychiatric prob- 
lems [4, 5] and cardiovascular diseases [6]. Insomnia, and 
its comorbid problems, leads to high societal costs, main- 
ly due to productivity losses [7, 8]. 
Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) 
is an evidence-based treatment with large effects on in- 
somnia severity (demonstrated in several meta-analyses, 
e.g. Hedges’ g = 0.98 [9]). CBT-I is recommended by (in- 
ter)national guidelines [10–13] as the first treatment op- 
tion for insomnia. In general practice, somewhat smaller 
effects are reported, but still in the moderate range (Hedg- 
es’ g = 0.40 [14]). Despite these moderate effects and the 
guideline recommendations, sleep medication is still the 
most commonly used treatment in general practice: 60% 
of new insomnia patients generally only receive medica- 
tion [15]. Even though general practitioners (GPs) ac- 
knowledge the importance of CBT-I, they lack the time 
and/or knowledge to offer it themselves and there is a lack 
of CBT-I trained therapists to refer to [16]. Internet-de- 
livered CBT-I (I-CBT-I) presents a promising way to in- 
crease the availability of CBT-I and to enable GPs to ad- 
here to insomnia guideline recommendations. 
Internet treatments usually consist of a number of les- 
sons in which an evidence-based intervention is ex- 
plained. This might be text-based, video-based or a mix- 
ture. Another core feature is that patients receive assign- 
ments. They need to apply techniques they read about in 
the online lessons to their own daily lives. The treatment 
might be offered without any support, but we know that 
the adherence and effects are better when it is offered with 
some type of support [17]. In general, guided Internet 
treatments seem as effective as face-to-face treatments 
[18], and this is also demonstrated for I-CBT-I [19, 20]. 
However, these results are mostly based on self-selected, 
specifically recruited online samples of help seekers [19, 
21]. It is not known whether I-CBT-I also works among 
patients in a routine general practice. This is what we 
want to examine in the current study. 
In the Netherlands almost all GPs employ a mental 
health nurse practitioner. Those nurse practitioners pro- 
vide psychosocial support or treatment for people with 
mild mental health symptoms. They vary in their back- 
ground and training but most often they are either mental 
health nurses or recently graduated psychologists. In this 
study we refer to them as “nurses.” The nurses delivered 
the I-CBT-I and provided online feedback. We opted for 
nurse practitioners because not enough trained psycholo- 
gists are available in the Netherlands. More importantly, 
in the Dutch health care system, patients who are referred 
to a psychologist because of insomnia have to pay for 
treatment out of pocket. The care provided by nurses in 
general practice falls under the GP care and is fully reim- 
bursed. Therefore, this is more feasible for offering in- 
somnia treatment to patients. 
The primary objective of this pragmatic randomized 
controlled trial was to assess whether nurse-guided I- 
CBT-I is effective in routine general practice compared 
to care as usual (CAU) on insomnia severity. Second- 
arily, sleep diary indices, mental health complaints and 
daily functioning were assessed. Effects were studied im- 
mediately after treatment (posttest; 8 weeks), after 26 
weeks and (in the intervention group only) after 52 
weeks. 

Research Design 
This 2-arm, pragmatic randomized clinical trial compared I- 
CBT-I to CAU. Patients in the intervention group were also al- 
lowed to receive CAU. Patients in the control group received the 
intervention after the 26-week assessment if they still wanted it. 
Randomization charts were made for each nurse separately, us- 
ing random sequence block randomization (blocks of 2, 4 or 6) 
on a 1: 1 ratio and stratified by sleep medication use. Participants 
were randomized using randomization charts created by an in- 
dependent researcher. A second independent researcher per- 
formed the randomization. The primary researcher (T.Z.) was 
blinded to treatment allocation. After allocation, the primary re- 
searcher, participants, nurses and GPs were informed of the ran- 
domization outcome. Participants in CAU were informed they 
would be offered I-CBT-I after 6 months. GPs strongly requested 
also being informed when patients were randomized to CAU so 
they could offer other treatments and patients would not be left 
on their own. The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU Medical 
Centre Amsterdam approved this trial (registration No. 
2015/258), and it was registered with the Dutch Trial Registry 
(NTR5202, April 17, 2015). The detailed protocol is available 
elsewhere [22]. 
Power 
In the original protocol we calculated our power based on an 
independent t test. To ensure 80% statistical power with a 2-sided 
α-value of 0.05, assuming a conservative effect size of Cohen’s d = 
0.50 on the primary outcome insomnia severity [23] and expecting 
a risk of 20% dropout [24], we aimed to include 160 participants. 






When we analyzed the data, we decided it was more appropriate 
to employ a statistical procedure taking baseline levels into ac- 
count. Based on this within-between group analysis and the 
achieved sample size (n = 134), we obtained a power of 0.8 (α = 
0.05) to detect an effect size of d = 0.24. 
Recruitment 
Recruitment leaflets were distributed in print and on screens in 
waiting rooms. GPs and nurses were asked to alert all possible eli- 
gible insomnia patients who consulted them to the trial. GPs and 
nurses received laminated summaries of the trial and how to ex- 
plain it to patients, to use during consultations. Additionally, GPs 
sent invitation letters and leaflets to patients who had consulted 
them for insomnia in the past year. All recruitment materials re- 
ferred patients to our study website which explained the study in 
more detail. Patients could leave their e-mail address to show that 
they were interested. They then received an e-mail with a link to a 
screening questionnaire. Eligible patients received all information 
in printed form, a sleep diary, informed consent form and stamped 
return envelope. Patients were randomized after returning the 
completed sleep diary and informed consent. The inclusion period 
was extended from originally 18 months to 30 months. We ended

inclusion in April 2018, at 134 of the planned 160 participants for 
pragmatic reasons (Fig. 1 for a flow chart).1 
Eligibility Criteria 
Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18 years or older; (2) reporting lying 
awake for ≥30 min a night for ≥3 nights per week for ≥3 months; 
and (3) causing clinically significant distress or impairment in dai- 
ly functioning. The duration and frequency of insomnia com- 
plaints were assessed in an online screening questionnaire. The 
consequences during the day were assessed with the Daytime Con- 
sequences items [25]. This scale assesses 6 domains of function- 
ing: energy, relationships, mood, concentration, productivity and 
sleepiness. Each domain was measured using a 5-point Likert scale 
(0 = not disturbed, 4 = very disturbed). We defined daytime con- 
sequence as scoring at least a 3 on one of the domains. These inclu- 
sion criteria (sleep complaints and consequences for daily func- 
tioning) were chosen because they resemble the DSM-5 criteria for 
an insomnia disorder [26]. Exclusion criteria were: (1) no access to 
the Internet; (2) inadequate proficiency in Dutch; (3) meeting 
sleep apnea criteria; (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) working 
night shifts; (6) other current psychological treatment; (7) suicidal 
ideation or (8) schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. In order to 
identify sleep apnea, we used the Screening for Sleeping Disorders 
questionnaire [27]. Patients with a positive score for suspected un- 
treated sleep apnea (reporting snoring, breathing stops and exces- 
sive daytime sleepiness) were excluded. Suicidal ideation over the 
past month was assessed using 5 MINI diagnostic interview items 
in the self-report screening questionnaire (e.g., thoughts about sui- 
cide, making plans or attempting suicide) [28]. Patients in both 
groups were allowed to use sleep medication and over-the-counter 
sleep aids without restrictions. 
General Practices 
At first, we recruited general practices through the Academic 
Network of General Practices (n = 8). This is a structural collabo- 
ration between a number of general practices in the Amsterdam 
area and the department of General Practice at Amsterdam Uni- 
versity Medical Centre. Due to low inclusion rates, we sought ad- 
ditional practices outside Amsterdam during the trial (n = 7). 
There were around 50 GPs working in the 15 participating gen- 
eral practices. 
The GP practices employed mental health nurses with either a 
university degree in psychology (62%) or higher vocational train- 
ing as a psychiatric nurse (38%). Their average age was 51 (SD = 
11, range 32–64 years) Their clinical experience ranged from 6 
months to 15 years (mean = 6.9 years, SD = 5). Most of them re- 
ported some experience with e-Health (77%), 8% reported little 
experience and 15% no experience. 
1 Due to the low inclusion rates and difficulty reaching our envisioned sam- 
ple size, we made several changes to the protocol along the course of the 
trial. First, we changed an exclusion criterion. Originally, the protocol was 
to exclude patients who had psychological treatment (for insomnia or other 
complaints) in the past 6 months. We switched to excluding only patients in 
current psychological treatment. Patients previously excluded for this reason 
(n = 3) were invited to participate again (of whom 2 did). Second, we initially 
recruited only patients who consulted their GP for insomnia prospectively. 
We switched to GPs actively screening electronic medical records and invit- 
ing all patients who had consulted their GP in the last year to our screening 
questionnaire. Third, we dropped actigraphy measures early on in the trial 
because these led to considerable logistic difficulties. 
Intervention 
The i-Sleep intervention was developed by the first, second and 
last authors and is based on CBT-I [29–33]. i-Sleep consists of 5 
lessons. Each lesson consists of information which is offered in text 
format as well as video. Furthermore, every lesson includes a ficti- 
tious and a real-life case example (also in text format and video). 
After every lesson the patient needs to fill out “homework” (sleep 
diary and e.g. setting bedtimes). Lesson 1 focused on psychoeduca- 
tion about healthy and disordered sleep and sleep hygiene. In les- 
son 2, stimulus control is introduced (getting out of bed when 
awake for > 15 min, using the bed for sleep and sexual activity only) 
and patients start sleep restriction therapy. Lesson 3 teaches relax- 
ation and minimizing worrying. Lesson 4 is aimed at tackling dys- 
functional cognitions about sleep. The fifth and final lesson invites 
the participant to make a summary of lessons learned and con- 
struct a relapse prevention plan. 
Participants were advised to complete one lesson per week and 
received online coaching from the nurse in their own general prac- 
tice. The aim of the feedback was to motivate patients to carry on, 
to offer explanations if needed and to comment on the completed 
exercises. Patients had the possibility to ask the nurses additional 
questions (online). Nurses received approximately 1.5 h of training 
from the first author (T.Z.) on how to guide i-Sleep and back- 
ground knowledge about sleep and treatment. Every nurse first 
treated a mock patient under supervision (T.Z.), using the feedback 
manual created for this trial. Further supervision was offered on an 
as-needed basis, assessed by regular phone calls and e-mail contact 
(T.Z.). Nurses reported spending between 5 and 20 min per patient 
per session on providing online feedback. Feedback was program- 
prompted: all participants received feedback on all completed ses- 
sions. The intervention did not include face-to-face contact and 
was provided at no cost to participants. Intervention group par- 
ticipants were free to receive other GP care as needed. The i-Sleep 
intervention is not primarily aimed at tapering or discontinuing 
medication but does discuss the (dis)advantages of medication. Pa- 
tients are advised to contact their GP if they want to reduce or quit. 
A previous study has shown that the i-Sleep intervention is effective 
among insomnia patients recruited in the general population [21]. 
CAU Control Condition 
GPs participating in this study received a printed version of the 
most recent Dutch insomnia guidelines for GPs [10] to promote a 
similar knowledge level on guidelines among participating prac- 
tices. We did not otherwise interfere with CAU as offered by GPs. 
We reported to GPs which patients were randomized to CAU and 
invited these participants to use i-Sleep 6 months after randomiza- 
tion. 
Measurements 
Timing of the Assessments 
Assessment took place at baseline (week 0), after treatment 
(week 8), at 26 weeks and 52 weeks. After the third assessment (26 
weeks), the CAU patients were offered the i-Sleep treatment (n = 
37 [57%] accepted). The 52-week follow-up is uncontrolled. This 
follow-up aimed to determine whether effects in the intervention 
group are sustained over time. 
Primary Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity In- 
dex [34] (ISI; range 0–28). The ISI contains 7 items scored on a 





5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely). The ISI is a reli- 
able instrument possessing adequate internal consistency (Cron- 
bach’s α = 0.90 [35]) and was validated for online use [36]. Clini- 
cally significant improvement is defined as a change of ≥8 points, 
a clinical cutoff of ISI > 10 is used to define patients with clinical 
insomnia symptoms [35]. 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
We used a pen-and-paper version of the Dutch translation of 
the Carney consensus diary [37] to estimate several sleep charac- 
teristics: sleep onset latency (SOL; number of minutes it takes to 
fall asleep), sleep efficiency (SE; 0–100%; total sleep time divided 
by the total time in bed), number of awakenings (NWAK), wake 
after sleep onset (WASO; total minutes awake after sleep onset), 
terminal wakefulness (TWAK; time spent awake in bed before get- 
ting up), total sleep time (TST) and sleep quality (SQ; rated 1–5 
each night). Participants completed 7-day diaries at each assess- 
ment, aggregated into week averages for analysis. Diaries with at 
least 5 days completed were included in the analysis. 
We used the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to 
assess anxiety and depression [38, 39]. Each item is scored on a 
scale of 0–3, and the total scores thus range from 0 to 21 for both 
the Anxiety and the Depression scales. 
Daytime functioning (energy, relationships, mood, concentra- 
tion, productivity and sleepiness) was measured using a 5-point 
scale (0–4; range 0–24) for each of the 6 items of the Daytime Con- 
sequences items [25]. We used the Work and Social Adjustment 
Scale to measure 4 domains of functioning (household tasks, work 
productivity, close relationships and social life) [40]. Each domain 
is measured on a scale of 0–8. Fatigue was measured with the Fa- 
tigue Severity Scale [41] which consists of 7 items (scored 1–7). The 
total score ranges from 7 (no fatigue) to 49 (severely fatigued). 
Finally, we assessed the use of sleep medication and antidepres- 
sant use. These data were collected both by direct reporting by 
participants and by examining the electronic medical records of 
the participants, separately. Due to privacy regulations we could 
not cross-check the medication use and therefore we report on 
both self-report (at the different assessments) and GP records 
(covering the complete inclusion period). From GP records we 
extracted whether patients had received at least one prescription 
during the assessment period (between baseline and follow-up at 
26 weeks) of benzodiazepine derivatives (N05CD, N05BA), ben- 
zodiazepine-related drugs (N05CF) or antidepressants (N06A), 
using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification of the 
World Health Organization (www.whocc.no/atc). From these re- 
cords we could not determine whether a patient’s use had declined 
over the course of the trial, hence we additionally asked patients to 
report medication use at all assessments (“Have you used sleep 
medication in the past 4 weeks?” – yes/no). 
Participants were asked to report (minor) falls, traffic accidents 
and other adverse events (“Did anything unpleasant happen to you 
that was related to your sleep or participation in the trial?”) at each 
assessment. If yes, they were asked to describe what happened and 
whether any medical or psychological assistance was needed.2 
Statistical Analysis 
We performed intent-to-treat analyses (i.e., on all 134 included 
participants, irrespective of whether treatment was completed) 
[42]. We performed generalized mixed multilevel (patient and 
condition) regression analysis to evaluate the effects of time (with- 
in-group), condition (between-group) and the interaction be- 
tween time × condition (between-group). For normally distribut- 
ed outcomes regular linear mixed regressions using identity links 
were used, and mixed negative binomial regression analyses with 
a log link otherwise. To assess differences in change in outcomes 
between the two conditions, we performed a series of two-level 
(participants and time points) repeated-measures analyses in two 
separate models: one to assess change in outcome from pre- to 
posttest assessment and one assessing change in outcomes from 
pre- to 26 weeks follow-up. Assuming data were missing at ran- 
dom, we applied an unstructured covariance matrix as most fitting 
to the data [43]. Baseline characteristics significantly predicting 
dropout were added to the model as covariates (daytime conse- 
quences and sex). Baseline differences between the two conditions 
were not tested for statistical significance [44]. Between-group Co- 
hen’s d effect sizes were calculated by calculating the pre-post 
change scores for both groups and calculating the difference. We 
then divided these by the pooled standard deviations observed at 
baseline [45]. 
We also compared the percentage of patients recovered (ISI 
below clinical cutoff of 11) or showing clinically significant im- 
provement on the primary outcome (ISI; defined as a change of ≥8 
points) [35] between the intervention and control group at posttest 
examination and at 26 weeks follow-up. For the uncontrolled 52- 
week follow-up, within-group effect sizes were calculated based on 
observed means. For all statistical analyses, the two-sided signifi- 
cance level was set at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS for 
Windows 25. 
Changes to Protocol 
We made two changes to our original protocol [22] both with 
the intention to enhance recruitment. In the original protocol the 
recruitment strategy was described as GPs inviting patients during 
a face-to-face consultation for sleep problems. We added a direct 
mailing of all patients who had consulted the GP for sleep prob- 
lems in the last year. Furthermore, in the original protocol we de- 
scribed that we would exclude patients who received prior or cur- 
rent psychological treatment. We changed this to excluding pa- 
tients only for current, not prior, psychological treatment. 

Participants 
The final sample consisted of 134 adults, randomized 
to i-Sleep (n = 69) or the CAU control group (n = 65; 
Fig. 1 for a flowchart).3 The mean age was 50.6 (SD = 
2 We did not report on data on alcohol use as per protocol due to a technical 
error in the data collection procedure that led to a lot of missing data. One 
of the originally 5 items of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale is miss- 
ing for the same reason (we report on the other 4 and not on a total score). 
3 Further details on the analysis are available from the first author (i.e., tables 
with regression coefficients, observed means and observed within-group ef- 
fect sizes).

15.9), 65% of the sample was female and 87% was born in 
the Netherlands (Table 1). In the i-Sleep condition, 47 
participants (68%) completed the intervention, and 22 
(32%) did not (8 did not start and 14 dropped out during 
treatment). The study response rate (providing data) was 
83% (n = 111) at the posttest assessment, 80% (n = 107) 
at 26 weeks and 62% (n = 43, intervention group only) at 
52 weeks. Contributions to data did not differ significant- 
ly between conditions (8 weeks: χ2 = 0.28, p = 0.60; 26- 
week follow-up: χ2 = 0.817, p = 0.37). At baseline, the av- 
erage insomnia score (ISI = 18.9) refers to moderate clin- 
ical levels of insomnia. There were no patients without 
insomnia (as defined by ISI scores < 11), 17 patients (13%) 
reported subthreshold clinical insomnia (ISI < 14), 80 re- 
ported moderate-severe (60%; ISI 15–21) and 37 reported 
severe insomnia (28%; ISI 22–28). At baseline, sleep med- 
ication was used by 33% (i-Sleep group) versus 39% (con- 
trol group) of the participants. The average score on anx- 
iety was 8.16 which indicates subclinical levels of anxiety 
(> 11 indicative of anxiety disorder) [38]. The average 
score on depression was 6.21 which indicates subclinical 
levels of depression (> 11 indicative of depressive disor- 
der) [38]. Of all patients, 20 (15%) scored above the anx- 
iety cutoff, and 13 patients (10%) scored above the de- 
pression cutoff [39]. 
Primary Outcome: Effect on ISI 
Multilevel regression analyses showed significant 
time × condition interaction effects for the ISI, from pre- 
to posttest assessment, F1, 88 = 29.62, p < 0.001, dbetween = 
1.66 and from pre-examination to follow-up at 26 weeks, 
F1, 74 = 10.65, p = 0.002, dbetween = 1.02 (Fig. 2). This indi- 
cates that I-CBT-I resulted in participants experiencing a 
greater improvement in insomnia severity than CAU pa- 
tients from pre- to postassessment and from preassess- 
ment to 26-week follow-up. See Table 2 for confidence 
intervals. The intervention group more often reported a 
clinically significant improvement (improvement on ISI 
score ≥8 points) than patients in the control group at the 
posttest assessment (56 vs. 12%) and at 26 weeks (46 vs. 
11%; Table 3). 
Secondary Outcomes: Effect on Sleep Diary Indices 
Multilevel regression analyses showed significant 
time × condition interaction effects at the posttest assess- 
ment for the sleep diary variables: WASO, F1, 94 = 14.09, 
p < 0.001, dbetween = 0.54; NWAK, F1, 102 = 11.32, p ≤ 
0.001, dbetween = 0.43; TWAK, F1, 96 = 5.84, p = 0.018, 
dbetween = 0.31; SQ, F1, 90 = 5.23, p = 0.025, dbetween = 0.52 
and SE, F1, 112 = 17.23, p < 0.001, dbetween = 0.61. This in- 
dicates that participants in the i-Sleep condition showed 
more improvement on time spent awake in bed and sleep 
efficiency than patients receiving CAU at the posttest as- 
sessment. No significant differences were observed for 
SOL, TST or sleep quality. At 26 weeks of follow-up, sig- 
nificant interaction effects of time × condition were ob- 
served for SE, F1, 103 = 5.55, p = 0.02, dbetween = 0.41, and 
TST, F1, 99 = 5.89, p = 0.017, dbetween = 0.41 (Table 2).

Secondary Outcomes: Effect on Mood, Anxiety, 
Fatigue and Daily Functioning 
Multilevel regression analyses showed a significant 
time × condition interaction effect at the posttest assess- 
ment for depression, F1, 103 = 5.28, p = 0.024, dbetween = 0.37, 
but no statistically significant time × condition effects on 
anxiety, fatigue, daytime consequences or daily function- 
ing (Work and Social Adjustment Scale items: household

tasks, work productivity, close relationships and social 
life). At 26 weeks of follow-up, no significant interaction 
effects were observed for any of the secondary outcomes. 
Both conditions improved significantly over time on these 
measures of mental health and daytime functioning. 
Secondary Outcomes: Medication 
There were no significant differences in sleep medica- 
tion use, as reported by patients themselves, between the 
intervention and CAU group at baseline (33 vs. 39%, p = 
0.54) or at the posttest assessment (20 vs. 23% p = 0.96). 
At the 26-week follow-up, twice as many patients in the 
control group used medication (29%) than in the inter- 
vention group (13%). However, this difference is not sta- 
tistically significant (p = 0.75). At the 52-week follow-up, 
10 i-Sleep participants (23%) used sleep medication. GP 
records showed that over the complete trial period 30% 
used sleep medication (25% benzodiazepine derivatives, 
5% Z drugs) in the i-Sleep condition versus 47% of the 
control group (40% benzodiazepine derivatives, 7% Z 
drugs). Antidepressants were used by 12% of i-Sleep par- 
ticipants over this period, versus 25% in the control group. 
One-Year Uncontrolled Follow-Up 
Within-group effect sizes in the i-Sleep condition in- 
dicate that the effects were sustained at 52 weeks of fol- 
low-up (dwithin ranging from 1.69 [ISI] to 0.23 [SOL]); 
however, the response rate at 52 weeks of follow-up was 
quite low (62%). 
Adverse Events 
No serious adverse events (warranting psychological 
or medical care) were reported. At the posttest assess- 
ment, one CAU participant mentioned a surgery for un- 
related medical reasons. 

This pragmatic randomized controlled trial showed 
that nurse-guided I-CBT-I is effective in general practice 
in reducing insomnia symptoms. The study showed that 
I-CBT-I is feasible and can be used in general practice 
with support from nurses. The intervention yielded large 
effect sizes compared to CAU on insomnia severity (d = 
1.66 after treatment, and d = 1.02 after 26 weeks). These 
effects remained at the 52-week follow-up. We also dem- 
onstrated significant secondary effects at the posttest as- 
sessment (sleep diary WASO, NWAK, TWAK, SQ, and 
depressive symptoms) and 26-week follow-up (TST and 
SE). No significant effects were observed on the other sec- 
ondary outcomes, anxiety, fatigue, daytime consequences 
or sleep medication. 
Our aim was to test whether I-CBT-I’s effects would 
stand the test in a general practice population. One of our 
hypotheses was that patients actively seeking help from 
their GP would be different than those who respond to 
online advertisement for insomnia treatment. However, 
when comparing the baseline scores of our population to 
those of other studies among the general population we 
do not see many differences. The participants in our trial 
were suffering from relatively severe insomnia (mean 
baseline ISI score 18.9 in our sample) but the same is the 
case in, for example, the online study of Kaldo et al. [46] 
(baseline ISI score 16.8) or Lancee et al. [47] (baseline ISI 
score 18.2). Baseline sleep efficiency (66% in our trial) was 
also very similar to the ones reported by Kaldo et al. [46] 
(71%) and Lancee et al. [47] (64%). Furthermore, 15% of 
our population scored above the cutoff on our anxiety 
questionnaire and 10% did so for depression. This also 
seems to indicate that our population did not suffer sub- 
stantially more often from comorbid mental disorders 
than those who are recruited in the general population. 
All this does not necessarily mean that people who ac- 
tively seek help are similar to those who do not. They 
might be different on aspects we did not measure, e.g. the 
extent of social support, or their personality traits. It is 
important that we showed that I-CBT-I can be effectively 
delivered in general practice because in many countries 
the GP functions as a gatekeeper and is the first person to 
go to when looking for help for insomnia. This online in- 
tervention enables GPs to offer insomnia care according 
to the current clinical guidelines. Support costs relatively 
little time (on average 1.5 h per patient) and does not have 
to be delivered by highly trained (psychological) profes- 
sionals but can be offered by people with a higher voca- 
tional background after a short training: in this case sup- 
port was effectively executed by the nurses employed in 
the general practice. 
We included not only sleep outcomes, but also other rel- 
evant secondary outcomes. Surprisingly, on many of these 
indices no effect of I-CBT-I was observed, a finding only 
partly in line with other trials. For instance, CBT-I often 
also has beneficial effects for depression and anxiety com- 
plaints [48–50]. We were able to replicate the effect at the 
posttest assessment for depressive complaints but this was 
no longer detected at the 26-week follow-up. The relatively 
low level of severity of depression in our sample might ex- 
plain the lack of mental health effects. Our sample may have 
consisted of people with an isolated insomnia problem not 





(yet) generalized to other areas of mental health (i.e., only 
10% suffered from depression). Our participants did show 
considerable baseline impairments in daytime functioning. 
Most studies observe improvements in daytime function- 
ing after insomnia treatment [20, 25]. We did not find a 
significant effect but the effect sizes for the various domains 
of functioning are between d = 0.21 and d = 0.39. A possible 
explanation for the lack of significance is that the study was 
underpowered to detect these clinically relevant effects, al- 
though by adding baseline measurements to the analysis we 
have likely increased power [51]. 
It remains difficult to understand that the intervention 
showed large effects on insomnia but not on fatigue. Fa- 
tigue is one of the most frequently reported symptoms of 
patients seeking help from insomnia. However, a recent 
meta-analysis into the effect of insomnia treatments on 
fatigue also concludes that there is no effect [50]. Impor- 
tantly, this meta-analysis indicates that there is a high het- 
erogeneity between studies indicating that some are more 
successful than others. At the moment, the association be- 
tween sleep and fatigue is still poorly understood. We def- 
initely need more research to uncover the (un)shared 
mechanisms. Network intervention analysis could be used 
in order to shed light on the treatment effects on individ- 
ual symptoms, since insomnia, fatigue and daytime symp- 
tom questionnaires are prone to overlap somewhat [52]. 
The assessments of sleep medication and antidepres- 
sant use were complicated, due to the combination of self- 
report and GP data which we could not link. Moreover, a 
prescription is not necessarily the same as usage. Using a 
more reliable measure (such as sophisticated bottle cap 
chips counting numbers of pills taken) was not feasible in 
this trial. Even though there are no significant differences, 
both the GP data and the self-report data indicate less use 
of sleep medication (and antidepressants) in the interven- 
tion group than in the control group. At 26 weeks the 
control group reports more than twice (29%) as much 
sleep medication use than the intervention group (13%), 
which is a promising result which needs to be replicated 
in larger trials. Previous research has indeed indicated 
that CBT-I can have favorable effects on sleep medication 
use and can facilitate the discontinuation process [53]. 
Our trial has several strong features. First of all, that it 
was a pragmatic trial. We showed that it is feasible to im- 
plement an I-CBT-I treatment in routine GP care. Fur- 
thermore, we showed that the treatment is acceptable for 
patients. A large majority (68%) completed the treatment 
fully, which is higher than often observed in online treat- 
ment for insomnia [24]. Adherence might even be raised 
by adding a face-to-face session before the start of the 
treatment or by offering it in a blended way (online and 
face-to-face sessions). This might depend on the individ- 
ual patients’ motivation and other characteristics. Anoth- 
er strong feature is our high assessment response rate 
(Fig. 1). About 80% completed the posttest measurement. 
A limitation of our study is the slow inclusion rate and 
the early termination of inclusion before we reached our 
desired sample size which has consequences for the pow- 
er of the secondary analyses in particular. The low inclu- 
sion rate was partly due to time and resource constraints 
in general practice. Although the participating GPs and 
nurses were highly motivated and enthusiastic about hav- 
ing an alternative treatment to offer insomnia patients 
other than or in addition to medication, the trial was not 
always mentioned during (insomnia-related) GP consul- 
tations which may have lowered inclusion rates. GP 
awareness and involvement should be a strong focus 
point in future research. An additional limitation is that 
polysomnographic measurements were not feasible in 
this research setting. Although we deem subjective mea- 
sures of this psychological problem to be most important, 
as is reflected by the DSM-5 nosology [26], it would have 
been valuable to have polysomnographic data in addi- 
tion. We aimed to include actigraphy data, but unfortu- 
nately this also turned out not to be feasible. The research 
context likely influenced uptake as well. Patients may 
have been hesitant to take part in a trial and could be more 
willing to undergo I-CBT-I through their GP outside of 
the research setting. A related limitation is the use of a 
CAU control condition [54]. We had expected that GPs 
would have provided more care (e.g., medication, sleep 
hygiene advice, referral to a psychologist or physiothera- 
pist) since we explicitly handed over the most recent in- 
somnia guidelines and notified the GPs of the patients 
who were randomized to the control group. However, it 
turned out that most patients in the control group did not 
receive much care and started i-Sleep after the waiting 
period. The control group thus resembled a waitlist con- 
dition which may have induced a nocebo effect [55]. 
In summary, we reached our goal of offering GPs a 
time-efficient treatment that is highly effective in reduc- 
ing insomnia complaints. A cost-effectiveness analysis of 
the intervention will be a valuable next step, as would 
comparing the intervention to an unguided version of- 
fered in general practice. This might increase uptake since 
it requires even less work by GPs and nurses, but it may 
decrease adherence and have a lower effect [17]. We dem- 
onstrated the potential of I-CBT-I in routine general 
practice: i-Sleep clearly outperformed CAU on insomnia 
severity and several sleep diary indices in this trial. The 





large effects on insomnia severity are important towards 
prevention of mental health problems for which insom- 
nia is a risk factor as well [4]. Although further research 
is needed to illuminate potential effects on other mental 
health complaints and daily functioning and the longer- 
term effects of online interventions [56], we recommend 
GPs to implement nurse-guided I-CBT-I as a way of al- 
leviating insomnia symptoms through feasible, effective, 
guideline adherent treatment.
