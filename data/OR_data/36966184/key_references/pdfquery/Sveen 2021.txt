Bereaved individuals often experience sleep problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and 
preliminary effects of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-i) in bereaved parents. 
Parents were randomized to iCBT-i (n = 10) or an active control group (n = 11). Primary outcome (insomnia) 
and secondary outcomes (prolonged grief, depression, posttraumatic stress, and grief rumination) were assessed 
pre- and post-treatment, with 9- and 18-month follow-ups. Feasibility was assessed post-treatment and one 
month later. Most parents reported positive effects of the treatment. The intervention group improved signifi- 
cantly from pre- to post-treatment and had a significantly larger reduction of insomnia when analyzed over all 
four time-points (Wald χ2 = 30.0, p < 0.001), although the effect at post-treatment was very small (d = 0.1) for 
insomnia. Thus, iCBT-i was feasible and was related to reduced insomnia and psychological distress in bereaved 
parents, both short- and long-term, but the results regarding the treatment effect are preliminary due to the small 
sample size. 

About 20% of children with cancer in Western countries do not 
survive their disease, making cancer one of the leading causes of death 
among children over one year of age (Rosenberg et al., 2012; Swedish 
Board of Health and Welfare, 2016). Bereaved parents are at increased 
risk of developing mental and physical health problems (Stroebe et al., 
2007) and bereavement is also associated with an increased risk of 
mortality, especially in mothers (Li et al., 2003). A systematic review 
(Rosenberg et al., 2012) reported that parents of children who die from 
cancer have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and prolonged grief, and 
poorer quality of life, compared with other parents. 
Impaired sleep is a common problem in bereaved individuals 
(Buckley et al., 2012; Hardison et al., 2005; Lancel et al., 2020). How- 
ever, there are few studies examining sleep impairments after the loss of 
a child (Lancel et al., 2020). One previous study (Lannen et al., 2008) 
has reported that a majority (73.5%) of parents who had lost a child to 
cancer had sleep difficulties 4–9 years later. 
There is strong evidence that sleep difficulties is associated with 
mental health problems following loss, such as prolonged grief and 
depression (Boelen and Lancee, 2013; Lancel et al., 2020; Monk et al., 
2008). For example, several studies have shown that more severe sleep 
difficulties are associated with higher levels of prolonged grief (Boelen 
and Lancee, 2013; Germain et al., 2005; Hardison et al., 2005). A study 
targeting treatment of prolonged grief found a modest improvement in 
sleep quality, but the sleep difficulties remained after treatment even 
though prolonged grief symptoms had decreased (Germain et al., 2006). 
This suggests that insomnia (a sleep disorder characterized by subjective 
difficulties with sleep onset and/or maintenance) is a partly independent 
factor, requiring specific treatment in individuals with prolonged grief, 
much like what has been seen for insomnia in relation to depression 
(Blom et al., 2015a). In addition, persistent sleep deprivation can

increase the risks for a variety of negative health outcomes (McEwen, 
2006). Thus, treating insomnia may improve not only sleep, but also 
health in general. 
via the internet (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al., 2015b; Kaldo et al., 
2015; Seyffert et al., 2016), with effect sizes similar to those of face-to- 
face therapy (Seyffert et al., 2016). 
Despite insomnia being common in bereaved individuals, only one 
pilot study (Carter et al., 2009) has evaluated feasibility and preliminary 
efficacy of an insomnia treatment – a brief two-session home based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – in cancer-bereaved caregivers. 
Eleven participants were included in two 2-hour sessions of a 5-week 
study protocol taking place at the participants' home, with focus on 
identifying and changing sleep habits. Preliminary results indicated 
improved sleep and reduced levels of distress, but the absence of a 
control group limits the interpretation of the results and more rigorous 
research is needed in bereaved individuals examining the effect of 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i). CBT-i is the recom- 
mended first-line treatment for adults (Riemann et al., 2017; Wilson 
et al., 2019). CBT-i has been shown to be effective in decreasing 
insomnia severity and improving sleep efficiency also when delivered 
Based on previous research on CBT-i and internet-delivered CBT-i 
(iCBT-i), mentioned above, it has the potential to also be effective in 
bereaved parents; however, as bereaved parents is a burdened group 
with a lot of distress, the feasibility and efficacy of iCBT-i needs to be 
examined in this specific population. This is the first study to examine 
iCBT-i in a randomized controlled trial in bereaved individuals. This 
study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of iCBT-i in 
bereaved parents 1 to 5 years after the loss of a child to cancer. A sec- 
ondary aim was a preliminary examination of the effect of the insomnia 
treatment on secondary outcomes including prolonged grief, depression, 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and grief rumination.

A two-armed randomized control trial with iCBT-i versus active 
control. The study was approved by the regional ethics review board in 
Stockholm, Sweden (protocol #2015/2183-31/5). This trial was regis- 
tered at ClinicalTrials.gov, (registration ID #NCT02886052). 

The present study is part of a larger project on parents of children 
who were diagnosed with a malignancy before the age of 17 years and 
died due to the malignancy before the age of 25 years, between 2010 and 
2015. Cancer-bereaved parents were invited to take part in a Swedish 
nationwide postal survey, which has been described in greater detail in 
Pohlkamp et al. (2018) and Sveen et al. (2019). Of 512 eligible in- 
dividuals, 372 consented to participate and received the survey, 63 
declined to participate and 76 parent could not be contacted. Two 
hundred and thirty-two parents filled out the survey, which included a 
question on interest in receiving more information about the present 
study. A total of 59 individuals indicated such interest. Initial screening 
was made based on the postal survey, i.e., scoring ≥10 on the Insomnia 
Severity Index, with 47 participants fulfilling this criterion. They were 
sent an information letter and contacted by telephone. Twelve parents 
scored <10 on ISI in the postal survey and were sent a letter explaining 
that they did not meet the initial inclusion criterion. Of the 47 partici- 
pants, nine could not be reached and five declined participation (Fig. 1), 
resulting in 33 participants being interviewed. 

The structured telephone interview was based on the clinical inter- 
view described by Morin and Espie (2003), translated into Swedish, and 
with the addition of DSM-5-critera for insomnia (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). The interview also included questions regarding 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and was structured with supporting 
questions and decision algorithms to facilitate use by inexperienced 
interviewers. Inclusion criteria were: insomnia disorder in accordance 
with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 
2013), more than 10 points on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin, 
1993), and ability to read and write in Swedish. Exclusion criteria were: 
other comorbid sleep disorders requiring other treatment (sleep apnea 
or narcolepsy), ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, comorbid disorders 
directly contraindicative of essential interventions in insomnia treat- 
ment (e.g., bipolar disorder), and night-shift work. Initial sleep medi- 
cation use was unrestricted, but participants were recommended to 
stabilize their dose during treatment, with the option of tapering. Thirty- 
three individuals were interviewed via telephone; five did not meet the 
inclusion criteria, while 28 did and consented to participate in the study. 
Seven individuals dropped out of the study prior to randomization, and 
21 participants filled out the baseline assessment online and were then 
randomized. 

The participants were randomized to either the intervention group or 
the active control group by an assistant not otherwise involved in the 
study, using www.random.org, a true random number source, and 
randomization of clusters of different sizes. In one case, both parents of a 
deceased child participated; they were assigned to the same group and 
counted as one individual in the randomization. Ten parents were ran- 
domized to the intervention group and eleven to the control group. 


The iCBT-i was based on well-established CBT models and tech- 
niques, and included active support from therapists during 9 weeks. It 
consisted of a set of modules on a secure website that only the partici- 
pants and their therapists could access. Each module included text to 
read, questions to answer, behavioral assignments, work sheets, and a 
sleep diary to be filled out throughout treatment. The modules were: 
introduction and facts about sleep; introduction to CBT for insomnia and 
sleep hygiene; education on sleep medication and how to quit; sleep 
restriction and stimulus control; stress management; managing fatigue; 
handling negative thoughts about sleep; and planning ahead. The par- 
ticipants were supposed to complete about one module a week. Each 
module ended with a homework assignment consisting of a set of 
structured, often free-text, questions to be sent to the therapist via the 
secure messaging system on the website. The therapist would review 
answers, work sheets and the sleep diary, give written feedback within 
two weekdays, and give the participant access to the next module. The 
participants could ask their therapist questions via the messaging sys- 
tem, and these messages were to be answered within two weekdays. 
Therapist adherence to the treatment protocol was ensured through the 
internet-delivered format and continuous supervision. There were two 
therapists, one who was in the final year of the Swedish 5-year univer- 
sity program for clinical psychologists and had training in CBT, and one 
who had a Bachelor of Science in psychology and had training in CBT. 
The therapists received initial training in the CBT-i program and weekly 
supervision. 

Participants received a short booklet with psychoeducation on sleep, 
sleep disturbances, setting treatment goals, sleep hygiene, stress man- 
agement, and mindfulness via the secure website. They could download 
the booklet if wanted. They had no contact with the therapist. It was not 
checked if the participants read the booklet or not. 
2.3. Feasibility – adherence, satisfaction, evaluation of the treatment's 
strengths and weaknesses, and adverse events 
To assess adherence, the numbers of completed modules and 
homework assignment reports were measured. The numbers of messages 
between the participants and therapists were also measured. 
In the intervention group, participants' satisfaction with treatment 
was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen 
et al., 1979) at post-treatment. The CSQ-8 contains 8 items and has a 
total score ranging from 8 to 32. 
2.3.1. Subjective/open-ended evaluation of the treatment's strengths and 
weaknesses, and adverse events 
One month after treatment, the participants from both groups were 
interviewed via telephone. Adverse events were assessed through the 
question “Did the treatment have any negative effects?” Participants 
who answered yes were asked to expand upon this. They were also asked 
if the treatment had any positive effects and, if so, asked to expand upon 
this. Further, they were asked about their perceptions of the weaknesses 
and strengths of the treatment, if there was anything missing or if any 
part of the treatment was especially useful. Participants in the inter- 
vention group who had ended the treatment in advance were asked why 
they had done so. 


The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin, 1993) was used to measure 
self-reported insomnia severity. The psychometric properties of ISI are 
adequate and it is sensitive to change (Bastien et al., 2001), including 
when used online (Thorndike et al., 2011). It consists of 7 items, partly 
corresponding to the symptoms in DSM-5, which assess the severity of 



sleep onset and sleep maintenance difficulties, sleep pattern satisfaction, 
interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attrib- 
uted to the sleep problem, and degree of concern or distress caused by 
the sleep problem. Treatment response and remission rates were also 
assessed (Morin et al., 2009): treatment responders were those whose 
scores decreased by 8 points or more from pre-treatment to post- 
treatment or follow-up, and remitters were those whose absolute ISI 
score at post-treatment or follow-up was below 8. 

2.4.2.1. Parent health. The Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 (PG-13) was 
used to assess symptoms of prolonged grief (Prigerson et al., 2009); it 
contains 11 items covering cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symp- 
toms, one duration item, and one impairment item. A study of the 
Swedish PG-13 has shown satisfactory psychometric properties (Pohl- 
kamp et al., 2018). The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) was used to assess depressive 
symptoms; it contains 9 items. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) 
was used to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
(Weathers et al., 2013); it contains 20 items corresponding to the 
symptoms in the DSM-5. A study of the Swedish PCL-5 has shown 
adequate psychometric properties (Sveen et al., 2016). The Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was used to assess self-reported generalized 
anxiety disorder symptoms (Spitzer et al., 2006); it consists of 7 items. 
The Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS) (Eisma et al., 2012) was 
used to measure grief-specific rumination; it contains 15 items that 
measure different aspects of grief rumination. A study of the Swedish 
UGRS has shown that it has satisfactory psychometric properties (Sveen 
et al., 2019). 

Data analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS version 25.0. De- 
mographic, loss-related baseline data, responses, and remission rates 
were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-squared tests, and 
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Fisher's exact test was used 
when the expected count of one or more cells was below five. All 
outcome analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e., 
including measures from all patients, regardless of their adherence to 
treatment. To examine the program effects on the primary and sec- 
ondary outcome variables, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) 
with a linear scale response and autoregressive (first order) correlation 
matrix were used. Intervention group, measurement timepoint, and the 
interaction of group and measurement time point were chosen as fac- 
tors/covariates. GEEs use all available observations instead of using only 
participants with complete data for all time points, and are thus suitable 
for intention-to-treat analyses when there are missing data. A sensitivity 
analysis of the main outcome, ISI, was performed using a GEE with 
missing data replaced by the last observation carried forward. For effect 
sizes, Cohen's ds with pooled standard deviations were calculated using 
observed data. 


Twenty-one bereaved parents were included in the study: 14 mothers 
and 7 fathers. Demographic variables of the deceased children and their 
parents are presented in Table 1 and missing data are presented in the 
flowchart (Fig. 1).

3.2. Feasibility – treatment adherence, treatment satisfaction and adverse 
events 

One participant dropped out of treatment immediately and did not 
complete or read any modules, and one participant completed the first 
module and then dropped out. One individual, after receiving the first 
module, did not complete any homework assignments or modules. 
An average of 4.4 (SD = 2.8) of the 9 modules were made available 
and the participants completed the homework for 3.5 (SD = 2.9) of the 
modules on average. The homework for the module on sleep restriction 
and stimulus control, which is considered the core of the treatment, was 
completed by 7 participants. On average, 18.6 messages were sent from 
each participant to the therapist and 15.4 messages were sent from the 
therapist. 

Seven participants in the intervention group completed the CSQ-8 at 
post-treatment, with a total mean score of 24.1 (SD = 5.5) from a 
maximum score of 32, which represents a “good” overall level of satis- 
faction (Larsen et al., 1979). Most participants reported that the quality 
of treatment was good and were satisfied with the amount of help 
received. Overall, four participants were very satisfied with the treat- 
ment, while two were indifferent, and one person was quite dissatisfied. 
Lack of time to complete the modules and treatment being too time- 
consuming were the most common comments. All responded yes to 
the question if they would recommend the treatment to a friend. 
3.2.3. Subjective/open-ended evaluation of the treatment's strengths and 
weaknesses, and adverse events 
All members in both groups were contacted for a telephone inter- 
view; 8 from the treatment group and 5 from the control group 
answered. In the treatment group, 7 participants reported that the 
treatment had positive effects. Most participants stated that they were 
sleeping better. Other positives were more knowledge about sleep, using 
relaxation techniques, and sleeping without interruptions. One person, 
who was dissatisfied, stated that they had not experienced any direct 
positive effects and that they lacked the time needed for completing the 
treatment. In response to the question “Is there anything especially good 
about the treatment?”, 4 stated that the support and responses from the 
therapist were important and 2 thought the knowledge and suggestions 
from the treatment had been helpful. Reasons for ending the treatment 
before completing were that sleep restriction was too difficult and that 
the treatment was too intensive and time-consuming. No one in the 



intervention group had experienced any negative effects of treatment. 
One participant in the control group stated that the sleep booklet had 
a slight positive effect, while no participant reported any negative effects 
of the sleep booklet. 

Descriptive data for insomnia severity at each time point are shown 
in Table 2. At baseline, there was no statistically significant difference in 
insomnia severity between the intervention group and the control group 
(Mann-Whitney U = 48, p > 0.05). A group comparison of change in 
insomnia severity over all four timepoints revealed an overall statisti- 
cally significant interaction effect in favor of the intervention group 
(Wald χ2 = 30.0, p < 0.001). The results were the same in the sensitivity 
analyses (Wald χ2 = 25.5, p < 0.001). The intervention group showed a 
steady decrease in insomnia symptoms and had statistically significantly 
lower levels of such symptoms at post-treatment (d = 1.6) and at follow- 
up assessments (9 months, d = 3.6; 18 months, d = 4.1) compared with 
at baseline. The active control group had fluctuating levels of insomnia 
symptoms across the three timepoints after treatment and symptom 
levels were statistically significantly lowered only at post-treatment (d 
= 1.1) and the 18-month follow-up (d = 1.5) compared with at baseline. 
When comparing absolute insomnia levels at each timepoint, the inter- 
vention group had statistically significantly lower levels at the 9-month 
follow-up (d = (cid:0) 1.5), but not at post-treatment (d = 0.1) or the 18- 

There were no statistically significant differences between the 
intervention and control groups concerning treatment response (χ2 = 
0.04–3.90, p > 0.05) or remission rates (χ2 = 0.3–4.7, p > 0.05) at any 
assessment point. In the intervention group, there were 2 (20%) re- 
mitters and 3 (30%) responders at post-treatment, 5 (50%) remitters and 
3 (30%) responders at the 9-month follow-up and 2 (20%) remitters and 
5 (50%) responders at the 18-month follow-up. In the control group, 
there were 1 (9%), 1 (9%), and 3 (27%) remitters, and 2 (18%), 1 (9%), 
and 2 (18%) responders, respectively, at the corresponding timepoints. 
3.4. Secondary symptom outcomes – symptoms of prolonged grief, 
depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and grief rumination 
Descriptive data for the secondary outcomes for each measurement 
time point are shown in Table 2. There were no differences between the 
groups at baseline on the secondary measures of prolonged grief, 
depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, except that grief rumi- 
nation was more common in the control group (Mann-Whitney U = 
85.5, p > 0.05). 
Group comparisons over all four timepoints revealed no overall 
statistically significant interaction effects for any of the secondary 
outcome measures (Wald χ2 = 3.2–7.3, p > 0.05), except for the anxiety 
measure (χ2 = 15.36, p < 0.01). However, there was a general trend in 
the treatment group for having a better outcome than the control group

This study showed positive results regarding feasibility, accept- 
ability, and preliminary efficacy of iCBT-i in bereaved parents 1 to 5 
years after the loss of a child to cancer. 
The study provided evidence for feasibility and acceptability, with 
the treatment group reported satisfaction with the treatment and stating 
that they would recommend it to a friend. The majority reported that it 
had positive effects and no one reported any negative effects. However, 
two individuals had wanted more support during sleep restriction. 
Although the treatment was reported by some parents to be time- 
consuming, the parents reported that they were sleeping better. In 
addition, several participants appreciated the support from the 
therapist. 
The score for satisfaction with the iCBT-i, as reported in the CSQ-8, 
was 24.1, which is good and comparable to previous studies on 
internet-based CBT-i, which reported between 23.1 and 27.3 for the 
same measure (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al., 2015b; Kaldo et al., 
2015). The participants in this study had completed a smaller number of 
modules, 38%, as compared with those in previous studies, where 
completion ranged from 68% to 82% (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al., 
2015b; Kaldo et al., 2015), and a smaller number of homework assign- 
ments: 39% compared with 68% in Kaldo et al. (2015). However, 70% of 
the individuals in this study completed the main assignments on sleep 
restriction and stimulus control. Overall, the comparison suggested a 
somewhat lower level of adherence in this study. There could be many 
reasons for this. The bereaved parents in this study had high symptoms 
levels, such as depression, posttraumatic stress and prolonged grief, 
compared with a larger overlapping sample by Pohlkamp et al. (2019). 
This suggests that the parents in this study were heavily burdened by 
their loss, with a lot of comorbid symptoms, and might have found it 
difficult to complete this version of CBT-i. The initial motivation might 
have been lower in this study, possibly influenced by the recruitment 
method: parents were offered treatment due to their participation in a 
survey, without having actively sought it, as they would have in regular 
care or when responding to an advertisement for a clinical trial. Also, the 
two therapists were rather inexperienced with both internet-delivered 
treatment and CBT for insomnia. However, they had university-level 
training in CBT and were supervised by a licensed psychologist. 
Furthermore, the numbers of messages sent between the therapists and 
the participants were at a similar level as those reported by Kaldo et al. 
(2015) and Blom et al. (2015a). 
The treatment group improved significantly, with large within-group 
effect sizes for the primary outcome, insomnia severity. There was a 
pattern of an overall greater reduction of insomnia severity for the 
treatment group if seen over all three follow-ups. However, the between- 
group effect size at post-treatment was very small for the primary 
outcome and there were rather large fluctuations over the follow-up 
time-points, most probably due to the small number of participants. 
The secondary outcomes (prolonged grief, depression, posttraumatic 
stress, anxiety, and grief rumination) showed positive results with small 
to large effect sizes, although the overall change in symptoms compared 
with the control group was not statistically significant, except in the case 
of anxiety. The active control group also improved significantly, with 
small to large effect sizes for the primary and secondary outcomes. The 
treatment group had significantly lower levels of psychological symp- 
toms than the control group at the 18-month follow-up, except for 
insomnia severity, where the difference was not statistically significant. 
The positive effect of iCBT-i in adults is well-known (Seyffert et al., 
2016), but this is the first study examining its effect in bereaved parents. 
The main finding is that the insomnia treatment ameliorated insomnia 
severity in bereaved parents. Interestingly, it was indicated that the 
comorbid symptoms improved in the long term as well. The treatment 
group had significantly lower symptom levels than the control group at 
the 18-month follow-up, which indicates that the effect was not due 
merely to symptoms levels abating in a natural bereavement process. 
The effects included an improvement in grief rumination, which has not 
been examined previously. Though there is a well-established associa- 
tion between rumination and sleep disturbances (Pillai and Drake, 
2015), only one previous study has examined the association between 
grief rumination and insomnia symptoms, showing a moderate associ- 
ation (Sveen et al., 2019). 
Our results are in line with previous studies, suggesting that treating 
insomnia with CBT-i is possible even when comorbid conditions are 
present and, furthermore, that it seems to reduce the comorbid symp- 
toms. For example, treating insomnia in adults with comorbid depres- 
sion improves not only insomnia severity, but also symptoms of 
depression (Blom et al., 2015a; van der Zweerde et al., 2019), and 
treating posttraumatic stress disorder with CBT and CBT-i for sleep 
disturbances reduces symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Ho et al., 2016). 
However, this has not been examined in bereaved individuals with 
prolonged grief disorder. A tentative conclusion from this study is that 
treating insomnia reduces symptoms of prolonged grief disorder. 

A limitation of this study was the small sample size and low statistical 
power. The study needs to be replicated in larger samples. We had aimed 
for a sample size of 60 participants, but could not recruit that many with 
the current recruitment method. Only 59 individuals out of the 232 who 
responded to the survey (i.e. 25%) signaled an interest in receiving more 
information about the current study. This indicates that the demand for 
this type of treatment, i.e. in the internet self-help format and not 
focused on the primary problem (bereavement), could be rather low in 
the group we targeted and that future studies should use a broader 
recruitment or offer the treatment in another context. In addition, future 
studies could compare iCBT-i with face-to-face CBT-i to examine 
whether face-to-face treatment is more feasible in this population. Also, 
lower response rates at the follow-ups make the results less certain. On 
the primary outcome, the attrition was 10–40% in the intervention 
group and 27–36% in the control group. Hence, the results should be 
interpreted with caution, although our sensitivity analyses on the pri- 
mary outcome did not indicate different results. A limitation is that may 
be a recall bias of adverse events as the interview was conducted one 
month post-treatment. A strength is that the risk for so-called therapist 
drift, i.e., that the therapist changes the contents of the treatment along 
the way, was minimized, as the therapeutic content in the intervention 
largely consisted of standardized self-help material. Another strength 
was that the active control group never received the CBT-i treatment; 
hence, we could compare the groups at the long-term follow-ups. 

Many bereaved parents have multiple psychological symptoms, 
including sleep problems, for many years after their loss. The present 
study showed that iCBT-i appears to be feasible and acceptable for 
bereaved parents who agree to try this treatment format. However, they 
may need support and encouragement from a therapist, especially when 
it comes to sleep restriction, which can be very demanding. Further- 
more, this study yielded preliminary results that treating insomnia has a 
positive effect on insomnia severity and also indicated positive effects on 
other psychological symptoms, such as prolonged grief, depression, 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress and grief rumination, in bereaved parents. 
Taken together with previous findings (van Straten et al., 2018; Wu 
et al., 2015), which show that insomnia can be effectively treated 
despite comorbidity, the results of this study provide support that this is 
the case also for bereaved individuals with insomnia. Thus, CBT-i could 
be implemented within bereavement care. Further studies on the effect 
of CBT-i in bereaved samples are needed both in samples with large 
comorbid problems and in bereaved individuals with low comorbid 





To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the feasibility 
and efficacy of iCBT-i in bereaved parents. The study suggested that the 
treatment is feasible and there were no reported adverse effects. The 
results showed preliminary evidence that iCBT-i can effectively alleviate 
insomnia, and to some extent comorbid problems, in bereaved parents, 
and could thus be offered to bereaved parents with comorbid symptoms. 
However, on insomnia severity the effect fluctuated rather much and 
was very small (d = 0.1) at post-treatment, but large at the 9 months 
follow-up (d = 3.6). Further research in larger samples and to clarify the 
specific relationship between insomnia and the comorbid symptoms is 
crucial. Given the high levels of insomnia and psychological symptoms 
in bereaved parents, this burdened group deserves more attention.
