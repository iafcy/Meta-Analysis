Background. Insomnia is effectively treated with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
Insomnia (CBT-I). Previous research has suggested the effects might not be limited to 
sleep and insomnia severity, but also apply to depressive symptoms. Results, however, are 
mixed. 
Methods. In this randomized controlled trial we investigated the effects of guided online 
CBT-I on depression and insomnia in people suffering from symptoms of both. 
Participants (n = 104) with clinical insomnia and at least subclinical depression levels were 
randomized to (1) guided online CBT-I and sleep diary monitoring (i-Sleep) or (2) control 
group (sleep diary monitoring only). The primary outcome was the severity of depressive 
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item; PHQ-WS). Secondary out- 
comes were insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, fatigue, daytime consequences of 
insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. 
Results. At post-test, participants in the i-Sleep condition reported significantly less depres- 
sive symptoms (PHQ-WS) compared with participants in the sleep-diary condition (d = 0.76). 
Large significant effects were also observed for insomnia severity (d = 2.36), most sleep diary 
parameters, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. Effects 
were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow-up. We did not find significant post-test effects 
on fatigue or total sleep time. 
Conclusions. Findings indicate that guided online CBT-I is not only effective for insomnia 
complaints but also for depressive symptoms. The effects are large and comparable with 
those of depression therapy. Clinical trial registration number: NTR6049 (Netherlands Trial 
Register). 

Insomnia and depression are both prevalent, severe disorders. Insomnia is characterized by 
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for three nights per week for 3 months, causing dis- 
tress and impaired daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Depression is 
diagnosed when someone experiences depressed mood and/or loss of interest in daily activities 
for 2 weeks and shows four or more other specific symptoms (e.g. inactivity, concentration 
problems) along with impaired functioning (APA, 2013). Insomnia and depression are highly 
disturbing to a person’s life and present significant financial burdens to society due to 
increased care consumption and decreased work productivity (Léger et al., 2001; Daley 
et al., 2009; Watkins et al., 2009). Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception; around 
40% of people with insomnia suffer from clinical depression (Taylor et al., 2005, 2007) and 
around 80% of depressed individuals suffer from insomnia symptoms (Ohayon, 2002; 
Szuba et al., 2003; Franzen and Buysse, 2008). 
Evidence is accumulating that insomnia plays a role in the development and maintenance 
of a depressive disorder. People with insomnia have a twofold chance of developing a depres- 
sion (Baglioni et al., 2011; Li et al., 2018), insomnia perpetuates depressive disorders (Pigeon 
et al., 2008), and residual insomnia complaints predict relapse after depression (Carney et al., 
2007). Suggested pathways through which insomnia affects depression include biological (e.g. 
sleep deprivation or fragmentation affecting the endocrine system), cognitive (e.g. effects of 
worrying and ruminating when lying awake), emotional (e.g. decreased emotional coping 
skills), and directly sleep-related pathways (e.g. use of sleep medication; Staner, 2010; 
Baglioni et al., 2014; Finan et al., 2015). 
Despite the high comorbidity between insomnia and depression, it is still unclear which 
disorder should be treated (first) or whether combination treatments are more effective. 



What is clear is that an insomnia disorder is effectively treated 
Insomnia (CBT-I). 
with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
Meta-analyses have demonstrated that 
the effects are rather 
small for total sleep time (TST; Hedges’ g = 0.16), but high for 
other sleep parameters such as sleep efficiency (SE; Hedges’ g = 
0.71) and for insomnia severity (Hedges’ g = 0.98; Trauer et al., 
2015; Wu et al., 2015; van Straten et al., 2017). Long-term effects 
of CBT-I surpass the effects of sleep medication (Smith et al., 
2002; Riemann and Perlis, 2009). Because of growing demand 
for and shortage of trained therapists, as well as difficulties 
some patients encounter (e.g. travel time, disabilities) treatments 
are also offered online to enhance accessibility. Online CBT-I is 
administered effectively with effect 
in the range of 
face-to-face treatment (Espie et al., 2014; van Straten et al., 
2014; Zachariae et al., 2016; Ritterband et al., 2017), although dir- 
ect comparisons between online and face-to-face CBT-I show 
mixed results (Blom et al., 2015b; Lancee et al., 2016). The effects 
of (online) CBT-I are not limited to sleep parameters and insom- 
nia severity. Meta-analyses report moderate effects of insomnia 
treatment on comorbid depressive symptoms experienced by 
insomnia patients (SMD = 0.36 in Ye et al., 2015; d = 0.34 in 
Ballesio et al., 2017). However, most trials included in these 
meta-analyses did not target depressed populations specifically 
and in several studies patients with higher depression scores 
were excluded. 

To our knowledge there have only been four studies that inves- 
tigated CBT-I as a standalone treatment for people with both 
depressive symptoms and insomnia. Two of those studies used 
face-to-face treatment and both failed to demonstrate an effect 
of insomnia treatment on depressive symptoms compared with 
depression treatment-as-usual (Wagley et al., 2013) and compared 
with relaxation therapy (Norell-Clarke et al., 2015). The other two 
studies used online CBT-I as a standalone treatment for depres- 
sive symptoms and insomnia. Those studies showed more prom- 
ising results. Blom and colleagues showed that online CBT-I was 
significantly more effective than online depression treatment on 
insomnia but as effective on depressive symptoms (Blom et al., 
2015a). However, the sample size of this study was small and rep- 
lication is needed before conclusions can be drawn. Christensen 
and colleagues (2016) demonstrated that online CBT-I effectively 
reduced depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms 
in 
patients with complaints of both compared with an online pla- 
cebo module. However, people with higher scores of depressive 
symptoms were excluded (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 >20; 
Spitzer et al., 1999). 
We aimed to replicate the findings of Christensen and collea- 
gues and expand them by not excluding people with higher levels 
of depressive symptoms, in a randomized controlled design com- 
paring online CBT-I (i-Sleep) with a non-treated control group, 
monitoring their sleep daily. The online treatment 
included 
online feedback by a coach as this has been shown to potentiate 
efficacy (Lancee et al., 2013b). We hypothesized that i-Sleep 
would be more effective than the control group in reducing 
depression symptoms. Secondarily, we investigated effects on 
insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, daytime consequences 
of insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. We 
hypothesized that i-Sleep would be more effective compared 
with the control group. We hypothesized that the effects of 
i-Sleep are generalized on functioning and other psychiatric 
symptoms such as perseverative thinking and anxiety known to 
be related to insomnia (Ohayon and Roth, 2003; Ehring and 
Watkins, 2008; Harvey et al., 2017). 


Participants who expressed interest in participating in research 
through a website on insomnia (www.insomnie.nl) were recruited. 
Potential participants received an email invitation to a screening 
questionnaire. Recruitment was completed in October 2016. 
The last follow-up occurred in June 2017 (see Fig. 1). 
Inclusion criteria (assessed in the online screening) were: (1) 
⩾18 years, (2) fulfilling DSM-5 criteria for insomnia (APA, 
2013): trouble falling or staying asleep, ⩾ three nights a week, 
⩾30 min, with significant consequences, sufficient opportunity 
to sleep and dissatisfaction with amount or quality of sleep; (3) 
depressive symptoms [PHQ-9 score >4; (Spitzer et al., 1999)]; 
and (4) access to the Internet and email. Exclusion criteria were 
(1) probable sleep apnea (Wilson et al., 2010); (2) previous 
CBT-I; (3) started psychotherapy < 6 months ago; (4) preg- 
nancy/breastfeeding; (5) shift work; (6) being diagnosed with 
psychosis/schizophrenia; and (7) suicidal intentions [five items 
from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnos- 
tic interview (Sheehan et al., 1998)]. Other psychiatric and som- 
atic comorbidities were allowed, as were the use of sleep 
medication, melatonin, and homeopathic aids. 

Based on the effect on depression (PHQ-9) of d = 0.69 reported by 
Christensen et al. (2016), a desired power of 0.8 and an alpha level 
of 0.05 (two-sided) a total of 34 participants per condition was 
needed. Considering risk of high dropout from online interven- 
tions (24% in Horsch et al., 2015) we aimed to include 52 parti- 
cipants per condition. 

After informed consent, participants completed the baseline 
questionnaire [demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9, Spitzer et al., 1999), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI, 
Bastien et al., 2001), consequences of insomnia during daytime 
(Espie et al., 2012); Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS, Krupp et al., 
1989) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety 
(HADS-A, Spinhoven et al., 1997)]. Due to technical issues, the 
Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ, Ehring et al., 2012) 
scheduled at baseline was completed at week 1. Excluded partici- 
pants were advised to contact their general practitioner. No appli- 
cants reported suicidal ideation. All eligible applicants were then 
asked to fill out a sleep diary. All participants that adhered to 
the diary (between 5 and 7 days) were included and subsequently 
randomized to (1) online CBT-I (i-Sleep) or (2) no treatment 
(sleep diary only). We used block randomization (blocks 2–4) 
with a 1:1 allocation sequence generated by an independent 
researcher also performing actual allocation. Blinding researchers 
or participants was not possible. 
All participants were asked weekly to complete the PHQ-9 
(Spitzer et al., 1999), the ISI (Bastien et al. 2001), and the ques- 
tionnaire on daily consequences (Espie et al., 2012). In addition, 
we asked participants to complete a sleep diary every morning 
(Carney et al., 2012). 
Post-assessments occurred 9 weeks after randomization, for 
testing the primary hypothesis. Intervention participants received 
a 3 and 6-month follow-up assessment. The control group received 
treatment after post-assessment (week 9). Figure 1 shows a flow 



chart of the study. The study was registered at the Netherlands 
Trial Register (NTR6049). The University of Amsterdam Ethics 
Review Board approved the protocol (2016-CP-7263). 

The online intervention i-Sleep consists of five sessions of CBT 
for insomnia (Morin and Espie, 2003; van der Zweerde et al., 
2016). The 5 sessions focused on (1) sleep hygiene and lifestyle, 
(2) stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy [SRT; 
in 
which the time in bed (TIB) is restricted to the average time 
slept in the last week (with a 5-h minimum), increasing TIB 
when efficiency is >85% and decreasing when it is <80%, with 
the aim of increasing the TIB spent asleep and decreasing TIB 
spent awake], (3) relaxation, (4) cognitive therapy tackling dys- 
functional thoughts about sleep, (5) relapse prevention (van der 
Zweerde et al., 2016). Clinical psychology graduate students at 
the University of Amsterdam offered online guidance (∼40 min 
per participant per week) under weekly supervision by the first 
and last author. Online guidance entailed feedback on exercises, 
discussing SRT/bedtimes based on the diary and motivating par- 
ticipants to persevere in the treatment. 

The primary outcome measure was the Dutch version of a nine- 
item depression scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at week 
9 (PHQ-9; range 0–27, Cronbach’s α = 0.94; Spitzer et al., 1999). 
The PHQ-9 is scored on a five-point Likert score ranging from 0 
(never) to 4 (almost daily). Next to the total score of the PHQ-9 
we also report the total score without the sleep item, preventing 
measuring a decline in depression directly due to improved 
sleep (see also Christensen et al., 2016). We call this the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item (PHQ-WS) score. 

Secondary measures were included to assess insomnia symp- 
toms, daytime functioning and other psychological symptoms 
associated with insomnia 
Insomnia 
Severity Index (ISI; Bastien et al., 2001) is a seven item-scale 
scored on a five-point Likert scale. The total score ranges from 
0 to 28. The ISI has good psychometric properties (Cronbach’s 
α = 0.78). The daytime consequences of insomnia were measured 
with six items (energy, mood, concentration, sleepiness, product- 
ivity, and relationships). Each item was scored on five-point Likert 
scale (Espie et al., 2012) and summed into one total score for day- 
time functioning. Fatigue was measured with the FSS (Cronbach’s 


α = 0.89, nine statements scored on a seven-point Likert scale; 
Krupp et al., 1989). Anxiety was measured with the Anxiety sec- 
tion of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A; 
Cronbach’s α = 0.84, seven items on a four-point Likert scale, 
scores ranging 0–21; Spinhoven et al., 1997). Perseverative think- 
ing was measured using the PTQ (Cronbach’s α = 0.94; 15 items 
are rated on a four-point Likert scale, scores range 0–60; Ehring 
et al., 2012). For all questionnaires, higher scores indicated 
more severe complaints. 

The Carney consensus sleep diary (Carney et al., 2012) was slightly 
adjusted to fit our study purpose and reduce participant burden. 
Participants reported when they went to bed to sleep and when 
they got up, sleep onset latency (SOL), TIB awake after sleep 
onset (WASO), how long they slept in total and mood on a scale 
of 1–10 (higher scores indicating better mood). We calculated 
TST (TST: TIB–SOL–WASO), and then calculated the SE (SE: 
TST/TIB × 100). Two items of the original Carney diary were left 
out: (1) the item distinguishing between the time patients went to 
bed and the time they switched off the light, and (2) the item distin- 
guishing between final morning awakening and getting up. 

At follow-up, participants were asked about adverse events over the 
course of participation. They indicated whether they had fallen, 
had an (traffic) accident or experienced other negative events that 
seemed related to fatigue and/or sleepiness (and if yes, what hap- 
pened and any physical or psychological consequences). 

All randomized participants were included in the analyses follow- 
ing the intention-to-treat principle (Newell, 1992). Generalized 
mixed (multilevel) regression analysis was used to evaluate 
within-group effects (Time) and between-group effects (Time × 
Condition) of the intervention. Mixed negative binomial regres- 
sion analyses with a log link were performed for skewed variables 
(PHQ-WS, ISI, PTQ, FSS, SE, SOL, WASO, TST), regular linear 
mixed regression with an identity link in all other cases. 
Two-level 
repeated- 
(participants and measurement points) 
measures designs were examined with outcomes as dependent 
variables (PHQ, PHQ-WS, 
ISI, daytime consequences, FSS, 
HADS-A, PTQ, sleep diary), Condition as between-subjects factor 
(intervention v. control) and Time as a within-subjects factor 
(pre- v. post-test). We used an unstructured covariance structure, 
which assumes data is missing at random, as the best model for 
the data and number of measurement points. Significance tests 
were performed to assess pre-treatment differences between 
groups. Baseline characteristics that significantly differed between 
groups and variables that predicted dropout were added as covari- 
ates. Analyses were repeated without covariates as a sensitivity 
analysis. 
Within-group Cohen’s d effect sizes were based on multilevel 
estimated baseline and post-test means (i.e., pre-post) and pooled 
observed standard deviations at baseline. Between-group Cohen’s 
d effect sizes were calculated by dividing the difference in change 
scores (i.e., pre-post) by the pooled standard deviations at baseline 
(Morris, 2008). Cohen’s d was considered small (i.e. <0.20), 
moderate (around 0.50) or large (⩾0.80; Cohen, 1988). Analyses 
were carried out using a 0.05 α-level (two-tailed) in SPSS v24. 


We included 104 patients (52 intervention and 52 control). The 
mean age of the sample was 45.99 years (S.D. = 12.32) and 82% 
of the participants were female (Table 1). Insomnia duration 
was around 10 years (M = 9.79, S.D. = 9.91). The majority of par- 
ticipants completed higher vocational or university education 
(60%). At baseline, participants showed mild (PHQ-9 > 4) to 
severe depression (PHQ-9 > 19) with scores ranging from 5 to 
22 (M = 10.19, S.D. = 3.90; see online Supplementary Fig. S1). 
There were no baseline differences between groups with the 
exception of perseverative thinking (see online Supplementary 
Table S4). Those in the i-Sleep condition reported more baseline 
perseverative thinking (M = 32.35, S.D. = 1.53) than participants in 
the control condition (M = 28.69, S.D. = 1.73; U = 1568, p = 0.03). 
Age, depression scores (PHQ-9 and PHQ-WS), and TST proved 
to be associated with non-response at post-test in the treatment 
condition: younger patients, patients with higher depression 
scores and shorter TST were less likely to fill out the post-test. 
We included these variables as covariates in the regression models 
on all outcome measures. Non-response in the control condition 
was not related to any of the variables examined. At the follow- 
ups, baseline PTQ was associated with nonresponse (non- 
responders had more perseverative thinking) and was therefore 
included as a covariate in the analysis. Figure 1 shows a flowchart 
of the study. 

Most of the 52 intervention participants (n = 41, 85%) completed 
the full i-Sleep intervention. Four participants dropped out of the 
intervention (see flowchart, Fig. 1). The remaining participants 
completed 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 1), or four sessions (n = 3). 
On average patients were satisfied with the website (M = 7.67 
on a scale 1–10, S.D. = 0.98), with the feedback (M = 7.91, S.D. = 
0.87), and the online module (M = 7.91, S.D. = 0.82, see online 
Supplementary Table S1). No adverse events related to the inter- 
vention or trial were reported.

Multilevel regression analyses showed significant Time × Condition 
interaction effects for all three depression scores [PHQ-9, F(1,81) = 
20.54, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2); PHQ-WS, F(1,82) = 14.38, p < 0.001, and 
the Mood item in the diary, F(1,83) = 13.34, p < 0.001]. This indi- 
cates participants in the i-Sleep condition experienced a greater 
decline in depressive symptoms at post-test than the control 
condition (dbetween = 1.05 for the total PHQ, dbetween = 0.76 for 
the PHQ without the sleep item and dbetween = 0.68 for the Mood 
item). Details of 
the analysis are in Table 2 and online 
Supplementary Tables S2–S5. 
Treatment effects on daytime functioning, anxiety, and 
perseverative thinking 
Significant Time × Condition interactions were found on anxiety 
[HADS-A, F(1,87) = 8.42, p < 0.01] perseverative thinking [PTQ, 
F(1,91) = 9.48, p < 0.01] and daytime functioning, F(1,88) = 18.44, 
p < 0.001. We observed no differential effects for the separate 
aspects of the daytime functioning and hence only report the 
total score. Findings indicate that participants in the i-Sleep condi- 
tion reported less anxiety (dbetween = 0.63), less perseverative think- 
ing (dbetween = 0.62) and better daytime functioning (dbetween = 1.12) 
than participants in the control group. 

Significant Time × Condition interactions were also found for 
insomnia severity [ISI, F(1,51) = 51.94, p < 0.001; Fig. 2] and for 
several sleep parameters from the diary [SE, F(1,89) = 9.66, p < 
0.001, SOL, F(1,70) = 20.12, p < 0.001, and WASO, F(1,80) = 22.59, 
p < 0.001]. This indicates that participants in the i-Sleep condition 
experienced more sleep improvements than participants 
in 
the control condition: 
lower insomnia severity 
they report 
(dbetween = 2.36), higher SE (dbetween = 0.67), lower SOL (dbetween = 
0.69) and less time spent WASO (dbetween = 0.60). No significant 
Time × Condition effect could be found for TST, F(1,73) = 0.04, 
p = 0.84, nor for Fatigue Severity, F(1105) = 1.43, p = 0.24.

Non-significant time effects from post to follow-up assessments 
(using Greenhouse–Geisser correction where the sphericity assump- 
tion was violated) indicated that treatment effects at post assessment 
were largely maintained at follow-up assessment for depression 
[PHQ-9, F(2,68) = 0.66, p = 0.52, PHQ-WS, F(2,68) = 0.32, p = 0.73] 
and insomnia severity, F(1.661, 56,48) = 0.29, p = 0.75. Effects on day- 
time functioning was maintained, F(2,68) = 0.073, p = 0.93 as well as 
on comorbid psychological symptoms [anxiety, F(2,68) = 0.29, p = 
0.77, perseverative thinking, F(1.626, 55.28) = 0.12, p = 0.94] and several 
sleep parameters [TST, F(1.275,15.30) = 2.09, p = 0.15, WASO, F(2,20) = 
2.05, p = 0.16, SOL F(2,22) = 2.49, p = 0.11 and SE, F(2,18) = 2.60, 
p = 0.10]. There was no effect for fatigue at follow-up, F(2,70) = 
0.93, p = 0.4, while mood improved further, F(2,24) = 5.73, p = 0.01, 
d = −0.23. 

Participants in the i-Sleep condition showed significantly more 
clinically relevant improvements in both depression symptoms 
(clinical improvement defined as a drop of 50% or more resulting 
in <11; Spitzer et al., 1999; 64% v. 30%) and insomnia severity 
(clinical improvement defined as a change of >8; Morin et al., 
2011; 64% v. 9%) than participants in the sleep diary monitoring 
control group. At 6 months follow-up, a considerable percentage 
of participants in the i-Sleep condition remained below the clin- 
ical cut-offs for depression (56%) and insomnia severity (50%) 
(see Table 3 for details). 

Our primary aim was to investigate effects of online CBT-I on 
depressive symptoms in a sample of people with insomnia and 
at least a subclinical level of depression. We hypothesized that 
the online intervention i-Sleep would be more effective than no 
treatment (sleep diary monitoring only). Our findings convin- 
cingly show online CBT-I, reduces symptoms of depression and 
insomnia in people experiencing both. 
Overall, the large effect sizes that we observed on depressive 
symptoms (PHQ-9, dbetween = −1.05; PHQ-WS, dbetween = −0.76) 
contrast with two face-to-face studies published in the past, 
which did not observe an effect on depression (Wagley et al., 
2013; Norell-Clarke et al., 2015). The effects we found are larger 
than those observed in two meta-analyses on effects of (online) 
CBT-I for depressive symptoms (SMD = −0.36; Ye et al., 2015a; 
d = 0.34 for individual CBT-I, d = 0.13 for self-help CBT-I; 
Ballesio et al., 2017) and larger than in the Christensen study 
which also specifically examined the effects of CBT-I on

depression. There could be several reasons why our observed effect 
on depressive symptoms was better than in other studies. First, 
many studies in the meta-analyses did not specifically target 
depression. Second, we had higher baseline depression severity 
scores in our sample than in the Christensen trial, which provides 
more room for improvement. Also, we used personalized feedback 
while the Christensen trial, and some other studies included in the 
meta-analyses, used automated feedback. Personalized feedback 
has been shown to enhance treatment effects (Lancee et al., 
2013a). Third and last, the Christensen trial used a more active 
control condition (Health Watch) than we did (monitoring only). 
Our second aim was to explore effects of the treatment on 
insomnia. The observed effect on insomnia severity was compar- 
able with a number of other online CBT-I trials but much larger 
(d = −2.36) than what was observed in the trial by Christensen

et al., 2016; Hedges’ g = 0.98 in van Straten et al., 2017). Future 
research is needed to identify sources of this heterogeneity of 
treatment effect sizes. The effects on SE were moderate, but in 
line with observations in a recent meta-analysis (van Straten 
et al., 2017). An increase in SE was also observed in the control 
condition (within Cohen’s d = 0.52, compared with d = 1.19 in 
the i-Sleep condition). It appears that merely keeping a sleep 
diary can have a positive effect on SE, although this result is ten- 
tative since we did not include a third group who did not fill out a 
sleep diary. This means that we cannot rule out that this increase 
in SE might also be caused by natural recovery. 
Interestingly, results did not show that participants were less 
fatigued or slept more (TST) compared with participants in the

control group. Perhaps, due to the SRT, participants were sleeping 
more efficiently and experiencing fewer symptoms (showing 
improvements on all symptom measures) at post-test, but were 
not recovered in such a way that they felt less tired. Possibly, 
the treatment causes participants to improve SE and therefore 
reduces insomnia complaints (i.e. decline on ISI, more satisfied 
with sleep, 
less trouble falling/staying asleep, etc.), while the 
SRT itself limited TST and actually caused fatigue. Fatigue is 
often an important reason for seeking treatment (Riedel and 
Lichstein, 2000) and is a commonly reported side effect of sleep 
restriction (Kyle et al., 2011). However, if the fatigue could be 
interpreted as a side effect of treatment here, then we would 
have expected to see postponed improvements in fatigue after 
treatment, in line with other research (e.g. Vitiello et al., 2014) 
we did not observe this after 6 months. Apparently insomnia 
severity and depression symptoms can largely improve despite 
fatigue remaining stable. Intuitively, it may seem that more and/ 
or better sleep should automatically lead to more restoration of 
depleted resources and therefore less fatigue. But research has 
shown the relationship between fatigue and sleep to be more com- 
plex (Fortier-Brochu et al., 2010). Future research may determine 
whether treatments targeting fatigue directly could be helpful in 
insomnia. 
We found significant moderate to large improvements after 
online CBT-I treatment on our other outcomes intended to meas- 
ure general (psychological) functioning: daytime functioning, 
anxiety, and perseverative thinking. It is interesting to note that 
although the treatment is not specifically aimed at these comorbid 
psychological symptoms, they do improve. The effect on daytime 
functioning (in energy, mood, concentration, sleepiness, product- 
ivity, and relationships) deserves specific attention because they 
are often overlooked in insomnia research (Kyle et al., 2010, 
2013). Suffering daytime consequences is one of the main reasons 
for seeking treatment (Morin et al., 2006) and our findings sug- 
gest online CBT-I for people suffering from insomnia and depres- 
sion has the potential to increase quality of life by improving 
daytime functioning. Future research will be necessary to confirm 
this (see e.g. protocol Espie et al., 2016). 
CBT-I treatment might be regarded as a treatment not purely 
targeting insomnia. Some of the components are clearly targeting 
sleep, for example stimulus-control and SRT. However, parts of 
the sleep hygiene component (i.e., including promoting physical 
exercise and a structured routine in the morning and at night) 
show overlap with behavioral activation, a treatment component 
of CBT for depression. Additionally, 
targeting dysfunctional 
thoughts about sleep resembles cognitive therapy for depression 
and may encourage patients to use this strategy on non-sleep 
related depressive thought patterns as well. Likewise, relaxation 
is also used in depression treatment (Beck, 1979). The question 
remains whether depression symptoms abate because sleep 
the treatment 
improves, or whether specific components of 
work towards improving depression symptoms directly. Which 
specific CBT-I components 
improve depressive complaints 
remains to be investigated. Dismantling studies could be used to 
isolate treatment ingredients that confer benefit to sleep and 
depressive symptoms, which may help refine treatment of the 
common comorbid presentation. A proportion of the participants 
in our study that underwent treatment remained above clinical 
cut-offs for depression (38%) and insomnia (38%) at post-test. 
Future studies should investigate how, possibly, combining proto- 
cols may enhance treatment response. Additionally, mediation 
and network approach research is needed to see whether sleep 
improves before, after or at the same time as depression does. 
Effects were maintained at follow-up. At 6 months follow-up, 
22 (56%) participants in the i-Sleep condition remained below the 
mild depression cut-off (PHQ-9 < 5), and 19 participants (50%) 
(⩽10) on the ISI. 
remained below the insomnia cut-off 
However, since we had a 25% non-response we cannot rule out 
that participants who did not complete the follow-up measure- 
ments were worse off than the ones that did (or neither that 
they were better off). Further research is needed to assess longer- 
term effects more reliably. Technical difficulties forced us to use a 
different program (Qualtrics, www.qualtrics.com) for the sleep 
diary at 6 months. This may have influenced the sleep diary 
adherence. 
Some limitations of the present study need to be acknowl- 
edged. We actively recruited participants who were interested in 
insomnia treatment from the general population who were not 
clinically diagnosed for depression. The majority was female 
and highly educated. This is conceivably a very different popula- 
tion than patients that seek depression treatment through regular 
(mental) health care. However, this is also the case in other stud- 
ies investigating the effect of online depression treatment on

comparable baseline depression severity (e.g. Clarke et al., 2009; 
Cavanagh et al., 2011; Titov et al., 2015). The next step is to 
study whether online CBT-I treatment is also effective for patients 
with depressive symptoms in general (mental) health care set- 
tings, when patients turn to their general practitioner or psycholo- 
gist for help. Also, in this study, we did not restrict time spent by 
clinical psychology students providing the feedback. Lancee et al. 
(2013a, 2013b) showed it is possible to complete guidance for the 
entire treatment in < 40 min. We expect trained professionals 
more experienced with patients will provide feedback in 15– 
20 min per session, lowering the necessary investment. 
In summary, our study shows that guided online CBT-I can be 
used to treat people suffering from both insomnia and depression 
symptoms. In our sample with mild to moderate depressive symp- 
(PHQ-9, d = −1.05; 
toms, effects on depressive symptoms 
PHQ-WS, d = −0.76) were larger than those found in a meta- 
analysis of supported online CBT for self-reported depressive 
symptoms (Andersson and Cuijpers, 2009). Our findings provide 
further evidence that insomnia should not be treated as a mere 
symptom of a depressive episode but requires dedicated attention. 
Targeting insomnia may offer new potential in the treatment of 
depression. Further research is crucial to clarify the specific rela- 
tions between insomnia and depression symptoms, in patients 
with a clinical diagnosis of both, preferably including a depression 
treatment condition and using both self-report and objective mea- 
sures such as actigraphy, to optimize therapeutic effects and 
improve clinical outcomes.
