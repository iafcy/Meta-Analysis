Objective: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], 
theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among 
insomnia patients. 
Methods: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly 
assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n=156) or a control group that received 
only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months 
postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes 
toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring, 
behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in 
outcomes between the two groups and across time. 
Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months, 
and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral 
control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of 
the intervention on outcomes.

Sleep and Insomnia 
Inadequate sleep and sleep disorders are among the most 
frequent problems worldwide [1]. Insomnia is the most common 
sleep disorder affecting approximately one-third of the general 
population [2]. It can have negative consequences on one or 
several spheres in daily life: psychosocial (eg, depression, 
daytime dysfunction, reduced quality of life), occupational 
functioning (eg, job absence, reduced ability to do tasks, poor 
job satisfaction, and inappropriate decisions and choices), or 
elevated burden to society (eg, increased health costs, reduced 
job productivity) [3-5]. Insomnia is described as a dissatisfying 
sleep associated with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep 
or early morning awakening despite good opportunities for sleep 
leading to various daytime symptoms. 
Introducing good sleep hygiene practices is often one of the 
first steps in treating insomnia. Sleep hygiene refers to a variety 
of behaviors that promote sleep quality [6]. Sleep promoting 
behaviors include avoiding going to bed hungry or thirsty, 
avoiding stress and anxiety, avoiding physical activity before 
going to bed, preparing a bedroom that provides a relaxed 
environment, and limiting activities in the bedroom to sleep and 
sexual activities [7]. However, behavioral modifications to 
improve sleep quality can be hard to achieve; many patients 
with insomnia report they have tried to modify their poor sleep 
habits without any effect. Dysfunctional or unrealistic sleep 
expectations and excessive worrying over sleep loss appear to 
contribute to poor sleep hygiene. For instance, a Japanese study 
found that sleep hygiene behaviors are confounded by sleep 
beliefs [8]. Additionally, due to the rise of mobile technologies, 
many individuals now use electronic devices in bed, and this 
may restrict individuals with insomnia from practicing good 
sleep hygiene (eg, being too excited to sleep due to the use of 
media) [9]. Consequently, interventions are needed to help 
individuals with insomnia actually practice sleep hygiene. 
Simply providing intervention on sleep hygiene behaviors for 
individuals with insomnia is insufficient. A review paper of 
qualitative studies showed that individuals suffering from 
insomnia observe the inefficiency of sleep hygiene education 
delivered by health care providers. In particular, health care 
providers are found to have limited knowledge in sleep hygiene 
(ie, they only know a few basic principles), and most providers 
are unable to incorporate theoretical models or techniques to 
deliver sleep hygiene [10]. Therefore, interventions concerning 
sleep hygiene behaviors should incorporate robust and effective 
theoretical models. Indeed, in a systematic review and 
meta-analysis, Webb et al [11] found that using theories as a 
framework in designing online interventions led to a substantial 
effect on outcome variables. Theoretical models can help to 
select the components of the intervention and help in evaluation 
of the intervention’s impact [12-22]. By designing interventions 
based on empirically derived theoretical principles, researchers 
can identify the most powerful determinants of a given construct 
[23]. Despite evidence-based recommendations that support the 
utility of theory-based approaches for designing interventions 
[21], very few studies have considered this aspect [22,24].

Therefore, studies using theory to support treatment efficacy 
are much needed. 
There are four empirically validated theoretical models 
(cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior 
[TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control 
theory [CT]) that may assist individuals with insomnia in 
engaging good sleep hygiene. 

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
CBT focuses on the effect of individuals’ beliefs, thoughts, and 
attitudes on their feelings and behaviors. The purpose of CBT 
is to educate individuals on how to proactively deal with 
problems or events during their lives [25]. CBT for insomnia 
(CBT-I) relies on the general principles of CBT and is designed 
to relieve insomnia symptoms [26]. The efficacy of CBT-I has 
been demonstrated in studies [27,28], and a randomized 
controlled 
that CBT-I outperformed 
medication in the long run [28]. The principles of CBT are 
presented to insomnia patients as a set of scientific methods 
with assessed efficacy [29]. The principles of CBT-I include 
behavioral modifications such as stimulus control, sleep 
restriction, sleep hygiene, relaxation training, and cognitive 
therapy. The goal is to adjust sleeping habits using cognitive 
strategies to improve thoughts, feelings, and expectations 
concerning sleep [30,31]. CBT-I can be held in group, individual 
face-to-face, or online (eg, app-based) sessions based on the 
therapist’s priority, patient’s progress, or both [32]. Although 
the efficacy of online CBT-I has been well established for 
general populations [25], there is a lack of understanding of 
how the efficacy of online CBT-I is explained by psychological 
mechanisms [33,34]. Therefore, this study incorporated CBT-I 
techniques using an app and investigated the underlying 
psychological mechanisms in the effectiveness of CBT-I, for 
which evidence has been extensively presented in the literature 
[26,28-33]. 
Theory of Planned Behavior 
TPB is one of the most widely applied sociocognitive theories. 
According to TPB, behavioral intention—an individual’s 
expression of their decisions to perform or not perform a specific 
behavior—is the most proximal determinant of an individual’s 
behavior. Behavioral intention, in turn, is determined by three 
constructs: attitudes toward the behavior (ie, whether an 
individual prefers or values the specific behavior), subjective 
norms (ie, the opinions of the individual’s significant others on 
the specific behavior), and perceived behavioral control (ie, 
how confident the individual feels in performing the specific 
behavior) [35]. The TPB has been used for understanding a 
variety of behaviors including sleep hygiene behaviors [7,36-38]. 
Based on TPB, health care providers may try to improve the 
attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control of 
individuals on their sleep hygiene behaviors. Subsequently, the 
individual may have elevated intention to practice good sleep 
hygiene. 
Health Action Process Approach 
Despite the success of TPB, there is evidence that intentions do 
not necessarily translate into actual behavior (ie, there is an 
intention-behavior gap) [39]. For this reason, HAPA proposes 
J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 4 | e15841 | p. 2 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


a series of volitional, or postintentional, processes that aim to 
bridge the intention-behavior gap. HAPA focuses more on 
postintentional processes than TPB. The volitional phase 
specifies both action planning and coping planning as mediators 
of the intention-behavior relationship. Action planning indicates 
how individuals move their intention into action (in this case, 
sleep hygiene behaviors). More specifically, individuals make 
plans to practice their sleep hygiene behavior. Coping planning 
indicates how individuals design any plan to overcome the 
possible obstacles in the intended behavior (again in this case, 
sleep hygiene). More specifically, individuals make plans to 
avoid any potential obstructions that hinder their sleep hygiene 
behaviors [38]. Using action and coping planning, individuals 
can better equip their intention to initiate sleep hygiene 
behaviors. Health care providers may assist individuals with 
insomnia to facilitate action and coping plans to ensure that 
individuals’ sleep hygiene behaviors can be implemented and 
actualized. 
Control Theory 
CT explains self-regulation systems, which are critical elements 
in analyzing human behaviors. The fundamental idea of CT is 
the negative feedback loop, and a behavior is performed when 
the discrepancy between current state (eg, drink a cup of tea 
before sleep) and reference value (eg, should not drink caffeine 
prior to sleep) is observed by individuals [40]. In order to assess 
the discrepancy, the technique of self-monitoring can be 
incorporated to the theoretical models mentioned above (CBT, 
TPB, and HAPA) to enhance the behavioral intention in 
performing sleep hygiene behaviors. 
Related Work on App 
The insomnia intervention was delivered via a smartphone app 
to make it available and accessible to meet population needs; 
app-based interventions overcome some of the pragmatic 
problems of the face-to-face therapy, including time limitations 
and high costs [41,42]. Indeed, app-based programs have been 
developed with highly personalized, tailored, and fully 
automated features [43-45]. In relation to exposure of in-person 
contact, a CBT-I app can be used as supplementary support to 


in-person therapy or as a primary intervention for insomnia 
through fully automated CBT-I (ie, the therapeutic program can 
be offered without any human support) [45]. The app designed 
in this study is similar to the CBT-i Coach [46]. More 
specifically, the app used in this study was designed to increase 
patients’ knowledge and skills using CBT-I (for detailed 
information please refer to the app overview section in the 
Methods). Both apps attempt to reduce insomnia symptoms. 
Although 
sleep hygiene 
recommendations in the session, the app used in our study 
directly addresses practicing sleep hygiene behaviors. 
Specifically, some theoretical constructs (eg, behavior change 
techniques [BCTs]) for changing participants’ sleep behaviors 
were applied. Also, some techniques derived from behavioral 
theories (eg, action planning and coping planning) were used 
to help participants achieve behavioral goals [47]. The app used 
in this study focuses on changing people’s sleep behaviors 
whereas other available sleep apps emphasize sleep mentoring 
[44]. Additionally, the apps summarized by Choi et al [44] 
generally assess sleep quantitatively (eg, sleep efficacy, sleep 
time) rather than taking sleep quality into account. 
Study Aims 
This study aimed to determine the long-term treatment efficacy 
of a theory-based app using CBT, TPB, HAPA, and CT on sleep 
hygiene among insomnia patients. The primary evaluation 
involved comparing sleep hygiene behaviors and sleep quality 
with a control group that received patient education (PE). 

Design 
A 2-arm single-blind parallel-group RCT was launched to 
compare CBT-I and PE groups via an app over a 6-month 
period. Potential participants were included after initial 
screening and signing informed consent forms. The flowchart 
of the study design is shown in Figure 1. Primary and secondary 
outcomes were assessed online at baseline, 1 month 
postintervention, 3 months postintervention, and 6 months 
postintervention.

Setting, Participants, and Recruitment 
This Iranian-based study was advertised using brochures and 
posters at 3 universities, 5 colleges, and 10 general physicians’ 
offices as well as on social media. Interested participants were 
asked to access an online platform specifically designed for the 
study to complete a screening questionnaire assessing insomnia 
symptoms comprising the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), sleep 
characteristics, and medical history as well as their time spent 
on computers and online. If participants met the initial criteria 
and expressed interest, a phone appointment was scheduled to 
conduct additional eligibility assessments. All telephone 
interviews were performed by three research assistants who had 
been trained by an experienced sleep medicine specialist during 
two 3-hour sessions. The sleep medicine specialist observed 
each research assistant during three actual patient encounters. 
The sleep medicine specialist and research assistant scored the 
patients independently. The scores were then compared to ensure 
that data collection procedures were consistent. There was more 
than 98% agreement between the sleep medicine specialist and 
research assistant in all cases.

Selection Criteria 
The inclusion criteria were (1) being age 18 years or older, (2) 
having insomnia disorder according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) 
[48], (3) having an ISI score of 10 or higher [49], (4) 
understanding Persian, and (5) having access to a smartphone 
and/or desktop computer with internet access. 
Participants were excluded if they (1) had an uncontrolled 
medical condition that interfered with sleep or required 
immediate treatment (eg, obstructive sleep apnea requiring 
continuous positive airway pressure treatment), (2) did shift 
work, (3) were pregnant, (4) were participating in other research 
and/or clinical trials, (5) had received psychotherapy in the past 
6 months, (6) had current major depressive disorder based on 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 disorders, (7) had 
a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, (8) 
showed evidence of alcohol abuse (more than 3 glasses of 
alcohol per day at least 21 days a month), (9) misused marijuana 
(use more than once per week), (10) appeared suicidal, or (11)

PE or a treatment group receiving CBT-I. Both study groups 
had access to their related content on the app. 
Sample Size Calculation 
The sample size was estimated based on previous studies on 
internet-based self-help insomnia interventions with a moderate 
effect size [42,50]. Using a 2-tailed test with a small-to-medium 
effect size (Cohen d=0.40) and significance level of P=.05, a 
total sample size of 266 (ie, 133 per group) had 90% power. To 
include an estimated dropout rate of 15%, entire sample size 
was increased from 266 to 312 participants (ie, 156 per group). 
Randomization and Allocation Procedures 
Participants who met the inclusion criteria and signed the 
informed consent were randomly assigned to a control group 
(PE) or a treatment group (CBT-I) at a 1:1 ratio. Randomization 
was performed by an independent researcher via a random list 
generated using SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp). Because 
blinding participants from treatment condition was impossible, 
the study blinded the data analyst using a code system for 
treatment condition. Moreover, the data analyst did not have 
access to the key document. Participants in both groups received 
assistance from a trained research assistant to help them install 
and unlock the app. To avoid contamination, participants in the 
PE group could not access the CBT-I content, which was locked 
using a personal code. 
App Overview 
The app was designed based on a combination of TPB, HAPA, 
and CBT-I [29] and used the self-help concept [19] in order to 
treat insomnia. Several BCTs are integrated in the app, including 
information about health consequences, information about social 
and environmental consequences, habit formation, habit reversal, 
pros and cons of performing sleep hygiene behaviors, 
reconstructing the physical environment, reconstructing the 
social environment, self-monitoring of behavior, action planning, 
and problem solving [51]. The intervention contents were 
designed across 6 weeks, with exercises and subtutorials 
automatically provided each week (Table 1). Detailed 
information with screenshots is provided in Multimedia 
Appendix 1. 
The content of the CBT-I was designed for treating patients 
with insomnia individually using weekly sessions, with each 
session lasting approximately 1 hour. However, participants 
could complete their sessions more quickly (ie, less than 1 hour) 
if they improved faster. The content of session 1 was provided 
for participants using plain text. For sessions 2 and 3, we used 
a variety of relaxation tools via audio guided meditation 
exercises as well as images. Session 4 provided correct 
information concerning sleep in plain text and tables, addressing 
incorrect information about insomnia participants may have 
heard. In sessions 5 and 6, plain text and tables were used to 
help participants plan their sleep hygiene behaviors. A sleep 
diary was used along with the ISI completed by participants to 
help 
improvements. 
Development of the current app is still at an early stage, and 
customizing content to suit individual specific situations is under 
consideration for an updated version of the app. The current 
version does not have individually tailored content. 


Access to the app content was provided to the participants each 
week; participants could not view the app content for weeks 2 
through 6 (ie, sessions 2-6) when they were in week 1 of the 
intervention, but as participants continued, previous sessions 
remained unlocked. Every week, there was homework or an 
exercise, and participants were encouraged to complete it 
weekly. The content in the next session was opened the 
following week. Most of the participants used the app as 
recommended, and a reminder text message was sent to those 
who did not open the session content on time. 





















aBehavior change techniques are sourced from the taxonomy of Michie et al [51]. For instance, BCT 5.3 (information about social and environmental 
consequences) represents the subgroup of the taxonomy natural consequence (group 5). 
Patient Education Procedure 
Participants in the PE group received written weekly information 
on accurate and relevant information regarding insomnia 
symptoms (week 1), physiological controls of sleep (week 2), 
sleep hygiene practices (week 3), healthy sleep behaviors (eg, 
reduce time in bed, get up at the same time every day, go to bed 
only if sleepy, and do not stay in bed unless asleep; week 4), 
and changing lifestyles to promote sleep health (week 5). The 
information was presented as separate content from the CBT-I 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 4 | e15841 | p. 5 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


in the app. This weekly information was unlocked for 
participants on a weekly basis. Participants in the PE group 
were informed that they could access the CBT-I content on the 
app at the end of the study (6 months after completing the 
intervention). 
Measures 
All participants completed a sociodemographic profile 
questionnaire (age, gender, educational status, occupational 
status) at the baseline assessment and primary and secondary 
outcomes were assessed. The complete measures used to assess 
primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Multimedia 
Appendix 2. 


Sleep hygiene behavior was assessed using three items. The 
participants were asked to report how many days they had good 
sleep hygiene behavior over the past week (How many days did 
you make your bedroom restful over the past week?), whether 
they avoided going to bed feeling hungry or thirsty, and whether 
they avoided anxiety and stress-provoking activity before bed. 
Participants were asked to respond on an 8-point scale ranging 
from 0 to 7. The internal consistency of the three items was 
found to be acceptable in a previous study (α=.78) [38]. 

The ISI is a 7-item self-report scale that assesses participant 
level of insomnia over the past 2 weeks. All items are rated on 
a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0=no problem to 4=very 
severe problem. A total score is generated by summing all 7 
items ranging from 0-28 with 5 subscores: 0-7 (absence of 
insomnia), 8-14 (subthreshold insomnia), 15-21 (moderate 
insomnia), and 22-28 (severe insomnia). The ISI has been 
translated into Persian, and its psychometric properties have 
been documented among Iranian adults [52]. 

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a subjective 
measure of sleep quality and disturbances over the past month 
that contains 19 items grouped into 7 separate component scores: 
subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual 
sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, 
and daytime dysfunction. Scores are summed to provide a global 
sleep quality score. The Persian version of the PSQI has been 
validated and described in detail [53]. 


Attitude toward good sleep hygiene was assessed using 5-point 
evaluative semantic differential scales (eg, “To make my 
bedroom/sleep environment restful would be: unpleasant- 
pleasant, good-bad, wise-foolish, correct-incorrect, unenjoyable- 
enjoyable, satisfying-unsatisfying, useful-useless”). Internal 
consistency of this 12-item scale has been found acceptable in 
previous studies [24,38]. 

Perceived behavioral control was assessed using three items 
(eg, “I am confident 
that every day I can prevent 
anxiety-provoking activity before bedtime”). All items were 
scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1=totally disagree 
to 5=totally agree. The scale has been proved internally 
consistent in previous studies [24,38]. 

Behavioral intention was assessed using 6 items (eg, “Over the 
next week, I intend to make my bedroom restful”). All items 
were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=totally 
disagree to 5=totally agree. Internal consistency of this scale 
has been found acceptable in previous studies [24,38]. 

Action planning was assessed using 4 items. The participants 
were asked to indicate if they have made a detailed plan 
regarding (1) when, (2) where, (3) how, and (4) how often they 
will perform sleep hygiene behaviors over the next 6 months. 
All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 
1=totally disagree to 5=totally agree. The internal consistency 
of this scale has been found acceptable in previous studies 
[24,38,54]. 

Coping planning was assessed using 5 items (eg, “I have made 
a detailed plan regarding what to do if something interferes with 
my plans”). All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale 
ranging from 1=totally disagree to 5=totally agree. Internal 
consistency of this scale has been found acceptable in previous 
studies [24,38,55]. 

Self-monitoring was assessed by 3 items (“I keep track of how 
much time I spend sleeping,” “I pay attention to how tired or 
rested I feel each day,” and “I take care to note the time that I 
go to bed and wake each day”). Responses were rated on a scale 
ranging from 1=never to 5=always. 

The extent to which sleep hygiene behaviors are habitual for an 
individual was assessed using the Self-Report Behavioral 
Automaticity Index (SRBAI). The SRBAI contains 4 items that 
start with the stem “Sleep hygiene behavior is something...” 
followed by “I do automatically,” “I do without having to 
consciously remember,” “I do without thinking,” and “I start 
doing before I realize I’m doing it.” The reliability of the Persian 
SRBAI has been reported [56]. 

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a 14-item scale 
that assesses anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) in 
patients with both somatic and mental problems. All items were 
scored on a 0 to 3 scale with higher score representing higher 
levels of anxiety and depression. The Iranian version of the 
scale has been validated in different clinical patients [57].

Data Management 
All data were collected and stored using the FileMaker Pro 15 
(Claris International Inc) database. Participants’ names, phone 
numbers, and addresses were recorded. Each participant received 
a unique code. All data were password protected and encrypted 
to ensure that confidentiality of the data was maintained 
throughout the study. The study was monitored (via quality 
control and audits) by the Social Determinants of Health 
Research Center at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences to 
ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable regulations 
was maintained and data were collected in a timely, accurate, 
and complete manner. 
Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were performed in accordance with 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
guidelines. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed to take 
care of attrition. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize 
the characteristics of the participants. To evaluate the magnitude 
of changes in primary and secondary outcomes over time across 
the two groups, linear mixed models (PROC MIXED) were 
performed controlling for baseline variables and other covariates 
that may relate to the outcome. The mixed modeling approach 
is a powerful statistical tool to evaluate group differences over 
time with unequal numbers of participants at baseline and 
follow-up. It is also a helpful way to handle missing data using 
full information maximum likelihood estimation. The analysis 
incorporated two between-participant effects (between groups 
and between participants within groups) and 
three 
within-participant effects (between times, group by time 
interactions, and random variation). All P values were 2-sided 
and were evaluated as statistically significant at the .05 level. 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute Inc). 
Ethics and Dissemination 
This study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of 
Qazvin University of Medical Sciences (IR.QUMS.REC. 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
1396.455) 








aPE: patient education. 
bCBT-I: cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. 
[NCT03605732], last updated July 2018. This study was 
performed based on the Helsinki Declaration principles. 
Required permissions were obtained from authorities of Qazvin 
University of Medical Sciences. After research assistants 
expressed objectives and assured participants about the 
confidentiality of their data and possibility of withdrawing from 
the study, informed consent forms were signed by those 
participants willing to participate in this research. 

General Use of the App 
App engagement was assessed using an online database that 
recorded the number of log-ins and the duration of each log-in 
for all participants. The results showed that over the 6-month 
study period, the mean number of log-ins in both groups was 
41.21 (SD 39.50). Participants in the CBT group had a higher 
number of log-ins (mean 42.65 [SD 42.58]) as compared with 
the PE group (mean 40.93 [SD 45.01]); however, this difference 
was not statistically significant (P=.38). Mean length of time 
using the app in all participants was 1580 minutes (SD 1460.37). 
The participants in the CBT group had significantly longer 
duration of app use (mean 1780.34 [SD 1770.07] minutes) 
compared with the PE group (mean 1370 [SD 450.01] minutes; 
P=.03). 
Descriptive Statistics in Demographics, Primary 
Outcomes, and Secondary Outcomes 
Table 2 shows that both CBT-I and PE groups shared similar 
demographic characteristics. Specifically, the mean age of the 
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group was 36.21 (SD 5.81) years, 
and the mean age of those in the PE was 35.29 (SD 5.76) years. 
Slightly less than half of the participants were male in each 
group (46.1% [72/156] in the CBT-I group and 42.3% [66/156] 
in the PE group). 
Table 3 describes the sleep quality (using PSQI), severity of 
insomnia (using ISI), sleep hygiene behaviors, and health status 
of both groups at baseline and 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month 
follow-ups.

Effects of the Intervention on Primary Outcomes 
The intervention had promising effects on the three primary 
outcomes: sleep quality, severity of insomnia, and sleep hygiene 
behaviors. Specifically, sleep quality was improved among 
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group compared with those in 
the PE at all follow-ups, as suggested by scores on the PSQI 
(P<.001 for 1, 3, and 6 months). Similar improvements were 
shown in severity of insomnia (ie, significant decrease in the 
severity of insomnia among the CBT-I group compared with

Effects of the Intervention on Secondary Outcomes 
In terms of secondary outcomes, analyses indicated that 
insomnia patients in the CBT-I group had better attitude (P=.03 
at 1 month; P=.04 at 3 months; P=.03 at 6 months), stronger 
perceived behavioral control (P values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6 
months), higher intention (P values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months) 
to develop good sleep hygiene behavior, and were more likely 
to have formed relevant action and coping plans (P values <.001 
at 1, 3, and 6 months; Table 5). Additionally, insomnia patients 
in the CBT-I group had higher behavioral automaticity (P values 
<.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months), better self-monitoring (P values 
≤.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months), and less anxiety (P=.003 at 1 
month and P<.001 at both 3 and 6 months), and depression (P 
values <.001 at 1, 3, and 6 months) relative to those in the PE 
group (Table 6).

Mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether the 
effects of CBT-I on the primary outcome of sleep hygiene 
behaviors were mediated by changes in relevant beliefs about 
sleep hygiene behaviors as specified by the three proposed 
theories (TPB, HAPA, and CT). Regarding sleep hygiene 
behaviors at 3 months, only action planning was a significant 
mediator (coefficient 1.11; 95% CI 0.54-1.69). Regarding sleep 
hygiene behaviors at 6 months, perceived behavioral control 
(coefficient 0.44; 95% CI 0.10-0.78), coping planning 
(coefficient 0.24; 95% CI 0.12-0.36), self-monitoring 
(coefficient 0.58; 95% CI 0.13-1.03), and behavioral 
automaticity (coefficient 1.00; 95% CI 0.17-1.83) were 
significant mediators (Table 7).

Principal Findings 
This research found that a theory-based intervention improved 
sleep outcomes among insomnia patients in Iran, as evidenced 
by improved sleep hygiene behaviors, increased sleep quality, 
and decreased insomnia severity. These beneficial effects were 
mediated by several changes in the putative determinants of 
behavior, including perceived behavioral control in TPB, action 
and coping planning in HAPA, and self-monitoring and 
behavioral automaticity in CT. Moreover, the entire treatment 
effects were guided by CBT (ie, the use of BCTs). Furthermore, 
as a consequence of improvements in sleep, positive effects of 
CBT-I were demonstrated by reduced anxiety and depression 
among insomnia patients. Researchers and practitioners 
interested in improving sleep quality, particularly among 
insomnia patients, might draw on insights provided by several 
components in TPB [7,35-38], HAPA [38,39], and CT [40] in 
order to design effective interventions for insomnia patients. 
Moreover, use of the CBT-I app may enhance the feasibility of 
providing CBT-I treatments incorporating the components in 
TPB, HAPA, and CT mentioned above. 
The finding that the PE group did not have substantial 
improvement could be due to the following barriers. The written 
information (1) did not have interactive components, commonly 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
used in apps, and may not have triggered the motivation of 
participants to obtain the information; (2) did not have any 
psychological mechanism to support its use whereas the CBT-I 
app incorporated and improved psychological components (eg, 
attitudes) for participants to actively engage in sleep, and (3) 
may have been hard to translate into daily practice for the PE 
group. Consequently, use of the PE group as a control is 
appropriate because PE only provides passive engagement and 
does not have any psychological mechanism to support its use. 
On the other hand, the CBT-I app involved active engagement 
and included psychological mechanism to support its use. 
Apart from illustrating the effectiveness of the CBT-I app, our 
findings support the notion that the improvements in sleep 
accrued (in part) from changes in several components specified 
by TPB (perceived behavioral control), HAPA (action and 
coping planning), and CT (self-monitoring and behavioral 
automaticity). Therefore, our findings partially support the 
notions from previous studies: health care providers may want 
to use TPB to effectively understand the performance of sleep 
hygiene behaviors [37,38]. Additionally, these findings go 
beyond those correlational studies [37,38] and agree with 
another RCT study [24] that used theory-based (TPB, HAPA, 
and CBT) interventions to improve sleep hygiene behaviors 
among adolescents. More specifically, changes in the putative 
determinants of action lead to changes in the respective 
behaviors (eg, sleep hygiene behaviors, sleep quality, and 
J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 4 | e15841 | p. 12 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


severity of insomnia). Consequently, this research provides 
experimental support for the combination of TPB, HAPA, CT, 
and CBT as a framework for improving sleep among insomnia 
patients. 
Our results also support the idea that it is important for CBT-I 
interventions to incorporate self-regulatory processes such as 
those specified in HAPA and CT. More specifically, action 
planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral 
this study. 
automaticity were significant mediators 
Interestingly, mediated effects of action planning on sleep 
hygiene behaviors were found at 3 months after completing the 
CBT-I program but not at 6 months after completing the 
program. In contrast, mediated effects of coping planning, 
self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity on sleep hygiene 
behaviors were observed at 6 months after completing the CBT-I 
program but not at 3 months after completing the program. 

A possible explanation is the cognitive progress during the 
CBT-I program. Insomnia patients first need to generate 
effective strategies (ie, using action planning) to assist them in 
developing good sleep hygiene behaviors because they do not 
have sufficient ability to devise good strategies [24]. Therefore, 
action planning was an important mediator for sleep hygiene 
behaviors at 3 months. Meanwhile, coping planning, 
self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity are not mediators 
at this stage because insomnia patients put all their efforts in 
action planning and do not have additional efforts to work on 
coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity. 
In terms of sleep hygiene behaviors at 6 months, insomnia 
patients are very likely to have satisfactory capability in action 
planning. Therefore, action planning loses its importance as 
mediator because insomnia patients can use the good strategies 
they have generated. In contrast, insomnia patients need to deal 
with all the unforeseen barriers and keep their practice. 
Therefore, coping planning (ie, thinking ahead to tackle possible 
barriers) [39], self-monitoring (ie, reflection on the difference 
between preferred and actual performance) [40], and behavioral 
automaticity (ie, developing the behaviors into habitual pattern) 
[56] become important mediators at this stage. 
This study’s findings on self-regulatory processes also support 
those of correlational studies that point to the importance of 
self-regulatory processes in predicting sleep hygiene behaviors 
and related outcomes, although in a different population [38]. 
In their study with obstructive sleep apnea patients, Deng et al 
[58] found that an intervention based on HAPA improved 
participant sleep quality. Our study suggests that targeting 
and 
different 
self-regulatory processes) specified in TPB, HAPA, and HAPA 
can lead to changes in the respective behaviors (eg, sleep 
hygiene in this study). 


Strengths and Limitations 
Our study has several strengths. First, few trials using 
psychological interventions built on empirically based theories 
have been designed for sleep problems. Therefore, results 
derived from this study provided information about relevant 
mechanisms of change. Second, development of an app may 
improve the effects of a sleep intervention in insomnia. More 
specifically, providing a technology-based intervention could 
be an effective and accessible way to overcome numerous 
barriers to CBT-I, such as low access, high costs, time 
constraints, social stigma, and the lack of therapists and trained 
mental health experts, as well as providing an intervention 
overcoming economic and geographical barriers. Third, this 
study controlled for many potential biases. For example, the 
blindness of the analyst and the avoidance of contamination 
were addressed. Fourth, although all the measures were 
self-reported, instruments used in this study had satisfactory 
psychometric properties. Consequently, the reliability and 
validity of outcome measures were ensured. 
There are some limitations in the study. First, participants were 
not representative of the entire population of Iranian patients 
with insomnia. For example, participants in this study needed 
to use the app to receive the intervention. Therefore, insomnia 
patients who have little literacy in using smartphones or desktop 
computers may not gain benefit from CBT-I. Given that the 
mean age of the studied sample was mid-thirties; the possibility 
to generalize our findings to all inhabitants and age groups is 
low. Second, the use of self-report measures for sleep and mental 
health outcomes could be biased by social desirability or 
memory recall. Although mental health outcomes are hard to 
measure using non-self-reports, future studies may want to use 
objectively measured instruments on sleep quality (eg, 
actigraphy). Third, participants could not be blinded because 
the intervention was obvious to them. Therefore, placebo effects 
were hard to exclude, especially because most of the outcome 
measures were self-reported. However, given that the promising 
effects were found across all outcome measures and placebo 
effects would be unlikely to last 6 months after treatment ends, 
we tentatively concluded that CBT-I is an effective program to 
treat insomnia. Last, as the study only followed participants 6 
months after completing the intervention, it is unclear whether 
CBT-I can provide effects lasting longer than 6 months. Future 
studies are thus warranted to examine the long-term effect of 
CBT-I. 
Conclusion 
The theory-based CBT-I intervention shows promising effects 
in treating sleep problems for insomnia patients. After receiving 
the feasible and short (ie, 6 weeks) CBT-I, insomnia patients 
showed improved sleep hygiene behaviors, enhanced sleep 
quality, and 
insomnia severity. Moreover, other 
psychological distress outcomes (ie, anxiety and depression) of 
the insomnia patients who received CBT-I showed improvement 
lasting 6 months after the intervention ended.
