First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor and mentor, Dr. Bruce Rybarczyk. I have 
learned a great deal from him these past six years and I am so grateful for his guidance through 
this entire process. I would also like to thank Dr. Laura Siminoff, who provided invaluable 
lessons in research and in being a productive scientist. I would like to thank my entire 
dissertation committee for their helpful feedback in designing and implementing this project. 
This study would not have been possible without the patients who gave their precious time 
during a particularly stressful time in their lives. On a personal note, I would like to thank my 
entire family, including all four of my parents. Last, but certainly not the least, I would like to 
thank my husband, Danny, for his wonderful support throughout my training and in completing 
this project. Thank you all!

In order to better understand your sleep problem and monitor your progress 
while using SHUTi, it is important to collect some information on your sleep 
pattern. 



• How often and when do I fill out the sleep diary? It is necessary 
for you to complete your sleep diary every day. If possible, the 
sleep diary should be completed within one hour of getting out of 
bed in the morning. 
• What should I do if I miss a day on this paper version of the 
diary? If you forget to fill in the diary or are unable to finish it, 
leave the diary blank for that day. If you complete this paper diary 
but do not enter it into SHUTi that day, you can enter up to 3 days 
worth of diaries at one time (today, yesterday, and the day before). 
• What if something unusual affects my sleep or how I feel in the 
daytime? If your sleep or daytime functioning is affected by some 
unusual event (such as an illness, or an emergency) you may make 
brief notes on your diary. 

diary can be used for people who are awake or asleep at unusual 
times. In the sleep diary, the word “day” is the time when you 
choose or are required to be awake. The term “bed” means the 
place where you usually sleep. 
• Will answering these questions about my sleep keep me awake? 
This is not usually a problem. You should not worry about giving 
exact times, and you should not watch the clock. Just give your best 
estimate. 
 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

leep Diary Instructions 
Use the guide below to clarify what is being asked for each item of the Sleep Diary. 


Write the time that you got into bed. This may not be the time you began “trying” to 
fall asleep. 


Record the time that you began “trying” to fall asleep. This is the time you go to bed 
with the intention of falling asleep. It should not include time in bed when you did 
not intend to fall asleep (that is included in Question 1). If you go to bed at 10:15 
PM, but do not turn the lights off with the intention of going to sleep until 11:30 
PM, you should enter 10:15 PM in Question 1 and 11:30 PM for this question. If 
you go to bed at 10:15 PM with the intention of going to sleep right away, but then 
do not fall asleep until 11:30 PM, you should write down 10:15 PM for both 
questions. The next question will capture how long it took to fall asleep. 


Beginning at the time you wrote in question 2, how long did it take you to fall asleep. 
Enter your answer in hours and minutes. Provide your best estimate of how long it 
took you to fall asleep once you got into bed and turned off the lights with the 
intention of going to sleep. If you go to bed at 10:15 PM with the intention of going to 
sleep, but then do not fall asleep until 11:30 PM, you should write down 1 hour 15 
minutes (75 minutes total) in this space. 
How many times did you wake up, not counting your final awakening? How 
many times did you wake up between the time you first fell asleep and your final 
awakening? This is the number of times you remember waking up during the 
night. 

 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 
 
What was the total time you were awake between the time you first fell asleep and 
your final awakening. Enter your answer in hours and minutes. For example, if you 
woke 3 times for 20 minutes, 35 minutes, and 15 minutes, add them all up 
(20+35+15= 70 min or 1 hr and 10 min). Estimate to the best of your knowledge how 
many minutes you spent awake for all awakenings combined. This should not 
include your very last awakening in the morning, as this will be logged in the next 
question (Question 6). 
Record the last time you woke up in the morning. This is the very last time you 
woke up in the morning. If you woke up at 4:00 AM and never went back to sleep, 
this is the time to write. However, if you woke up at 4:00 AM, but went back to 
sleep for a brief period of time (for example, from 6:00 AM to 6:35 AM; this 
information would then be included in Questions 4 and 5), then your last 
awakening would be 6:35 AM. 

What time did you get out of bed with no further attempt at sleeping? This may be 
different from your final awakening time (e.g., you may have woken up at 6:35 AM 
but did not get out of bed to start your day until 8:20 AM). 


“Sleep Quality” is your sense of whether your sleep was good or poor. Please use the 
following 5-point scale to indicate how you felt when you got up in the morning: 
(1=Very Poor, 2=Poor, 3=Fair, 4=Good, 5=Very Good) 






 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 
 

Estimate the total amount of time you spent napping or dozing, in hours and 
minutes. For instance, if you napped twice, once for 30 minutes and once for 60 
minutes, and dozed for 10 minutes, you would answer 1 hour 40 min. 
This should include all naps even if they were not intentional. For instance, if you 
dozed off in front of the TV for 30 minutes, this should be included. If you did not 
nap or doze, select 0 (zero). 



Enter the number of alcoholic drinks you had where 1 drink is defined as one 12 oz 
beer (can), 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz liquor (one shot). 



If you had an alcoholic drink yesterday, enter the time of day in hours and minutes of 
your last drink. If you did not have a drink, write “N/A” (not applicable). 
Did you take any over-the-counter or prescription medication(s) to help 
you sleep? If so, list medication(s), dose, and time taken: 
List the medication name, how much and when you took EACH different medication 
you took tonight to help you sleep. Include medication available over the counter, 
prescription medications, and herbals (example: "Zolpidem 10 mg 10 pm"). If every 
night is the same, write “same” after the first day. 


If you have anything that you would like to say that is relevant to your sleep feel free 
to write it here.
