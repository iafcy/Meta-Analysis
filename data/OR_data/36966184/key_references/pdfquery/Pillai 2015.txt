Though the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is well-established, the 
paucity of credentialed providers hinders widespread access. Further, the impact of alternatives 
such as web-delivered CBTI has not been adequately tested on common insomnia comorbidities 
such as anxiety. Therefore, we assessed the impact of an empirically validated web-delivered 
CBTI intervention on insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms. A sample of 22 adults 
(49.8±13.5 yo; 62.5% female) with DSM-5 based insomnia were randomized to either an active 
CBTI treatment group (n = 13) or an information-control (IC) group (n = 9). Participants in the 
CBTI group underwent a standard CBTI program delivered online by a ‘virtual’ therapist, whereas 
the IC group received weekly ‘sleep tips’ and general sleep hygiene education via electronic mail. 
All participants self-reported sleep parameters, including sleep onset latency (SOL), insomnia 
symptoms per the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and anxiety symptoms per the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI) at both baseline as well as follow- up assessment one week post-treatment. There 
were no significant differences between the CBTI and IC groups on baseline measures. The CBTI 
group showed significantly larger reductions in BAI scores (t = 2.6; p < .05; Cohen’s d = .8) and 
ISI scores (t = 2.1; p < .05; Cohen’s d = .9) at follow-up than did the IC group. Further, changes 
in SOL from baseline (62.3±44.0 minutes) to follow-up (22.3±14.4 minutes) in the CBTI group 
were also significantly greater (t = 2.3; p < .05; Cohen’s d = .9) than in the IC group (baseline: 
55.0±44.2 minutes; follow-up: 50.±60.2 minutes). 
This study offers preliminary evidence that a web-delivered CBTI protocol with minimal patient 
contact can improve comorbid anxiety symptoms among individuals with insomnia.

The historical view of insomnia as a symptom or ‘secondary’ consequence of an underlying 
condition arguably stems from its pervasiveness across the entire spectrum of medical 
and psychiatric disorders [1]. Indeed, insomnia co-occurring with another disorder is the 
most prevalent insomnia phenotype, accounting for over 80% of all cases [2]. However, 
epidemiological studies suggest that insomnia may not only precede the so-called primary 
condition but also exacerbate its course and severity [3-5]. Further, treatment studies show 
that insomnia often fails to remit despite successful alleviation of the primary disorder [6-8]. 
These observations have led to a more empirically robust conceptualization of insomnia 
as a primary disorder which can strongly influence its comorbidities [9]. As reflected in 
the 2005 NIH state-of-the-science conference statement, there is now growing evidence 
that treating insomnia can lead to improvements in a variety of comorbid conditions [10]. 
Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI), now recognized as a first-line treatment 
for insomnia [11, 12], has been shown to improve comorbid depression, chronic pain, and 
immune function (see Smith et al., [13] for a review). A small but emerging literature also 
offers preliminary support for the efficacy of CBTI in ameliorating anxiety symptoms. 
Though estimates vary as a function of diagnostic and methodological rigor, the comorbidity 
between insomnia and clinical anxiety is significant; some studies suggest that over 70% 
of patients with anxiety disorders also experience insomnia [14, 15]. Further, in a well- 
controlled recent study, participants with an insomnia diagnosis were 17 times more likely 
to report anxiety than were normal sleepers [16]. Insomnia is also a particularly refractory 
clinical feature of many anxiety disorders. In a clinical trial of cognitive behavior therapy 
for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nearly 50% of participants continued to report 
residual insomnia even though they no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD [8]. Not 
surprisingly, per a meta-analysis of CBTI clinical trials that included an anxiety outcome 
measure, insomnia treatment was associated with a moderate improvement in concurrent 
anxiety symptoms [17]. 
Despite these established benefits of CBTI for insomnia and concomitant anxiety, a number 
of practical barriers hinder widespread access to CBTI. First, the availability of CBTI 
is limited due to the severe shortage of credentialed behavioral sleep medicine (BSM) 
providers. While the prevalence of anxiety disorders and insomnia are each roughly 20% in 
the U.S. [18, 19], there are presently only a little over 200 board-certified BSM providers 
[20,21]. This staggering mismatch between supply and demand highlights the need for 
an alternative to therapist-delivered CBTI. Although CBTI delivered by nurses and para- 
professionals have shown promise, these modalities also rely on face-to-face contact and 
thus cannot be scaled to meet the population need [22]. A web- based CBTI protocol can 
overcome such obstacles to widespread delivery, reduce health-care costs, and help patients 
avoid the social stigma associated with meeting a therapist. Further, an internet- based

intervention can be easily integrated into the ‘stepped care’ model of health care as an 
intermediary treatment option between sleep hygiene education and individual CBTI with a 
credentialed BSM provider [23]. 
The present study examined the effects of an empirically-validated, web-delivered CBTI 
protocol on insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Specifically, participants with 
DSM-5insomnia [24] were randomized to either an active web-delivered CBTI treatment 
group (n = 13) or an information-control (IC) group (n = 9). Participants in the CBTI group 
underwent a standard 6-week CBTI program, whereas the IC group received weekly ‘sleep 
tips’ and general sleep hygiene education. All participants self-reported sleep parameters, 
including SOL, insomnia symptoms per the ISI [25], daytime sleepiness per the ESS 
[26], and anxiety symptoms per the BAI [27] at both baselines as well as at a follow-up 
assessment one week following treatment. We hypothesized that participants in the CBTI 
group would experience significantly greater improvements in both insomnia and anxiety 
symptoms than would those in the IC group. 



Participants were recruited from the Evolution of pathways to insomnia cohort (EPIC) study, 
a three-year NIMH-funded prospective investigation of a large community-based sample 
from southeastern Michigan [3, 28]. Specifically, participants who completed the third wave 
of data collection for the EPIC study were assessed for eligibility in the present study 
based on the following inclusion criteria: met diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 based insomnia 
[24]; no history of other sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea and restless 
leg syndrome; absence of unstable/untreated chronic health conditions; no night/rotating 
shift-work. (Figure 1) depicts the flow of participants through the study. Of the eligible 
participants (n = 34), 2 declined to participate in the present study (Response rate: 94.1%). 
The remaining sample (n = 32) was randomized to either a CBTI (n = 19) group or an IC 
(n = 13) group. Five participants provided incomplete data (< 75%) and one dropped-out 
prematurely (Retention rate: 81.3%). 
Per DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, participants earned an insomnia diagnosis if they reported 
experiencing one or more sleep complaints (e.g., ‘have you experienced difficulty falling 
asleep?’; ‘have you experienced difficulty staying asleep?’) for at least 3 nights a week 
for a period of three months or longer. Further, they had to endorse daytime impairment 
or distress as measured by the following question: ‘to what extent do you consider your 
sleep problems to interfere with your daily functioning?’ Responses were coded on a 4-point 
Likert type scale ranging from ‘0’ (‘not at all’) to ‘4’ (‘very much’), such that participants 
who reported a score of ‘2’ (somewhat) or higher received the diagnosis. 
At baseline and at a follow-up assessment one week following treatment, participants 
completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and self-reported sleep parameters, including sleep onset

S 
 


latency (SOL) and total sleep time (TST). The ISI [25] is an empirically validated, 7-item 
self-report instrument designed to quantify the severity and impact of insomnia symptoms. 
Specific sleep impairment factors assessed by the ISI include: severity of sleep onset, sleep 
maintenance, and early morning awakening problems; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of 
sleep difficulties with daytime functioning; notice ability of sleep problems by others; and 
distress caused by sleep difficulties. The BAI is a 21-item questionnaire which assesses the 
severity of common anxiety symptoms on a 4-point Likert type scale, with higher scores 
indicating greater anxiety [27]. Psychometric validation studies of the BAI report high 
internal consistency as well as good discriminant validity [29]. The ESS [26] was used to 
assess levels of daytime sleepiness, with overall scores of 10 or greater indicating excessive 
or clinically significant sleepiness [30]. 

CBTI: Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia [31] is a structured, multi-model treatment 
which targets sleep-disruptive behaviors and beliefs. Data from clinical trials show 
consistently that CBTI is as effective as pharmacological treatment in the short run, and 
that it is associated with more durable changes in the long run [32]. In the present study, 
participants received 6 weekly sessions of standard CBTI [33], which covered all behavioral 
(e.g., sleep restriction, stimulus control) and cognitive (e.g., cognitive re-structuring, 
paradoxical intention etc.) components, as well as relaxation strategies (e.g., progressive 
muscle relaxation and autogenic training) and sleep hygiene. Specifically, participants were 
immersed in a fully automated media-rich web environment, driven dynamically by baseline 
and progress data. At the start of each session, an animated “virtual therapist” (The Prof) 
conducted a progress review with the participant, explored diary data submitted during the 
week, current sleep status and pattern, and progress achieved against goals previously set. 
Further details of this online intervention as well as illustrative examples are available in a 
prior report [22]. 
IC: The IC group received weekly electronically delivered information on the following 
topics: the basics of endogenous sleep regulation; the impact on sleep of health problems 
such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; the effects of stimulants, such as caffeine and 
nicotine, and other sleep disruptive substances including alcohol; the relationship between 
sleep, diet, and exercise; tips on creating a sleep-conducive bedroom environment that is 
dark, quiet, cool, and comfortable. As with the CBTI group, these topics were divided 
equally across the 6 weekly sessions. Sleep hygiene is neither the primary cause nor 
therapeutic target in insomnia disorder [34, 35], as good sleepers and insomniacs generally 
exhibit comparable sleep hygiene [36]. As such, an IC intervention has not been shown 
to have any independent effects on insomnia [34], and thus serves as an ideal placebo 
condition. 

All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows – Version 
19 [37]. The SOL variable revealed significant skewness; outliers (> 3 SDs above the 
mean) were therefore excluded case wise from all further analyses (n = 4). Univariate 
between- group comparisons for continuous measures were accomplished via independent

samplest-tests. The effect sizes of all statistically significant differences were assessed per 
Cohen’s d, with d =.2, .5, .8 suggesting small, medium, and large effects respectively [38]. 


Baseline descriptive statistics for all participants stratified by group appear in (Table 1). 
Consistent with the gender disparity in the prevalence of insomnia [19], women were over- 
represented in the sample (62.5%). White Americans constituted the largest racial group 
(50%), with smaller percentages of other races (36.4% African American; 4.5 % Asian; 
9.1% Other). However, the small sample size precluded between-group comparisons in 
terms of gender and racial composition; counts in a number of individual cells (e.g., only 
one participant identified as ‘Asian’ in the IC group) were too low for valid chi-square 
analyses. With regard to sleep parameters, SOL and TST for both groups were in the 
clinically significant range [39] and comparable to those reported in prior insomnia studies 
[33]. BAI scores suggested mild to moderate anxiety symptoms among both groups [27]. 
Consistent with the elevated wake-drive observed in insomnia [40], the present sample 
did not evidence any signs of excessive daytime sleepiness on the ESS despite short 
habitual sleep durations (< 7 hrs on average). Finally, there were no statistically significant 
differences between the CBTI and IC groups in age or any of the baseline measures. 
Follow-up summary statistics appear in (Table 2). Between-group differences in post- 
treatment change scores on all study variables across the CBTI and IC groups were 
evaluated via independent sample t-tests. With respect to sleep parameters, the CBTI group 
showed a significantly larger decrease (t = 2.3; p < .05; Cohen’s d = 0.9) in SOL from 
baseline (62.3±44.0 minutes) to follow-up (22.3±14.4 minutes) than the IC group (baseline: 
55.0±44.2 minutes; follow-up: 50.6±60.2 minutes). Further, reductions in ISI scores (t = 
2 
05; Cohen’s d = 0.9) were also significantly greater for the CBTI group than for

the IC group. Post- treatment changes in TST and ESS scores did not differ significantly 
between groups. In terms of comorbid anxiety, the CBTI group exhibited a significantly 
larger decrease (t = 2.6; p < .05) in BAI scores from baseline (11.1±7.9) to follow-up 
(7.2±5.8) in comparison to the IC group (baseline: 8.7±9.4; follow-up: 8.7±8.8). Not unlike 
the sleep parameter changes, this effect was also large (Cohen’s d= 0.8). 


 
 
 

The present study involved a randomized clinical trial of a web-delivered CBTI protocol 
among participants with DSM-5 insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms. An information- 
control condition, which involved sleep education and sleep hygiene tips, served as a 
credible placebo intervention as it mimics the web-based patient contact inherent in the 
CBTI protocol but is inert with respect to sleep outcomes [34]. Follow-up data collected 
one week following treatment revealed that CBTI group experienced significantly greater 
reductions in anxiety symptoms than did the control group. Further, the CBTI group also 
showed significantly greater improvements in SOL and overall insomnia symptomatology 
on the ISI in comparison to the control group. Notably, both SOL and self-reported insomnia 
symptoms in the CBTI group were within normal limits post-treatment, suggesting disorder

remission [39]. Importantly, all above effect sizes were large per standardized norms [38]. 
Finally, as with any CBTI protocol, application of the sleep-restriction module carries the 
risk of inducing excessive daytime sleepiness [41]. However, there was no indication that the 
present protocol was hindered by such adverse iatrogenic effects; ESS scores did not change 
significantly from baseline to follow-up in either group and remained well below the clinical 
threshold [30]. 
This study is an important addition to the relatively sparse literature on sleep-focused 
treatments for anxiety comorbid with insomnia. Though a number of recent clinical trials of 
web-delivered CBTI have shown moderate efficacy in improving sleep [42], this is the first 
report on the effects of a highly innovative and entirely web-delivered CBTI intervention 
[22] on comorbid anxiety symptoms, as assessed by an empirically validated instrument 
[27]. Future studies with larger samples are needed to replicate these findings, and, more 
importantly, to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed improvements in 
concomitant anxiety. While it may be tempting to attribute the aforesaid anxiolytic effects 
of CBTI to improved sleep, meditational analyses are needed to reliably examine this 
hypothesis. Indeed, despite consistent support for the reciprocity between impaired sleep and 
anxiety symptoms [14-16], an empirically robust model of sleep and anxiety regulation has 
yet to emerge [43]. 

Though we believe the above results are quite promising, they must be interpreted with due 
consideration to some of the methodological limitations of this study. First, anxiety was not 
the primary outcome measure in the present study, and, as such, we were unable to quantify 
the proportion of participants who met strict diagnostic criteria for a particular anxiety 
disorder. Note that this is reflective of a major gap in the CBTI literature at large, as anxiety 
is rarely the outcome of interest in CBTI trials; of the over 200 reported CBTI studies, only 
28 randomized, placebo-controlled trials included an anxiety measure [17]. We are unaware 
of any clinical trials that specifically examined the efficacy of CBTI in alleviating symptoms 
of generalized anxiety disorder, one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders [44]. Further, 
only two prior studies [45, 46] have addressed the impact of CBTI on PTSD symptoms. 
Importantly, however, both studies combined CBTI with imagery-rehearsal therapy [47], a 
treatment geared toward cognitive restructuring of nightmares, and were thus unable to parse 
out the effects of pure CBTI. 
A second potential limitation in the present study was that baselines levels of anxiety in 
the present sample were in the mild to moderate range, thus limiting the generalizability 
of findings. Note, however, that this reflects the strength of these effects as a significant 
decrease is more difficult to detect when baseline scores are low. Further, we believe that 
these results are quite valuable as they speak to the feasibility of an internet-based protocol 
in addressing less severe forms of comorbid anxiety in the insomnia population. Per the 
stepped care model of healthcare – which is quickly gaining favor in primary care settings 
where the need and impact of treatment is the greatest [10, 48] – web-delivered CBTI can 
effectively reduce patient load on credentialed specialists who can then devote themselves to 
more challenging and severe clinical presentations.

This study offers preliminary evidence that a web-delivered CBTI protocol with minimal 
patient contact can serve as a cost- and time-effective alternative to traditional face-to-face 
therapy for insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms.
