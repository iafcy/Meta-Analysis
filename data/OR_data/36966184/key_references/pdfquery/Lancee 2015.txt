Abstract. Several trials have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for insomnia. However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the 
cognitive model of insomnia. Identiﬁcation of modiﬁable mechanisms by which the treatment works 
may guide efforts to further improve the efﬁcacy of insomnia treatment. The current study therefore 
has two aims: (1) to replicate the ﬁnding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test 
putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we 
conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to 
either online CBT for insomnia (n ¼ 36) or a waiting-list control group (n ¼ 27). Baseline and 
posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors, 
dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments 
were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically signiﬁcant 
effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures, 
sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety 
behaviors mediated the effects of treatment on insomnia severity and sleep efﬁciency. Together, these 
ﬁndings corroborate the efﬁcacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were 
produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for 
insomnia may speciﬁcally be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of 
sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments. Key words: beliefs; CBT; 
insomnia; online; safety behaviors.

Insomnia, 
is, problems of getting to 
sleep and/or staying asleep, affects about 10% 
of the general population (Ohayon, 2002). In 
the criteria for a DSM-5 
order to meet 
disorder, these sleep complaints need to be 
present for at least three months, cannot be 
better explained by another disorder, and have 
negative daytime consequences (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Among these daytime negative conse- 
quences, studies have documented low con- 
centration, fatigue, and impaired cognitive 
functioning (Espie, Kyle, Hames, Cyhlarova, 
& Benzeval, 2012; Kyle, Morgan, & Espie, 
2010; LeBlanc et al., 2007; Roth & Drake, 
2004), as well as an increased likelihood of 
experiencing physical complaints such as 
coronary artery disease (Mallon, Broman, & 
Hetta, 2002), diabetes (Mallon, Broman, & 
Hetta, 2005), and high blood pressure (Suka, 
Yoshida, & Sugimori, 2003). Furthermore, 
insomnia is related to an increased risk of 
developing other mental disorders such as 
depression and anxiety (Baglioni et al., 2011; 
Taylor, Lichstein, Durrence, Reidel, & Bush, 
2005). In addition, insomnia is associated with 




substantial societal costs due to higher work 
absenteeism and decreased productivity 
(Daley, Morin, LeBlanc, Gregoire, & Savard, 
2009). 
Several meta-analyses showed that sleeping 
problems can be effectively treated with 
cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I; Irwin, Cole, & Nicassio, 2006; Morin 
et al., 2006; Morin et al., 1999). CBT-I is as 
effective as sleep medication in the short term, 
and has more support for its efﬁcacy in the 
long term (Rieman & Perlis, 2009; Smith et al., 
2002). Moreover, CBT-I comes without the 
adverse side effects often associated with 
medication, such as headaches, drowsiness, 
and dizziness (Glass, Lanctot, Herrmann, 
Sproule, & Busto, 2005). 
To reach a larger group of people and to 
create easier access to CBT-I, online versions 
of CBT-I for insomnia have been developed. 
Two meta-analyses demonstrated that self- 
help treatment for insomnia yields small to 
moderate effects (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; van 
Straten & Cuijpers, 2009), while a recent meta- 
analysis reported moderate to large effects 
(Ho et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies 
showed that 
these online 
the efﬁcacy of 
treatments is enhanced when patients received 
motivational feedback via the e-mail on their 
exercises and progress (Lancee, van den Bout, 
Sorbi, & van Straten, 2013), especially for the 
subgroup with depressive 
comorbidity 
(Lancee, Sorbi, Eisma, van Straten, & van 
den Bout, 2014). 
While the evidence for (online) CBT-I is 
mounting, support for mechanisms by which 
the treatment works remains scarce. Indeed, in 
their recent meta-analysis on mediators of 
CBT-I, Schwartz and Carney (2012) con- 
cluded that although CBT-I appears to target 
the risk factors of insomnia, more research is 
needed to establish whether CBT-I works 
according to proposed mediators. 
In a cognitive model of insomnia, Harvey 
thinking repetitively 
(2002a) argued that 
about possible sleep deﬁciencies and the 
consequences of impaired sleep contributes 
to arousal and distress, which consequently 
lead to selective attention and increased 
monitoring of sleep-related threats. These 
processes in turn result in an overestimation 
of the consequences of sleep difﬁculties, which 
causes even more impairment in sleep and 
daytime functioning. According to Harvey 
(2002a), dysfunctional beliefs and safety 
behaviors fuel and exacerbate these processes 
and are therefore important maintaining 
insomnia. This paper therefore 
factors of 
aims to test the singular and joint meditational 
potency of these two constructs in the context 
of a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) 
comparing online CBT-I and a waiting-list 
control condition. 
Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are erro- 
neous assumptions, such as unrealistic expec- 
tations about sleep requirements, wrong 
attributions to the causes of insomnia, and 
unrealistic beliefs about the consequences of 
insomnia (Morin & Espie, 2003). These 
dysfunctional beliefs are hypothesized to 
trigger negative emotions that in turn lead to 
impaired sleep. For example, a patient that 
holds the belief “I need eight hours of sleep to 
adequately function during the day” will start 
to worry during the night if less than eight 
hours of available sleeping time remains. 
Following Harvey’s (2002a) model, 
this 
worry/excessive toned cognitive activity will 
lead to distress which will result in a delay in 
sleep onset. 
Most authors recognize the importance of 
dysfunctional beliefs and therefore identifying 
and challenging these beliefs are nowadays a 
standard component of CBT-I (Harvey et al., 
2014; Harvey, Sharpley, Ree, Stinson, & Clark, 
2007; Morin & Espie, 2003). Multiple trials 
measured the effect of insomnia treatment on 
dysfunctional beliefs and found that such 
beliefs were indeed ameliorated by therapy 
compared to control conditions (Edinger, 
Wohlgemuth, Radtke, Marsh, & Quillian, 
2001; Harvey et al., 2007). More importantly, 
changes in dysfunctional beliefs were corre- 
lated with treatment effect (Edinger et al., 2001; 
Espie, Inglis, & Harvey, 2001; Jansson-Froj- 
mark & Linton, 2008; Morin, Blais, & Savard, 
2002). However, only two groups performed 
speciﬁc mediation analyses (Espie et al., 2014; 
Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, & Inoue, 2014). 
Surprisingly, Espie et al. (2014) found that 
dysfunctional beliefs mediated effects of treat- 
ment on a general insomnia measure, but not 
research 
on sleep efﬁciency. Another 
group found no mediating effect of dysfunc- 
tional beliefs on the effects of treatment on 
insomnia severity (Okajima et al., 2014). Stated 
differently, while there is substantial support 
for the relationship between dysfunctional 



beliefs and insomnia, speciﬁc evidence for its 
mediating role in CBT-I remains inconclusive. 
Safety behaviors, that is, subtle avoidance 
behaviors intended to prevent a feared out- 
come, provide relief from distress in the short 
term, but eventually have negative conse- 
quences in the long term (Salkovskis, 1991). 
According to models in the anxiety literature 
(Clark, 1999; Kamphuis & Telch, 1998; 
Salkovskis, 1991) and Harvey’s (2002a) 
insomnia-based model, safety behaviors pre- 
vent disconﬁrmation of patients’ dysfunc- 
tional beliefs. For example, the belief that 
one needs eight hours a night to sleep may lead 
to the safety behavior of going to bed early so 
that there is an increased chance of sleeping 
for eight hours. This safety behavior will have 
the short-term beneﬁt of being more rested in 
the morning, but it also prevents falsiﬁcation 
of the belief that one needs eight hours of 
sleep for adequate functioning during the next 
day. The safety behavior thereby blocks 
opportunities to gain new insights about 
sleep learning by misattributing the prevention 
of sleep problems to the safety behavior. 
Notably, this may not apply to all safety 
behavior; for example, recent evidence shows 
that the careful use of safety behaviors can 
have beneﬁcial effects for treatment 
(e.g., 
allowing some safety behaviors can motivate 
to do their exercises; Levy & 
patients 
Radomsky, 2014). In insomnia, these safety 
behaviors can occur both during the day and 
at night, and are not exclusively aimed at 
controlling overt behavior but also at control- 
ling thoughts and imagery (Harvey, 2002a). 
Safety behaviors in insomnia have only 
recently become the object of empirical 
scrutiny. Upon identiﬁcation of safety beha- 
it was 
viors in insomnia (Harvey, 2002b), 
demonstrated that people with insomnia 
report engaging in more safety behavior than 
people without insomnia (Jansson-Frojmark, 
Harvey, Norell-Clarke, & Linton, 2012; Ree & 
Harvey, 2004). Also, the need to engage in 
safety behavior (but not the intensity at which 
people engage in it) was associated with 
insomnia severity (Hood, Carney, & Harris, 
two treatment studies 
2011). Moreover, 
showed that safety behaviors were amelio- 
rated by CBT-I (Harvey et al., 2007; Jernelov 
et al., 2012). On the other hand, Woodley and 
Smith (2006) found insomnia severity unre- 
lated to the use of safety behaviors and 
Gosling, Batterham, and Christensen (2012) 
reported that safety behaviors were not 
associated with the onset of sleep disturbance 
when controlling for ruminative style and 
somatic sensitivity. No mediation analyses 
have yet been conducted relating change in use 
of safety behaviors to treatment outcome. 
In sum, both dysfunctional beliefs and 
safety behaviors are proposed as key mechan- 
isms in the negative cognitive cycle of 
insomnia (Harvey, 2002a), but these assertions 
yielded inconclusive evidence (i.e., dysfunc- 
tional beliefs), or have not been tested 
empirically (i.e., safety behaviors) in therapy 
effect studies. 
In the current investigation, we therefore 
aimed to (1) replicate the ﬁnding that online 
CBT-I is effective in the treatment of insomnia 
and (2) test the hypotheses that dysfunctional 
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect 
of CBT-I. Accordingly, we conducted an RCT 
comparing online CBT-I to a waiting-list 
control group. Speciﬁc hypotheses include: 
(1) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list 
in ameliorating insomnia severity and 
sleep impairment assessed with a sleep diary, 
(2) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list 
in ameliorating dysfunctional beliefs and safety 
behaviors about sleep, and (3) dysfunctional 
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect 
of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep 
measures. 

Participants 
Participants were recruited from April 2013 
to January 2014 via a popular-scientiﬁc 
website and a Facebook ad campaign. 
Enrollment took place in October 2013 and 
January 2014. An initial group of 109 
interested individuals 
read information 
about 
the study, completed an informed 
consent form, and started the online ques- 
tionnaire. Thirty-three interested volunteers 
were excluded based on the preselected 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Figure 1 for 
a Flowchart). Inclusion criteria were: 
(1) 
insomnia according to DSM-5 criteria; (2) 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score 10 or 
higher (Morin, Belleville, Belanger, & Ivers, 
2011); (3) being awake for at least 30 min at 
night for at least three nights a week; and 
(4) being 18 years or older. Exclusion 




sleep apnea 
(1) possible 
criteria were: 
(measured with the SLEEP-50 where the 
apnea subscale has a cutoff of . 15; Spoor- 
maker, Verbeek, van den Bout, & Klip, 
2005), (2) shift-work, (3) earlier CBT for 
insomnia, (4) starting other psychotherapy 
in the last six months, (5) alcohol abuse 
(more than three glasses of alcohol a day for 
at 
least 21 days a month) or marijuana 
abuse (use more than once a week), (6) a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, and 
(7) current suicidal plans. Of the remaining 
76 people, 13 did not 
the 
questionnaires or failed to complete their 
diary on more than one day (out of seven). 
This 
sample of 63 
participants. Baseline characteristics and 
descriptive statistics of 
the sample are 
displayed in Tables 1 and 2. 


Power 
This study was originally powered to include 
100 participants (aof 0.05 and a power of 0.8 
to detect Cohen’s d effect sizes of 0.6 with a 
20% dropout). However, due to ﬁnancial and 
practical 
limitations we were forced to 
stop inclusion at 63 participants. Based on 
the posttest questionnaire data, in the current 
study we now achieved a power of 0.8 for an 
effect size of d ¼ 0.65. 
Materials 
Online questionnaires. For online question- 
naires, Thorndike et al. (2009) demonstrated 
the validity of both single-item and multiple- 
item presentation per webpage. We used 
multiple items per webpage (but never more 
than 15 items per webpage).

Insomnia severity was measured with a 
Dutch translation of the seven-item ISI. The 
ISI is a widely used measure to index changes 
in insomnia severity, and favorable psycho- 
metric properties are documented (internal 
consistency a¼ 0.78; Bastien, Vallie` res, & 
Morin, 2001; Morin, 1993). The total score 
ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe 
insomnia). The internal consistency (Cron- 
bach’s a) in the present study was 0.60 (which 
was comparable to the a¼ 0.61 that was 
found in a validation study of the online 
version of the ISI; Thorndike et al., 2011). 
A cutoff of 10 was previously offered as the 
optimal indicator for clinical levels of insom- 
nia in a community sample (Morin et al., 2011) 
and was used in this study. 
Dysfunctional beliefs were assessed with the 
Dutch translation of the 16-item brief Dys- 
functional Belief and Attitudes about 
Sleep scale—DBAS (Lancee & Kamphuis, in 
preparation; Morin, Vallieres, & Ivers, 2007). 
The English version of 
the DBAS shows 
adequate internal consistency (a¼ 0.79; in the 
current study: a¼ 0.81) and was signiﬁcantly 
correlated with self-report measures of insom- 
nia severity, anxiety, and depression. The sum 
of the DBAS score is averaged so that the total 
score ranges from 0 (no dysfunctional beliefs) 
to 10 (severe dysfunctional beliefs). 
Sleep safety behaviors were measured with 
the Dutch translation of the 32-item Sleep- 
Related Behaviors Questionnaire—SRBQ 
(Lancee & Kamphuis, in preparation; Ree & 
Harvey, 2004). The total score ranges from 0 
(no safety behaviors) to 128 (severe safety 
behaviors). The English version showed good 
internal consistency (a¼ 0.92; in the current 
study: a¼ 0.83) and could discriminate 
normal sleepers from people with insomnia. 
Furthermore, the SRBQ is correlated with 
complaints of 
daytime 
insomnia. 

Depression was measured using a Dutch 
translation of the 20-item Centre of Epidemio- 
logical Studies Depression scale (CES-D, 
range ¼ 0—no depressive symptoms to 60— 
severe depressive symptoms; Bouma et al., 1995; 
Radloff, 1977). This scale has good internal 
consistency (a¼ 0.79–0.92), and the validity of 
the Dutch scale is comparable to that of the 
original version (Bouma et al., 1995; Radloff, 
1977). Cronbach’s a was 0.89 in the current 
study. 
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the 
Dutch version of the seven anxiety items of the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS; Spinhoven et al., 1997; Zigmond & 
Snaith, 1983). The total score ranges from 0 
to 21 (severe 
(no symptoms of anxiety) 



symptoms of anxiety). The reliability of the 
HADS is good (a¼ 0.80 –0.84; in the current 
study: a¼ 0.85), as is the test –retest corre- 
lation (r ¼ 0.89; p , 0.001). 
The SLEEP-50 (Spoormaker et al., 2005) was 
used to exclude patients with possible 
sleep apnea. The apnea subscale has eight 
items (a¼ 0.51) and the total scale ranges from 
8 (no apnea indication) to 32 (severe apnea 
indication). A cutoff of $15 is optimal with a 
sensitivity of 0.85 and a speciﬁcity of 0.88. 
Online sleep diary. We used a Dutch 
the consensus sleep diary 
translation of 
(Carney et al., 2012). Participants kept a 
sleep diary for seven days and recorded time to 
bed, time they tried to go to sleep, time of ﬁnal 
time out of bed, sleep onset 
awakening, 
latency (SOL), wake after 
sleep onset 
(WASO), 
terminal wakefulness (TWAK), 
number of nightly awakenings, sleep quality 
(1 ¼ “very bad” to 5 ¼ “very good”), and use 
of sleep medication. From these variables, the 
time in bed (TIB ¼ ﬁnal arising time 2 time to 
bed), total sleep time (TST ¼ TIB 2 SOL 2 - 
WASO), and sleep efﬁciency (SE ¼ [TST/ 
TIB] £ 100) were calculated. 
Intervention 
The online CBT-I treatment protocol that was 
administered was based on treatment manuals 
for face-to-face CBT-I (e.g., Morin & Espie, 
2003; Verbeek & Klip, 2005). This treatment 
packaged the following modules: (1) psycho- 
education; (2) progressive muscle relaxation; (3) 
sleep hygiene; (4) sleep restriction—restricting 
TIB to actual sleeping time; and (5) cognitive 
exercises—challenging the misconceptions 
about sleep. The treatment comprised six 
weekly sessions that each covered one or more 
modules. The basic treatment sessions spanned 
six weeks, but participants who took longer to 
complete the treatment (e.g., because of holi- 
day) received feedback up to eight weeks. For a 
more elaborate description of the treatment 
content, please see Lancee, van den Bout, van 
Straten, and Spoormaker (2012). 
The online program, ﬁrst described in a 
study of Lancee et al. (2013), features an 
integrated diary that gives visual feedback on 
participants’ sleep efﬁciency and total time 
spent awake. The online program enables the 
provision of feedback on treatment progress 
and assigned exercises. In a previous study 
(Lancee et al., 2013), motivational feedback 



proved 
effects 
(reminding and motivating are the most 
important aspects of the feedback). In the 
current study, similar feedback was provided 
by master’s students of psychology under 
supervision of the ﬁrst author. On average, the 
students spent 56.5 minutes (SD ¼ 31.1) on 
giving feedback per participant for the full 
online treatment (i.e., all six lessons). 
Procedure 
The participants who met study criteria 
completed a questionnaire and received an 
online sleep diary, e-mailed to them at 6:00 am 
for seven consecutive days. After completing 
the diary, participants were randomized to 
either online CBT-I or the waiting-list con- 
dition. Twelve weeks later, both the CBT-I and 
waiting-list group received posttest question- 
naires and a sleep diary. After completing the 
posttreatment sleep diary, participants in the 
waiting-list condition received an online CBT-I 
treatment. Participants in the online CBT-I 
condition also received three- and six-month 
follow-up questionnaires and diaries. The 
study was conducted in line with the Declara- 
tion of Helsinki, approved by the internal 
Ethical Review Board of the University of 
Amsterdam, and registered at Clinicaltrials. 
gov (NCT01955928). 
Statistical analysis 
The effects of the intervention were tested using 
multilevel 
regression analysis. Multilevel 
regression analysis is an intention-to-treat 
procedure that also allows participants with 
only one measurement in the analyses (Hox, 
2002). One-way ANOVAs and chi-square tests 
showed that participants did not differ on any of 
the demographic or outcome variables at base- 
line (all ps . 0.2). However, participants in the 
online condition who did not respond to the 
posttest sleep diary had lower average scores on 
total sleep time at baseline (284 min versus 
353 min). Therefore, total sleep time was added 
as a covariate in the multilevel regression 
analyses regarding the pretest–posttest measure- 
ments. At the three- and six-month follow-up no 
variables were associated with nonresponse. One 
outlier was removed from the diary analyses, as 
this respondent’s sleep diary scores were below a 
z-score of 3.29 (sleep efﬁciency of this participant 
was 6.9% on average). 



Because total sleep time was associated with 
nonresponse in the CBT-I condition, we used a 
multiple imputation procedure based on the 
missing at random assumption (Sterne et al., 
2009). We used a monotone predictive mean 
matching procedure to generate 10 separate 
datasets and insert missing cases on the 
questionnaire and diary data. The posttest scores 
in Table 2 are the imputed values. To provide a 
comprehensive overview and to further show the 
possible inﬂuence of missing values on our 
analyses, we also included a completers analysis. 
Within-group Cohen’s ds were calculated on 
the imputed and completers data with (Mpre1 2 
Mpost1)/spooled. Between-group Cohen’s ds were 
calculated on the difference in change scores 
divided by the pooled baseline standard devi- 
ation of the groups (Morris, 2008). A Cohen’s d 
of 0.20 is generally considered small, that of 0.50 
moderate, and that of 0.80 large (Cohen, 1988). 
A signiﬁcance level of p , 0.05 (two-sided) was 
used throughout our study. 
For the mediation analyses we used the 
bootstrapping method in the SPSS PROCESS 
tool of Hayes (2013). Bootstrapping is a 
nonparametrical procedure that produces an 
estimate of 
the sample based on several 
resamples. Mediation was tested by evaluating 
the 95% conﬁdence interval of the indirect effect. 
The above procedure is preferred above the 
Sobel’s test since often the sampling of the 
indirect effect 
is non-normally distributed 
(Hayes, 2013). 
More speciﬁcally, we modeled our procedure 
after Vincent and Walsh (2013), that is, we used 
n ¼ 5000 bootstrap resamples and the pretreat- 
ment level of the dependent variable (i.e., ISI, 
SE, WASO, SQ) was added as a covariate in the 
model to predict posttreatment levels of the 
the limited 
dependent variable. In view of 
observed power, we performed both single 
(using either dysfunctional beliefs or safety 
behavior as mediator) and multiple mediation 
analyses (including both mediators). Our 
procedure differed from Vincent and Walsh 
(2013) in that we also added the pretreatment 
score of the mediator under investigation as 
covariate(s). We also calculated the effect sizes 
of the indirect effect with: 1 2 c0/c. With this 
formula the proportion of the effect of the 
independent variable on the dependent variable 
that 
is accounted for by the mediator is 
calculated. Possible values lie between 0 and 1 
(MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007). 
In Figure 2, the mediation model is shown. 
Results 
Completion of modules 
A module was deemed completed if the last 
exercise of this module was saved by the user. 
Twenty-seven (75.0%) of the participants in 
the CBT-I condition completed an adequate 
dose of the intervention (at least four modules; 
Lancee et al., 2013) and 17 (47.2%) completed 
all sessions of the intervention. 
Baseline differences and nonresponse

the three- and six-month diaries by 17 (47.2%)

As mentioned previously, people in the CBT- 
I condition who did not ﬁll out the posttest diary 
had a lower score on total sleep time at baseline 
(284 min versus 353 min). There were no other 
statistically signiﬁcant differences with respect 
to demographic or clinical variables between the 
responders and nonresponders. 
Efﬁcacy: intention-to-treat analyses 
Table 2 displays the imputed mean scores and 
corresponding Cohen’s d effect sizes. At posttest, 
we found signiﬁcant interaction effects (Time 
£ Group) between the CBT-I and waiting-list 
condition for the following variables: insomnia 


severity (ISI), b ¼ 3.80; SE ¼ 1.50; p ¼ 0.013, 
SE ¼ 2.92; 
sleep 
p ¼ 0.006, WASO, b ¼ 27.65; SE ¼ 11.21;

depressive symptoms, b ¼ 5.25; SE ¼ 2.03; 
p ¼ 0.010. These effects indicate that CBT-I is 
more effective than the waiting-list condition. 
The effects in the CBT-I condition were 
maintained or improved at three- and six- 
month follow-ups. The improvements between 
posttest and six-month follow-up were most 
notable for insomnia severity, anxiety, and 
depressive symptoms (Table 3).

Efﬁcacy: treatment and study 
completers only 
Completers analyses only included individuals 
who completed an adequate dose of the online 
treatment (at least four sessions) and ﬁlled out 
the posttest diary or questionnaire. Table 4 
displays the mean scores of the completers and 
corresponding Cohen’s d effect sizes (Sup- 
plemental Table S1 displays the completers’ 
follow-up data). Again, we observed signiﬁ- 
cant interaction effects (Time £ Group) for 
insomnia severity 
the following variables: 
p ¼ 0.005,

As before, these results indicate that CBT-I 
is more effective 
than the waiting-list 
condition. 



Now there was trend toward a signiﬁcant 
interaction effect on number of nightly 
awakenings, b ¼ 0.63; SE ¼ 0.38; p ¼ 0.097. 
The following variables showed no signiﬁcant 
interaction

b ¼ 9.39; SE ¼ 8.05; p ¼ 0.244, TWAK, 
b ¼ 6.34; SE ¼ 11.18; p ¼ 0.571. 



Clinical signiﬁcant change 
At baseline, all participants had clinical levels 
of insomnia based on the ISI (cutoff $ 10) 
(Morin et al., 2011). Of the participants that 
completed the posttest, 12 (37.5%) scored 
below the cutoff in the CBT-I condition and 3 
(13.6%) in the waiting-list condition. The 
proportions of the two conditions attaining 
scores below the cutoff were not signiﬁcantly 
different, x2 [1] ¼ 3.70; p ¼ 0.14. On the 
follow-ups, 13 (52.0%; three-month) and 12 
participants (57.1%; six-month) scored below 
cutoff in the CBT-I condition. 
A change of eight or more on the ISI is 
considered a clinical meaningful change in 
insomnia severity (Morin et al., 2011). Of the 
participants that completed the posttest, a 
trend emerged showing that CBT-I partici- 
pants were more likely to achieve a meaningful 
change in insomnia with 13 participants 
(40.6%) meeting criteria for meaningful 
change in the CBT-I condition, and 4

Deterioration and adverse events 
In line with the consensus statement on 
negative effects of Internet 
interventions 
(Rozental et al., 2014), we report the partici- 
pants that deteriorated at posttest. In the CBT- 
I group 3 (9.3%) participants deteriorated on 
the ISI and in the waiting-list group 7 (31.8%). 
None of the deteriorations were clinical mean- 
(change ISI $ 8). Furthermore, no 
ingful 
patients reported adverse events; however, we 
only asked the people that dropped out from 



the study if they had experienced such events 
during therapy. 

Mediation analysis 
We conducted mediation analyses for the 
dependent sleep variables that showed a 
signiﬁcant interaction effect (Time £ Group) 
severity, 
at 
sleep efﬁciency, WASO, sleep quality). Dys- 
functional beliefs and safety behaviors were 
the mediator variables in two separate 
analyses (please see Supplemental Table S2 
for the zero-order correlations). 


As can be seen in Table 5, dysfunctional 
beliefs (proportion of the effect explained 
by the mediation 94%) and safety beha- 
viors (92%) mediated the treatment effects 
of CBT-I on insomnia severity (ISI), as well 
as on sleep efﬁciency (proportion explained 
respectively 45% and 41%). No mediation 
effects were found on WASO or on 
sleep quality. Mediation effect size esti- 
mates are based on MacKinnon et al. 
(2007). 
For insomnia severity and sleep efﬁciency we 
also conducted joint meditational analyses, 
including both potential mediators in a single 
model 
(Table 5). Dysfunctional beliefs, 
b ¼ 23.67, 95% BI [29.12, 0.16] and safety 
behaviors, b ¼ 21.57, 95% BI [26.96, 2.31], 
were not signiﬁcant mediators on sleep efﬁciency 
in this model. However, together they mediated 
the effect, b ¼ 25.25, 95% BI [212.03, 20.72], 
proportion explained: 54%. For insomnia 
severity, the total mediation effect, b ¼ 4.43, 
95% BI [2.08, 7.03], proportion explained 80%, 
was carried by safety behaviors, b ¼ 3.06, 95% 
BI [1.18, 5.80], and not by dysfunctional beliefs, 
b ¼ 1.37, 95% BI [20.42, 3.86]. 

Discussion 
A ﬁrst aim of the present study was to test 
whether online CBT-I was effective in treating 
insomnia. We found that online CBT-I 
showed moderate to large statistically signiﬁ- 
cant 
severity, 
sleep efﬁciency, sleep quality, anxiety, and 
depression scores compared to a waiting list. 
Moreover, this CBT-I treatment format also 
ameliorated 
and 
dysfunctional 
sleep safety behaviors. After treatment, 
40.6% of 
the participants in the CBT-I 
condition achieved a clinical meaningful 



change on the ISI against 18.2% in the 
waiting-list condition. The effects of online 
CBT-I were maintained at the three- and six- 
month follow-up. 
A second aim was to test the extent to which 
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors 
might mediate the effects of CBT-I on 
insomnia severity and sleep diary measures. 
The singular mediator analyses indicated that 
both dysfunctional beliefs and safety beha- 
viors mediated the effect of CBT-I on 
insomnia severity (ISI) and sleep efﬁciency, 
but not WASO and sleep quality. 
The observed treatment outcomes are in line 
with previous studies on online treatment of 
insomnia (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; Ho et al., 
2014; van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009). However, 
the effects appeared somewhat smaller than 
effects in a couple of recent studies (Espie, 
Kyle, Williams, et al., 2012; Lancee et al., 
2012; Ritterband et al., 2009; van Straten 
et al., 2014), as well as in a recent study using 
the same treatment program (e.g., posttest 
within-group Cohen’s d on insomnia severity 
of 1.6 versus 1.2; Lancee et al., 2013). 
A possible explanation could be that in the 
current study feedback was provided by 
master’s students of psychology instead of by 
an insomnia expert such as in a previous 
investigation (Lancee et al., 2013). However, 
in another similar study (van Straten et al., 
2014) large results were acquired with student- 
based feedback. Furthermore, no signiﬁcant 
interaction effects were observed for total 
sleep time, number of nightly awakenings, 
TWAK, and SOL, possibly due to power 
issues. In addition, the proportion achieving a 
clinical meaningful change (18%) 
in the 
waiting list was rather high, conceivable as a 
consequence of the high percentage (30%) 
seeking other treatment during the trial. 
Our mediation analyses provided additional 
support for the hypothesis that change in 
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors 
explains CBT-I’s treatment effects. As such, 
they fall 
in line with ﬁndings observed by 
several authors regarding dysfunctional beliefs 
(Edinger et al., 2001; Espie et al., 2001; Harvey 
et al., 2007; Jansson-Frojmark & Linton, 
2008; Morin et al., 2002) and safety behaviors 
(Espie et al., 2014; Harvey et al., 2007; 
Jernelov et al., 2012). They are in contrast to 
the null ﬁndings on insomnia severity reported 
on 
al. 
by Okajima 









sleep efﬁciency reported by Espie et al. (2014). 
When testing the joint model, 
i.e., when 
including both dysfunctional beliefs and safety 
behaviors into the mediation analyses, only 
safety behaviors 
remained a signiﬁcant 
mediator for insomnia severity. 
These ﬁndings underscore the importance 
of paying attention to safety behaviors in 
insomnia treatment. To challenge these safety 
behaviors, Harvey and Eidelman (2011) 
advocated the use of behavioral experiments. 
They described several useful experiments, 
such as the use of clock-watching at night. 
In this exercise, patients are asked to act as 
usual for the ﬁrst three nights (i.e., watching 
their clock when they are awake). In the 
subsequent three nights, they are asked to 
refrain from their clock-watching. Before 
conducting the experiment patients write 
down their predictions and afterwards the 
outcomes are discussed. These experiments 
help the patients to understand that the safety 
behavior and underlying beliefs are not helpful 
and, in most cases, fuel insomnia. Since our 
data point toward the importance of these 
safety behaviors we think further investigation 
of such behavioral experiments is warranted. 
Some limitations need to be acknowledged 
when appraising the present ﬁndings. We used 
a pre – post change score for the mediator 
variables (dysfunctional beliefs/safety beha- 
vior). Arguably, our argument would be less 
theoretical if the mediators were measured at a 
separate time-point that succeeded the inde- 
pendent variable (group) and preceded the 
dependent variable (i.e., ISI). Furthermore, 
with the present level of power (i.e., a 0.8 
probability to detect an effect size of 0.65), no 
signiﬁcant treatment effects were detected for 
time. 
SOL, TWAK, 
We therefore did not conduct mediation 
analyses for these variables. Future studies 
on CBT-I may include more participants to 
allow for mediational analyses on these diary 
sleep variables. Likewise, the predominance of 
the meditational potency of safety behaviors 
over dysfunctional belief needs to be cross- 
validated in future studies. 
Other methodological 
limitations of this 



study were that we did not include objective 
measurements (e.g., polysomnography), that 
insomnia was not diagnosed by a clinician, 
and that we had a self-selected sample of 
people interested in an online treatment study. 
On the other hand, we note that subjective 
measurements (i.e., diaries) are the standard 
outcome measures in most treatments trials 
(Buysse, Ancoli-Israel, Edinger, Lichstein, & 
Morin, 2006), and we believe that 
the 
inclusion of objective measurements and/or 
clinician-based diagnoses would have wea- 
kened the ecological validity of the online 
design. Furthermore, we made an effort to use 
the best possible online selection criteria by 
using DSM-5 insomnia criteria in addition to 
a score of 10 on the ISI (Morin et al., 2011). 
Likewise, one could argue that the present 
sample was a self-selected set of individuals 
who were online and interested in treatment. 
Again, this may be the case, but this likely 
reﬂects the potential users of these treatment 
formats. 
Also, this trial suffered from some dropout. 
We had 11 –19% missing data in the posttest 
questionnaire and 31– 33% in the diary. These 
missing data may have inﬂuenced the results 
because participants in the CBT-I condition 
with low total sleep time scores dropped out 
more often from the posttest measurements. 
Our multilevel and multiple imputation inten- 
tion-to-treat analyses mitigate these concerns 
somewhat (Hox, 2002; Sterne et al., 2009). 
However, 
is 
particularly important that individuals with 
the most severe insomnia do complete the 
treatment. This may be particularly important 
for total sleep time since insomniacs that 
sleep the fewest hours have a higher risk for 
hypertension (Vgontzas, Liao, Bixler, Chrou- 
sos, & Vela-Bueno, 2009). Limiting these 
dropouts in the future is therefore of major 
importance. 


Finally, as these mediation analyses were 
performed in an online treatment study, we 
cannot be sure that our ﬁndings generalize to 
face-to-face therapy. These concerns are 
mitigated by the fact 
that both types of 
treatment use the same protocol, it is likely 
that the treatments achieve their effects in a 
similar manner. 
Taken together, this study contributes to 
the now substantial evidence for the efﬁcacy 
of online CBT for insomnia. Future studies 
may compare online CBT-I to active treat- 
ments, including face-to-face treatments, and 
focus more on the mechanisms of change. 
Indeed, we hold that the main contribution of 
this paper lies in the identiﬁcation of two 



potential mediating factors of 
treatment 
effectiveness: dysfunctional beliefs and safety 
behaviors. As a primary candidate variable 
deserving more attention, we would like to 
nominate the (fading out of the) use of safety 
behaviors.
