Background. Insomnia is a prevalent problem with a high burden of disease (e.g. reduced quality of life, reduced work 
capacity) and a high co-morbidity with other mental and somatic disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
is effective in the treatment of insomnia but is seldom offered. CBT delivered through the Internet might be a more acces- 
sible alternative. In this study we examined the effectiveness of a guided Internet-delivered CBT for adults with insomnia 
using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Method. A total of 118 patients, recruited from the general population, were randomized to the 6-week guided Internet 
intervention (n = 59) or to a wait-list control group (n = 59). Patients ﬁlled out an online questionnaire and a 7-day sleep 
diary before (T0) and after (T1) the 6-week period. The intervention group received a follow-up questionnaire 3 months 
after baseline (T2). 
Results. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) of the patients completed the whole intervention. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis 
showed that the treatment had statistically signiﬁcant medium to large effects (p < 0.05; Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 1.06), 
and resulted more often in clinically relevant changes, on all sleep and secondary outcomes with the exception of sleep 
onset latency (SOL) and number of awakenings (NA). There was a non-signiﬁcant difference in the reduction in sleep 
medication between the intervention (a decrease of 6.8%) and control (an increase of 1.8%) groups (p = 0.20). Data on 
longer-term effects were inconclusive. 
Conclusions. This study adds to the growing body of literature that indicates that guided CBT for insomnia can be 
delivered through the Internet. Patients accept the format and their sleep improves. 



Insomnia is characterized by difﬁculty initiating or 
maintaining sleep or non-restorative sleep. The dis- 
order often persists for many years (Morin et al. 
2009a) and is an important public health issue. The 
prevalence is high, with about a third of the population 
suffering from insomnia symptoms and about 10% 
fulﬁlling the criteria for a sleep disorder (Ohayon, 
2002; Morin et al. 2006b). Insomnia also has a high bur- 
den of disease. People with insomnia often report

a decline in cognitive abilities and mood swings due 
to fatigue, which impacts their daily life in various 
domains (Roth & Ancoli-Israel, 1999; Kyle et al. 2010). 
Not only is insomnia a signiﬁcant public health pro- 
blem in itself, but also many people with insomnia 
have co-morbid (mental) health problems or will 
develop co-morbid disorders in the future. Most 
often reported is the association with depression 
(Taylor et al. 2005; Staner, 2010). In addition, research 
over the past decade provides increasing evidence 
that insomnia contributes to the risk of developing 
heart disease (Redline & Foody, 2011) and is associated 
with increased mortality (Gallicchio & Kaleson, 2009). 
The societal costs due to insomnia are substantial. 
These costs are caused by increased health-care use, 
which is about three times higher among poor sleepers 

than among good sleepers. Most of the societal costs of 
insomnia (75%) stem from work absenteeism and poor 
work productivity (Daley et al. 2009b). In total, poor 
sleepers cost society about 10 times more than good 
sleepers (Daley et al. 2009a). 
Treatment frequently consists of sleep medication 
such as benzodiazepines. Several meta-analyses have 
shown that benzodiazepines are effective in enhancing 
sleep in the short term (Buscemi et al. 2007), but also 
that there are important side-effects such as drowsiness, 
dizziness and light headedness. These side-effects 
increase the risk of (trafﬁc) accidents and, especially 
in the elderly, the risk of falls. The other treatment 
option for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT). It has been demonstrated convincingly that 
CBT is at least as effective as benzodiazepines in the 
short term, whereas in the longer term CBT is more 
effective than sleep medication (Smith et al. 2002; 
Morin et al. 2009b). However, although CBT is the pre- 
ferred treatment according to several guidelines 
(Siebern & Manber, 2011), 
is often unavailable. 
There is a shortage of CBT therapists, and professionals 
are often unaware of the treatment facilities that do 
exist. Moreover, CBT is relatively costly in the short 
term compared with medication, even though the 
costs in the longer term (e.g. days away from work) 
may be reduced by CBT. 

A recent development in the management of insomnia 
is to deliver the treatment over the Internet. During the 
past decade eHealth has been introduced in mental 
health care in general. Many Internet-delivered pro- 
grammes have been developed for different disorders 
such as depression, alcohol and anxiety disorders 
(Andrews et al. 2010; Grifﬁths et al. 2010; Riper et al. 
2011) and meta-analyses have demonstrated that these 
programmes are effective (Cuijpers et al. 2010). How- 
ever, they seem to be much more effective when 
delivered with some form of guidance and coaching 
(Spek et al. 2007). Recently, the beneﬁts of coaching in 
self-help treatments have also been demonstrated for 
insomnia (Jernelöv et al. 2012). 
In a previously performed meta-analysis on self-help 
CBT for insomnia (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009), we 
showed medium effects (e.g. sleep efﬁciency, Cohen’s 
d = 0.42). However, of the 10 included studies, only 
one provided the self-help through the Internet 
(Ström et al. 2004). Other studies on Internet-delivered 
CBT (Suzuki et al. 2008; Ritterband et al. 2009; Vincent 
& Lewycky, 2009; Espie et al. 2012; Lancee et al. 2012) 
have concluded that this treatment has positive effects, 
although the interventions in these studies were pro- 
vided without personal guidance or coaching and 
some studies had small sample sizes. 
In the current study we examined the effectiveness 
of an Internet-delivered CBT guided by a personal 
coach for adults with insomnia using a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT). 


In our RCT people were randomized to either the inter- 
vention (Internet-based CBT) or to a wait-list control 
group. The wait-list control group received the inter- 
vention immediately after the post-test assessment. 

for recruitment purposes, we 
In a previous trial, 
created a popular scientiﬁc website on insomnia 
(www.insomnie.nl; Lancee et al. 2012). Because of the 
overwhelming response to this website, we had to 
create a waiting list. For the current trial we approached 
those on this waiting list (about 1 year later) by email, in 
batches of 100 to 200 people to prevent overloading 
the coaches. The email contained a link to a website 
with information on this particular trial. On this web- 
site, people could register for participation. We sent 
emails to the ﬁrst 1500 people on this list as this was 
the maximum number of patients we could coach. 

Inclusion criteria were: age 518 years and suffering 
from insomnia. Insomnia was deﬁned according to 
DSM-IV criteria as difﬁculty initiating sleep or difﬁculty 
maintaining sleep and based on self-report. To be 
included people had to be awake for at least 30 min 
a night, for at least three nights a week, for at least 3 
months (APA, 2000). Exclusion criteria were: severe 
symptoms of anxiety or depression. Anxiety was 
assessed with the anxiety subscale of the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Spinhoven et al. 
1997; Bjelland et al. 2002; Andersson et al. 2003), which 
contains seven items. Depression was assessed with 
the Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression 
scale (CES-D; Beekman et al. 1997). People with a 
HADS score of 510 or a CES-D score of 530 were 
excluded. Use of sleep medication was allowed. 

A total of 275 people (18.3%) registered on the trial 
website (Fig. 1). They were sent an information folder, 
a consent form, a link to the baseline questionnaire and 
a 7-day sleep diary. Of these 275 who had registered, 
137 (49.8%) returned the informed consent form, the 
sleep diary and the questionnaire. Of these 137 people, 
19 (13.9%) exceeded the cut-off score for depression 
or anxiety and were excluded. The remaining 118 



people (7.9% of 
the 1500 initially invited) were 
included in the trial. Half of them (n = 59) were ran- 
domized to the guided Internet-based intervention 
and the other half (n = 59) were randomized to the wait- 
list control group. Six weeks later they all received 
another email with a link to the post-test questionnaire 
and a 7-day sleep diary. Two weeks later the people in 
the wait-list control group could start the intervention. 
Eight weeks later we asked the intervention group to 
again complete a questionnaire and a sleep diary. At 
this time, the controls were only asked to complete a 
questionnaire about their experiences with the treat- 
ment. 

took place between May 2010 and 
September 2010. The study was approved by the 
Medical Ethical Committee of the Vrije Universiteit 
Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
The trial was registered on nederlandstrialregister.nl 
(number NTR2132). 

For pragmatic reasons we were not able to recruit for 
more than 5 months. Initially, we expected to be able 
to include only about 50 patients in this period. In 
other words, we expected to carry out a pilot study 
and hence no formal power analysis was performed. 
However, because recruitment was easier than ex- 
pected, we continued inclusion until we met our full 
capacity to coach the patients in the intervention.

A randomization schedule was generated by the 
study coordinator (A.v.S.) by computer. We used 
blocks of 10 to enhance equal distribution between 
the groups. The actual randomization was performed 
by an independent researcher. All patients were in- 
formed by email about the randomization outcome. 

The patients were asked to complete a sleep diary for 
7 days pre- and post-test, and at follow-up for the inter- 
vention group. From these diaries we calculated the 
sleep efﬁciency (SE), 
total sleep time (TST), sleep 
onset 
latency (SOL) and number of awakenings 
(NA). SE is calculated by dividing TST by the total 
time the person spent in bed (×100%). This SE might 
be considered as the true primary outcome because 
this measure can be used for patients presenting with 
types of sleep problems (Morin, 2003). 
different 
Patients were also asked to rate daily how sound their 
sleep had been the previous night and how refreshed 
they felt in the morning. Both questions could be 
answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not 
sound/refreshed at all) to 10 (very sound/refreshed). 

All patients were asked to complete an online ques- 
tionnaire pre- and post-test, and at follow-up for the 
intervention group. With this questionnaire we me- 
asured (along with demographics): the duration of 
sleep problems, overall sleep quality, use of sleep 
medication, anxiety, depression and quality of life. 
Overall sleep quality was measured with the Dutch 
version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). 
The questionnaire is well validated in different 
languages (Buysse et al. 1989; Backhaus et al. 2002) 
but Dutch validation studies are lacking. The PSQI 
is a self-rating questionnaire with 19 questions, and 
consists of seven subscales (sleep quality, sleep latency, 
sleep duration, habitual sleep efﬁciency, sleep disturb- 
ance, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunc- 
tion). Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. The 
subscale scores can be summed to a total score ranging 
from 0 (good quality of sleep) to 21 (very poor quality 
of sleep). As mentioned earlier, 
the symptoms of 
anxiety were measured with the HADS and the symp- 
toms of depression with the CES-D. The total score 
of the seven HADS items range from 0 (no symptoms 
of anxiety) 
to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety). 
The total score of the 20 CES-D items range from 0 
(no symptoms of depression) to 60 (severe symptoms 
of depression). Quality of life was assessed with one 
question (on a the visual analogue scale, VAS), which 
is part of 
in which the patients 
rate their quality of life on a scale from 0 (poor) to 

100 (excellent) (Brooks, 1996). Online administration 
of questionnaires has been found to generate valid 
and reliable data with maintained psychometric 
properties. 
After the treatment period all patients were asked to 
rate the intervention on several aspects. They could 
give an overall rating score for the treatment itself, 
and the feedback as provided by the coaches, each 
on a scale between 1 (very poor) and 10 (excellent). 
For each of the six lessons we asked whether the in- 
formation in that particular lesson had been useful 
(yes/no). We also proposed two statements (‘I gained 
new insights because of this treatment’ and ‘I’m better 
able to cope with my sleep problems because of the 
treatment’) and asked if the patient agreed with those 
statements (answers on a ﬁve-point scale ranging 
from ‘fully disagree’ to ‘fully agree’). These questions 
were developed by the research group. 

The Internet intervention was written (information, 
examples and assignments) by the ﬁrst author 
(A.v.S.). It is based on a collection of other self-help 
materials for insomnia, textbooks and research litera- 
ture. The ﬁrst version of the intervention was discussed 
with the co-authors and several other sleep experts. 
The treatment consisted of six weekly lessons and 
included the different elements that are commonly in- 
corporated in face-to-face CBT for insomnia (Edinger & 
Wolgemuth, 1999; Morin & Espie, 2003; Edinger & 
Means, 2005; Verbeek & Klip, 2005; Espie, 2006; 
Table 1). Every lesson contained information, examples 
of other people carrying out the treatment, and home- 
work. After ﬁnishing the homework, 
the coach 
received a notiﬁcation. Within 3 working days the 
coach provided online feedback on the homework. 
Patients could also send separate emails, for example 
when they had a question about the information pro- 
vided. At the start of the study, feedback took about 
20–30 min per person per lesson. During the study, 
as the coaches became more experienced, feedback 
took on average 15 min per person per lesson. The 
four master’s 
coaching was performed by A.v.S., 
students in psychology, and one experienced CBT 
therapist (J.E.) who also trained and supervised the 
others. The aim of the feedback was to comment on 
the exercise, clarify information and motivate the 
patient to persist in carrying out the course and the 
requested behavioural changes. 

All post-test 
analyses were performed on the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. Missing values were 
imputed using the multiple imputation procedure

implemented in SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., USA). We 
created 20 imputation sets. We then used statistical 
analyses to create pooled estimates of the 20 datasets. 
Standard deviations for the post-test mean scores 
were calculated separately because SPSS does not pro- 
vide them. These were calculated by taking the natural 
logarithm of the standard deviation of each dataset, 
and taking the exponent of the summed result divided 
by the 20 datasets. 
Comparisons between baseline values for the inter- 
vention and control groups were made with χ2 tests 
(for dichotomous variables) or independent t tests 
(for continuous variables). To test the effectiveness of 
the intervention we ﬁrst tested the differences in the 
post-test 
scores between the groups with linear 
regression while controlling for baseline scores and 
gender. The differences between the two groups were 
then expressed in effect sizes. We calculated Cohen’s 
d by dividing the difference in post-test scores of 
the two groups by the pooled standard deviation. 
Cohen’s d can thus be interpreted as the number of 
standard deviations the intervention group scores 
better than the control group (Cohen, 1988). A Cohen’s 
d of 0.00–0.32 can be considered as small, 0.33–0.55 
as medium, and > 0.56 as large (Lipsey, 1990; Lipsey 
& Wilson, 1993). 
Next, we wanted to test the clinical relevance of the 
intervention by comparing the intervention and con- 
trol groups with regard to the percentage of patients 
who had (1) improved between baseline and post-test 
and (2) recovered post-test. However, no consensus 
consists on the deﬁnitions of ‘improved’ or ‘recovered’ 
for many of the variables studied. Instead of not study- 
ing clinical relevance at all, we arbitrarily deﬁned 
‘improvement’ and determined post-test thresholds 
as a proxy for recovery. For the PSQI we deﬁned an 
improvement as a decrease in score of 53 points. 
A score > 5 is usually considered an indicator of rel- 
evant sleep disturbances (Buysse et al. 1989; Backhaus 
et al. 2002). However, only very few people scored 
below this cut-off. We therefore set the threshold at 
a score of 8. For SOL we deﬁned improvement as a 
decrease of 530 min. The post-test threshold for SOL 
was set at 30 min because there is some consensus 
that this can be considered ‘normal’ (Lichstein et al. 
2003). Improvement for TST was deﬁned as sleeping 
at least 1 h longer and the threshold was set at 6 h. 
For SE improvement was deﬁned as at least a 10% 
increase and the threshold was set at 80%. For NA 
we deﬁned improvement as waking up at least one 
time less and the threshold was deﬁned as two awaken- 
ings. Feeling refreshed and soundness of sleep were 
both scored on a scale of 1 to 10. Improvement was 
deﬁned as scoring at least 1 point higher and we set 
the threshold at 6. 
for anxiety was 
deﬁned as 53 points and for depression and quality 
of life as 55 points. For the anxiety score on the 
HADS we used a threshold of 47 (Olsson et al. 2005), 
for the depression score on the CES-D 416 (Beekman 
et al. 1997) and for quality of life (EuroQoL) 560. 

Finally, we tested the robustness of the longer-term 
effects of the intervention. We did not impute the miss- 
ing values of the follow-up scores but only used the 
data as provided by patients. We calculated the effects 
between post-test and follow-up within the interven- 
tion group with Cohen’s d. 


Most of the patients were female (70.3%), living with 
a partner (63.6%), born in The Netherlands (84.7%), 
had a high educational level (58.5%) and a paid job 
(70.3%; Table 2). There were signiﬁcantly less females 
in the intervention group (59.3%) than in the wait-list 
control group (81.4%, p < 0.01). There were also less 
people living with a partner in the intervention group 
(55.9%) than in the control group (71.2%), but this differ- 
ence only reached borderline signiﬁcance (p = 0.09).

On average, it took patients almost an hour to fall 
asleep (mean SOL = 57.1 min), 
for 5½ h 
(TST), woke almost twice during the night (NA = 1.9) 
and slept 67.5% of the time that they were in bed 
(SE). They rated the soundness of sleep and the feeling 
of being refreshed as insufﬁcient (5.7 and 5.5 respect- 
ively). On average, their sleep problems had existed 
for 11.8 years (S.D. = 10.2). 
In general, it took people in the intervention group 
longer to fall asleep (SOL 68.7 min) than those in the 
control group (45.4 min; p < 0.01), mainly because the 
number of people lying awake for a very long time 
(5 2 h) was higher in the intervention group (n = 10) 
than in the control group (n = 2). Furthermore, people 
in the intervention group woke less often during 
the night (NA = 1.7) than people in the control group 
(p = 0.02). There were no signiﬁcant differences with 
respect to the use of sleep medication, depression, 
anxiety or quality of life. 

Three of the 59 patients (5.1%) in the intervention 
group did not start the treatment, six (10.2%) com- 
pleted one or two lessons, seven (11.9%) completed 
between three and ﬁve lessons, and the majority 
(72.9%; n = 43) completed all six lessons. Most of the 
patients that dropped out of treatment did not provide 
any reasons. Some indicated that they were too busy. 
The treatment was rated as a 7.3 (S.D. = 1.2) on a scale 
from 1 to 10, and the feedback as a 7.6 (S.D. = 1.2). The 
third lesson, which was about stimulus control and 
sleep restriction, was viewed as useful most often 
(by 79.6% of the patients). All the other lessons were 
viewed as useful by about 60% of the patients. About 
two-thirds (61.2%) of the patients agreed with the 
statement ‘I gained new insights because of this treat- 
ment’, and about two-thirds (65.3%) agreed with the 
statement ‘I’m better able to cope with my sleep pro- 
blems because of the treatment’. 
Post-test effects of the intervention: continuous 
outcomes 
The overall post-test response was 86.4% (n = 102) for 
the questionnaire, and 71.2% (n = 84) for the sleep 
diary. The non-response for the sleep diary was signiﬁ- 
cantly higher in the intervention group (n = 22; 37%) 
than in the control group (n = 12; 20%; p = 0.04). 
Furthermore, 
those who returned the sleep diary 
were more often born in The Netherlands (89% 
v. 74%, p = 0.03) and they had a shorter SOL at baseline 
(48.9 min v. 78.0 min, p < 0.01). There were no other 
signiﬁcant differences between the responders and

Clinical relevant changes: percentage of patients who 
improved or scoring below a threshold 
The post-test scores of the patients in the interven- 
tion group were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) better than 
those of the control group on all sleep estimates and 
other health outcomes, after correcting for baseline 
values and gender, with the exception of SOL (p = 0.14) 
and NA (p = 0.15; Table 3). The effect sizes for overall 
sleep quality (the PSQI score), TST, SE, soundness of 
sleep and quality of life were large (Cohen’s d = 1.06, 
0.57, 0.95, 0.88 and 0.58 respectively). The effect sizes 
for NA, 
feeling refreshed, anxiety and depression 
were medium (Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 0.54). The 
effect size for SOL was almost absent (d = 0.04). The 
95% conﬁdence intervals around the effect sizes 
are all fairly wide. 
Post-test data on the use of sleep medication were 
available for 102 (86.4%) of the 118 included patients. 
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in 
response between those patients who used sleep medi- 
cation at baseline (response rate 91.7%) and those that 
did not (response rate 84.1%; p = 0.27). In the interven- 
tion group the use of sleep medication decreased 
from 28.8% at baseline to 22.4% at post-test (−6.4%). 
In the control group it increased from 32.2% at baseline 
to 34.0% at post-test (+1.8%). The post-test difference 
between the intervention and control group did not 
reach statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0.20). 
We arbitrarily deﬁned improvement, and set thresh- 
olds for each of the outcome variables as proxy meas- 
urements for recovery. The effects were largest on 
overall sleep quality and SE: about 60% of the pa- 
tients in the intervention group improved compared 
to around 15% in the control group (Table 4). 
Furthermore, about 50% of the patients in the interven- 
tion group scored below the post-test cut-off whereas 
this was the case for only 9.5% (sleep quality) and 
18% (SE) of the control group. The percentage of 
patients scoring below the cut-off for TST, feeling 
refreshed and sleeping soundly were also signiﬁcantly 
higher in the intervention than in the control group, 
and they also improved more often. For SOL, NA 
and anxiety, the differences between the groups were 
not statistically signiﬁcant. Patients in the intervention 
group did improve more often on depression and qual- 
ity of life than patients in the control group but there 
was no difference in the percentage of patients scoring 
below the threshold as this percentage was already 
high in the control group. 

The response at follow-up was 49% (n = 29) for the 
sleep diary and 73% (n = 43) for the questionnaire.

b Based on logistic regression analyses with gender and baseline values as covariates. 
There were no statistically signiﬁcant baseline differ- 
ences between the group who did complete a sleep 
diary at follow-up and those who did not, although 
people who did not return the diary had borderline 
signiﬁcantly higher anxiety and depression scores 
(p = 0.09 and p = 0.10 respectively). 
We compared the observed follow-up scores for 
patients in the intervention group with post-test scores 
to obtain some indication of the robustness of effects 
in the long term (Table 5). None of the improvements 
or deteriorations were statistically signiﬁcant and all 
were very small. Most notable were the continued 
small improvements in overall sleep quality and qual- 
ity of life (Cohen’s d = 0.25 and 0.21 respectively). 

In this RCT we studied the effectiveness of a guided 
Internet-based CBT for adults with insomnia. First, 
we showed that adherence was good (72.9% completed 
the intervention) and that the patients were satisﬁed 
with the information they received, the assignments,

of the intervention on SOL and NA, possibly because 
of baseline differences and because SOL had some out-

(p < 0.05) on all the remaining sleep estimates (sleep 
quality, TST, SE, 
sleeping soundly and feeling 
refreshed in the morning) and on the secondary out- 
comes (symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality 
life). The effect sizes were medium to large 
of 
(Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 1.06). Patients in the inter- 
vention group more often improved and reached 
recovery than those in the control group. The use of 
medication decreased in the intervention group by 
6.8% and increased in the control group by 1.8%. 
However, 
these analyses were performed on the 
sample of completers and were not statistically signiﬁ- 
cant. Finally, the completers-only sample did not show 
any signiﬁcant improvement or deterioration in the 
longer term (3 months). 
There were some baseline differences between the 
intervention and baseline groups (gender, SOL, NA). 
We therefore used gender as a covariate in all the stat- 
istical 
tests on post-test differences, and we also 
included baseline values as covariates. The post-test 
response was high, with 88.1% of the patients provid- 
ing some or all of the data. Although there were some 
baseline differences between post-test responders and 
non-responders, 
the risk of bias is probably low 
because the non-response percentage was small and 
these data were estimated using multiple imputation. 
However, the follow-up data should be interpreted 
with caution. As the non-response percentage for the 
sleep diary was 51%, we decided not to impute the 
data but to show the results for the responders only. 
Hence these data may be biased, and suggest that 
more research on the longer-term effects of Internet 
treatments for insomnia is necessary. 
We recruited our patients through a waitlist, which 
comprised people who had indicated 1 year earlier 
that they were interested in participating in an insom- 
nia study. Those people that responded to our invita- 
tion were still, or again, suffering from insomnia. 
Thus, it is thus likely that our sample was skewed 
towards higher insomnia severity. Baseline sleep esti- 
mates indeed indicate severe problems: SOL of almost 
1 h, TST of 5.5 h and SE of 68%, which on average had 
lasted for 12 years. Even though this might indicate 
that our group is not representative for all insomnia 
patients, it might consist of the patients most in need 
for treatment. 
The effects of our intervention are promising. Two 
insomnia 
previous meta-analyses on self-help for 
showed, for example, an effect size of 0.40 (Cheng & 
Dizon, 2012) and 0.42 (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009) 
for SE whereas in the current study the SE effect size 
was much higher (d = 0.95). One reason for our positive 
results might be that the patients in the intervention 
received regular weekly feedback from their personal 
coach. This might also have been responsible for our 

high adherence rates and overall satisfaction with 
the intervention. In general, higher effects are de- 
monstrated for guided web-based interventions than 
for unguided ones (Spek et al. 2007; Richards & 
Richardson, 2012). However, it has been argued that 
unguided interventions might in future become as 
beneﬁcial as guided interventions once the websites 
are more interactive and technically better, for example 
including automated personalized feedback based on 
text or answers on quizzes and questionnaires. Some 
studies on unguided Internet-delivered insomnia treat- 
ments also show promising results (e.g. Ritterband 
et al. 2009; Espie et al. 2012) but, to date, only one 
study has compared guided with unguided self-help 
for insomnia (Jernelöv et al. 2012). That study supports 
the notion that guidance increase effectiveness. We rec- 
ommend replication of that study using Internet-guided 
treatment and also examining the cost-effectiveness of 
the two approaches. 
The effects of face-to-face treatments for insomnia are 
well studied and their results are summarized in 
reviews (e.g. Morin et al. 2006a). Although no formal 
meta-analysis has been performed and no overall esti- 
mate for face-to-face treatments is available, the effects 
seem to be of the same order of magnitude as those of 
our study. Unfortunately, there are very few studies 
that directly compare face-to-face treatments with self- 
help or Internet treatments. In our previous meta- 
analysis on self-help, we demonstrated that those few 
studies that exist do not demonstrate a clear difference 
in effect (van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009). The compar- 
ability of effects between face-to-face treatments and 
self-help (Internet) treatments has been demonstrated 
for anxiety and depression (Cuijpers et al. 2010). We 
need further studies examining accessibility, effects 
and costs, to demonstrate which intervention should 
be used when and for whom. 
In our opinion people with co-morbidity should be 
included in insomnia treatment 
trials because co- 
morbidity tends to be the rule rather than the excep- 
tion. In particular, co-morbidity with mental disorders 
is very common. People with insomnia are about 
10 times more likely to have depression and 17 times 
more likely to have an anxiety disorder than people 
without insomnia (Taylor et al. 2005). In our study 
we excluded people with severe anxiety or depressive 
disorders because the most effective treatment strategy 
for people with co-morbid insomnia and more severe 
mental health problems is not known. This is an 
important 
topic that requires further investigation. 
We did include people who reported moderate symp- 
toms of anxiety and depression. These symptoms 
improved during the intervention period with medium 
effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.53 and 0.44). This might indi- 
cate that insomnia is one of the causes of mental health 
problems or that there are other underlying mechan- 
isms that lead to disruption of both mood and sleep 
(Turek, 2005; Fairholme et al. 2012). This signiﬁcant 
ﬁnding stresses the importance of insomnia treatment, 
as it might be useful to reduce moderate symptoms of 
depression or anxiety. 
There are several limitations to this study. First, the 
diagnosis of insomnia was based purely on self-report 
and was not conﬁrmed by a clinician. This means that 
it is possible that some people in our sample did not 
suffer from full-blown insomnia or suffered other 
sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea). 
In future we 
would prefer this intervention to be delivered through 
general practitioners (GPs). This means that the GPs 
might screen out mild cases and those with other 
serious sleep or medical disorders. However, we 
would like to stress that our method of recruitment 
did not result in a sample of only mild cases. The 
fact that 72.9% of the patients completed the interven- 
tion (and put in considerable effort in completing the 
exercises) seems to indicate that those people were 
indeed in need of help. A second limitation is that 
the sleep estimates were based on sleep diaries and 
not on more objective measures such as polysomnogra- 
phy or actigraphy. The use of both subjective and 
objective measures has been recommended because 
people with insomnia often over- or underestimate 
their actual sleep time (Buysse et al. 2006; Van den 
Berg et al. 2008). However, using polysomnography 
is costly and imposes a burden on the patients. 
Therefore, sleep diaries are currently the most widely 
used outcome measure in insomnia treatment studies 
(Morin, 2003). Sleep diaries are also generally well 
accepted because it is the subjective complaint that 
prompts patients to seek treatment. The third limit- 
ation is that we did not measure daytime consequences 
of insomnia. As it is already an effort for patients to 
keep a sleep diary, we wanted to keep the number of 
remaining questions as low as possible. However, 
now that this intervention has proved to be effective 
with regard to sleep estimates, a next step would be 
to investigate the consequences of these improvements 
for daytime functioning. This is ultimately the most 
important outcome for patients but is also essential 
in demonstrating possible cost-effectiveness. Almost 
two-thirds of our sample had a paid job, and loss of 
work productivity is one of the most common conse- 
quences of insomnia but also the most costly (Dailey 
et al. 2009a). The self-help study of Jernelöv et al. 
(2012) is one of the few to demonstrate positive effects 
on daytime functioning after self-help treatment. 
In summary, this study adds to the growing body of 
literature that indicates that guided CBT for insomnia 
can be delivered through the Internet. We suggest 
that it is time for large-scale implementation projects. 

We are grateful for the ﬁnancial support we received 
from Fund NutsOhra (0804–46) to develop the inter- 
vention and to carry out this study.
