**Abstract**

_Study Objectives: We sought to examine the impact of digital cognitive behavioural therapy_


(dCBT) for insomnia on both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive

performance.


_Methods:_ The DISCO trial was an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of

dCBT versus wait-list control. Participants were aged 25 years and older, met DSM-5


diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and reported difficulties with concentration or

memory. Assessments were carried out online at baseline, and 10 and 24 weeks post

randomisation. The primary outcome measure was self-reported cognitive impairment,

assessed with the British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI). Secondary


outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia symptoms, cognitive failures,

fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.


_Results: 410 participants with insomnia were recruited and assigned to dCBT (N = 205) or_

wait-list control (N = 205). At 10 weeks post-randomisation the estimated adjusted mean


difference for the BC-CCI was -3.03 [95% CI: -3.60,-2.47; p<.0001, d = -0.86], indicating that

participants in the dCBT group reported less cognitive impairment than the control group.


These effects were maintained at 24 weeks (d = -0.96) and were mediated, in part, via

reductions in insomnia severity and increased sleep efficiency. Treatment effects in favour of


dCBT, at both 10 and 24 weeks, were found for insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, cognitive

failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. We found no between-group


differences on objective tests of cognitive performance.

_Conclusions: Our study shows that dCBT robustly decreases self-reported cognitive_

impairment at post-treatment and these effects are maintained at 6 months.


_Keywords: insomnia; cognitive function; cognitive behavioural therapy_

_Clinical trial registration: The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry_


(ISRCTN89237370).

Statement of significance

We conducted the first study to investigate the effects of CBT, delivered via digital


technology, on subjective and objective cognitive function in people with both insomnia and

cognitive complaints. We found that CBT improves self-reported cognitive impairment


relative to a waitlist control group at both post-treatment and 6 months follow-up, and that

such differences are mediated in part via reduction in insomnia symptoms. We found no


benefit of CBT on objective cognitive performance measured by computerised tasks.

**Introduction**

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and second-most prevalent psychiatric


disorder in Europe[1,2]. People with insomnia report significant impairments to quality of life[3]

and cite cognitive impairment as one of the chief consequences of sleep disruption[4]. Self

reported cognitive impairment manifests as difficulties with concentration, memory, attention

and decision-making. While the literature on objective cognitive performance (assessed via


neuropsychological tasks) is characterised by conflicting findings[5-7], meta-analyses reveal

small-to-moderate deficits in working memory, inhibitory control, episodic memory and


problem-solving[8,9]. More recent studies suggest that complex attention may be particularly

affected[10]. Both objective and self-reported cognitive impairment may explain, at least in


part, reduced work productivity and increased accident risk in those with insomnia[11,12].

Sleep is known to play a central role in brain plasticity, memory consolidation and optimal


cognitive engagement[13]. Insomnia, therefore, is proposed to lead to impairment in cognition

through its adverse effects on brain structure and function[14]. Indeed, insomnia is an


independent risk-factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease[15,16], and may

contribute to cognitive impairment observed in other highly co-morbid neuropsychiatric


disorders[17].

Rescue of self-reported cognitive impairment through treatment is clearly important to


patients[4] but to date few studies have assessed cognitive function in trials of cognitive

behavioural therapy (CBT), the recommended first-line treatment. A recent review of this


small literature[18] found that studies 1) assessed self-reported cognitive impairment using

low-resolution questionnaire items; 2) rarely included objective performance measures of


cognitive function; 3) evaluated cognitive function as secondary or exploratory outcomes;

### 5


-----

and 4) often recruited small samples, with potentially confounding co-morbidities. The effect

of CBT on cognitive function remains largely uncharacterized in adequately-designed


studies. The present study, therefore, was specifically designed to examine the potential

impact of an established digital CBT programme for insomnia (dCBT), relative to waitlist

control (WLC), upon both self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive

performance. We also aimed to determine whether change in insomnia symptoms mediates


change in cognitive outcomes.

The primary hypothesis for the trial was:


### 1. dCBT will reduce self-reported cognitive impairment at the end of treatment


### (10 weeks) relative to WLC

The secondary hypotheses were:


### 2. dCBT will reduce self-reported cognitive impairment at follow-up (24 weeks)

 relative to WLC


### 3. dCBT will improve objective cognitive performance (in the following domains:

 simple attention, visual attention, episodic memory, working memory, and


### complex processing speed), relative to WLC (10 and 24 weeks)


### 4. dCBT will reduce insomnia severity and improve sleep efficiency relative to

 WLC (10 and 24 weeks)


### 5. Change in insomnia severity and sleep efficiency at week 10 will mediate

 change in self-reported cognitive impairment and objective cognitive


### performance at week 24


### 6


-----

### 6. dCBT will lead to improvements in fatigue, sleepiness, self-reported cognitive


### failures, depression and anxiety, relative to WLC (weeks 10 and 24)

**Methods**


_Study Design_

The DISCO [Defining the Impact of Sleep improvement on Cognitive Outcomes] study was


an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of dCBT versus WLC. Participants

meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder were recruited from the community and


screened, consented, assessed and randomised on a 1:1 basis to intervention or control

using the online platform, Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com). Participants in the intervention arm


received access to the dCBT programme, Sleepio (www.sleepio.com)[19], while the WLC

group received access to the same programme on completion of study follow-up (24 weeks).


The study was conducted in the UK and approved by the University of Oxford Medical

Sciences Inter-divisional Research Ethics Committee (R46116/RE001). The trial was


prospectively registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN89237370) and the trial protocol

published[20].


_Participants_

We aimed to recruit 404 participants and achieved a final sample size of 410 (205 in each


arm). Participants were recruited from the community through multiple channels; for

example, the study web-link was sent to contact lists of people who had previously


expressed an interest in taking part in sleep research, and advertised on websites and social

media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Inclusion criteria were: 1) aged 25 years and


over; 2) meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder according to the Sleep Condition

Indicator[21]; 3) report difficulties with concentration or memory[22]; 4) have reliable internet


### 7


-----

access; 5) read and understand English; and 6) currently reside in the United Kingdom.

Exclusion criteria were: a) screen positive for or report diagnosis of additional sleep


disorder[23]; b) report a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, dementia or neurological

condition; c) take prescribed sleep medication on >2 nights in the past two weeks; d)


currently receiving psychological treatment for insomnia; e) report a diagnosis of

schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; f) report suicidal ideation with intent[24]; g) planned major


surgery; h) life expectancy < 6 months; and i) habitual night, evening, or rotating shift-work.

Participants with other mental and physical health problems, or receiving other types of


treatments, were eligible to take part.

_Randomisation and Masking_


Simple randomisation with an allocation ratio of 1:1 was carried out using the randomisation

function within Qualtrics Survey Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA) on completion of


baseline measures. The research team therefore had no access to future allocations and

were unable to influence randomisation. Other than the trial coordinator, who emailed


participants their allocation, the research team remained blind to allocation. Contact between

trial coordinator and participants was limited to standardised information, detailing


instructions for dCBT access and completion of assessments, and did not cover therapy

content or support.


_Procedures_

dCBT was delivered via the Sleepio programme, the efficacy of which has been established


in several RCTs[19,25,26]. Detailed information is available elsewhere[19] but in brief, intervention

ingredients, covering key cognitive and behavioural strategies, are introduced by an


animated virtual therapist in a personalized but automated manner over six 15-20 minute

### 8


-----

sessions. Participants also have access to a library of sleep-related articles and online

community forum, and can participate in weekly live discussions with a sleep expert.


Participants randomised to the wait-list control arm were informed that they would be

provided with access to dCBT at the end of the study (24 week follow-up). For both arms


there was no restriction on what treatments or support participants could access during the

trial, for sleep or any other health problem.


_Outcomes_

Demographic data were collected at baseline. Major assessments of primary and secondary


outcomes were conducted at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks post-randomisation) and

follow-up (24 weeks post-randomisation). Participants received vouchers for completion of


assessments (£5 for baseline; £10 for post-treatment; £15 for follow-up).

The primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, was assessed with the British


Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI[27]), a six-item questionnaire assessing

perceived cognitive problems in the past 7 days. Items are scored on a 0-3 scale (range = 0

18) and probe difficulties with concentration, memory, expressing thoughts, word-finding,

slow thinking speed and problem-solving. Higher scores indicate greater perceived cognitive


impairment.

Secondary outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia severity, sleep


efficiency, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression and anxiety.


### 9


-----

Cognitive performance was assessed via web-based test battery. The battery was

developed by the UK Biobank Cognitive Psychology Sub-Group for Cognitive Assessments


and comprised 6 tasks. Participants were advised to complete the tasks in a distraction-free

environment and, where possible, at the same clock-time (across assessments), using the


same device (across assessments). _Snap task (simple attention):_ In this task, two cards

(matching or non-matching) appear side-by-side on the screen. Participants are instructed to


respond as quickly as possible when they see two matching cards, and withhold responses

to non-matching cards (dependent variable: mean RT [msec] for correct responses on


matching trials). Trail making task (visual search, motor speed, mental flexibility): In the first

part of this task (TRAILS-A) participants are required to join numbered circles in sequential


order (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and number of errors). In part b

(TRAILS-B) participants are asked to join together numbered circles and lettered circles in


sequential order, shifting between sets (dependent variables: RT [msec] to complete and

number of errors). _Reverse digit span task (working memory): In this task participants are_


presented with a series of numbers on the screen, increasing in string length across trials.

Number strings disappear and participants are asked to insert the number string in reverse


order using a mouse-click keypad (dependent variable: longest correct string of numbers).

_Pairs matching task (episodic memory): In this task 6 pairs of cards (level 1, 3x4 matrix) or 8_


pairs of cards (level 2, 4x4 matrix) are flashed on the screen and then disappear.

Participants are asked to remember their location and subsequently identify matching pairs


of cards (dependent variable: number of errors when matching pairs for levels 1 and 2).

Progression to level 2 is contingent on achieving ≤ 1 error on level 1. _Symbol-digit_


_substitution task (complex processing speed): In this task participants are asked to match a_

series of symbols to digits (dependent variable: number of correct matches in a 1-minute


interval).


### 10


-----

Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)[28] and through

calculation of sleep efficiency (%; derived from three items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality


Index, PSQI[29]). Fatigue was measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI[30]),

which comprises five sub-scales covering general, physical and mental fatigue, and reduced


motivation and reduced activity; sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness

Scale (ESS[31]); everyday failures in perception, memory and motor function were measured


with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ[32]); depression was measured with Patient

Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9[33]); and anxiety was measured using two items from the


General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2[34]).

We report four outcomes beyond those that were pre-registered. We measured groups on


the use of prescribed sleep medication and non-prescription sleep remedies at baseline, 10

and 24 weeks. Participants were asked to indicate _how many nights in the last two weeks_


_have you taken…(1) sleeping pills prescribed by your doctor; and (2) non-prescription sleep_

_remedies. The cognitive test battery also included a test of reasoning (fluid intelligence task)_


at baseline, 10 and 24 weeks, where participants were presented with a series of problem
solving questions (dependent variable: total number of correct answers in 2-minute period).


We measured proportion meeting ‘caseness’ for depression (defined as PHQ ≥10) at

baseline, 10 and 24 weeks.


Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded if the research team were made aware of

them, and were defined as death, suicide attempt, admission to hospital, or formal


complaints about the dCBT intervention. We collected information on the following pre
defined adverse effects at 10 weeks using a standardised scale[35]: low mood, fatigue and/or


exhaustion, extreme sleepiness, feeling agitated, bodily pain, headache and/or migraine,

### 11


-----

euphoria and/or intense increase in mood, reduced motivation and/or energy, changes in

hunger and/or appetite, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling irritable.


_Statistical analysis_

The study was powered at 90% to detect a minimum standardised effect size of 0.42 at post

treatment (week 10) at a 5% level of significance, accounting for 40% attrition from baseline.

Analyses followed intention to treat (ITT) principles and are reported according to the


CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological interventions[36]. All analysis was conducted

by the trial statisticians as partially blind (groups labelled A/B until analysis complete) using


Stata version 14 (StataCorp). Summary statistics (means and standard deviations for

continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical variables) are


presented by randomised group without testing for baseline differences.

A linear mixed effects model was estimated using maximum likelihood for the primary


outcome of self-reported cognitive impairment, measured by the BC-CCI. The outcomes at

10 and 24 weeks were included as the response. The baseline score was included as a


covariate in the model along with time point (10 or 24 weeks), randomised group (dCBTi or

WLC), and a patient specific random intercept to account for repeated measures. An


interaction between time point and randomised group was included to estimate the treatment

effect - the mean difference in scores between the dCBT group and the WLC group 

separately at each time point. Of _primary interest is the treatment effect at 10 weeks. 95%_

confidence intervals and two-sided p-values (significance level of ≤ .05) are reported with


estimated effects. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals where there was

evidence of heteroscedasticity. Cohen’s d statistics were calculated as the adjusted


### 12


-----

treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation of the BC-CCI for the combined

treatment groups. Unadjusted means by the two randomised groups are also reported.


Secondary outcomes were analysed in the same way. For binary secondary outcomes, for

which a linear model was not deemed appropriate, a logistic mixed model was estimated.


Missing outcomes were assumed to be missing at random, conditional on the covariates in

the model. Moderation of the cognitive functioning outcomes (BC-CCI, cognitive test battery)


was assessed by including age at baseline in a three-way interaction in the linear mixed

models. This enabled estimation of the difference in treatment effect associated with an


increase in 1 year of age at both 10 and 24 weeks.

For cognitive variables showing a treatment effect at 24 weeks, causal mediation methods


were used to investigate if changes in these outcomes at 24 weeks were mediated by

changes in insomnia severity and sleep efficiency, respectively, at 10 weeks. Parametric


regression models adjusting for the mediator measure at 10 weeks were used to test for the

direct effect of the intervention on the outcome at 24 weeks. The indirect effect was


estimated by multiplying the effect of the intervention on the mediator at 10 weeks and the

effect of the mediator at 10 weeks on the outcome at 24 weeks, and bootstrapping was used


to produce standard errors for the direct and indirect effects. Adjustment was made for

baseline measures of the mediator and the outcome.


Differences in the frequency of self-reported adverse effects at 10 weeks were calculated

and compared using chi-squared tests. The total number of adverse effects was also


compared in a Mann-Whitney test.


### 13


-----

No adjustment was made for multiple testing for the analyses performed on the primary and

secondary outcomes as these hypotheses are pre-specified, correlated and related to each


other[37].

Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of the primary outcome analysis to different


assumptions regarding departures from randomisation policies and missing data. A pattern

mixture model was applied to the data which estimates the treatment effect under scenarios


where the missing outcomes at 10 weeks are imputed as being higher or lower than the

observed mean outcome. Additionally, it was assessed whether including baseline variables


associated with missingness of the primary outcome at 10 weeks in the main analysis model

changed the estimated treatment effect of the intervention on the primary outcome.


_Role of the Funding Source_

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data


interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the

data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.


**Results**

Recruitment commenced 18[th] October, 2016 and stopped on the 21[st] March, 2017 after the


planned sample size was achieved. 2947 individuals were screened online; 509 were

deemed eligible, while 410 participants completed baseline and were subsequently


randomised (205 in each arm). Principal reasons for exclusion were not meeting insomnia

criteria, shift work, possible sleep apnoea and possible restless legs syndrome (see Figure


1). Retention was 82% at 10 weeks and 74% at 24 weeks, and differed by group, with the

### 14


-----

dCBT group less likely to provide outcome data than control (at 10 weeks: 76% for dCBT vs.

88% for control/ at 24 weeks: 66% for dCBT vs. 81% in control). An administrative error


meant that 43 participants (n=28 dCBT, n=15 WLC), who did not complete outcome

assessments at 10 weeks, were not sent a follow-up invitation at 24 weeks. In the dCBT


arm, 60% of participants completed all 6 online treatment sessions, 73% completed ≥ 3

sessions, while 17% did not access the intervention at all.



[INSERT FIGURE 1: TRIAL FLOW]

The sample was predominately in middle-age (52.4 yrs, SD = 11.5; range 26-82), of white


ethnic background (98%), comprised of females (87%), and the majority were university
educated (54%; see Table 1). Consistent with inclusion criteria, insomnia severity scores


(ISI) were in the clinical range (mean = 18.2, SD = 3.7; see Table 2), and the majority of

participants (62%) met ‘caseness’ for depression on the PHQ-9 (score of ≥10). At baseline,


only 17% of the sample progressed to level 2 on the pairs-matching task so we did not

analyse this variable as an outcome at 10 and 24 weeks.



[INSERT TABLES 1 & 2 – DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS AND BASELINE SCORES


OF OUTCOMES]

At 10 weeks post-randomisation the estimated adjusted mean difference on the primary


outcome measure of self-reported cognitive impairment (BC-CCI) was -3.03 [95% CI: -3.60,
2.47; p<.0001, d = -0.86], indicating that participants in the dCBT group (unadjusted mean =


5.88, SD = 3.61) reported less cognitive impairment than the control group (8.91, SD = 3.87;

### 15


-----

see Table 3). These large treatment effects were maintained at 24 weeks [estimated

adjusted mean difference = -3.41, 95% CI: -4.06,-2.76; p<.0001, d = -0.96], with the dCBT


group (unadjusted mean = 5.51, SD = 3.69) reporting less cognitive impairment than the

control group (8.98, SD = 4.23). Effects were robust across sensitivity analyses investigating


assumptions regarding missingness mechanisms for the outcome (see Supplementary

Information).


[INSERT TABLES 3 & 4 – SECONDARY OUTCOMES]

Large treatment effects were observed for insomnia severity (ISI) at 10 weeks (d = -1.57)


and 24 weeks (d = -1.60), and for sleep efficiency at 10 weeks (d = 0.91) and 24 weeks (d =

0.72), with the dCBT group reporting less insomnia symptoms and higher sleep efficiency


scores (Table 3).

For objective cognitive performance, there were no significant group differences at 10 or 24


weeks, on any of the performance tests (d range = -0.09 to 0.11; see Table 4).

Treatment effects were observed for all five subscales (and total score) of the


multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), at both 10 weeks (d range = -0.34 to - 0.70) and 24

weeks (d range = -0.42 to -0.76; see Table 3), with the dCBT group reporting lower levels of


fatigue. Similarly, the dCBT group reported significantly lower levels of sleepiness (ESS) at

10 weeks (d = -0.42) and 24 weeks (d = -0.44). Consistent with the primary outcome, large


treatment effects were found for self-reported cognitive failures (CFQ), with significantly

### 16


-----

lower values in the dCBT group compared to control at 10 weeks (d = -0.83) and 24 weeks

(d = -0.98).


At both 10 and 24 weeks dCBT was associated with less depressive symptoms compared to

the control group (d = -0.68 and d = -0.64, respectively). Exploratory analyses, focusing on


depression ‘caseness’ (defined as PHQ9 score ≥10), found a reduced likelihood of meeting

‘caseness’ in the dCBT group at both 10 weeks (adjusted risk ratio = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21,


0.54) and 24 weeks (adjusted risk ratio=0.49, 95% CI: 0.28,0.70). For anxiety symptoms,

dCBT was associated with significantly lower scores on the GAD-2 at 10 weeks (d = -0.39)


and 24 weeks (d = -0.37).

Groups did not differ with respect to proportion using prescribed sleep medication (defined


as ≥1 night in the past 14 days) at 10 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.13,1.98]

or 24 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.07,1.79]. Compared to the control group,


significantly fewer participants in the dCBT arm reported using non-prescription sleep

remedies (defined as ≥1 night in the past 14 days) at both 10 [adjusted odds ratio = 0.20,


95% CI: 0.06,0.66] and 24 weeks [adjusted odds ratio = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03,0.39].

We tested the extent to which treatment effects for cognitive variables at 24 weeks were


mediated by change in insomnia symptoms and sleep efficiency at 10 weeks. Since there

were no group differences on the objective cognitive tests we only assessed mediation for


self-reported cognitive impairment (BC-CCI). The mediators (ISI scores and sleep efficiency)

showed large treatment effects at 10 weeks (see Table 3). The proportion of the effect of the


intervention on BC-CCI at 24 weeks that was mediated by change in _sleep efficiency was_

### 17


-----

29.5% (see Table 5). The proportion of the effect of the intervention on BC-CCI at 24 weeks

that was mediated by change in insomnia severity (ISI) was 60.4%.



[INSERT TABLE 5 – MEDIATION]

There was no evidence of moderation by age for the BC-CCI at 10 or 24 weeks, or for any


cognitive task at 10 weeks (see Table S3). There was some evidence of moderation for two

of the cognitive tasks at 24 weeks, although direction was not consistent. One task (simple


attention) showed magnification of group differences with increasing age, while the other

(episodic memory) showed attenuation. None of these effects were statistically significant


after conservative adjustment for multiple testing.

There were no reported SAEs. For the 12 pre-specified adverse effects, there were no


statistically significant group differences and the total number of endorsed adverse effects

was similar in both arms (Table S4).


**Discussion**

Uptake of the dCBT intervention was high and, similar to previous trials[26,38], led to large


reductions in insomnia severity, indexed via sleep efficiency and global ratings of insomnia

symptoms. These sleep-related changes were accompanied by less frequent use of non

prescription sleep remedies in the dCBT arm versus control. We observed large treatment

effects in favour of dCBT for our primary outcome, self-reported cognitive impairment, at


both post-treatment (d = -0.86) and follow-up (d = -0.96). Group differences in self-reported

cognitive impairment at follow-up were mediated, in part, by change in sleep efficiency and


### 18


-----

global insomnia severity ratings at 10 weeks, suggesting a potential causal pathway to

improved cognitive function via reduction in insomnia symptoms. Our secondary


questionnaire measures (cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety) similarly

showed treatment effects in favour of dCBT at both post-treatment and follow-up. In contrast,


we did not observe treatment effects on any of our objective cognitive tests (see Figure 2).

[INSERT FIGURE 2 – FOREST PLOT]


This is the first trial to assess self-reported cognitive impairment as a primary outcome post
dCBT for insomnia. We recruited insomnia participants with cognitive complaints at baseline,


reflecting perceived difficulty with memory and/or concentration. Baseline scores on the BC
CCI in our sample exceeded those observed in patients with major depression[27], while


scores on the CFQ (everyday cognitive failures) were higher than those found in patients

with multiple sclerosis[39]. Large improvements on both the BC-CCI and CFQ, and medium-to

large improvements on the _mental fatigue sub-scale of the MFI, suggest dCBT effectively_

reduces perceived cognitive impairment; and these benefits are sustained at 6 months


follow-up. This is an important finding because perceived cognitive impairment is one of the

most salient concerns for patients with chronic insomnia, impacting upon a range of quality


of life domains, including work performance and safety[12,40]. Further research is needed to

determine whether the management of insomnia in the context of _specific neurological and_


psychiatric conditions has the potential to improve self-reported cognitive and functional

outcomes.


Although robust effects were observed in the subjective domain we found no evidence that

dCBT engenders change in cognitive performance indexed via computerised tasks.


### 19


-----

Divergent findings for subjective and objective cognitive function are common across a

range of neuropsychiatric disorders, with reported impairment often not supported by task


performance[41,42]. Subjective reports and task performance may probe different aspects of

cognitive health[43]. It is important to note that subjective cognitive complaints, even in the


absence of objective task-related impairment, have been associated with increased amyloid
β deposition, evolution of objective impairment over time, and subsequent dementia


diagnosis[44,45]. While it is possible that our participants did not have objective cognitive

impairment at baseline - and, therefore, limited capacity for change - we attempted to


mitigate this by recruiting participants with persistent insomnia disorder _plus cognitive_

complaints, a group more likely to display performance deficits[46]. Nevertheless, without a


control group of normal sleepers (or normative data for comparison) we cannot confirm the

presence of baseline impairment in objective cognitive performance. Below we offer several


(non-exclusive) explanations for the null findings.

Our tasks map onto widely used neuropsychological measures that have shown sensitivity to


insomnia (versus controls) in previous studies[9,47,48], but they were relatively simple, brief,

and may not unmask subtle cognitive deficits[49]. For example, several studies reveal


impairment (only) when cognitive load is high, particularly for the domain of attention[10,50]. A

related point is that tests were performed outside of the laboratory, over the internet, and at


a time convenient for participants. While we advised participants to maintain standard testing

conditions (i.e. same device, clock-time, and distraction-free environment) across


assessment points, variability introduced by the testing environment may have further

reduced signal-to-noise ratio.


At least seven RCTs[38,51-55 ] have assessed the effect of CBT on objective cognitive

performance in adult insomnia samples, four of which (including the present study) find no


### 20


-----

evidence of benefit[38,54,55]. It is important to note that our study is the largest to date to test

cognitive performance through objective computerised tasks, with the power to detect even


modest effects. Impairments, if they reliably exist, may be trait-like and unresponsive to CBT.

Alternatively, CBT may not sufficiently modify sleep physiology in order to bring about


improvements in cognitive performance, consistent with findings from a recent meta
analysis[56]. These possibilities require dedicated interrogation in future studies.


Limitations of this work should be considered. We employed a waitlist control arm, which

may slightly inflate effect size differences compared to a minimally active arm (e.g., sleep


hygiene education), or behavioral placebo. Nevertheless, several studies show that the

dCBT programme used in the present study convincingly out-performs sleep hygiene[26] and


placebo[19] with respect to both sleep and daytime outcomes. Our sample was recruited

online and may not be representative of treatment-seeking patients in clinical practice. For


example, our sample was well-educated, with the majority holding a university degree, and

the vast majority (87%) were female. We required participants to report cognitive complaints


to enter the trial, which may have resulted in an over-representation of participants

concerned about the effects of sleep disruption on cognitive function. However, research


shows that perceived cognitive impairment is one of the most common consequences of

insomnia.[4] We also excluded frequent users of hypnotics at baseline in order to limit


confounding effects on our cognitive dependent measures; the extent to which our findings

apply to those who regularly take sleep medication requires testing in future studies. Our


sample included people from a broad age range (26-82 years), potentially introducing

marked between-subject variability in the nature of sleep disruption, cognitive function and


health (and their interaction). However, our aim was to conduct a randomised trial in a large

sample of people with insomnia and perceived cognitive impairment; and we found no clear


pattern of moderation by age. A key strength of our study is inclusion of people with common

mental and physical health problems. For example, the majority of our sample met clinical

cut-offs for depression at baseline. Participants treated with dCBT were 62% less likely to

meet ‘caseness’ at post-treatment, and 51% less likely at follow-up, relative to control. These


results are consistent with emerging evidence showing that CBT for insomnia may exert anti
depressant effects[57]. Improvement in mood may represent an additional mechanistic


pathway to restoration of cognitive function. Future study designs, capable of disentangling

temporal changes in sleep, mood, and cognitive function, should be considered. A final point


is that given the online nature of our trial we were not able to record sleep physiology and

therefore the sleep profile of our sample is unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that


insomnia disorder in combination with objective short sleep duration may have the most

pronounced effects on cognitive performance[8,58]. Future stratification based on objective


sleep parameters will help determine whether insomnia phenotypes have differential

response on cognitive outcomes.


In conclusion our study finds that dCBT robustly improves self-reported cognitive impairment

and that such improvements may operate via increased sleep efficiency and reduced


insomnia severity. We found no evidence that dCBT improves objective cognitive

performance relative to control, across a range of tasks and domains. The field requires


rigorously-designed studies, incorporating sensitive measures of performance and sleep

physiology in order to further delineate the effects of insomnia treatment on cognitive health.
