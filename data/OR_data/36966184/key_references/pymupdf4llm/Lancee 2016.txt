**Study Objectives: To compare the efficacy of guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list**
condition.
**Methods: A randomized controlled trial comparing three conditions: guided online; face-to-face; wait-list. Posttest measurements were administered to**
all conditions, along with 3- and 6-mo follow-up assessments to the online and face-to-face conditions. Ninety media-recruited participants meeting the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for insomnia were randomly allocated to either guided online CBT-I
(n = 30), individual face-to-face CBT-I (n = 30), or wait-list (n = 30).
**Results: At post-assessment, the online (Cohen d = 1.2) and face-to-face (Cohen d = 2.3) intervention groups showed significantly larger treatment effects**
than the wait-list group on insomnia severity (insomnia severity index). Large treatment effects were also found for the sleep diary estimates (except for total
sleep time), and anxiety and depression measures (for depression only in the face-to-face condition). Face-to-face treatment yielded a statistically larger
treatment effect (Cohen d = 0.9) on insomnia severity than the online condition at all time points. In addition, a moderate differential effect size favoring
face-to-face treatment emerged at the 3- and 6-mo follow-up on all sleep diary estimates. Face-to-face treatment further outperformed online treatment on
depression and anxiety outcomes.
**Conclusions: These data show superior performance of face-to-face treatment relative to online treatment. Yet, our results also suggest that online**
treatment may offer a potentially cost-effective alternative to and complement face-to-face treatment.

**Significance**
This is the first published study to compare guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list
condition. Whereas both treatments were significantly more effective than the wait-list condition, face-to-face treatment outperformed online treatment.
These findings may guide clinicians in choosing the right treatment format for patients with insomnia if both treatments are available to the patient. Yet, if
access to face-to-face treatment is limited, online treatment may be considered as it can significantly reduce insomnia complaints. However, our results
need to be seen as preliminary until replicated in future clinical trials.


**INTRODUCTION**
Insomnia is a common disorder with a prevalence of about
10% in the general population.[1] Individuals suffering from insomnia have difficulty initiating and/or staying asleep, have
these complaints for at least 3 mo, and suffer from negative
daytime consequences.[2–5] Furthermore, insomnia is associated
with an increased risk of anxiety and depression,[6–8] suicidality,[9] and cardiovascular diseases.[10]

Sleep medication is the most widely used treatment option
for insomnia. Although sleep medication is effective in the short
term, it is also associated with side effects,[11] and the long-term
efficacy of sleep medication has not been established.[12] An alternative treatment option is cognitive behavioral treatment for
insomnia (CBT-I); this psychological treatment has equal shortterm effects[12,13] and superior long-term effects[12] as medication.
Recently it was demonstrated that the acute phase of sleep restriction in CBT-I is also associated with side effects such as daytime sleepiness and objective performance impairment. However,
these side effects are not maintained at 3-mo follow-up.[14]

Another issue with CBT-I is that it requires considerable
time investment of trained psychologists that may not always
be readily available.[15] A possible solution to cut costs (i.e., time
investment) and increase accessibility is to provide the CBT-I


via the internet.[15] In recent years several trials were published
on online CBT-I. Overall the results were encouraging with recent meta-analyses identifying moderate to large effects sizes
for these online treatments.[16,17] Furthermore, it was established
that such online interventions should best be delivered in a
guided format (i.e., with some form of Email support)[18] and that
this guidance is possible with a low level of clinical training.[19]
For insomnia, several online treatment studies observed treatment effects comparable to face-to-face treatment.[20–23]

In other clinical domains there has been a surge in research
on the comparison between face-to-face and online psychological interventions. Recent meta-analyses on somatic and psychiatric disorders have concluded that face-to-face and online
treatments were equally effective.[24,25] If these findings would
also hold for insomnia, online treatments could be a major advancement in terms of accessibility and cost-effectiveness of
interventions.
To our knowledge, only one published study directly compared online CBT-I and face-to-face group treatments for insomnia, utilizing a noninferiority trial design.[26] In line with
the studies on somatic and psychiatric disorders, online CBT-I
was found to be non-inferior to group-administered CBT-I. No
published studies have reported on the comparison between

online CBT-I and individual face-to-face treatment. In this article, we report the results of a randomized wait-list controlled
trial comparing online CBT-I to individual face-to-face CBT-I.
We hypothesized that: (1) online and face-to-face treatment
ameliorate insomnia complaints compared to a wait-list condition, and (2) online and face-to-face delivery methods do not
differ considerably in treatment effect.

**METHOD**

**Participants**
Participants were recruited from April 2013 to January 2014 via
a popular scientific website and a Facebook campaign. Enrollment took place in October 2013 and January 2014. Inclusion
criteria were: (1) insomnia disorder according to Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)[2]; (2) insomnia severity index (ISI) score of 10 or higher,[27] (3) being
awake subjectively for at least 30 min a night at least 3 nights
a week, and (4) being 18 y or older. Exclusion criteria were:
(1) possible sleep apnea (determined with a subscale of the
SLEEP-50, cutoff > 15[28]), (2) shift work, (3) pregnancy, (4) earlier CBT-I, (5) start of psychotherapy in the past 6 mo, (6) current major depressive disorder based on the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV disorders (SCID-I; administered during
the telephone screening), (7) alcohol abuse (more than three
glasses of alcohol a day for at least 21 d/mo), (8) marijuana
abuse (use more than once a week), (9) self-reported diagnosis


of schizophrenia or psychosis, (10) or current suicidal plans.
An initial group of 183 interested individuals completed an informed consent form and started the online questionnaire.
Of these, 47 potential participants were excluded based
on the online assessment. Next, a psychologist conducted a
telephone screening interview that included an assessment
on DSM-5 insomnia and the SCID-I for current depression.
Figure 1 presents a flowchart of the recruitment, and details the
reasons for exclusion. The final 90 participants were randomly
assigned to online treatment (n = 30), face-to-face treatment
(n = 30), or a wait-list condition (n = 30). Baseline characteristics and descriptive statistics of the sample are displayed in
Tables 1 and 2.

**Power**
This study was powered for the detection of a within-between
interaction effect size of f [2] = 0.20. Based on an alpha of 0.05
and a power of 0.8, detecting this effect size requires a cell size
of n = 22. In consideration of an expected attrition rate, we
included 30 participants per group.

**Materials**

**_Online questionnaires_**
Demographic characteristics were assessed at baseline
(Table 1). We also assessed treatment preference at baseline
and treatment satisfaction at post-assessment.

f2f, face-to-face: n = 30; online: n = 30; wait-list: n = 30. *Due to a programming error, we were unable to assess the age of seven participants. Therefore
the information about age was based on: n = 83. SD, standard deviation.


Insomnia complaints were measured with a Dutch translation of the seven-item ISI. The ISI is a widely used measure
to index changes in insomnia severity, and favorable psychometric properties have been documented.[29,30] The total score
ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe insomnia). A cutoff
of 10 was determined as optimal to indicate clinical levels of
insomnia[27] and was therefore used in this study. Surprisingly,
in the current study the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha)
of the ISI was 0.22. After deleting the first item (regarding difficulty falling asleep), the Cronbach alpha rose to 0.57 (which
is comparable to the α = 0.61 that was found in a validation
study of the online version of the original ISI.[31] For comparability with other publications, we decided to report on the full
ISI score. We also performed all the analyses without the first
item of the ISI and these results were highly similar to the full
seven-item ISI (see Tables S1 and S2, supplemental material).

Depressive symptoms were measured using a Dutch translation of the 20-item Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D, range = 0, no depressive symptoms, to 60,
high depressive symptoms).[32,33] The original scale has shown


strong reliability, and the psychometric properties of the Dutch
scale are comparable to that of the original version (α = 0.79–­
0.92).[32,33] In the current study, the Cronbach alpha was 0.88.
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Dutch version
of the seven anxiety items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).[34,35] The total score ranges from 0 (no
symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe symptoms of anxiety). The
internal consistency of the HADS is good (α = 0.84 in the
Dutch version[34]). In the current study, the Cronbach alpha was
0.84.
A subscale of the SLEEP-50[28] was used to exclude patients
with possible apnea. The apnea subscale has eight items
(α = 0.51), and the total scale ranges from 8 (no apnea indication) to 32 (severe apnea indication).

**_Online sleep diary_**
We used the Dutch translation of the consensus sleep diary.[36]
Participants kept a sleep diary for 7 d and recorded time to
bed, time they tried to go to sleep, time of final awakening,
time out of bed, sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep
onset (WASO), terminal wakefulness (TWAK), number of

g ( ) p q y ( y
to 5 = “very good”), and use of sleep medication. From these
variables, the time in bed (TIB = final arising time − time to
bed), total sleep time (TST = TIB − SOL – WASO – TWAK),
sleep efficiency (SE = [TST / TIB] × 100), and total wake time
(TWT = SOL + WASO + TWAK) were calculated.

**Interventions**
The online and face-to-face CBT-I treatments had equal content
and included the following modules of standard multicomponent treatment for insomnia: (1) psychoeducation; (2) progressive muscle relaxation; (3) sleep hygiene; (4) sleep restriction
(i.e., restricting time in bed to actual sleeping time; the sleep
restriction parameters[37] are reported in Table S3, supplemental
material); and (5) cognitive exercises (i.e., challenging the misconceptions about sleep).[38] The modules were offered in the
same order in both treatment conditions.
The online program, first described in the study of Lancee
and colleagues,[18] features an integrated diary that gives visual
feedback on participants’ SE and total time spent awake. It
enables the provision of feedback on treatment progress and
assigned exercises. The participants first read information
regarding the module, then do their homework, and then fill
out online forms based on their exercises. Access to the next
module is gained only if the previous one is completed. Feedback is provided by Email based on these exercises, forms, and
on the sleep diary. In the current study, personal feedback was
provided by Master level students of psychology, and supervised by the first author.
The online treatment comprised six weekly sessions and
participants received feedback up to 8 w. In the first session,
participants started with psychoeducation and a sleep diary,
which was continued throughout treatment. In the second session, sleep hygiene and progressive muscle relaxation were
covered. After reading the sleep hygiene section, participants
wrote down their intentions for the following week; the coach
used this for his/her feedback. Progressive muscle relaxation
exercises were provided in mp3 downloads and participants
reported their intended frequency. In the third session, participants started with sleep restriction. They used the guidelines to
form their sleep window for the consecutive week. The coach
assessed this sleep window and gave feedback based on the
form and the sleep diary (e.g., “you are planning to spent 7
h in bed the following week but based on your diary it may
be better to spent 6 h a night in bed.”). For the remainder of
the program the coach and participants discussed sleep windows every week (up to 8 w). Cognitive exercises started in
the fourth session. In these exercises common misconceptions
were discussed and participants were asked to fill out a thought
form with their original and challenged misconception (e.g., “I
must sleep 8 h a night for full functioning next day” into “even
if I sleep only 6 h tonight I will be able to work quite well
tomorrow”). In the fifth session, again sleep restriction and
cognitive exercises were covered. In the sixth and final session,
sleep restriction was covered for the last time and a plan for the
future was made.
In the face-to-face condition, all six individual treatment
sessions were administered by a psychologist specialized in


were offered over a maximum time span of 12 w. The sessions
followed the same order as the online treatment, with the only
exception that in the face-to-face condition sleep hygiene was
started in the first week. Furthermore, stimulus control was
covered more elaborately in session two.

**Procedure**
Participants who met study criteria completed questionnaires,
and an online sleep diary on 7 consecutive days. Participants
were then randomized to either (1) guided online treatment;
(2) individual face-to-face treatment; or (3) the wait-list condition. We used a block randomization procedure with blocks of
30. Randomization results were not blinded to the investigators
and participants. Twelve weeks after the randomization, participants in all conditions were invited to complete post-assessment questionnaires and again the 7-night sleep diary. After
completing the post-assessment sleep diary, participants in the
wait-list condition received the online CBT-I treatment. The
people participating in the online and face-to-face condition
also received 3- and 6-mo follow-up measurements. The study
was approved by the internal Ethical Review Board of the University of Amsterdam and was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01955850).

**Statistical Analysis**
The effects of the intervention were tested using multilevel regression analysis, which lends itself well for intention-to-treat
analyses, and enables the inclusion of participants with one
measurement only.[39]

Analyses of variance detected baseline differences in depressive symptoms, F (2, 80) = 4.25; P = 0.02. A post hoc test
identified that participants in the wait-list group (mean = 21.5;
standard deviation [SD] = 8.0) had higher scores on depressive symptoms than people in the face-to-face condition
(mean = 15.7; SD = 7.6; P = 0.02). Furthermore, participants
in the online condition who completed the post-assessment
questionnaire had lower depressive symptoms at baseline
(mean = 16.0; SD = 6.5) than those who did not complete
the questionnaire (mean = 27.3; SD = 9.3), _F (1. 28) = 9.29;_
P = 0.005. This was also observed at the 6-month followup (mean = 22.0; SD = 9.8 versus mean = 15.6; SD = 6.0),
_F (1. 28) = 4.86; P = 0.04. Therefore, baseline depressive_
symptoms were added as a covariate in the multilevel regression analyses.
We also used multiple imputations based on the missing
at random assumption to insert missing cases on the questionnaire and diary data.[40] Using a predictive mean matching
procedure we generated 10 separate datasets. The values in
Tables 2 and 3 are based on these imputed datasets. Betweengroup Cohen ds were calculated on the difference in change
scores divided by the pooled standard deviation of the change.
A Cohen d of 0.20 indicates a small, 0.50 a moderate, and 0.80
a large effect.[43] To enhance comparability with other studies
we also included the Cohen _d based on the pooled baseline_
standard deviation in Table S4 (supplemental material). A significance level of P < 0.05 (two-sided) was used throughout
the study.

**RESULTS** **Table 4**

**Treatment Preference**
When asked about treatment preference before randomization, 47 participants (52.2%)

Post

named online treatment, 70 (77.8%) face-to
3-month

face treatment, 39 (43.3%) treatment by the

6-month

general practitioner, and 14 (15.6%) sleep
medication as feasible options (checking
more than one option was possible). Significantly more participants were interested
in receiving face-to-face treatment than in
online treatment (P = 0.003).

**Completion Rates, Satisfaction and Nonresponse**
In the online condition, 15 completed all six sessions, four
completed five sessions, three completed four sessions, one
completed three sessions, five completed two sessions, and
two completed zero sessions. Accordingly, 22 (73.3%) participants completed at least four sessions (which has previously
been described as an adequate dose of this intervention[18]),
and 15 participants (50.0%) completed all six sessions. On
average, the students spent 90.7 min (SD = 47.9) on giving
feedback per participant for the full online treatment (i.e., all
six lessons).
In the face-to-face condition, 21 followed all six sessions,
five followed five sessions, two followed four sessions, one
followed two sessions, and one followed zero sessions. Accordingly, 28 participants (93.3%) attended at least four
sessions, with 21 (70.0%) attending all six sessions. This resulted in an average treatment time of 241.5 min (SD = 60.8).
The completion rates did not significantly differ between the
online and face-to-face conditions, four session: χ[2] (1) = 4.32;
P = 0.08; all sessions: χ[2] (1) = 2.50; P = 0.19. At post-assessment, mean satisfaction ratings were statistically different,
_F (1. 50) = 17.71; P < 0.001 (range was 1, not satisfied at all,_
to 10, very satisfied), with a mean score of 6.8 (SD = 2.3) in
the online condition, and of 8.8 (SD = 1.0) in the face-to-face
condition.
The post-measure was completed by 87% to 97% of the
participants. Figure 1 presents the percentages among groups


and the completion rates for the diary and the follow-ups. As
mentioned in the statistical analysis section of this article,
participants in the online condition were less likely to fill out
post-assessment questionnaires if they had high depressive
symptoms at baseline.

**Efficacy: Online and Face-to-Face Versus Wait-List**
Both the online (Cohen _d_ = 1.0; P < 0.001) and face-to-face
(Cohen d = 2.3; P < 0.001) conditions showed stronger reductions at post-assessment on insomnia severity (ISI) than the
wait-list condition (Figure 2). The same pattern was observed
for anxiety (Cohen d = 0.8 / 1.2; P < 0.01), SE (Cohen d = 0.6 / 0.8;
P < 0.05) and TWT (Cohen d = 0.8 / 0.9; P < 0.01). With regard
to depressive symptoms, face-to-face treatment was associated with significantly lower scores at post-assessment (Cohen
_d = 1.2; P < 0.001) than the wait-list condition, whereas no_
significant difference was found between online treatment
and wait-list at post-assessment. Finally, the active conditions did not significantly differ from the wait-list condition at
post-assessment regarding TST (Cohen d = 0.4, P = 0.17 and
Cohen d = 0.3, P = 0.21 for online and face-to-face treatment,
respectively). See Table 2 for all means, corresponding Cohen
_ds, and significance levels as well as Table S5 (supplemental_
material) for all regression analyses. The data on the treatment completers sample showed highly similar effects to the
intent-to-treat sample (Table S6, supplemental material). Other
sleep diary measures are reported in the supplemental material
(SOL, WASO, TWAK, NWAK and SQ; Table S1).

**Figure 2—Insomnia severity index scores on all time points for face-**

imputation data. Error bars represent SEM.


**Efficacy: Online Versus Face-to-Face**
As compared to patients in the online condition, those in the
face-to-face condition reported significantly lower ISI scores
at post-assessment (Cohen _d = 0.9), 3-mo (Cohen_ _d = 0.8),_
and 6-mo follow-up assessments (Cohen d = 0.9 all Ps < 0.01),
respectively (see Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). Further, face-toface treatment was significantly more effective in reducing
comorbid depressive symptoms at post-assessment (Cohen
_d = 0.7; P < 0.05), and at the 6-mo follow-up assessment (Cohen_
_d = 0.5; P < 0.05); for anxiety differences were marginally sig-_
nificant at the post-assessment (Cohen d = 0.4; P = 0.06), and
significant at the 3-mo follow-up (Cohen _d = 0.5; P < 0.05)._
At post-assessment, no difference was observed for the sleep
diary, but the face-to-face intervention was more effective at
the 3-mo (SE: Cohen d = 0.6; TWT: Cohen d = 0.5; P < 0.05),
and 6-mo follow-up assessments (SE: Cohen d = 0.5; P < 0.05;
Tables 2, 3, S1, S2, S7, and S8, supplemental material).

**Clinical Change**
Table 4 displays the insomnia cutoff scores (ISI < 10) and ISI
clinical change scores (ISI change ≥ 8) for all time points and
conditions.

**Medication and Use of Other Treatment during the Trial**
Of the participants who completed the post-assessment, the
following numbers used prescribed sleep medication: online,
n = 6 (23.1%), face-to-face, n = 6 (20.7%), wait-list, n = 10
(38.5%). The proportions did not significantly differ from each
other, χ[2] (2) = 2.51; P = 0.29.
The following participants sought other treatment during
the trial: online, n = 4 (13.3%; one fitness, one a psychologist,

events were reported by any participant.

**DISCUSSION**
In this study we investigated the efficacy of a guided online
treatment and a face-to-face treatment for insomnia. As expected, both interventions were more effective than the waitlist group at post-assessment on insomnia severity (ISI), TWT,
SE, and anxiety. Face-to-face treatment (but not online treatment) was further effective in reducing comorbid depressive
symptoms as compared to the wait-list. No differences were
observed between the active conditions and the wait-list on TST.
Contrary to our expectation, face-to-face treatment yielded
a much stronger effect on insomnia severity (ISI) than the online treatment. Effect size differences between the two interventions were large at all three measurement points following
treatment (Cohen d = 0.9). Face-to-face treatment was also superior in terms of clinical change, with about 70% of the participants achieving clinically meaningful changes compared
to about 40% of the participants in the online treatment. The
same pattern held for the remission rates. About 70% of the
participants remitted in the face-to-face treatment, whereas
20% to 40% did (depending on which measurement) in the online treatment.
The effects on the sleep diary measures were less pronounced. No differences emerged between the two intervention conditions at post-assessment. However, follow-up results
revealed that participants in the face-to-face treatment reported
more favorable scores in SE (both 3 mo and 6 mo following
treatment) and TWT (3 mo following treatment only) than participants in the online intervention. To illustrate, these effect
sizes translate to an 11% SE improvement at 6-mo follow-up
in the online condition and an 18% improvement in the face-to
face condition.
The superiority of face-to-face treatment was also observed
with regard to comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. A
direct comparison of the active conditions revealed that faceto-face treatment was more effective in reducing depressive
symptoms as measured at the end of treatment and 6 mo afterward (with no difference found 3 mo following treatment).
Face-to-face treatment was found to be more effective than
online treatment in addressing comorbid anxiety only at the
3-mo follow-up.
Taken together, the results of this trial suggest that faceto-face treatment was substantially more effective than the
online counterpart. Accordingly, our findings are not in line
with previous clinical trials on online treatment for somatic
and other psychiatric disorders.[24,25] Furthermore, they are at
odds with several studies showing that online treatment effects
for insomnia are up to par with face-to-face delivery,[20–22] and
a study[26] comparing online and group treatment for insomnia
directly. However, in the latter study,[26] group treatment instead
of face-to-face treatment was investigated, and whether group
treatment is equivalent to face-to-face treatment remains unanswered.[42] A comparison of within-group effects indicated

leagues[26] was somewhat more effective than in the current
study (Cohen _d_ = 1.8 compared to Cohen _d_ = 1.5 in the current study), whereas the opposite was true for the face-to-face
intervention (Cohen d = 2.1 compared to Cohen d = 2.8 in the
current study).
To appraise the implications of these findings, several aspects of the current comparative trial warrant discussion. Conceivably, the difference in efficacy between the online and
face-to-face treatments in our study may be explained by the
large difference in time investment associated with both versions of treatment (242 min face-to-face treatment versus 91
min for online treatment). Another explanation may be that,
prior to treatment, fewer participants were motivated for online than for face-to-face treatment (52% and 78%, respectively). Moreover, the face-to-face treatment was delivered
by an insomnia expert, whereas the online treatment was provided by (supervised) graduate students with limited experience in psychotherapy.
Accordingly, the current study should not be mistaken for a
true test of whether it is possible to achieve similar treatment
effects with different delivery formats. However, we selected
this design to examine the extent to which online treatment
can produce significant treatment effects at low costs (i.e., limited time investment and low level of clinical training). Moreover, had we increased the time investment or used insomnia
experts, we believe the ecological validity of the comparison
would have suffered. Furthermore, our design was in line with
previous online CBT-I trials, including our own, that found
large treatment effects with feedback provided by students[22]
or even fully automated feedback.[20,21] Apart from the feedback
delivery, available online treatments are rather similar with regard to the content (albeit not with the same level of design and
usage of media possibilities such as videos and animations).
However, it should be noted that for insomnia self-help, provision of support seems essential to reaching large effects,[18] and
the effect of support appears to be mediated by an increased
use of the most important treatment methods such as sleep restriction.[43] In sum, the quality and intensity of the provided
feedback may substantially affect outcome.
A further candidate explanation for the difference in treatment effect may be that our online treatment was not up to
par with previous reported studies. However, this seems unlikely, as the current online treatment was tested in a previous
trial[18] and yielded treatment effects on insomnia severity that
were large (Cohen d = 1.0), as compared to the wait-list condition, and commensurate with those reported in a meta-analysis
concerning online treatment for insomnia (Cohen _d_ = 0.9).[16]
Moreover, we found effect sizes for the sleep diary that were
also in line with the effects reported in two meta-analyses.[16,17]
However, larger effects have been reported in other single trial
studies.[20,21,26] Additionally, the effects sizes regarding anxiety
(Cohen d = 0.8) and depressive outcomes (Cohen d = 0.4) were
similar or better than in previous studies.[22,44–46]

A final potential explanation for the differential effects
might be that the observed effects in the face-to-face treatment are exceptional. Indeed, the current face-to-face treatment was delivered by an experienced insomnia expert under


p
severity (ISI) were superior to the already large effect in
the group treatment in the study by Blom et al.[26] and much
larger than was found on a recent meta-analysis concerning
CBT-I in persons with comorbid insomnia (between group
Cohen _d =_ 2.3 versus Cohen d = 1.2).[47] However, treatment
effects on insomnia severity similar to those observed in the
current study have been reported previously[48,49] and effects
on the sleep diary were in line with the effects found in metaanalyses.[13,47] Notwithstanding, the use of only one therapist reduces the external validity and calls for a replication study in
which the psychologists are not insomnia experts (but receive
standard CBT-I training before the trial).
The following limitations of the study need to be addressed.
First, the ISI scale suffered from low internal consistency in
our sample. However, the analyses with one item left out produced a similar internal consistency result as the data on the
original ISI. Second, as a result of the modest sample size,
the presented study had limited power to detect differences,
which may be particularly relevant to the sleep diary outcomes. Third, a wait-list is not the optimal control condition.
An online placebo treatment such as employed in the study of
Espie and colleagues[21] or a face-to-face placebo control (e.g.,
sleep hygiene) would have been very informative. Fourth, objective sleep measurements such as polysomnography would
have enhanced our findings, but this measurement would have
required some degree of additional interaction which could
have compromised the online nature of the treatment. As the
comparison of online versus face-to-face treatment was the
primary purpose of this study, we chose to refrain from these
measurements. Fifth, because restless legs syndrome is associated with insomnia,[50] it could have been assessed in the
screening. Sixth and finally, the study was conducted on a
self-selected sample.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our current study shows
that face-to-face treatment outperformed the online treatment.
It cannot be ruled out that face-to-face treatment is more effective by mainly increasing the completion rates, although this
explanation seems unlikely as the data on the treatment completers sample show highly similar effects to the intent-to-treat
sample (Table S7 and S8, supplemental material). The first
and most important step is now to replicate these results. We
therefore encourage future studies with similar designs (preferably with an active control condition) to examine whether
individual face-to-face treatment is indeed more effective that
online treatment for insomnia.
In conclusion, our results indicate that face-to-face treatment for insomnia is more effective than online treatment.
Yet, as online treatment also resulted in large effect sizes, our
findings suggest that online treatment may offer a potentially
cost-effective[51] alternative and complement to face-to-face
treatment. Indeed, large effect sizes were achieved by the online treatment and these gains were achieved by low-cost labor
in about 38% of the time investment associated with the face-toface treatment. Presumably, this means that the cost of online
treatment is lower. Furthermore, specifically trained face-toface treatment providers may not be generally or sufficiently
available (e.g., in remote areas). Accordingly, if face-to-face

(p )
not readily accessible, or if is not the client-preferred treatment format, online treatment offers an effective alternative.
An interesting question for future research is to identify which
individuals benefit from online treatment versus those who do
not, and who may require face-to-face treatment, but such research would require (much) larger samples. Alternatively, one
might envision a stepped care approach, in which individuals
first receive online treatment and only if indicated subsequent
face-to-face treatment.[15]
