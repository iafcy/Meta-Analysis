Abstract

Background. Insomnia is effectively treated with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
Insomnia (CBT-I). Previous research has suggested the effects might not be limited to
sleep and insomnia severity, but also apply to depressive symptoms. Results, however, are
mixed.
Methods. In this randomized controlled trial we investigated the effects of guided online
CBT-I on depression and insomnia in people suffering from symptoms of both.
Participants (n = 104) with clinical insomnia and at least subclinical depression levels were
randomized to (1) guided online CBT-I and sleep diary monitoring (i-Sleep) or (2) control
group (sleep diary monitoring only). The primary outcome was the severity of depressive
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item; PHQ-WS). Secondary outcomes were insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, fatigue, daytime consequences of
insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking.
Results. At post-test, participants in the i-Sleep condition reported significantly less depressive symptoms (PHQ-WS) compared with participants in the sleep-diary condition (d = 0.76).
Large significant effects were also observed for insomnia severity (d = 2.36), most sleep diary
parameters, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. Effects
were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow-up. We did not find significant post-test effects
on fatigue or total sleep time.
Conclusions. Findings indicate that guided online CBT-I is not only effective for insomnia
complaints but also for depressive symptoms. The effects are large and comparable with
those of depression therapy. Clinical trial registration number: NTR6049 (Netherlands Trial
Register).

Introduction

Insomnia and depression are both prevalent, severe disorders. Insomnia is characterized by
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for three nights per week for 3 months, causing distress and impaired daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Depression is
diagnosed when someone experiences depressed mood and/or loss of interest in daily activities
for 2 weeks and shows four or more other specific symptoms (e.g. inactivity, concentration
problems) along with impaired functioning (APA, 2013). Insomnia and depression are highly
disturbing to a person’s life and present significant financial burdens to society due to
increased care consumption and decreased work productivity (Léger et al., 2001; Daley
et al., 2009; Watkins et al., 2009). Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception; around
40% of people with insomnia suffer from clinical depression (Taylor et al., 2005, 2007) and
around 80% of depressed individuals suffer from insomnia symptoms (Ohayon, 2002;
Szuba et al., 2003; Franzen and Buysse, 2008).
Evidence is accumulating that insomnia plays a role in the development and maintenance
of a depressive disorder. People with insomnia have a twofold chance of developing a depression (Baglioni et al., 2011; Li et al., 2018), insomnia perpetuates depressive disorders (Pigeon
et al., 2008), and residual insomnia complaints predict relapse after depression (Carney et al.,
2007). Suggested pathways through which insomnia affects depression include biological (e.g.
sleep deprivation or fragmentation affecting the endocrine system), cognitive (e.g. effects of
worrying and ruminating when lying awake), emotional (e.g. decreased emotional coping
skills), and directly sleep-related pathways (e.g. use of sleep medication; Staner, 2010;
Baglioni et al., 2014; Finan et al., 2015).
Despite the high comorbidity between insomnia and depression, it is still unclear which
disorder should be treated (first) or whether combination treatments are more effective.


-----

What is clear is that an insomnia disorder is effectively treated
with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).
Meta-analyses have demonstrated that the effects are rather
small for total sleep time (TST; Hedges’ g = 0.16), but high for
other sleep parameters such as sleep efficiency (SE; Hedges’ g =
0.71) and for insomnia severity (Hedges’ g = 0.98; Trauer et al.,
2015; Wu et al., 2015; van Straten et al., 2017). Long-term effects
of CBT-I surpass the effects of sleep medication (Smith et al.,
2002; Riemann and Perlis, 2009). Because of growing demand
for and shortage of trained therapists, as well as difficulties
some patients encounter (e.g. travel time, disabilities) treatments
are also offered online to enhance accessibility. Online CBT-I is
administered effectively with effect sizes in the range of
face-to-face treatment (Espie et al., 2014; van Straten et al.,
2014; Zachariae et al., 2016; Ritterband et al., 2017), although direct comparisons between online and face-to-face CBT-I show
mixed results (Blom et al., 2015b; Lancee et al., 2016). The effects
of (online) CBT-I are not limited to sleep parameters and insomnia severity. Meta-analyses report moderate effects of insomnia
treatment on comorbid depressive symptoms experienced by
insomnia patients (SMD = 0.36 in Ye et al., 2015; d = 0.34 in
Ballesio et al., 2017). However, most trials included in these
meta-analyses did not target depressed populations specifically
and in several studies patients with higher depression scores
were excluded.
To our knowledge there have only been four studies that investigated CBT-I as a standalone treatment for people with both
depressive symptoms and insomnia. Two of those studies used
face-to-face treatment and both failed to demonstrate an effect
of insomnia treatment on depressive symptoms compared with
depression treatment-as-usual (Wagley et al., 2013) and compared
with relaxation therapy (Norell-Clarke et al., 2015). The other two
studies used online CBT-I as a standalone treatment for depressive symptoms and insomnia. Those studies showed more promising results. Blom and colleagues showed that online CBT-I was
significantly more effective than online depression treatment on
insomnia but as effective on depressive symptoms (Blom et al.,
2015a). However, the sample size of this study was small and replication is needed before conclusions can be drawn. Christensen
and colleagues (2016) demonstrated that online CBT-I effectively
reduced depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms in
patients with complaints of both compared with an online placebo module. However, people with higher scores of depressive
symptoms were excluded (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 >20;
Spitzer et al., 1999).
We aimed to replicate the findings of Christensen and colleagues and expand them by not excluding people with higher levels
of depressive symptoms, in a randomized controlled design comparing online CBT-I (i-Sleep) with a non-treated control group,
monitoring their sleep daily. The online treatment included
online feedback by a coach as this has been shown to potentiate
efficacy (Lancee et al., 2013b). We hypothesized that i-Sleep
would be more effective than the control group in reducing
depression symptoms. Secondarily, we investigated effects on
insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, daytime consequences
of insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. We
hypothesized that i-Sleep would be more effective compared
with the control group. We hypothesized that the effects of
i-Sleep are generalized on functioning and other psychiatric
symptoms such as perseverative thinking and anxiety known to
be related to insomnia (Ohayon and Roth, 2003; Ehring and
Watkins, 2008; Harvey et al., 2017).


Methods

Participants and recruitment

Participants who expressed interest in participating in research
[through a website on insomnia (www.insomnie.nl) were recruited.](http://www.insomnie.nl)
Potential participants received an email invitation to a screening
questionnaire. Recruitment was completed in October 2016.
The last follow-up occurred in June 2017 (see Fig. 1).
Inclusion criteria (assessed in the online screening) were: (1)
⩾18 years, (2) fulfilling DSM-5 criteria for insomnia (APA,
2013): trouble falling or staying asleep, ⩾ three nights a week,
⩾30 min, with significant consequences, sufficient opportunity
to sleep and dissatisfaction with amount or quality of sleep; (3)
depressive symptoms [PHQ-9 score >4; (Spitzer et al., 1999)];
and (4) access to the Internet and email. Exclusion criteria were
(1) probable sleep apnea (Wilson et al., 2010); (2) previous
CBT-I; (3) started psychotherapy < 6 months ago; (4) pregnancy/breastfeeding; (5) shift work; (6) being diagnosed with
psychosis/schizophrenia; and (7) suicidal intentions [five items
from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnostic interview (Sheehan et al., 1998)]. Other psychiatric and somatic comorbidities were allowed, as were the use of sleep
medication, melatonin, and homeopathic aids.

Sample size

Based on the effect on depression (PHQ-9) of d = 0.69 reported by
Christensen et al. (2016), a desired power of 0.8 and an alpha level
of 0.05 (two-sided) a total of 34 participants per condition was
needed. Considering risk of high dropout from online interventions (24% in Horsch et al., 2015) we aimed to include 52 participants per condition.

Procedure

After informed consent, participants completed the baseline
questionnaire [demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9, Spitzer et al., 1999), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI,
Bastien et al., 2001), consequences of insomnia during daytime
(Espie et al., 2012); Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS, Krupp et al.,
1989) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety
(HADS-A, Spinhoven et al., 1997)]. Due to technical issues, the
Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ, Ehring et al., 2012)
scheduled at baseline was completed at week 1. Excluded participants were advised to contact their general practitioner. No applicants reported suicidal ideation. All eligible applicants were then
asked to fill out a sleep diary. All participants that adhered to
the diary (between 5 and 7 days) were included and subsequently
randomized to (1) online CBT-I (i-Sleep) or (2) no treatment
(sleep diary only). We used block randomization (blocks 2–4)
with a 1:1 allocation sequence generated by an independent
researcher also performing actual allocation. Blinding researchers
or participants was not possible.
All participants were asked weekly to complete the PHQ-9
(Spitzer et al., 1999), the ISI (Bastien et al. 2001), and the questionnaire on daily consequences (Espie et al., 2012). In addition,
we asked participants to complete a sleep diary every morning
(Carney et al., 2012).
Post-assessments occurred 9 weeks after randomization, for
testing the primary hypothesis. Intervention participants received
a 3 and 6-month follow-up assessment. The control group received
treatment after post-assessment (week 9). Figure 1 shows a flow

chart of the study. The study was registered at the Netherlands
Trial Register (NTR6049). The University of Amsterdam Ethics
Review Board approved the protocol (2016-CP-7263).

Intervention

The online intervention i-Sleep consists of five sessions of CBT
for insomnia (Morin and Espie, 2003; van der Zweerde et al.,
2016). The 5 sessions focused on (1) sleep hygiene and lifestyle,
(2) stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy [SRT; in
which the time in bed (TIB) is restricted to the average time
slept in the last week (with a 5-h minimum), increasing TIB
when efficiency is >85% and decreasing when it is <80%, with
the aim of increasing the TIB spent asleep and decreasing TIB
spent awake], (3) relaxation, (4) cognitive therapy tackling dysfunctional thoughts about sleep, (5) relapse prevention (van der
Zweerde et al., 2016). Clinical psychology graduate students at
the University of Amsterdam offered online guidance (∼40 min
per participant per week) under weekly supervision by the first
and last author. Online guidance entailed feedback on exercises,
discussing SRT/bedtimes based on the diary and motivating participants to persevere in the treatment.


Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the Dutch version of a nineitem depression scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at week
9 (PHQ-9; range 0–27, Cronbach’s α = 0.94; Spitzer et al., 1999).
The PHQ-9 is scored on a five-point Likert score ranging from 0
(never) to 4 (almost daily). Next to the total score of the PHQ-9
we also report the total score without the sleep item, preventing
measuring a decline in depression directly due to improved
sleep (see also Christensen et al., 2016). We call this the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item (PHQ-WS) score.
Secondary measures were included to assess insomnia symptoms, daytime functioning and other psychological symptoms
associated with insomnia and depression. The Insomnia
Severity Index (ISI; Bastien et al., 2001) is a seven item-scale
scored on a five-point Likert scale. The total score ranges from
0 to 28. The ISI has good psychometric properties (Cronbach’s
α = 0.78). The daytime consequences of insomnia were measured
with six items (energy, mood, concentration, sleepiness, productivity, and relationships). Each item was scored on five-point Likert
scale (Espie et al., 2012) and summed into one total score for daytime functioning. Fatigue was measured with the FSS (Cronbach’s


-----

α = 0.89, nine statements scored on a seven-point Likert scale;
Krupp et al., 1989). Anxiety was measured with the Anxiety section of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A;
Cronbach’s α = 0.84, seven items on a four-point Likert scale,
scores ranging 0–21; Spinhoven et al., 1997). Perseverative thinking was measured using the PTQ (Cronbach’s α = 0.94; 15 items
are rated on a four-point Likert scale, scores range 0–60; Ehring
et al., 2012). For all questionnaires, higher scores indicated
more severe complaints.

Sleep diary

The Carney consensus sleep diary (Carney et al., 2012) was slightly
adjusted to fit our study purpose and reduce participant burden.
Participants reported when they went to bed to sleep and when
they got up, sleep onset latency (SOL), TIB awake after sleep
onset (WASO), how long they slept in total and mood on a scale
of 1–10 (higher scores indicating better mood). We calculated
TST (TST: TIB–SOL–WASO), and then calculated the SE (SE:
TST/TIB × 100). Two items of the original Carney diary were left
out: (1) the item distinguishing between the time patients went to
bed and the time they switched off the light, and (2) the item distinguishing between final morning awakening and getting up.

Adverse events

At follow-up, participants were asked about adverse events over the
course of participation. They indicated whether they had fallen,
had an (traffic) accident or experienced other negative events that
seemed related to fatigue and/or sleepiness (and if yes, what happened and any physical or psychological consequences).

Statistical methods

All randomized participants were included in the analyses following the intention-to-treat principle (Newell, 1992). Generalized
mixed (multilevel) regression analysis was used to evaluate
within-group effects (Time) and between-group effects (Time ×
Condition) of the intervention. Mixed negative binomial regression analyses with a log link were performed for skewed variables
(PHQ-WS, ISI, PTQ, FSS, SE, SOL, WASO, TST), regular linear
mixed regression with an identity link in all other cases.
Two-level (participants and measurement points) repeatedmeasures designs were examined with outcomes as dependent
variables (PHQ, PHQ-WS, ISI, daytime consequences, FSS,
HADS-A, PTQ, sleep diary), Condition as between-subjects factor
(intervention v. control) and Time as a within-subjects factor
(pre- v. post-test). We used an unstructured covariance structure,
which assumes data is missing at random, as the best model for
the data and number of measurement points. Significance tests
were performed to assess pre-treatment differences between
groups. Baseline characteristics that significantly differed between
groups and variables that predicted dropout were added as covariates. Analyses were repeated without covariates as a sensitivity
analysis.
Within-group Cohen’s d effect sizes were based on multilevel
estimated baseline and post-test means (i.e., pre-post) and pooled
observed standard deviations at baseline. Between-group Cohen’s
d effect sizes were calculated by dividing the difference in change
scores (i.e., pre-post) by the pooled standard deviations at baseline
(Morris, 2008). Cohen’s d was considered small (i.e. <0.20),


moderate (around 0.50) or large (⩾0.80; Cohen, 1988). Analyses
were carried out using a 0.05 α-level (two-tailed) in SPSS v24.

Results

Descriptives and non-response

We included 104 patients (52 intervention and 52 control). The
mean age of the sample was 45.99 years (S.D. = 12.32) and 82%
of the participants were female (Table 1). Insomnia duration
was around 10 years (M = 9.79, S.D. = 9.91). The majority of participants completed higher vocational or university education
(60%). At baseline, participants showed mild (PHQ-9 > 4) to
severe depression (PHQ-9 > 19) with scores ranging from 5 to
22 (M = 10.19, S.D. = 3.90; see online Supplementary Fig. S1).
There were no baseline differences between groups with the
exception of perseverative thinking (see online Supplementary
Table S4). Those in the i-Sleep condition reported more baseline
perseverative thinking (M = 32.35, S.D. = 1.53) than participants in
the control condition (M = 28.69, S.D. = 1.73; U = 1568, p = 0.03).
Age, depression scores (PHQ-9 and PHQ-WS), and TST proved
to be associated with non-response at post-test in the treatment
condition: younger patients, patients with higher depression
scores and shorter TST were less likely to fill out the post-test.
We included these variables as covariates in the regression models
on all outcome measures. Non-response in the control condition
was not related to any of the variables examined. At the followups, baseline PTQ was associated with nonresponse (nonresponders had more perseverative thinking) and was therefore
included as a covariate in the analysis. Figure 1 shows a flowchart
of the study.

Treatment adherence, satisfaction, and adverse events

Most of the 52 intervention participants (n = 41, 85%) completed
the full i-Sleep intervention. Four participants dropped out of the
intervention (see flowchart, Fig. 1). The remaining participants
completed 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 1), or four sessions (n = 3).
On average patients were satisfied with the website (M = 7.67
on a scale 1–10, S.D. = 0.98), with the feedback (M = 7.91, S.D. =
0.87), and the online module (M = 7.91, S.D. = 0.82, see online
Supplementary Table S1). No adverse events related to the intervention or trial were reported.

Treatment effects on depression

Multilevel regression analyses showed significant Time × Condition
interaction effects for all three depression scores [PHQ-9, F(1,81) =
20.54, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2); PHQ-WS, F(1,82) = 14.38, p < 0.001, and
the Mood item in the diary, F(1,83) = 13.34, p < 0.001]. This indicates participants in the i-Sleep condition experienced a greater
decline in depressive symptoms at post-test than the control
condition (dbetween = 1.05 for the total PHQ, dbetween = 0.76 for
the PHQ without the sleep item and dbetween = 0.68 for the Mood
item). Details of the analysis are in Table 2 and online
Supplementary Tables S2–S5.

Treatment effects on insomnia and fatigue

Significant Time × Condition interactions were also found for
insomnia severity [ISI, F(1,51) = 51.94, p < 0.001; Fig. 2] and for
several sleep parameters from the diary [SE, F(1,89) = 9.66, p <
0.001, SOL, F(1,70) = 20.12, p < 0.001, and WASO, F(1,80) = 22.59,
p < 0.001]. This indicates that participants in the i-Sleep condition
experienced more sleep improvements than participants in
the control condition: they report lower insomnia severity
(dbetween = 2.36), higher SE (dbetween = 0.67), lower SOL (dbetween =
0.69) and less time spent WASO (dbetween = 0.60). No significant
Time × Condition effect could be found for TST, F(1,73) = 0.04,
p = 0.84, nor for Fatigue Severity, F(1105) = 1.43, p = 0.24.

Treatment effects on daytime functioning, anxiety, and
perseverative thinking

Significant Time × Condition interactions were found on anxiety

[HADS-A, F(1,87) = 8.42, p < 0.01] perseverative thinking [PTQ,
F(1,91) = 9.48, p < 0.01] and daytime functioning, F(1,88) = 18.44,
p < 0.001. We observed no differential effects for the separate
aspects of the daytime functioning and hence only report the
total score. Findings indicate that participants in the i-Sleep condition reported less anxiety (dbetween = 0.63), less perseverative thinking (dbetween = 0.62) and better daytime functioning (dbetween = 1.12)
than participants in the control group.

Treatment effects at follow-up

Non-significant time effects from post to follow-up assessments
(using Greenhouse–Geisser correction where the sphericity assumption was violated) indicated that treatment effects at post assessment
were largely maintained at follow-up assessment for depression

[PHQ-9, F(2,68) = 0.66, p = 0.52, PHQ-WS, F(2,68) = 0.32, p = 0.73]
and insomnia severity, F(1.661, 56,48) = 0.29, p = 0.75. Effects on daytime functioning was maintained, F(2,68) = 0.073, p = 0.93 as well as
on comorbid psychological symptoms [anxiety, F(2,68) = 0.29, p =
0.77, perseverative thinking, F(1.626, 55.28) = 0.12, p = 0.94] and several
sleep parameters [TST, F(1.275,15.30) = 2.09, p = 0.15, WASO, F(2,20) =
2.05, p = 0.16, SOL F(2,22) = 2.49, p = 0.11 and SE, F(2,18) = 2.60,
p = 0.10]. There was no effect for fatigue at follow-up, F(2,70) =
0.93, p = 0.4, while mood improved further, F(2,24) = 5.73, p = 0.01,
d = −0.23.

Clinically relevant improvements

Participants in the i-Sleep condition showed significantly more
clinically relevant improvements in both depression symptoms
(clinical improvement defined as a drop of 50% or more resulting
in <11; Spitzer et al., 1999; 64% v. 30%) and insomnia severity
(clinical improvement defined as a change of >8; Morin et al.,
2011; 64% v. 9%) than participants in the sleep diary monitoring
control group. At 6 months follow-up, a considerable percentage
of participants in the i-Sleep condition remained below the clinical cut-offs for depression (56%) and insomnia severity (50%)
(see Table 3 for details).

Discussion

Our primary aim was to investigate effects of online CBT-I on
depressive symptoms in a sample of people with insomnia and
at least a subclinical level of depression. We hypothesized that
the online intervention i-Sleep would be more effective than no
treatment (sleep diary monitoring only). Our findings convincingly show online CBT-I, reduces symptoms of depression and
insomnia in people experiencing both.
Overall, the large effect sizes that we observed on depressive
symptoms (PHQ-9, dbetween = −1.05; PHQ-WS, dbetween = −0.76)
contrast with two face-to-face studies published in the past,
which did not observe an effect on depression (Wagley et al.,
2013; Norell-Clarke et al., 2015). The effects we found are larger
than those observed in two meta-analyses on effects of (online)
CBT-I for depressive symptoms (SMD = −0.36; Ye et al., 2015a;
d = 0.34 for individual CBT-I, d = 0.13 for self-help CBT-I;
Ballesio et al., 2017) and larger than in the Christensen study
which also specifically examined the effects of CBT-I on

depression. There could be several reasons why our observed effect
on depressive symptoms was better than in other studies. First,
many studies in the meta-analyses did not specifically target
depression. Second, we had higher baseline depression severity
scores in our sample than in the Christensen trial, which provides
more room for improvement. Also, we used personalized feedback
while the Christensen trial, and some other studies included in the
meta-analyses, used automated feedback. Personalized feedback
has been shown to enhance treatment effects (Lancee et al.,
2013a). Third and last, the Christensen trial used a more active
control condition (Health Watch) than we did (monitoring only).
Our second aim was to explore effects of the treatment on
insomnia. The observed effect on insomnia severity was comparable with a number of other online CBT-I trials but much larger
(d = −2.36) than what was observed in the trial by Christensen


and colleagues (d = −1.10, 2016) and in the most recent
meta-analysis of (online) CBT (Hedges’ g = 1.03 in Zachariae
et al., 2016; Hedges’ g = 0.98 in van Straten et al., 2017). Future
research is needed to identify sources of this heterogeneity of
treatment effect sizes. The effects on SE were moderate, but in
line with observations in a recent meta-analysis (van Straten
et al., 2017). An increase in SE was also observed in the control
condition (within Cohen’s d = 0.52, compared with d = 1.19 in
the i-Sleep condition). It appears that merely keeping a sleep
diary can have a positive effect on SE, although this result is tentative since we did not include a third group who did not fill out a
sleep diary. This means that we cannot rule out that this increase
in SE might also be caused by natural recovery.
Interestingly, results did not show that participants were less
fatigued or slept more (TST) compared with participants in the

control group. Perhaps, due to the SRT, participants were sleeping
more efficiently and experiencing fewer symptoms (showing
improvements on all symptom measures) at post-test, but were
not recovered in such a way that they felt less tired. Possibly,
the treatment causes participants to improve SE and therefore
reduces insomnia complaints (i.e. decline on ISI, more satisfied
with sleep, less trouble falling/staying asleep, etc.), while the
SRT itself limited TST and actually caused fatigue. Fatigue is
often an important reason for seeking treatment (Riedel and
Lichstein, 2000) and is a commonly reported side effect of sleep
restriction (Kyle et al., 2011). However, if the fatigue could be
interpreted as a side effect of treatment here, then we would
have expected to see postponed improvements in fatigue after
treatment, in line with other research (e.g. Vitiello et al., 2014)
we did not observe this after 6 months. Apparently insomnia
severity and depression symptoms can largely improve despite
fatigue remaining stable. Intuitively, it may seem that more and/
or better sleep should automatically lead to more restoration of
depleted resources and therefore less fatigue. But research has
shown the relationship between fatigue and sleep to be more complex (Fortier-Brochu et al., 2010). Future research may determine
whether treatments targeting fatigue directly could be helpful in
insomnia.
We found significant moderate to large improvements after
online CBT-I treatment on our other outcomes intended to measure general (psychological) functioning: daytime functioning,
anxiety, and perseverative thinking. It is interesting to note that
although the treatment is not specifically aimed at these comorbid
psychological symptoms, they do improve. The effect on daytime
functioning (in energy, mood, concentration, sleepiness, productivity, and relationships) deserves specific attention because they
are often overlooked in insomnia research (Kyle et al., 2010,
2013). Suffering daytime consequences is one of the main reasons
for seeking treatment (Morin et al., 2006) and our findings suggest online CBT-I for people suffering from insomnia and depression has the potential to increase quality of life by improving
daytime functioning. Future research will be necessary to confirm
this (see e.g. protocol Espie et al., 2016).
CBT-I treatment might be regarded as a treatment not purely
targeting insomnia. Some of the components are clearly targeting
sleep, for example stimulus-control and SRT. However, parts of
the sleep hygiene component (i.e., including promoting physical


exercise and a structured routine in the morning and at night)
show overlap with behavioral activation, a treatment component
of CBT for depression. Additionally, targeting dysfunctional
thoughts about sleep resembles cognitive therapy for depression
and may encourage patients to use this strategy on non-sleep
related depressive thought patterns as well. Likewise, relaxation
is also used in depression treatment (Beck, 1979). The question
remains whether depression symptoms abate because sleep
improves, or whether specific components of the treatment
work towards improving depression symptoms directly. Which
specific CBT-I components improve depressive complaints
remains to be investigated. Dismantling studies could be used to
isolate treatment ingredients that confer benefit to sleep and
depressive symptoms, which may help refine treatment of the
common comorbid presentation. A proportion of the participants
in our study that underwent treatment remained above clinical
cut-offs for depression (38%) and insomnia (38%) at post-test.
Future studies should investigate how, possibly, combining protocols may enhance treatment response. Additionally, mediation
and network approach research is needed to see whether sleep
improves before, after or at the same time as depression does.
Effects were maintained at follow-up. At 6 months follow-up,
22 (56%) participants in the i-Sleep condition remained below the
mild depression cut-off (PHQ-9 < 5), and 19 participants (50%)
remained below the insomnia cut-off (⩽10) on the ISI.
However, since we had a 25% non-response we cannot rule out
that participants who did not complete the follow-up measurements were worse off than the ones that did (or neither that
they were better off). Further research is needed to assess longerterm effects more reliably. Technical difficulties forced us to use a
[different program (Qualtrics, www.qualtrics.com) for the sleep](http://www.qualtrics.com)
diary at 6 months. This may have influenced the sleep diary
adherence.
Some limitations of the present study need to be acknowledged. We actively recruited participants who were interested in
insomnia treatment from the general population who were not
clinically diagnosed for depression. The majority was female
and highly educated. This is conceivably a very different population than patients that seek depression treatment through regular
(mental) health care. However, this is also the case in other studies investigating the effect of online depression treatment on
depressive symptoms that often use samples that show

comparable baseline depression severity (e.g. Clarke et al., 2009;
Cavanagh et al., 2011; Titov et al., 2015). The next step is to
study whether online CBT-I treatment is also effective for patients
with depressive symptoms in general (mental) health care settings, when patients turn to their general practitioner or psychologist for help. Also, in this study, we did not restrict time spent by
clinical psychology students providing the feedback. Lancee et al.
(2013a, 2013b) showed it is possible to complete guidance for the
entire treatment in < 40 min. We expect trained professionals
more experienced with patients will provide feedback in 15–
20 min per session, lowering the necessary investment.
In summary, our study shows that guided online CBT-I can be
used to treat people suffering from both insomnia and depression
symptoms. In our sample with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, effects on depressive symptoms (PHQ-9, d = −1.05;
PHQ-WS, d = −0.76) were larger than those found in a metaanalysis of supported online CBT for self-reported depressive
symptoms (Andersson and Cuijpers, 2009). Our findings provide
further evidence that insomnia should not be treated as a mere
symptom of a depressive episode but requires dedicated attention.
Targeting insomnia may offer new potential in the treatment of
depression. Further research is crucial to clarify the specific relations between insomnia and depression symptoms, in patients
with a clinical diagnosis of both, preferably including a depression
treatment condition and using both self-report and objective measures such as actigraphy, to optimize therapeutic effects and
improve clinical outcomes.
