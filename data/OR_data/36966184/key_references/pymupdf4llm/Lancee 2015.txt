Abstract. Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
for insomnia. However, few studies have examined putative mechanisms of change based on the
cognitive model of insomnia. Identification of modifiable mechanisms by which the treatment works
may guide efforts to further improve the efficacy of insomnia treatment. The current study therefore
has two aims: (1) to replicate the finding that online CBT is effective for insomnia and (2) to test
putative mechanism of change (i.e., safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs). Accordingly, we
conducted a randomized controlled trial in which individuals with insomnia were randomized to
either online CBT for insomnia (n ¼ 36) or a waiting-list control group (n ¼ 27). Baseline and
posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors,
dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary. Three- and six-month assessments
were administered to the CBT group only. Results show moderate to large statistically significant
effects of the online treatment compared to the waiting list on insomnia severity, sleep measures,
sleep safety behaviors, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors mediated the effects of treatment on insomnia severity and sleep efficiency. Together, these
findings corroborate the efficacy of online CBT for insomnia, and suggest that these effects were
produced by changing maladaptive beliefs, as well as safety behaviors. Treatment protocols for
insomnia may specifically be enhanced by more focused attention on the comprehensive fading of
sleep safety behaviors, for instance through behavioral experiments. Key words: beliefs; CBT;
insomnia; online; safety behaviors.

Insomnia, that is, problems of getting to
sleep and/or staying asleep, affects about 10%
of the general population (Ohayon, 2002). In
order to meet the criteria for a DSM-5
disorder, these sleep complaints need to be
present for at least three months, cannot be
better explained by another disorder, and have
negative daytime consequences (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Among these daytime negative consequences, studies have documented low concentration, fatigue, and impaired cognitive
functioning (Espie, Kyle, Hames, Cyhlarova,


& Benzeval, 2012; Kyle, Morgan, & Espie,
2010; LeBlanc et al., 2007; Roth & Drake,
2004), as well as an increased likelihood of
experiencing physical complaints such as
coronary artery disease (Mallon, Broman, &
Hetta, 2002), diabetes (Mallon, Broman, &
Hetta, 2005), and high blood pressure (Suka,
Yoshida, & Sugimori, 2003). Furthermore,
insomnia is related to an increased risk of
developing other mental disorders such as
depression and anxiety (Baglioni et al., 2011;
Taylor, Lichstein, Durrence, Reidel, & Bush,
2005). In addition, insomnia is associated with


-----

substantial societal costs due to higher work
absenteeism and decreased productivity
(Daley, Morin, LeBlanc, Gregoire, & Savard,
2009).
Several meta-analyses showed that sleeping
problems can be effectively treated with
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
(CBT-I; Irwin, Cole, & Nicassio, 2006; Morin
et al., 2006; Morin et al., 1999). CBT-I is as
effective as sleep medication in the short term,
and has more support for its efficacy in the
long term (Rieman & Perlis, 2009; Smith et al.,
2002). Moreover, CBT-I comes without the
adverse side effects often associated with
medication, such as headaches, drowsiness,
and dizziness (Glass, Lanctot, Herrmann,
Sproule, & Busto, 2005).
To reach a larger group of people and to
create easier access to CBT-I, online versions
of CBT-I for insomnia have been developed.
Two meta-analyses demonstrated that selfhelp treatment for insomnia yields small to
moderate effects (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; van
Straten & Cuijpers, 2009), while a recent metaanalysis reported moderate to large effects
(Ho et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies
showed that the efficacy of these online
treatments is enhanced when patients received
motivational feedback via the e-mail on their
exercises and progress (Lancee, van den Bout,
Sorbi, & van Straten, 2013), especially for the
subgroup with depressive comorbidity
(Lancee, Sorbi, Eisma, van Straten, & van
den Bout, 2014).
While the evidence for (online) CBT-I is
mounting, support for mechanisms by which
the treatment works remains scarce. Indeed, in
their recent meta-analysis on mediators of
CBT-I, Schwartz and Carney (2012) concluded that although CBT-I appears to target
the risk factors of insomnia, more research is
needed to establish whether CBT-I works
according to proposed mediators.
In a cognitive model of insomnia, Harvey
(2002a) argued that thinking repetitively
about possible sleep deficiencies and the
consequences of impaired sleep contributes
to arousal and distress, which consequently
lead to selective attention and increased
monitoring of sleep-related threats. These
processes in turn result in an overestimation
of the consequences of sleep difficulties, which
causes even more impairment in sleep and
daytime functioning. According to Harvey


(2002a), dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors fuel and exacerbate these processes
and are therefore important maintaining
factors of insomnia. This paper therefore
aims to test the singular and joint meditational
potency of these two constructs in the context
of a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
comparing online CBT-I and a waiting-list
control condition.
Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are erroneous assumptions, such as unrealistic expectations about sleep requirements, wrong
attributions to the causes of insomnia, and
unrealistic beliefs about the consequences of
insomnia (Morin & Espie, 2003). These
dysfunctional beliefs are hypothesized to
trigger negative emotions that in turn lead to
impaired sleep. For example, a patient that
holds the belief “I need eight hours of sleep to
adequately function during the day” will start
to worry during the night if less than eight
hours of available sleeping time remains.
Following Harvey’s (2002a) model, this
worry/excessive toned cognitive activity will
lead to distress which will result in a delay in
sleep onset.
Most authors recognize the importance of
dysfunctional beliefs and therefore identifying
and challenging these beliefs are nowadays a
standard component of CBT-I (Harvey et al.,
2014; Harvey, Sharpley, Ree, Stinson, & Clark,
2007; Morin & Espie, 2003). Multiple trials
measured the effect of insomnia treatment on
dysfunctional beliefs and found that such
beliefs were indeed ameliorated by therapy
compared to control conditions (Edinger,
Wohlgemuth, Radtke, Marsh, & Quillian,
2001; Harvey et al., 2007). More importantly,
changes in dysfunctional beliefs were correlated with treatment effect (Edinger et al., 2001;
Espie, Inglis, & Harvey, 2001; Jansson-Frojmark & Linton, 2008; Morin, Blais, & Savard,
2002). However, only two groups performed
specific mediation analyses (Espie et al., 2014;
Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, & Inoue, 2014).
Surprisingly, Espie et al. (2014) found that
dysfunctional beliefs mediated effects of treatment on a general insomnia measure, but not
on sleep efficiency. Another research
group found no mediating effect of dysfunctional beliefs on the effects of treatment on
insomnia severity (Okajima et al., 2014). Stated
differently, while there is substantial support
for the relationship between dysfunctional


-----

beliefs and insomnia, specific evidence for its
mediating role in CBT-I remains inconclusive.
Safety behaviors, that is, subtle avoidance
behaviors intended to prevent a feared outcome, provide relief from distress in the short
term, but eventually have negative consequences in the long term (Salkovskis, 1991).
According to models in the anxiety literature
(Clark, 1999; Kamphuis & Telch, 1998;
Salkovskis, 1991) and Harvey’s (2002a)
insomnia-based model, safety behaviors prevent disconfirmation of patients’ dysfunctional beliefs. For example, the belief that
one needs eight hours a night to sleep may lead
to the safety behavior of going to bed early so
that there is an increased chance of sleeping
for eight hours. This safety behavior will have
the short-term benefit of being more rested in
the morning, but it also prevents falsification
of the belief that one needs eight hours of
sleep for adequate functioning during the next
day. The safety behavior thereby blocks
opportunities to gain new insights about
sleep learning by misattributing the prevention
of sleep problems to the safety behavior.
Notably, this may not apply to all safety
behavior; for example, recent evidence shows
that the careful use of safety behaviors can
have beneficial effects for treatment (e.g.,
allowing some safety behaviors can motivate
patients to do their exercises; Levy &
Radomsky, 2014). In insomnia, these safety
behaviors can occur both during the day and
at night, and are not exclusively aimed at
controlling overt behavior but also at controlling thoughts and imagery (Harvey, 2002a).
Safety behaviors in insomnia have only
recently become the object of empirical
scrutiny. Upon identification of safety behaviors in insomnia (Harvey, 2002b), it was
demonstrated that people with insomnia
report engaging in more safety behavior than
people without insomnia (Jansson-Frojmark,
Harvey, Norell-Clarke, & Linton, 2012; Ree &
Harvey, 2004). Also, the need to engage in
safety behavior (but not the intensity at which
people engage in it) was associated with
insomnia severity (Hood, Carney, & Harris,
2011). Moreover, two treatment studies
showed that safety behaviors were ameliorated by CBT-I (Harvey et al., 2007; Jernelov
et al., 2012). On the other hand, Woodley and
Smith (2006) found insomnia severity unrelated to the use of safety behaviors and


Gosling, Batterham, and Christensen (2012)
reported that safety behaviors were not
associated with the onset of sleep disturbance
when controlling for ruminative style and
somatic sensitivity. No mediation analyses
have yet been conducted relating change in use
of safety behaviors to treatment outcome.
In sum, both dysfunctional beliefs and
safety behaviors are proposed as key mechanisms in the negative cognitive cycle of
insomnia (Harvey, 2002a), but these assertions
yielded inconclusive evidence (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs), or have not been tested
empirically (i.e., safety behaviors) in therapy
effect studies.
In the current investigation, we therefore
aimed to (1) replicate the finding that online
CBT-I is effective in the treatment of insomnia
and (2) test the hypotheses that dysfunctional
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect
of CBT-I. Accordingly, we conducted an RCT
comparing online CBT-I to a waiting-list
control group. Specific hypotheses include:
(1) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list
in ameliorating insomnia severity and
sleep impairment assessed with a sleep diary,
(2) CBT-I is effective compared to a waiting list
in ameliorating dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors about sleep, and (3) dysfunctional
beliefs and safety behaviors mediate the effect
of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep
measures.

#### Method
##### Participants
Participants were recruited from April 2013
to January 2014 via a popular-scientific
website and a Facebook ad campaign.
Enrollment took place in October 2013 and
January 2014. An initial group of 109
interested individuals read information
about the study, completed an informed
consent form, and started the online questionnaire. Thirty-three interested volunteers
were excluded based on the preselected
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Figure 1 for
a Flowchart). Inclusion criteria were: (1)
insomnia according to DSM-5 criteria; (2)
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score 10 or
higher (Morin, Belleville, Belanger, & Ivers,
2011); (3) being awake for at least 30 min at
night for at least three nights a week; and
(4) being 18 years or older. Exclusion

criteria were: (1) possible sleep apnea
(measured with the SLEEP-50 where the
apnea subscale has a cutoff of . 15; Spoormaker, Verbeek, van den Bout, & Klip,
2005), (2) shift-work, (3) earlier CBT for
insomnia, (4) starting other psychotherapy
in the last six months, (5) alcohol abuse
(more than three glasses of alcohol a day for
at least 21 days a month) or marijuana
abuse (use more than once a week), (6) a
diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, and
(7) current suicidal plans. Of the remaining
76 people, 13 did not complete the
questionnaires or failed to complete their
diary on more than one day (out of seven).
This resulted in a final sample of 63
participants. Baseline characteristics and
descriptive statistics of the sample are
displayed in Tables 1 and 2.


##### Power
This study was originally powered to include
100 participants (a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8
to detect Cohen’s d effect sizes of 0.6 with a
20% dropout). However, due to financial and
practical limitations we were forced to
stop inclusion at 63 participants. Based on
the posttest questionnaire data, in the current
study we now achieved a power of 0.8 for an
effect size of d ¼ 0.65.

##### Materials
Online questionnaires. For online questionnaires, Thorndike et al. (2009) demonstrated
the validity of both single-item and multipleitem presentation per webpage. We used
multiple items per webpage (but never more
than 15 items per webpage).

Insomnia severity was measured with a
Dutch translation of the seven-item ISI. The
ISI is a widely used measure to index changes
in insomnia severity, and favorable psychometric properties are documented (internal
consistency a ¼ 0.78; Bastien, Vallie` res, &
Morin, 2001; Morin, 1993). The total score
ranges from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (severe
insomnia). The internal consistency (Cronbach’s a) in the present study was 0.60 (which
was comparable to the a ¼ 0.61 that was
found in a validation study of the online
version of the ISI; Thorndike et al., 2011).
A cutoff of 10 was previously offered as the
optimal indicator for clinical levels of insomnia in a community sample (Morin et al., 2011)
and was used in this study.
Dysfunctional beliefs were assessed with the
Dutch translation of the 16-item brief Dysfunctional Belief and Attitudes about
Sleep scale—DBAS (Lancee & Kamphuis, in
preparation; Morin, Vallieres, & Ivers, 2007).
The English version of the DBAS shows
adequate internal consistency (a ¼ 0.79; in the
current study: a ¼ 0.81) and was significantly
correlated with self-report measures of insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression. The sum
of the DBAS score is averaged so that the total
score ranges from 0 (no dysfunctional beliefs)
to 10 (severe dysfunctional beliefs).


Sleep safety behaviors were measured with
the Dutch translation of the 32-item SleepRelated Behaviors Questionnaire—SRBQ
(Lancee & Kamphuis, in preparation; Ree &
Harvey, 2004). The total score ranges from 0
(no safety behaviors) to 128 (severe safety
behaviors). The English version showed good
internal consistency (a ¼ 0.92; in the current
study: a ¼ 0.83) and could discriminate
normal sleepers from people with insomnia.
Furthermore, the SRBQ is correlated with
daytime and nighttime complaints of
insomnia.
Depression was measured using a Dutch
translation of the 20-item Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D,
range ¼ 0—no depressive symptoms to 60—
severe depressive symptoms; Bouma et al., 1995;
Radloff, 1977). This scale has good internal
consistency (a ¼ 0.79–0.92), and the validity of
the Dutch scale is comparable to that of the
original version (Bouma et al., 1995; Radloff,
1977). Cronbach’s a was 0.89 in the current
study.
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the
Dutch version of the seven anxiety items of the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS; Spinhoven et al., 1997; Zigmond &
Snaith, 1983). The total score ranges from 0
(no symptoms of anxiety) to 21 (severe


-----

symptoms of anxiety). The reliability of the
HADS is good (a ¼ 0.80–0.84; in the current
study: a ¼ 0.85), as is the test–retest correlation (r ¼ 0.89; p, 0.001).
The SLEEP-50 (Spoormaker et al., 2005) was
used to exclude patients with possible
sleep apnea. The apnea subscale has eight
items (a ¼ 0.51) and the total scale ranges from
8 (no apnea indication) to 32 (severe apnea
indication). A cutoff of $15 is optimal with a
sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.88.
Online sleep diary. We used a Dutch
translation of the consensus sleep diary
(Carney et al., 2012). Participants kept a
sleep diary for seven days and recorded time to
bed, time they tried to go to sleep, time of final
awakening, time out of bed, sleep onset
latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset
(WASO), terminal wakefulness (TWAK),
number of nightly awakenings, sleep quality
(1 ¼ “very bad” to 5 ¼ “very good”), and use
of sleep medication. From these variables, the
time in bed (TIB ¼ final arising time 2 time to
bed), total sleep time (TST ¼ TIB 2 SOL 2 WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE ¼ [TST/
TIB] £ 100) were calculated.

##### Intervention
The online CBT-I treatment protocol that was
administered was based on treatment manuals
for face-to-face CBT-I (e.g., Morin & Espie,
2003; Verbeek & Klip, 2005). This treatment
packaged the following modules: (1) psychoeducation; (2) progressive muscle relaxation; (3)
sleep hygiene; (4) sleep restriction—restricting
TIB to actual sleeping time; and (5) cognitive
exercises—challenging the misconceptions
about sleep. The treatment comprised six
weekly sessions that each covered one or more
modules. The basic treatment sessions spanned
six weeks, but participants who took longer to
complete the treatment (e.g., because of holiday) received feedback up to eight weeks. For a
more elaborate description of the treatment
content, please see Lancee, van den Bout, van
Straten, and Spoormaker (2012).
The online program, first described in a
study of Lancee et al. (2013), features an
integrated diary that gives visual feedback on
participants’ sleep efficiency and total time
spent awake. The online program enables the
provision of feedback on treatment progress
and assigned exercises. In a previous study
(Lancee et al., 2013), motivational feedback


proved to enhance treatment effects
(reminding and motivating are the most
important aspects of the feedback). In the
current study, similar feedback was provided
by master’s students of psychology under
supervision of the first author. On average, the
students spent 56.5 minutes (SD ¼ 31.1) on
giving feedback per participant for the full
online treatment (i.e., all six lessons).

##### Procedure
The participants who met study criteria
completed a questionnaire and received an
online sleep diary, e-mailed to them at 6:00 am
for seven consecutive days. After completing
the diary, participants were randomized to
either online CBT-I or the waiting-list condition. Twelve weeks later, both the CBT-I and
waiting-list group received posttest questionnaires and a sleep diary. After completing the
posttreatment sleep diary, participants in the
waiting-list condition received an online CBT-I
treatment. Participants in the online CBT-I
condition also received three- and six-month
follow-up questionnaires and diaries. The
study was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by the internal
Ethical Review Board of the University of
Amsterdam, and registered at Clinicaltrials.
gov (NCT01955928).


##### Statistical analysis
The effects of the intervention were tested using
multilevel regression analysis. Multilevel
regression analysis is an intention-to-treat
procedure that also allows participants with
only one measurement in the analyses (Hox,
2002). One-way ANOVAs and chi-square tests
showed that participants did not differ on any of
the demographic or outcome variables at baseline (all ps . 0.2). However, participants in the
online condition who did not respond to the
posttest sleep diary had lower average scores on
total sleep time at baseline (284min versus
353min). Therefore, total sleep time was added
as a covariate in the multilevel regression
analyses regarding the pretest–posttest measurements. At the three- and six-month follow-up no
variables were associated with nonresponse. One
outlier was removed from the diary analyses, as
this respondent’s sleep diary scores were below a
z-score of 3.29 (sleep efficiency of this participant
was 6.9% on average).


-----

Because total sleep time was associated with
nonresponse in the CBT-I condition, we used a
multiple imputation procedure based on the
missing at random assumption (Sterne et al.,
2009). We used a monotone predictive mean
matching procedure to generate 10 separate
datasets and insert missing cases on the
questionnaire and diary data. The posttest scores
in Table 2 are the imputed values. To provide a
comprehensive overview and to further show the
possible influence of missing values on our
analyses, we also included a completers analysis.
Within-group Cohen’s ds were calculated on
the imputed and completers data with (Mpre1 2
Mpost1)/spooled. Between-group Cohen’s ds were
calculated on the difference in change scores
divided by the pooled baseline standard deviation of the groups (Morris, 2008). A Cohen’s d
of 0.20 is generally considered small, that of 0.50
moderate, and that of 0.80 large (Cohen, 1988).
A significance level of p, 0.05 (two-sided) was
used throughout our study.
For the mediation analyses we used the
bootstrapping method in the SPSS PROCESS
tool of Hayes (2013). Bootstrapping is a
nonparametrical procedure that produces an
estimate of the sample based on several
resamples. Mediation was tested by evaluating
the 95% confidence interval of the indirect effect.
The above procedure is preferred above the
Sobel’s test since often the sampling of the
indirect effect is non-normally distributed
(Hayes, 2013).
More specifically, we modeled our procedure
after Vincent and Walsh (2013), that is, we used
n ¼ 5000 bootstrap resamples and the pretreat
(a) Group


ment level of the dependent variable (i.e., ISI,
SE, WASO, SQ) was added as a covariate in the
model to predict posttreatment levels of the
dependent variable. In view of the limited
observed power, we performed both single
(using either dysfunctional beliefs or safety
behavior as mediator) and multiple mediation
analyses (including both mediators). Our
procedure differed from Vincent and Walsh
(2013) in that we also added the pretreatment
score of the mediator under investigation as
covariate(s). We also calculated the effect sizes
of the indirect effect with: 1 2 c[0]/c. With this
formula the proportion of the effect of the
independent variable on the dependent variable
that is accounted for by the mediator is
calculated. Possible values lie between 0 and 1
(MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007).
In Figure 2, the mediation model is shown.

#### Results
##### Completion of modules
A module was deemed completed if the last
exercise of this module was saved by the user.
Twenty-seven (75.0%) of the participants in
the CBT-I condition completed an adequate
dose of the intervention (at least four modules;
Lancee et al., 2013) and 17 (47.2%) completed
all sessions of the intervention.

##### Baseline differences and nonresponse
Thirty-three (88.9%) participants in the CBTI condition and 22 (81.5%) in the waiting-list
condition completed the posttest questionnaire. The posttest diary was completed by 25

(69.4%) in the CBT-I condition and by 18
(66.7%) in the waiting-list condition. In the
CBT-I condition, the three- and six-month
questionnaires were completed by 25 (69.4%)
and 21 (58.3%) participants, respectively, and
the three- and six-month diaries by 17 (47.2%)
and 18 (50.0%), respectively.
As mentioned previously, people in the CBTI condition who did not fillout the posttest diary
had a lower score on total sleep time at baseline
(284min versus 353 min). There were no other
statistically significant differences with respect
todemographicorclinicalvariables betweenthe
responders and nonresponders.

##### Efficacy: intention-to-treat analyses
Table 2 displays the imputed mean scores and
correspondingCohen’s d effectsizes.At posttest,
we found significant interaction effects (Time
£ Group) between the CBT-I and waiting-list
condition for the following variables: insomnia


severity (ISI), b ¼ 3.80; SE ¼ 1.50; p ¼ 0.013,
sleep efficiency, b ¼ 2 7.89; SE ¼ 2.92;
p ¼ 0.006, WASO, b ¼ 27.65; SE ¼ 11.21;
p ¼ 0.014, sleep quality, b ¼ 20.41; SE ¼ 0.16;

b ¼ 1.89;SE ¼ 0.42; p, 0.001, safety behaviors
(SBRQ), b ¼ 14.19; SE ¼ 3.83; p, 0.001, and
depressive symptoms, b ¼ 5.25; SE ¼ 2.03;
p ¼ 0.010. These effects indicate that CBT-I is
more effective than the waiting-list condition.
The effects in the CBT-I condition were
maintained or improved at three- and sixmonth follow-ups. The improvements between
posttest and six-month follow-up were most
notable for insomnia severity, anxiety, and
depressive symptoms (Table 3).
There was a trend toward a significant
interaction effect for total sleep time,
b ¼ 2 24.19; SE ¼ 13.57; p ¼ 0.075, and
anxiety symptoms, b ¼ 1.86; SE ¼ 0.98;

##### Efficacy: treatment and study completers only
Completers analyses only included individuals
who completed an adequate dose of the online
treatment (at least four sessions) and filled out
the posttest diary or questionnaire. Table 4
displays the mean scores of the completers and
corresponding Cohen’s d effect sizes (Supplemental Table S1 displays the completers’
follow-up data). Again, we observed significant interaction effects (Time £ Group) for
the following variables: insomnia severity
(ISI), b ¼ 4.60; SE ¼ 1.66; p ¼ 0.005,
sleep efficiency, b ¼ 2 7.57; SE ¼ 3.39; p ¼

b ¼ 6.39; SE ¼ 2.14; p ¼ 0.002, and anxiety
symptoms, b ¼ 2.46; SE ¼ 1.03; p ¼ 0.016.
As before, these results indicate that CBT-I
is more effective than the waiting-list
condition.


Now there was trend toward a significant
interaction effect on number of nightly
awakenings, b ¼ 0.63; SE ¼ 0.38; p ¼ 0.097.
The following variables showed no significant
interaction effect: total sleep time,
b ¼ 2 17.13; SE ¼ 16.44; p ¼ 0.298, SOL,
b ¼ 9.39; SE ¼ 8.05; p ¼ 0.244, TWAK,
b ¼ 6.34; SE ¼ 11.18; p ¼ 0.571.

##### Clinical significant change
At baseline, all participants had clinical levels
of insomnia based on the ISI (cutoff $ 10)
(Morin et al., 2011). Of the participants that
completed the posttest, 12 (37.5%) scored
below the cutoff in the CBT-I condition and 3
(13.6%) in the waiting-list condition. The
proportions of the two conditions attaining
scores below the cutoff were not significantly
different, x[2] [1] ¼ 3.70; p ¼ 0.14. On the
follow-ups, 13 (52.0%; three-month) and 12
participants (57.1%; six-month) scored below
cutoff in the CBT-I condition.
A change of eight or more on the ISI is
considered a clinical meaningful change in
insomnia severity (Morin et al., 2011). Of the
participants that completed the posttest, a
trend emerged showing that CBT-I participants were more likely to achieve a meaningful
change in insomnia with 13 participants
(40.6%) meeting criteria for meaningful
change in the CBT-I condition, and 4

(18.2%) in the waiting-list condition
(x [2][1] ¼ 3.04; p ¼ 0.07). At the followup assessments, 11 (44.0%; three-month) and
10 participants (47.6%; six-month) achieved a
clinical meaningful change in the CBT-I
condition, respectively.

##### Medication and use of other treatment during the trial
Of the participants that completed the
posttest, 10 (31.2%) used prescribed
sleep medication and also 10 (45.5%) in the
waiting-list condition. These proportions were
not significantly different, x [2][1] ¼ 1.13;
p ¼ 0.39.
During the trial, alternative treatment was
sought by six (18.8%) participants in the CBTI condition (n ¼ 1, sleep medication; n ¼ 2,


general practitioner; n ¼ 1, sleep center, n ¼ 1,
acupuncture, n ¼ 1, physical therapy) and
eight participants (29.6%) in the waiting list
(n ¼ 4, sleep medication; n ¼ 1, self-help via
smartphone app; n ¼ 1 general practitioner;
n ¼ 1 psychologist; n ¼ 1, tai-chi).

##### Deterioration and adverse events
In line with the consensus statement on
negative effects of Internet interventions
(Rozental et al., 2014), we report the participants that deteriorated at posttest. In the CBTI group 3 (9.3%) participants deteriorated on
the ISI and in the waiting-list group 7 (31.8%).
None of the deteriorations were clinical meaningful (change ISI $ 8). Furthermore, no
patients reported adverse events; however, we
only asked the people that dropped out from


-----

the study if they had experienced such events
during therapy.

##### Mediation analysis
We conducted mediation analyses for the
dependent sleep variables that showed a
significant interaction effect (Time £ Group)
at posttest (i.e., insomnia severity,
sleep efficiency, WASO, sleep quality). Dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors were
the mediator variables in two separate
analyses (please see Supplemental Table S2
for the zero-order correlations).
As can be seen in Table 5, dysfunctional
beliefs (proportion of the effect explained
by the mediation 94%) and safety behaviors (92%) mediated the treatment effects
of CBT-I on insomnia severity (ISI), as well
as on sleep efficiency (proportion explained
respectively 45% and 41%). No mediation
effects were found on WASO or on
sleep quality. Mediation effect size estimates are based on MacKinnon et al.
(2007).
For insomnia severity and sleep efficiency we
also conducted joint meditational analyses,
including both potential mediators in a single
model (Table 5). Dysfunctional beliefs,
b ¼ 23.67, 95% BI [29.12, 0.16] and safety
behaviors, b ¼ 21.57, 95% BI [26.96, 2.31],
were not significant mediators on sleep efficiency
in this model. However, together they mediated
the effect, b ¼ 25.25, 95% BI [212.03, 20.72],
proportion explained: 54%. For insomnia
severity, the total mediation effect, b ¼ 4.43,
95% BI [2.08, 7.03], proportion explained 80%,
was carried by safety behaviors, b ¼ 3.06, 95%
BI [1.18, 5.80], and not by dysfunctional beliefs,
b ¼ 1.37, 95% BI [20.42, 3.86].

#### Discussion


A first aim of the present study was to test
whether online CBT-I was effective in treating
insomnia. We found that online CBT-I
showed moderate to large statistically significant effects on insomnia severity,
sleep efficiency, sleep quality, anxiety, and
depression scores compared to a waiting list.
Moreover, this CBT-I treatment format also
ameliorated dysfunctional beliefs and
sleep safety behaviors. After treatment,
40.6% of the participants in the CBT-I
condition achieved a clinical meaningful


change on the ISI against 18.2% in the
waiting-list condition. The effects of online
CBT-I were maintained at the three- and sixmonth follow-up.
A second aim was to test the extent to which
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors
might mediate the effects of CBT-I on
insomnia severity and sleep diary measures.
The singular mediator analyses indicated that
both dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors mediated the effect of CBT-I on
insomnia severity (ISI) and sleep efficiency,
but not WASO and sleep quality.
The observed treatment outcomes are in line
with previous studies on online treatment of
insomnia (Cheng & Dizon, 2012; Ho et al.,
2014; van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009). However,
the effects appeared somewhat smaller than
effects in a couple of recent studies (Espie,
Kyle, Williams, et al., 2012; Lancee et al.,
2012; Ritterband et al., 2009; van Straten
et al., 2014), as well as in a recent study using
the same treatment program (e.g., posttest
within-group Cohen’s d on insomnia severity
of 1.6 versus 1.2; Lancee et al., 2013).
A possible explanation could be that in the
current study feedback was provided by
master’s students of psychology instead of by
an insomnia expert such as in a previous
investigation (Lancee et al., 2013). However,
in another similar study (van Straten et al.,
2014) large results were acquired with studentbased feedback. Furthermore, no significant
interaction effects were observed for total
sleep time, number of nightly awakenings,
TWAK, and SOL, possibly due to power
issues. In addition, the proportion achieving a
clinical meaningful change (18%) in the
waiting list was rather high, conceivable as a
consequence of the high percentage (30%)
seeking other treatment during the trial.
Our mediation analyses provided additional
support for the hypothesis that change in
dysfunctional beliefs and safety behaviors
explains CBT-I’s treatment effects. As such,
they fall in line with findings observed by
several authors regarding dysfunctional beliefs
(Edinger et al., 2001; Espie et al., 2001; Harvey
et al., 2007; Jansson-Frojmark & Linton,
2008; Morin et al., 2002) and safety behaviors
(Espie et al., 2014; Harvey et al., 2007;
Jernelov et al., 2012). They are in contrast to
the null findings on insomnia severity reported
by Okajima et al. (2014) and on


-----

-----

sleep efficiency reported by Espie et al. (2014).
When testing the joint model, i.e., when
including both dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors into the mediation analyses, only
safety behaviors remained a significant
mediator for insomnia severity.
These findings underscore the importance
of paying attention to safety behaviors in
insomnia treatment. To challenge these safety
behaviors, Harvey and Eidelman (2011)
advocated the use of behavioral experiments.
They described several useful experiments,
such as the use of clock-watching at night.
In this exercise, patients are asked to act as
usual for the first three nights (i.e., watching
their clock when they are awake). In the
subsequent three nights, they are asked to
refrain from their clock-watching. Before
conducting the experiment patients write
down their predictions and afterwards the
outcomes are discussed. These experiments
help the patients to understand that the safety
behavior and underlying beliefs are not helpful
and, in most cases, fuel insomnia. Since our
data point toward the importance of these
safety behaviors we think further investigation
of such behavioral experiments is warranted.
Some limitations need to be acknowledged
when appraising the present findings. We used
a pre–post change score for the mediator
variables (dysfunctional beliefs/safety behavior). Arguably, our argument would be less
theoretical if the mediators were measured at a
separate time-point that succeeded the independent variable (group) and preceded the
dependent variable (i.e., ISI). Furthermore,
with the present level of power (i.e., a 0.8
probability to detect an effect size of 0.65), no
significant treatment effects were detected for
SOL, TWAK, or total sleep time.
We therefore did not conduct mediation
analyses for these variables. Future studies
on CBT-I may include more participants to
allow for mediational analyses on these diary
sleep variables. Likewise, the predominance of
the meditational potency of safety behaviors
over dysfunctional belief needs to be crossvalidated in future studies.
Other methodological limitations of this
study were that we did not include objective
measurements (e.g., polysomnography), that
insomnia was not diagnosed by a clinician,
and that we had a self-selected sample of
people interested in an online treatment study.


On the other hand, we note that subjective
measurements (i.e., diaries) are the standard
outcome measures in most treatments trials
(Buysse, Ancoli-Israel, Edinger, Lichstein, &
Morin, 2006), and we believe that the
inclusion of objective measurements and/or
clinician-based diagnoses would have weakened the ecological validity of the online
design. Furthermore, we made an effort to use
the best possible online selection criteria by
using DSM-5 insomnia criteria in addition to
a score of 10 on the ISI (Morin et al., 2011).
Likewise, one could argue that the present
sample was a self-selected set of individuals
who were online and interested in treatment.
Again, this may be the case, but this likely
reflects the potential users of these treatment
formats.
Also, this trial suffered from some dropout.
We had 11–19% missing data in the posttest
questionnaire and 31–33% in the diary. These
missing data may have influenced the results
because participants in the CBT-I condition
with low total sleep time scores dropped out
more often from the posttest measurements.
Our multilevel and multiple imputation intention-to-treat analyses mitigate these concerns
somewhat (Hox, 2002; Sterne et al., 2009).
However, from a clinical viewpoint, it is
particularly important that individuals with
the most severe insomnia do complete the
treatment. This may be particularly important
for total sleep time since insomniacs that
sleep the fewest hours have a higher risk for
hypertension (Vgontzas, Liao, Bixler, Chrousos, & Vela-Bueno, 2009). Limiting these
dropouts in the future is therefore of major
importance.
Finally, as these mediation analyses were
performed in an online treatment study, we
cannot be sure that our findings generalize to
face-to-face therapy. These concerns are
mitigated by the fact that both types of
treatment use the same protocol, it is likely
that the treatments achieve their effects in a
similar manner.
Taken together, this study contributes to
the now substantial evidence for the efficacy
of online CBT for insomnia. Future studies
may compare online CBT-I to active treatments, including face-to-face treatments, and
focus more on the mechanisms of change.
Indeed, we hold that the main contribution of
this paper lies in the identification of two


-----

potential mediating factors of treatment
effectiveness: dysfunctional beliefs and safety
behaviors. As a primary candidate variable
deserving more attention, we would like to
nominate the (fading out of the) use of safety
behaviors.
