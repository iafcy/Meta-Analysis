### Summary
**Background Sleep difficulties might be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of mental health problems. If**
**this is true, improving sleep should benefit psychological health. We aimed to determine whether treating insomnia**
**leads to a reduction in paranoia and hallucinations.**

**Methods We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial (OASIS) at 26 UK universities. University students with**
**insomnia were randomly assigned (1:1) with simple randomisation to receive digital cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)**
**for insomnia or usual care, and the research team were masked to the treatment. Online assessments took place at**
**weeks 0, 3, 10 (end of therapy), and 22. The primary outcome measures were for insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinatory**
**experiences. We did intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61272251.**

**Findings Between March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for**
**insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864). Compared with usual practice, the sleep intervention at 10 weeks**
**reduced insomnia (adjusted difference 4·78, 95% CI 4·29 to 5·26, Cohen’s d=1·11; p<0·0001), paranoia (–2·22,**
**–2·98 to –1·45, Cohen’s d=0·19; p<0·0001), and hallucinations (–1·58, –1·98 to –1·18, Cohen’s d=0·24; p<0·0001).**
**Insomnia was a mediator of change in paranoia and hallucinations. No adverse events were reported.**

**Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a**
**mental health problem.** **It provides strong evidence that insomnia is a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic**
**experiences and other mental health problems. Whether the results generalise beyond a student population requires**
**testing. The treatment of disrupted sleep might require a higher priority in mental health provision.**

### Introduction
Sleep problems are a common occurrence in patients
with mental health disorders. The traditional view is that
disrupted sleep is a symptom, consequence, or nonspecific epiphenomenon of the disorders; the clinical
result is that the treatment of sleep problems is given a
low priority. An alternative perspective is that disturbed
sleep is a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of
many mental health disorders.[1] An escalating cycle then
emerges between the distress of the mental health
symptoms, effect on daytime functioning, and struggles
in gaining restorative sleep. From this alternative
perspective, the treatment of sleep problems attains a
higher clinical importance. We are particularly interested
in the putative causal association between disturbed sleep
and psychotic experiences.[2,3] The interventionist–causal
model approach to establishment of a causal association
is to manipulate the hypothesised mechanistic variable
and observe the effect on the outcome of interest;[4] if
a causal association exists then the outcome variable
should alter The effects of the manipulation can then be


substantiated further by use of mediation analysis.[5,6] In
the present study, we aimed to improve sleep in
individuals with insomnia to determine the effect on
psychotic experiences. This approach therefore informs
both theoretical understanding and clinical practice.
The most common form of sleep disruption is insomnia,
comprising sustained difficulties in initiating or staying
asleep, or both, which cause problems during the day. The
association of insomnia with psychotic experiences in the
general population has been established.[3] There are
multiple, independent, psychotic experiences. Each
psychotic experience exists on a spectrum of severity in
the general population with differing heritability and
differing strength of association with insomnia.[7] Paranoia
and hallucinations have the strongest links with
insomnia.[2,7,8] However, the effect of altering the amount of
sleep disruption—eg, by targeted sleep treatment—on
these psychotic experiences remains to be established.
Clinical guidelines recommend the use of cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment for
insomnia [9] Digital forms of CBT for insomnia that require

no therapist to be present have been shown to be
efficacious as well.[10–12] In patients with current delusions
and hallucinations, results of our pilot randomised
controlled trial[13] have shown that insomnia can be
substantially reduced with CBT, but the trial was
underpowered to establish with sufficient precision the
consequences for psychotic experiences. Therefore, we
undertook a clinical trial that was large enough to
definitively test the causal association between insomnia
and self-reported psychotic experiences.
To test thousands of individuals, we did an online study
using digital CBT for insomnia treatment. A participant
pool (university students) was selected that would be easily
reachable (since we would have access to large email lists)
and at an age when mental health disorders emerge. We
have previously shown in a student population that sleep
problems are associated with elevated levels of paranoia,
hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and manic symptoms.[8]
Our main aim required a comparison between the
effects of a reduction in insomnia (in a group receiving
recommended treatment) and continued sleep disruption
(in a group receiving usual care, which is likely to mean
receiving little or no treatment). Clear change in sleep in
one group relative to another was required to test the
mechanistic hypothesis. We were not investigating the
intervention elements that might lead to change. Our
primary aim was to find out whether CBT for insomnia,
compared with a usual practice control group, reduced
insomnia and reduced paranoia and hallucinations by the
end of treatment, and whether the changes in insomnia
mediated the changes in psychotic experiences. We also
aimed to determine the potential effects of sleep
improvement on a wider range of mental health outcomes


**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
If insomnia is a contributory cause of psychotic experiences, then
the key test is whether improving sleep will lead to a reduction in
psychotic experiences. We therefore searched for randomised
controlled studies that set out to reduce insomnia and examine
the effects on psychotic experiences. On June 23, 2017, we
searched the entire archive (ie, using no date restrictions) of
PubMed for: (Sleep OR Insomnia) AND (Delus* OR Hallucinat* OR
Psychosis OR Psychotic OR Schizophren*) AND (CBT OR hypnotic
OR medication) AND (Random* OR RCT). 130 papers were
identified and only two were randomised controlled trials that
tested the effects of sleep treatment on psychotic experiences,
with the larger of the trials being our own with 50 patients with
schizophrenia or related disorders. These trials were
underpowered to determine with any precision the potential link
between insomnia and psychotic experiences.

**Added value of this study**
We undertook what might be the largest randomised
controlled trial to date of a psychological treatment. It is the


first study adequately powered to determine the effects of
treating sleep dysfunction on psychotic experiences. It shows
very clearly that treatment of insomnia in students leads to a
reduction in psychotic experiences. A mediation analysis
supports this interpretation. Furthermore, the trial is
consistent with a small number of other randomised
controlled trials that indicate multiple other benefits for
mental health when treating sleep problems.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Sleep disruption might have a contributory causal role in the
occurrence of psychotic experiences and a wide range of other
mental health problems. Adequately powered tests in other
populations would be helpful, but research indicating that the
treatment of disrupted sleep requires a higher priority in
mental health provision is accumulating.


in this general population group. Our secondary aims
were to investigate whether digital CBT for insomnia,
compared with usual practice, reduced depression, anxiety,
nightmares, and mania; improved psychological wellbeing;
and led to the occurrence of fewer mental health disorders.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial
(OASIS; Oxford Access for Students Improving Sleep) of
digital CBT versus treatment as usual (usual practice).
Screening, informed consent, assessments, allocation to
condition, and the delivery of the intervention were
carried out online using an automated system, a specially
configured instance of True Colours, which is a system
for the scheduled collection of outcome measures.[14]
Participants in the control group were given access to the
sleep intervention after their final assessment. The study
received overall ethical approval from the University
of Oxford Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional Ethics
Committee and then local approvals at the other
participating universities. The OASIS trial protocol has
been published.[15]

Participants were eligible if they were attending
university; had a positive screen for insomnia, as indicated
by a score of 16 or lower on the Sleep Condition Indicator
(SCI);[16] and were 18 years or older. We had no exclusion
criteria. 26 UK universities took part (appendix 1),
ensuring a range in geographical locations and academic
ability. The principal method of recruitment was sending
a circular email within universities that contained a link to
the web-based screening. When a circular email was not
possible recruitment was via advertisment on websites


-----

and displaying posters, or both. Recruitment began on
March 5, 2015, and ended on Feb 17, 2016. We collected
the final data on July 28, 2016.

#### Randomisation and masking
As recommended for large clinical trials,[17] we used
simple randomisation (1:1) with an automated online
system, ensuring that the research team was unable to
affect randomisation. Participants completed all the
assessments independently online and therefore their
responses could not be affected by the trial team.

#### Procedures
Assessments took place at weeks 0 (baseline), 3, 10 (end of
therapy), and 22. The week 3 assessment comprised only
the primary outcome measures. The week 3 assessment
was carried out to assess in the mediation analyses the
temporal order of changes. Participants received an email
prompt to complete the assessments online. The order of
the assessments was consistent across timepoints. If
participants did not complete the assessment, then they
received up to two email reminders 2 days apart.
The CBT for insomnia intervention is called Sleepio.[11,18]
It is provided in six sessions, lasting an average of 20 min
each. Sessions are unlocked weekly, although participants
can move at a slower pace. The full programme is
accessible via any web browser and all participants start
the programme online. Certain tools (eg, sleep diaries
and relaxation audios) could also be accessed using the
web browser of a smartphone. All of the sessions, sleep
diaries, relaxation audios, and the scheduling tool could
be accessed with an iPhone. Completion of an initial
assessment drives the algorithms that personalise the
programme. For example, the assessment leads to a
tailored choice of treatment goal, with progress then
reviewed at each subsequent session. The treatment
includes behavioural, cognitive, and educational com­
ponents. The behavioural techniques include sleep
restriction (ie, reducing the sleep window to enhance
sleep consolidation), stimulus control (eg, getting out of
bed after 15–20 min of wakefulness), and relaxation
(eg, tensing and relaxing muscles when in bed). The
cognitive techniques include paradoxical intention
(eg, trying to stay awake), belief restructuring (eg, targeting
unrealistic expectations about sleep), mindfulness
(eg, acknowledging thoughts and feelings without
dwelling on them), imagery (eg, generating positive
mental images), and putting the day to rest (eg, setting
time aside to reflect on the day). The educational
component covers information about the processes of
sleep and sleep hygiene. The programme is interactive,
and content is presented by an animated therapist.
Participants make a time for the session and are prompted
via email or text message via a short message service if
they do not attend. Participants complete daily sleep
diaries throughout the intervention, which are used by
the programme to tailor the advice Sleep restriction is


introduced in the third session of the course. The
animated therapist proposes a new sleep window, which
is calculated from the sleep diary data, and engages with
the participant to help them select the timing of the
window (eg, earlier versus later in the night). A more
lenient sleep window is used for those individuals
reporting substantial physical problems, other mental
health problems, or moderate-to-severe sleepiness. The
sleep window is regularly reviewed at each session after it
has been introduced. If the sleep diary data indicate a
sleep efficiency of 90% or higher, the animated therapist
advises that 15 min is added to the sleep window.
Throughout the course of therapy, participants had access
to a moderated online community and an online library
of information about sleep. Participants could also view
their online case file, which included four sections: a
progress review, a reminder of strategies, an agreed sleep
schedule, and a list of further reading. Usual practice
(treatment as usual) referred to the current care that the
participants were receiving. The amount of treatment
input was likely to be minimal, with prescription of
medication for a small proportion. We did not attempt to
alter the current care that participants received.

#### Outcomes
The primary outcomes were insomnia, paranoia, and
hallucinatory experiences. The primary measure for
insomnia was the SCI-8.[16] This score is an 8-item
measure, validated against DSM-5 criteria, assessing
sleep and its impact on daytime functioning over the past
week. Scores can range from 0 to 32 with higher scores
indicating better sleep. A clinical cutoff of less than
17 correctly identifies 89% of individuals with probable
insomnia disorder. We used a version of the SCI that
included one additional question, as a secondary outcome,
regarding early morning waking. The internal consistency
(Cronbach’s α at baseline) of the scale in the present study
was 0·63.
Paranoia was assessed with the Green et al Paranoid
Thought Scales (GPTS), part B.[19] This scale assesses
persecutory ideation, and the timeframe used was the
past fortnight. The scale comprises 16 items, each rated
on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (totally) scale. High scores indicate
higher levels of paranoia. The internal consistency of the
scale in the present study was 0·94.
The measure for hallucinations was the Specific
Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire—Hallucinations
subscale.[20] The scale comprises nine items rated on a
0 (not at all) to 5 (more than once per day) scale. The
timeframe was the past fortnight. Higher scores indicate
greater occurrences of hallucinatory experiences. The
internal consistency of the scale in the present study
was 0·93.
The secondary outcome measures for sleep were the
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI;[21] Cronbach’s α in the
present study=0·67) and the Disturbing Dreams and
Nightmare Severity Index[22] (Cronbach’s α in the present

collected at repeated timepoints,[30] and in this trial
included outcome data at weeks 3, 10, and 22 available
for all participants who had been randomly assigned.
The method has the advantage of implicitly accounting
for data missing at random. The estimated (adjusted)
treatment differences from these analyses are therefore
reported. The linear mixed effects models included the
outcome as the response variable, timepoint, randomised
group, and baseline score as fixed effects and random
effects were estimated for students nested within
universities. A student is located within one university,
and so to estimate the random intercepts, we accounted
for random variation between universities and between
students within the same university. We modelled an
interaction between time and randomised group as a
fixed effect to allow estimation of treatment effect at all
three timepoints. Sex and course level were included as
covariates in the model. We used an unstructured
variance–covariance matrix to model the within-subject
error correlation structure. Results are presented as
mean adjusted differences in scores between the
randomised groups, with 95% CIs and associated twosided p values. We confirmed the normality assumption
of the residuals for each outcome. No deviations from
normality were apparent and therefore maximum
likelihood estimates were reported. We did sensitivity
analyses (pattern mixture models, inclusion of baseline
covariates predictive of missing data, and imputation) for
the three main outcomes, examining the robustness of
the results to different assumptions regarding missing
data. We calculated standardised effect sizes with
Cohen’s d, dividing the treatment effect by the shared SD
at baseline. We used similar logistic mixed effects models
for the secondary binary outcomes.
To test the mediation hypotheses, we determined the
extent of mediation of the week 3 and week 10 insomnia
scores on the week 10 paranoia and hallucination
outcomes. The approach used was similar to the method
of Baron and Kenny,[5,31] but made use of linear mixed
effects models at each step. The approach involved four
steps and three separate model fits. In two separate linear
mixed effects models, the intervention was shown to be
correlated with the outcome and then with the mediator.
We then fitted the data to a third model with the outcome
as the response and both the intervention and mediator
as covariates. The parameters were extracted as per Baron
and Kenny[31] to obtain the total, direct, and indirect effects,
and finally the percentage mediation was determined. In
all models, we included baseline amounts of both the
outcome and mediator as covariates. This method is
similar to the mediation analysis in the study by Freeman
and colleagues,[32] but made use of linear mixed effects
models to account for repeated measurements, rather
than through structural equation modelling. We used
STATA version 14.1 for the statistical analysis.

study=0·91). The secondary outcome measure for
psychotic experiences was the 16-item version of the
Prodromal Questionnaire[23] (Cronbach’s α in the present
study=0·79). A score of 6 or more has 87% specificity and
87% sensitivity to correctly classify ultra-high risk for
psychosis mental states in a help-seeking sample.
The measures to assess affective symptoms were the
Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item version[24] (PHQ-9;
Cronbach’s α in the present study=0·85), the Generalised
Anxiety Disorder 7-item version[25] (GAD-7; Cronbach’s α
in the present study=0·89), and the Altman Mania Scale[26]
(Cronbach’s α in the present study=0·64). Psychological
wellbeing was assessed with the Warwick–Edinburgh
Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS;[27] Cronbach’s α in
the present study=0·89), and the Work and Social
Adjustment Scale (WSAS;[28] Cronbach’s α in the present
study=0·83).
To assess the development of mental health disorders,
we used established cutoffs on the Prodromal
Questionnaire,[23] Altman Mania Scale,[26] PHQ,[24] and
GAD-7.[25] Participants were also asked at each assessment
timepoint whether they were in contact with mental
health services, had received a mental health diagnosis,
took medication for a mental health problem, or were
currently receiving any other psychological therapy.
If the trial team were informed of the occurrence of a
serious adverse event for a trial participant, then this was
recorded. Serious adverse events were defined as deaths,
suicide attempts, serious violent incidents, admissions to
secure units, and formal complaints about the online
intervention.

#### Statistical analysis
We calculated the sample size on the basis of change in
paranoia (one of the two psychotic symptoms studied),
since following this intervention change would be
expected to be lower in psychotic experiences than in
insomnia. Based on the SDs observed from a previous
study[29] for the GPTS (SD 10·4), a total sample size of 2614
participants (ie, 1307 per group) would provide 90% power
to detect a small effect size in paranoia, with a
standardised mean difference of 0·15, while accounting
for a high amount of expected attrition (40%). In a study
amendment, the sample size was increased because of a
higher than initially expected dropout rate.
An outline of the analysis strategy was provided in the
published trial protocol[15] and a full statistical analysis
plan was agreed before the trial analysis (appendix 2). All
the analyses were validated by a second statistician.
Analyses were by intention to treat and were carried out
at the end of the last follow-up assessment (with no
interim analyses). We analysed each continuous outcome
with a linear mixed effects regression model to account
for the repeated measures over time, and we analysed
binary outcomes with a logistic mixed effects model.
Mixed effects models are the recommended statistical
technique for analysing clinical trials when outcomes are

### Results
Between March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly
assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for
insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864; figure).
The sample was predominately female, studying for
their first university degree, and two-thirds were of
white British ethnicity (table 1). Around a fifth of the
participants were in contact with mental health services
(table 1). The two randomised groups were well matched
at baseline (table 1).
Appendix 1 has the full details of the sample, missing
data patterns, sensitivity analyses, and all other analyses.
The dropout from the study assessments was high (50%)
during the course of the study, and was greater in the
treatment group than in the control group, with this figure
and pattern almost identical to the most comparable
previous study.[12] The baseline scores for the three primary
outcomes (insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinations) were
not associated with later missingness (appendix 1).
Compared with participants who remained in the study,
participants who dropped out from both groups were
younger in age and more likely to be male (appendix 1).
For the secondary measures, ISI, PHQ-9, Altman Mania
Scale, and WSAS scores were slightly higher, and the
WEMWBS score was slightly lower, in the missing groups
than the non-missing groups (appendix 1).
Treatment uptake was relatively low. In the intervention
group, 1302 participants (69%) logged on for at least one
treatment session, 953 (50%) accessed at least two sessions,
672 (36%) accessed at least three sessions, 497 (26%)
accessed at least four sessions, 390 (21%) accessed at least
five sessions, and 331 (18%) accessed six sessions (figure).
Regarding the primary measures, the sleep treatment
was associated with significant reductions, at all
timepoints, in insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinations
compared with the control group (all p<0·0001; table 2).
The reduction in insomnia after treatment was large,
while the reduction in psychotic experiences was small
(table 2). After treatment, 454 (62%) of 733 individuals in
the treatment group and 326 (29%) of 1142 individuals in
the control group scored outside the clinical cutoff for
insomnia used for trial entry. The treatment differences
were robust to the three different types of sensitivity
analyses for missing data (appendix 1). A conservative
imputation (given the general improvement in scores in
both groups) of missing data was used, whereby the last
available measurement for a participant was imputed for
all further missing measurements of that participant. All
three primary outcome differences remained significant
with last observation carried forward imputations


(appendix 1). Treatment differences also remained
consistent with the primary analysis when we repeated
the main analyses covarying for baseline variables that
predicted missingness for each outcome. We also used
pattern mixture models. Treatment differences would
still be significant assuming the missing individuals in
the treatment group had outcome scores 2 points worse
for insomnia and paranoia, and 1 point worse for
hallucinations (predictably the hallucination scale scores
were much lower than for the other two outcome
variables; appendix 1).
For the mediation analyses, change in sleep over
3 weeks explained 30% of the intervention effect on
paranoia at 10 weeks, with change in sleep over 10 weeks
accounting for 58% of the treatment effect on paranoia
(table 3). Change in sleep over 3 weeks explained 21% of
the intervention effect on hallucinations at 10 weeks,
with change in sleep over 10 weeks accounting for 39% of
the intervention effect on hallucinations. Hence early
changes in sleep explain approximately half of the total
sleep-mediated changes in psychotic experiences by the
end of treatment. In comparison, parallel analyses in the
opposite direction indicated that changes in psychotic

experiences explained a much smaller percentage of
variation in improvements in sleep. Specifically, when
paranoia and hallucination outcomes at 3 weeks were set
as the mediators and the sleep outcome at 10 weeks
as the main outcome paranoia symptoms mediated


just 3·8% of change in sleep and hallucinations mediated
3·4% of change in sleep. These outcomes lend further
support to the causal pathway hypothesis proposed in
this study.
The large improvement in insomnia is confirmed with
the ISI assessment (table 4). The sleep treatment also led
to improvements in depression and improvements in


-----

anxiety, prodromal symptoms, nightmares, psychological
wellbeing, and functioning, and all these improvements
were maintained over time (tables 4, 5). Those participants
randomised to the sleep treatment were also less likely to
meet criteria over the course of the trial for a depressive
episode, anxiety disorder, or ultra-high risk of psychosis
(table 5). However, contact with mental health services
did not differ between groups (table 5). Furthermore, the
sleep treatment led to a small, sustained increase in
symptoms of mania (table 5). With the sleep treatment, a
greater risk also existed of meeting criteria for a manic
episode (table 5). No adverse events were reported to
the trial team.

### Discussion
We aimed to investigate the effects on mental health of
the reduction of sleep difficulties. The first necessary
stage was for the intervention to reduce insomnia, which
was achieved. A large effect size reduction was found
with the digital CBT intervention in a large student
population. But we designed the trial to establish the
consequent effects on psychotic experiences. To our
knowledge the OASIS trial is the largest randomised


controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a
mental health problem. Students randomly assigned to
the sleep intervention showed small, sustained reductions
in paranoia and hallucinations, suggesting that disrupted
sleep has a contributory causal role in the occurrence of
these psychotic experiences in a specific population of
young adults. The mediation analyses supported this
interpretation—eg, improvements in sleep accounted for
almost 60% of the change in paranoia after treatment.
Insomnia might not be the largest cause of psychotic
experiences but it is not an epiphenomenon. Hence, this
study adds to our understanding of the causes of psychotic
experiences and might indicate a promising route into
the early treatment of some psychotic problems.
The focus on a sleep intervention in a young adult
population is important. Young people with incipient
disorders might be very reluctant to seek help for
psychiatric problems. Trouble sleeping is a common
complaint with little stigma. Hence, it provides a much
more acceptable focus for a first step in a care pathway.
The digital sleep treatment gave added benefits.
Depression in particular, but also anxiety, psychological
wellbeing nightmares and perceived functioning all


-----

improved. The effects on anxiety and depression are
consistent with the results of a meta-analysis.[33]
Participants who received the sleep treatment in the trial
were less likely to report symptoms at a level that met
criteria for ultra-high risk of psychosis, depression, or
anxiety disorder. At baseline, the frequency of positive
screens for psychosis risk with the Prodromal
Questionnaire was high, similar to the risk found with
this questionnaire for adolescents referred to treatment
services;[34] this high rate will reflect the well established
associations of sleep difficulties with psychotic
experiences[2,3,7,8] (ie, that participants have been selected
for insomnia and therefore will score higher on psychosis
measures), and also the limitations of brief self-report
questionnaires for assessing psychosis risk. However, in
the trial, sleep treatment did not affect contact with
mental health services. Most participants were not in
contact with these services so a longer follow-up period


might be needed to truly test such effects. Furthermore,
manic symptoms associated with the sleep treatment
increased. This outcome might be due to an actual
increase in problematic manic symptoms or it might
simply reflect the overall increase in psychological
wellbeing in the sample since the questionnaire domains
concern cheerfulness, self-confidence, reduced need for
sleep, increase in amount of activity, and talkativeness.
The Altman scale has been found to correlate poorly with
self-ratings of elation.[35]

Are the study results generalisable beyond a student
population? We consider that the results are likely to
apply to the wider adult population. We used a treatment
developed for adults, which was not modified for
students. The large treatment reduction in insomnia for
the students is very similar to that found in trials with
general adult populations,[10,11,36] while previous studies[36,37]
with community samples have shown self-help sleep
treatment to reduce anxiety and depression. Nonetheless,
only a direct comparison in a trial can definitively


-----

determine the generalisablilty of our findings. Although
not the primary objective of the study, the trial does
indicate that the provision of internet-delivered CBT for
insomnia to university students is likely to lead to
reductions overall in insomnia, and smaller reductions in
a number of other mental health symptoms, with benefits
for positive psychological wellbeing too. Tailoring of the
intervention specifically for this population could enhance
engagement and outcome effects. Support to complete
the intervention might well be helpful too.
Several limitations exist in the study. First, the study
relied on self-report questionnaires, albeit validated in
their development against clinical interviews. Similar
change captured in rater-assessed measures would have
strengthened confidence in the study results. Second,
the samples tested were predominately in the nonclinical range of psychotic experiences, restricting the
conclusions to the less severe end of the psychosis
spectrum. Third, the participants were self-selecting in
responding to the invitation, which will have affected the
representativeness of the sample. However, access to the
study was via an Internet webpage, which is a simpler
process than obtaining treatment from clinical services.
The whole study could be completed in the privacy of the
home, which means that far fewer barriers existed to
participation than conventional patient trials. Fourth, the
extent to which the results will generalise to the rest of
the population is not known. Even within the student
population, we do not know the representativeness of the
participants. Fifth, bias in the outcome results will have
been introduced because of the high dropout rate,
especially in the treatment group, which is similar to
comparable online studies.[12] The results did remain
robust against conservative assumptions in the sensitivity
analyses about those participants who dropped out, but it
is notable that treatment effects were greater for those
participants who completed the sleep treatment. Finally,
the causal argument rests on the plausible assumption
that the sleep treatment first changes the occurrence of
insomnia, since that was the topic of the intervention,
but the mediation analyses in this trial based on week 10
outcomes cannot fully capture the temporal order of
changes or rule out reverse causation. We were able to
show a significant amount of mediation based on the
week 3 insomnia score as a mediator, while evidence for
reverse causation was weak, which does follow the
predicted temporal causal pathway. In reality, it is difficult
in a clinical trial to capture potential temporal changes
between mediator and outcomes, since improvements in
paranoia and hallucinations are likely to closely parallel
the improvement in sleep.
This work can be taken forward in several possible
ways. Determination of the mechanisms linking
insomnia to psychotic experiences will shed further light
on the causes of psychosis and potentially enable
treatment improvement.[3,13] Of great clinical interest will
be the evaluation of the effects of improving sleep for


patients attending clinical services with ultra-high risk of
psychosis, or established clinical psychotic experiences,
or at the early stages of relapse. Our experience is that
patients with psychosis value their sleep difficulties
being appropriately addressed, that this enhances
engagement with other treatments, and that better sleep
can contribute to a reduction in psychotic experiences.
Furthermore, a gap exists in mental health services
regarding intervention for early, relatively non-specific
presentations, and proper sleep treatment might provide
a sensible first response. Overall, this trial indicates the
importance of sleep difficulties for mental health in the
general population and the need for a reconsideration in
clinical services of the priority given to improving sleep.
