**Introduction**

With prevalence rates between 7 and 10% in the general population [1], clinical insomnia is the second most
prevalent mental disorder [2]. In general practice, fatigue
and sleeplessness are respectively the first and third most
reported complaints, and insomnia is estimated to occur
in as many as 30% of general practice patients [1, 3]. Insomnia leads to a high disease burden on its own but also
increases the risks of developing other psychiatric problems [4, 5] and cardiovascular diseases [6]. Insomnia, and
its comorbid problems, leads to high societal costs, mainly due to productivity losses [7, 8].
Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I)
is an evidence-based treatment with large effects on insomnia severity (demonstrated in several meta-analyses,
e.g. Hedges’ g = 0.98 [9]). CBT-I is recommended by (inter)national guidelines [10–13] as the first treatment option for insomnia. In general practice, somewhat smaller
effects are reported, but still in the moderate range (Hedges’ g = 0.40 [14]). Despite these moderate effects and the
guideline recommendations, sleep medication is still the
most commonly used treatment in general practice: 60%
of new insomnia patients generally only receive medication [15]. Even though general practitioners (GPs) acknowledge the importance of CBT-I, they lack the time
and/or knowledge to offer it themselves and there is a lack
of CBT-I trained therapists to refer to [16]. Internet-delivered CBT-I (I-CBT-I) presents a promising way to increase the availability of CBT-I and to enable GPs to adhere to insomnia guideline recommendations.
Internet treatments usually consist of a number of lessons in which an evidence-based intervention is explained. This might be text-based, video-based or a mixture. Another core feature is that patients receive assignments. They need to apply techniques they read about in
the online lessons to their own daily lives. The treatment
might be offered without any support, but we know that
the adherence and effects are better when it is offered with
some type of support [17]. In general, guided Internet
treatments seem as effective as face-to-face treatments

[18], and this is also demonstrated for I-CBT-I [19, 20].
However, these results are mostly based on self-selected,
specifically recruited online samples of help seekers [19,
21]. It is not known whether I-CBT-I also works among
patients in a routine general practice. This is what we
want to examine in the current study.
In the Netherlands almost all GPs employ a mental
health nurse practitioner. Those nurse practitioners provide psychosocial support or treatment for people with


mild mental health symptoms. They vary in their background and training but most often they are either mental
health nurses or recently graduated psychologists. In this
study we refer to them as “nurses.” The nurses delivered
the I-CBT-I and provided online feedback. We opted for
nurse practitioners because not enough trained psychologists are available in the Netherlands. More importantly,
in the Dutch health care system, patients who are referred
to a psychologist because of insomnia have to pay for
treatment out of pocket. The care provided by nurses in
general practice falls under the GP care and is fully reimbursed. Therefore, this is more feasible for offering insomnia treatment to patients.
The primary objective of this pragmatic randomized
controlled trial was to assess whether nurse-guided ICBT-I is effective in routine general practice compared
to care as usual (CAU) on insomnia severity. Secondarily, sleep diary indices, mental health complaints and
daily functioning were assessed. Effects were studied immediately after treatment (posttest; 8 weeks), after 26
weeks and (in the intervention group only) after 52
weeks.

**Material and Methods**

_Research Design_
This 2-arm, pragmatic randomized clinical trial compared ICBT-I to CAU. Patients in the intervention group were also allowed to receive CAU. Patients in the control group received the
intervention after the 26-week assessment if they still wanted it.
Randomization charts were made for each nurse separately, using random sequence block randomization (blocks of 2, 4 or 6)
on a 1:1 ratio and stratified by sleep medication use. Participants
were randomized using randomization charts created by an independent researcher. A second independent researcher performed the randomization. The primary researcher (T.Z.) was
blinded to treatment allocation. After allocation, the primary researcher, participants, nurses and GPs were informed of the randomization outcome. Participants in CAU were informed they
would be offered I-CBT-I after 6 months. GPs strongly requested
also being informed when patients were randomized to CAU so
they could offer other treatments and patients would not be left
on their own. The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU Medical
Centre Amsterdam approved this trial (registration No.
2015/258), and it was registered with the Dutch Trial Registry
(NTR5202, April 17, 2015). The detailed protocol is available
elsewhere [22].

_Power_
In the original protocol we calculated our power based on an
independent t test. To ensure 80% statistical power with a 2-sided
α-value of 0.05, assuming a conservative effect size of Cohen’s d =
0.50 on the primary outcome insomnia severity [23] and expecting
a risk of 20% dropout [24], we aimed to include 160 participants.

When we analyzed the data, we decided it was more appropriate
to employ a statistical procedure taking baseline levels into account. Based on this within-between group analysis and the
achieved sample size (n = 134), we obtained a power of 0.8 (α =
0.05) to detect an effect size of d = 0.24.

_Recruitment_
Recruitment leaflets were distributed in print and on screens in
waiting rooms. GPs and nurses were asked to alert all possible eligible insomnia patients who consulted them to the trial. GPs and
nurses received laminated summaries of the trial and how to ex

plain it to patients, to use during consultations. Additionally, GPs
sent invitation letters and leaflets to patients who had consulted
them for insomnia in the past year. All recruitment materials referred patients to our study website which explained the study in
more detail. Patients could leave their e-mail address to show that
they were interested. They then received an e-mail with a link to a
screening questionnaire. Eligible patients received all information
in printed form, a sleep diary, informed consent form and stamped
return envelope. Patients were randomized after returning the
completed sleep diary and informed consent. The inclusion period
was extended from originally 18 months to 30 months. We ended

inclusion in April 2018, at 134 of the planned 160 participants for
pragmatic reasons (Fig. 1 for a flow chart).[1]

_Eligibility Criteria_
Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18 years or older; (2) reporting lying
awake for ≥30 min a night for ≥3 nights per week for ≥3 months;
and (3) causing clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. The duration and frequency of insomnia complaints were assessed in an online screening questionnaire. The
consequences during the day were assessed with the Daytime Consequences items [25]. This scale assesses 6 domains of functioning: energy, relationships, mood, concentration, productivity and
sleepiness. Each domain was measured using a 5-point Likert scale
(0 = not disturbed, 4 = very disturbed). We defined daytime consequence as scoring at least a 3 on one of the domains. These inclusion criteria (sleep complaints and consequences for daily functioning) were chosen because they resemble the DSM-5 criteria for
an insomnia disorder [26]. Exclusion criteria were: (1) no access to
the Internet; (2) inadequate proficiency in Dutch; (3) meeting
sleep apnea criteria; (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) working
night shifts; (6) other current psychological treatment; (7) suicidal
ideation or (8) schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. In order to
identify sleep apnea, we used the Screening for Sleeping Disorders
questionnaire [27]. Patients with a positive score for suspected untreated sleep apnea (reporting snoring, breathing stops and excessive daytime sleepiness) were excluded. Suicidal ideation over the
past month was assessed using 5 MINI diagnostic interview items
in the self-report screening questionnaire (e.g., thoughts about suicide, making plans or attempting suicide) [28]. Patients in both
groups were allowed to use sleep medication and over-the-counter
sleep aids without restrictions.

_General Practices_
At first, we recruited general practices through the Academic
Network of General Practices (n = 8). This is a structural collaboration between a number of general practices in the Amsterdam
area and the department of General Practice at Amsterdam University Medical Centre. Due to low inclusion rates, we sought additional practices outside Amsterdam during the trial (n = 7).
There were around 50 GPs working in the 15 participating general practices.
The GP practices employed mental health nurses with either a
university degree in psychology (62%) or higher vocational training as a psychiatric nurse (38%). Their average age was 51 (SD =
11, range 32–64 years) Their clinical experience ranged from 6
months to 15 years (mean = 6.9 years, SD = 5). Most of them reported some experience with e-Health (77%), 8% reported little
experience and 15% no experience.

1 Due to the low inclusion rates and difficulty reaching our envisioned sample size, we made several changes to the protocol along the course of the
trial. First, we changed an exclusion criterion. Originally, the protocol was
to exclude patients who had psychological treatment (for insomnia or other
complaints) in the past 6 months. We switched to excluding only patients in
current psychological treatment. Patients previously excluded for this reason
(n = 3) were invited to participate again (of whom 2 did). Second, we initially
recruited only patients who consulted their GP for insomnia prospectively.
We switched to GPs actively screening electronic medical records and inviting all patients who had consulted their GP in the last year to our screening
questionnaire. Third, we dropped actigraphy measures early on in the trial
because these led to considerable logistic difficulties.


_Intervention_
The i-Sleep intervention was developed by the first, second and
last authors and is based on CBT-I [29–33]. i-Sleep consists of 5
lessons. Each lesson consists of information which is offered in text
format as well as video. Furthermore, every lesson includes a fictitious and a real-life case example (also in text format and video).
After every lesson the patient needs to fill out “homework” (sleep
diary and e.g. setting bedtimes). Lesson 1 focused on psychoeducation about healthy and disordered sleep and sleep hygiene. In lesson 2, stimulus control is introduced (getting out of bed when
awake for >15 min, using the bed for sleep and sexual activity only)
and patients start sleep restriction therapy. Lesson 3 teaches relaxation and minimizing worrying. Lesson 4 is aimed at tackling dysfunctional cognitions about sleep. The fifth and final lesson invites
the participant to make a summary of lessons learned and construct a relapse prevention plan.
Participants were advised to complete one lesson per week and
received online coaching from the nurse in their own general practice. The aim of the feedback was to motivate patients to carry on,
to offer explanations if needed and to comment on the completed
exercises. Patients had the possibility to ask the nurses additional
questions (online). Nurses received approximately 1.5 h of training
from the first author (T.Z.) on how to guide i-Sleep and background knowledge about sleep and treatment. Every nurse first
treated a mock patient under supervision (T.Z.), using the feedback
manual created for this trial. Further supervision was offered on an
as-needed basis, assessed by regular phone calls and e-mail contact
(T.Z.). Nurses reported spending between 5 and 20 min per patient
per session on providing online feedback. Feedback was programprompted: all participants received feedback on all completed sessions. The intervention did not include face-to-face contact and
was provided at no cost to participants. Intervention group participants were free to receive other GP care as needed. The i-Sleep
intervention is not primarily aimed at tapering or discontinuing
medication but does discuss the (dis)advantages of medication. Patients are advised to contact their GP if they want to reduce or quit.
A previous study has shown that the i-Sleep intervention is effective
among insomnia patients recruited in the general population [21].

_CAU Control Condition_
GPs participating in this study received a printed version of the
most recent Dutch insomnia guidelines for GPs [10] to promote a
similar knowledge level on guidelines among participating practices. We did not otherwise interfere with CAU as offered by GPs.
We reported to GPs which patients were randomized to CAU and
invited these participants to use i-Sleep 6 months after randomization.

_Measurements_
Timing of the Assessments
Assessment took place at baseline (week 0), after treatment
(week 8), at 26 weeks and 52 weeks. After the third assessment (26
weeks), the CAU patients were offered the i-Sleep treatment (n =
37 [57%] accepted). The 52-week follow-up is uncontrolled. This
follow-up aimed to determine whether effects in the intervention
group are sustained over time.

Primary Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index [34] (ISI; range 0–28). The ISI contains 7 items scored on a


4 Psychother Psychosom Van der Zweerde/Lancee/Slottje/

-----

5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely). The ISI is a reliable instrument possessing adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.90 [35]) and was validated for online use [36]. Clinically significant improvement is defined as a change of ≥8 points,
a clinical cutoff of ISI >10 is used to define patients with clinical
insomnia symptoms [35].

Secondary Outcome Measures
We used a pen-and-paper version of the Dutch translation of
the Carney consensus diary [37] to estimate several sleep characteristics: sleep onset latency (SOL; number of minutes it takes to
fall asleep), sleep efficiency (SE; 0–100%; total sleep time divided
by the total time in bed), number of awakenings (NWAK), wake
after sleep onset (WASO; total minutes awake after sleep onset),
terminal wakefulness (TWAK; time spent awake in bed before getting up), total sleep time (TST) and sleep quality (SQ; rated 1–5
each night). Participants completed 7-day diaries at each assessment, aggregated into week averages for analysis. Diaries with at
least 5 days completed were included in the analysis.
We used the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to
assess anxiety and depression [38, 39]. Each item is scored on a
scale of 0–3, and the total scores thus range from 0 to 21 for both
the Anxiety and the Depression scales.
Daytime functioning (energy, relationships, mood, concentration, productivity and sleepiness) was measured using a 5-point
scale (0–4; range 0–24) for each of the 6 items of the Daytime Consequences items [25]. We used the Work and Social Adjustment
Scale to measure 4 domains of functioning (household tasks, work
productivity, close relationships and social life) [40]. Each domain
is measured on a scale of 0–8. Fatigue was measured with the Fatigue Severity Scale [41] which consists of 7 items (scored 1–7). The
total score ranges from 7 (no fatigue) to 49 (severely fatigued).
Finally, we assessed the use of sleep medication and antidepressant use. These data were collected both by direct reporting by
participants and by examining the electronic medical records of
the participants, separately. Due to privacy regulations we could
not cross-check the medication use and therefore we report on
both self-report (at the different assessments) and GP records
(covering the complete inclusion period). From GP records we
extracted whether patients had received at least one prescription
during the assessment period (between baseline and follow-up at
26 weeks) of benzodiazepine derivatives (N05CD, N05BA), benzodiazepine-related drugs (N05CF) or antidepressants (N06A),
using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification of the
World Health Organization (www.whocc.no/atc). From these records we could not determine whether a patient’s use had declined
over the course of the trial, hence we additionally asked patients to
report medication use at all assessments (“Have you used sleep
medication in the past 4 weeks?” – yes/no).
Participants were asked to report (minor) falls, traffic accidents
and other adverse events (“Did anything unpleasant happen to you
that was related to your sleep or participation in the trial?”) at each
assessment. If yes, they were asked to describe what happened and
whether any medical or psychological assistance was needed.[2]

2 We did not report on data on alcohol use as per protocol due to a technical
error in the data collection procedure that led to a lot of missing data. One
of the originally 5 items of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale is missing for the same reason (we report on the other 4 and not on a total score).

Internet-Delivered CBT-I in General
Practice: A Randomized Controlled Trial


_Statistical Analysis_
We performed intent-to-treat analyses (i.e., on all 134 included
participants, irrespective of whether treatment was completed)

[42]. We performed generalized mixed multilevel (patient and
condition) regression analysis to evaluate the effects of time (within-group), condition (between-group) and the interaction between time × condition (between-group). For normally distributed outcomes regular linear mixed regressions using identity links
were used, and mixed negative binomial regression analyses with
a log link otherwise. To assess differences in change in outcomes
between the two conditions, we performed a series of two-level
(participants and time points) repeated-measures analyses in two
separate models: one to assess change in outcome from pre- to
posttest assessment and one assessing change in outcomes from
pre- to 26 weeks follow-up. Assuming data were missing at random, we applied an unstructured covariance matrix as most fitting
to the data [43]. Baseline characteristics significantly predicting
dropout were added to the model as covariates (daytime consequences and sex). Baseline differences between the two conditions
were not tested for statistical significance [44]. Between-group Cohen’s _d_ effect sizes were calculated by calculating the pre-post
change scores for both groups and calculating the difference. We
then divided these by the pooled standard deviations observed at
baseline [45].
We also compared the percentage of patients recovered (ISI
below clinical cutoff of 11) or showing clinically significant improvement on the primary outcome (ISI; defined as a change of ≥8
points) [35] between the intervention and control group at posttest
examination and at 26 weeks follow-up. For the uncontrolled 52week follow-up, within-group effect sizes were calculated based on
observed means. For all statistical analyses, the two-sided significance level was set at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS for
Windows 25.

_Changes to Protocol_
We made two changes to our original protocol [22] both with
the intention to enhance recruitment. In the original protocol the
recruitment strategy was described as GPs inviting patients during
a face-to-face consultation for sleep problems. We added a direct
mailing of all patients who had consulted the GP for sleep problems in the last year. Furthermore, in the original protocol we described that we would exclude patients who received prior or current psychological treatment. We changed this to excluding patients only for current, not prior, psychological treatment.

**Results**

_Participants_
The final sample consisted of 134 adults, randomized
to i-Sleep (n = 69) or the CAU control group (n = 65;

15.9), 65% of the sample was female and 87% was born in
the Netherlands (Table 1). In the i-Sleep condition, 47
participants (68%) completed the intervention, and 22
(32%) did not (8 did not start and 14 dropped out during
treatment). The study response rate (providing data) was
83% (n = 111) at the posttest assessment, 80% (n = 107)
at 26 weeks and 62% (n = 43, intervention group only) at
52 weeks. Contributions to data did not differ significantly between conditions (8 weeks: χ[2] = 0.28, p = 0.60; 26week follow-up: χ[2] = 0.817, p = 0.37). At baseline, the average insomnia score (ISI = 18.9) refers to moderate clinical levels of insomnia. There were no patients without
insomnia (as defined by ISI scores <11), 17 patients (13%)
reported subthreshold clinical insomnia (ISI <14), 80 reported moderate-severe (60%; ISI 15–21) and 37 reported
severe insomnia (28%; ISI 22–28). At baseline, sleep medication was used by 33% (i-Sleep group) versus 39% (control group) of the participants. The average score on anxiety was 8.16 which indicates subclinical levels of anxiety
(>11 indicative of anxiety disorder) [38]. The average
score on depression was 6.21 which indicates subclinical
levels of depression (>11 indicative of depressive disorder) [38]. Of all patients, 20 (15%) scored above the anxiety cutoff, and 13 patients (10%) scored above the depression cutoff [39].

_Primary Outcome: Effect on ISI_
Multilevel regression analyses showed significant
time × condition interaction effects for the ISI, from pre

to posttest assessment, F1, 88 = 29.62, p < 0.001, dbetween =
1.66 and from pre-examination to follow-up at 26 weeks,
_F1, 74 = 10.65, p = 0.002, dbetween = 1.02_ (Fig. 2). This indicates that I-CBT-I resulted in participants experiencing a
greater improvement in insomnia severity than CAU patients from pre- to postassessment and from preassessment to 26-week follow-up. See Table 2 for confidence
intervals. The intervention group more often reported a
clinically significant improvement (improvement on ISI
score ≥8 points) than patients in the control group at the
posttest assessment (56 vs. 12%) and at 26 weeks (46 vs.
11%; Table 3).

_Secondary Outcomes: Effect on Sleep Diary Indices_
Multilevel regression analyses showed significant
time × condition interaction effects at the posttest assessment for the sleep diary variables: WASO, F1, 94 = 14.09,
_p < 0.001,_ _dbetween = 0.54; NWAK,_ _F1, 102 = 11.32,_ _p_ ≤

_dbetween = 0.31; SQ, F1, 90 = 5.23, p = 0.025, dbetween = 0.52_
and SE, F1, 112 = 17.23, p < 0.001, dbetween = 0.61. This indicates that participants in the i-Sleep condition showed
more improvement on time spent awake in bed and sleep
efficiency than patients receiving CAU at the posttest assessment. No significant differences were observed for
SOL, TST or sleep quality. At 26 weeks of follow-up, significant interaction effects of time × condition were observed for SE, F1, 103 = 5.55, p = 0.02, dbetween = 0.41, and
TST, F1, 99 = 5.89, p = 0.017, dbetween = 0.41 (Table 2).

tasks, work productivity, close relationships and social
life). At 26 weeks of follow-up, no significant interaction
effects were observed for any of the secondary outcomes.
Both conditions improved significantly over time on these
measures of mental health and daytime functioning.

_Secondary Outcomes: Medication_
There were no significant differences in sleep medication use, as reported by patients themselves, between the
intervention and CAU group at baseline (33 vs. 39%, p =
0.54) or at the posttest assessment (20 vs. 23% p = 0.96).
At the 26-week follow-up, twice as many patients in the
control group used medication (29%) than in the intervention group (13%). However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.75). At the 52-week follow-up,
10 i-Sleep participants (23%) used sleep medication. GP
records showed that over the complete trial period 30%
used sleep medication (25% benzodiazepine derivatives,
5% Z drugs) in the i-Sleep condition versus 47% of the
control group (40% benzodiazepine derivatives, 7% Z
drugs). Antidepressants were used by 12% of i-Sleep participants over this period, versus 25% in the control group.

_One-Year Uncontrolled Follow-Up_
Within-group effect sizes in the i-Sleep condition indicate that the effects were sustained at 52 weeks of follow-up (dwithin ranging from 1.69 [ISI] to 0.23 [SOL]);
however, the response rate at 52 weeks of follow-up was
quite low (62%).

_Adverse Events_
No serious adverse events (warranting psychological
or medical care) were reported. At the posttest assessment, one CAU participant mentioned a surgery for unrelated medical reasons.

**Discussion**

This pragmatic randomized controlled trial showed
that nurse-guided I-CBT-I is effective in general practice
in reducing insomnia symptoms. The study showed that
I-CBT-I is feasible and can be used in general practice
with support from nurses. The intervention yielded large
effect sizes compared to CAU on insomnia severity (d =
1.66 after treatment, and d = 1.02 after 26 weeks). These
effects remained at the 52-week follow-up. We also demonstrated significant secondary effects at the posttest assessment (sleep diary WASO, NWAK, TWAK, SQ, and
depressive symptoms) and 26-week follow-up (TST and


SE). No significant effects were observed on the other secondary outcomes, anxiety, fatigue, daytime consequences
or sleep medication.
Our aim was to test whether I-CBT-I’s effects would
stand the test in a general practice population. One of our
hypotheses was that patients actively seeking help from
their GP would be different than those who respond to
online advertisement for insomnia treatment. However,
when comparing the baseline scores of our population to
those of other studies among the general population we
do not see many differences. The participants in our trial
were suffering from relatively severe insomnia (mean
baseline ISI score 18.9 in our sample) but the same is the
case in, for example, the online study of Kaldo et al. [46]
(baseline ISI score 16.8) or Lancee et al. [47] (baseline ISI
score 18.2). Baseline sleep efficiency (66% in our trial) was
also very similar to the ones reported by Kaldo et al. [46]
(71%) and Lancee et al. [47] (64%). Furthermore, 15% of
our population scored above the cutoff on our anxiety
questionnaire and 10% did so for depression. This also
seems to indicate that our population did not suffer substantially more often from comorbid mental disorders
than those who are recruited in the general population.
All this does not necessarily mean that people who actively seek help are similar to those who do not. They
might be different on aspects we did not measure, e.g. the
extent of social support, or their personality traits. It is
important that we showed that I-CBT-I can be effectively
delivered in general practice because in many countries
the GP functions as a gatekeeper and is the first person to
go to when looking for help for insomnia. This online intervention enables GPs to offer insomnia care according
to the current clinical guidelines. Support costs relatively
little time (on average 1.5 h per patient) and does not have
to be delivered by highly trained (psychological) professionals but can be offered by people with a higher vocational background after a short training: in this case support was effectively executed by the nurses employed in
the general practice.
We included not only sleep outcomes, but also other relevant secondary outcomes. Surprisingly, on many of these
indices no effect of I-CBT-I was observed, a finding only
partly in line with other trials. For instance, CBT-I often
also has beneficial effects for depression and anxiety complaints [48–50]. We were able to replicate the effect at the
posttest assessment for depressive complaints but this was
no longer detected at the 26-week follow-up. The relatively
low level of severity of depression in our sample might explain the lack of mental health effects. Our sample may have
consisted of people with an isolated insomnia problem not

(yet) generalized to other areas of mental health (i.e., only
10% suffered from depression). Our participants did show
considerable baseline impairments in daytime functioning.
Most studies observe improvements in daytime functioning after insomnia treatment [20, 25]. We did not find a
significant effect but the effect sizes for the various domains
of functioning are between d = 0.21 and d = 0.39. A possible
explanation for the lack of significance is that the study was
underpowered to detect these clinically relevant effects, although by adding baseline measurements to the analysis we
have likely increased power [51].
It remains difficult to understand that the intervention
showed large effects on insomnia but not on fatigue. Fatigue is one of the most frequently reported symptoms of
patients seeking help from insomnia. However, a recent
meta-analysis into the effect of insomnia treatments on
fatigue also concludes that there is no effect [50]. Importantly, this meta-analysis indicates that there is a high heterogeneity between studies indicating that some are more
successful than others. At the moment, the association between sleep and fatigue is still poorly understood. We definitely need more research to uncover the (un)shared
mechanisms. Network intervention analysis could be used
in order to shed light on the treatment effects on individual symptoms, since insomnia, fatigue and daytime symptom questionnaires are prone to overlap somewhat [52].
The assessments of sleep medication and antidepressant use were complicated, due to the combination of selfreport and GP data which we could not link. Moreover, a
prescription is not necessarily the same as usage. Using a
more reliable measure (such as sophisticated bottle cap
chips counting numbers of pills taken) was not feasible in
this trial. Even though there are no significant differences,
both the GP data and the self-report data indicate less use
of sleep medication (and antidepressants) in the intervention group than in the control group. At 26 weeks the
control group reports more than twice (29%) as much
sleep medication use than the intervention group (13%),
which is a promising result which needs to be replicated
in larger trials. Previous research has indeed indicated
that CBT-I can have favorable effects on sleep medication
use and can facilitate the discontinuation process [53].
Our trial has several strong features. First of all, that it
was a pragmatic trial. We showed that it is feasible to implement an I-CBT-I treatment in routine GP care. Furthermore, we showed that the treatment is acceptable for
patients. A large majority (68%) completed the treatment
fully, which is higher than often observed in online treatment for insomnia [24]. Adherence might even be raised
by adding a face-to-face session before the start of the

Internet-Delivered CBT-I in General
Practice: A Randomized Controlled Trial


treatment or by offering it in a blended way (online and
face-to-face sessions). This might depend on the individual patients’ motivation and other characteristics. Another strong feature is our high assessment response rate
(Fig. 1). About 80% completed the posttest measurement.
A limitation of our study is the slow inclusion rate and
the early termination of inclusion before we reached our
desired sample size which has consequences for the power of the secondary analyses in particular. The low inclusion rate was partly due to time and resource constraints
in general practice. Although the participating GPs and
nurses were highly motivated and enthusiastic about having an alternative treatment to offer insomnia patients
other than or in addition to medication, the trial was not
always mentioned during (insomnia-related) GP consultations which may have lowered inclusion rates. GP
awareness and involvement should be a strong focus
point in future research. An additional limitation is that
polysomnographic measurements were not feasible in
this research setting. Although we deem subjective measures of this psychological problem to be most important,
as is reflected by the DSM-5 nosology [26], it would have
been valuable to have polysomnographic data in addition. We aimed to include actigraphy data, but unfortunately this also turned out not to be feasible. The research
context likely influenced uptake as well. Patients may
have been hesitant to take part in a trial and could be more
willing to undergo I-CBT-I through their GP outside of
the research setting. A related limitation is the use of a
CAU control condition [54]. We had expected that GPs
would have provided more care (e.g., medication, sleep
hygiene advice, referral to a psychologist or physiotherapist) since we explicitly handed over the most recent insomnia guidelines and notified the GPs of the patients
who were randomized to the control group. However, it
turned out that most patients in the control group did not
receive much care and started i-Sleep after the waiting
period. The control group thus resembled a waitlist condition which may have induced a nocebo effect [55].
In summary, we reached our goal of offering GPs a
time-efficient treatment that is highly effective in reducing insomnia complaints. A cost-effectiveness analysis of
the intervention will be a valuable next step, as would
comparing the intervention to an unguided version offered in general practice. This might increase uptake since
it requires even less work by GPs and nurses, but it may
decrease adherence and have a lower effect [17]. We demonstrated the potential of I-CBT-I in routine general
practice: i-Sleep clearly outperformed CAU on insomnia
severity and several sleep diary indices in this trial. The

large effects on insomnia severity are important towards
prevention of mental health problems for which insomnia is a risk factor as well [4]. Although further research
is needed to illuminate potential effects on other mental
health complaints and daily functioning and the longerterm effects of online interventions [56], we recommend
GPs to implement nurse-guided I-CBT-I as a way of alleviating insomnia symptoms through feasible, effective,
guideline adherent treatment.
