**1. Introduction**


A B S T R A C T

Bereaved individuals often experience sleep problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and
preliminary effects of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-i) in bereaved parents.
Parents were randomized to iCBT-i (n = 10) or an active control group (n = 11). Primary outcome (insomnia)
and secondary outcomes (prolonged grief, depression, posttraumatic stress, and grief rumination) were assessed
pre- and post-treatment, with 9- and 18-month follow-ups. Feasibility was assessed post-treatment and one
month later. Most parents reported positive effects of the treatment. The intervention group improved signifi­
cantly from pre- to post-treatment and had a significantly larger reduction of insomnia when analyzed over all
four time-points (Wald χ[2 ]= 30.0, p < 0.001), although the effect at post-treatment was very small (d = 0.1) for
insomnia. Thus, iCBT-i was feasible and was related to reduced insomnia and psychological distress in bereaved
parents, both short- and long-term, but the results regarding the treatment effect are preliminary due to the small
sample size.


About 20% of children with cancer in Western countries do not
survive their disease, making cancer one of the leading causes of death
among children over one year of age (Rosenberg et al., 2012; Swedish
Board of Health and Welfare, 2016). Bereaved parents are at increased
risk of developing mental and physical health problems (Stroebe et al.,
2007) and bereavement is also associated with an increased risk of
mortality, especially in mothers (Li et al., 2003). A systematic review
(Rosenberg et al., 2012) reported that parents of children who die from
cancer have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and prolonged grief, and
poorer quality of life, compared with other parents.
Impaired sleep is a common problem in bereaved individuals
(Buckley et al., 2012; Hardison et al., 2005; Lancel et al., 2020). How­
ever, there are few studies examining sleep impairments after the loss of
a child (Lancel et al., 2020). One previous study (Lannen et al., 2008)


has reported that a majority (73.5%) of parents who had lost a child to
cancer had sleep difficulties 4–9 years later.
There is strong evidence that sleep difficulties is associated with
mental health problems following loss, such as prolonged grief and
depression (Boelen and Lancee, 2013; Lancel et al., 2020; Monk et al.,
2008). For example, several studies have shown that more severe sleep
difficulties are associated with higher levels of prolonged grief (Boelen
and Lancee, 2013; Germain et al., 2005; Hardison et al., 2005). A study
targeting treatment of prolonged grief found a modest improvement in
sleep quality, but the sleep difficulties remained after treatment even
though prolonged grief symptoms had decreased (Germain et al., 2006).
This suggests that insomnia (a sleep disorder characterized by subjective
difficulties with sleep onset and/or maintenance) is a partly independent
factor, requiring specific treatment in individuals with prolonged grief,
much like what has been seen for insomnia in relation to depression
(Blom et al., 2015a). In addition, persistent sleep deprivation can

increase the risks for a variety of negative health outcomes (McEwen,
2006). Thus, treating insomnia may improve not only sleep, but also
health in general.
Despite insomnia being common in bereaved individuals, only one
pilot study (Carter et al., 2009) has evaluated feasibility and preliminary
efficacy of an insomnia treatment – a brief two-session home based
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – in cancer-bereaved caregivers.
Eleven participants were included in two 2-hour sessions of a 5-week
study protocol taking place at the participants' home, with focus on
identifying and changing sleep habits. Preliminary results indicated
improved sleep and reduced levels of distress, but the absence of a
control group limits the interpretation of the results and more rigorous
research is needed in bereaved individuals examining the effect of
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i). CBT-i is the recom­
mended first-line treatment for adults (Riemann et al., 2017; Wilson
et al., 2019). CBT-i has been shown to be effective in decreasing
insomnia severity and improving sleep efficiency also when delivered


via the internet (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al., 2015b; Kaldo et al.,
2015; Seyffert et al., 2016), with effect sizes similar to those of face-toface therapy (Seyffert et al., 2016).
Based on previous research on CBT-i and internet-delivered CBT-i
(iCBT-i), mentioned above, it has the potential to also be effective in
bereaved parents; however, as bereaved parents is a burdened group
with a lot of distress, the feasibility and efficacy of iCBT-i needs to be
examined in this specific population. This is the first study to examine
iCBT-i in a randomized controlled trial in bereaved individuals. This
study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of iCBT-i in
bereaved parents 1 to 5 years after the loss of a child to cancer. A sec­
ondary aim was a preliminary examination of the effect of the insomnia
treatment on secondary outcomes including prolonged grief, depression,
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and grief rumination.

**2. Materials and methods**

_2.1. Study design_

A two-armed randomized control trial with iCBT-i versus active
control. The study was approved by the regional ethics review board in
Stockholm, Sweden (protocol #2015/2183-31/5). This trial was regis­
[tered at ClinicalTrials.gov, (registration ID #NCT02886052).](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)

_2.2. Participants and procedure_

The present study is part of a larger project on parents of children
who were diagnosed with a malignancy before the age of 17 years and
died due to the malignancy before the age of 25 years, between 2010 and
2015. Cancer-bereaved parents were invited to take part in a Swedish
nationwide postal survey, which has been described in greater detail in
Pohlkamp et al. (2018) and Sveen et al. (2019). Of 512 eligible in­
dividuals, 372 consented to participate and received the survey, 63
declined to participate and 76 parent could not be contacted. Two
hundred and thirty-two parents filled out the survey, which included a
question on interest in receiving more information about the present
study. A total of 59 individuals indicated such interest. Initial screening
was made based on the postal survey, i.e., scoring ≥10 on the Insomnia
Severity Index, with 47 participants fulfilling this criterion. They were
sent an information letter and contacted by telephone. Twelve parents
scored <10 on ISI in the postal survey and were sent a letter explaining
that they did not meet the initial inclusion criterion. Of the 47 partici­
pants, nine could not be reached and five declined participation (Fig. 1),
resulting in 33 participants being interviewed.

_2.2.1. Structured telephone interview_
The structured telephone interview was based on the clinical inter­
view described by Morin and Espie (2003), translated into Swedish, and
with the addition of DSM-5-critera for insomnia (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013). The interview also included questions regarding
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and was structured with supporting
questions and decision algorithms to facilitate use by inexperienced
interviewers. Inclusion criteria were: insomnia disorder in accordance
with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association,
2013), more than 10 points on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin,
1993), and ability to read and write in Swedish. Exclusion criteria were:
other comorbid sleep disorders requiring other treatment (sleep apnea
or narcolepsy), ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, comorbid disorders
directly contraindicative of essential interventions in insomnia treat­
ment (e.g., bipolar disorder), and night-shift work. Initial sleep medi­
cation use was unrestricted, but participants were recommended to
stabilize their dose during treatment, with the option of tapering. Thirtythree individuals were interviewed via telephone; five did not meet the
inclusion criteria, while 28 did and consented to participate in the study.
Seven individuals dropped out of the study prior to randomization, and
21 participants filled out the baseline assessment online and were then
randomized.

_2.2.2. Randomization and assessment points_
The participants were randomized to either the intervention group or
the active control group by an assistant not otherwise involved in the
study, using [www.random.org, a true random number source, and](http://www.random.org)
randomization of clusters of different sizes. In one case, both parents of a
deceased child participated; they were assigned to the same group and
counted as one individual in the randomization. Ten parents were ran­
domized to the intervention group and eleven to the control group.
Assessment points were before the treatment, post-treatment and at
one month (interview), 9 and 18 months after treatment.


_2.2.3. Intervention_
The iCBT-i was based on well-established CBT models and tech­
niques, and included active support from therapists during 9 weeks. It
consisted of a set of modules on a secure website that only the partici­
pants and their therapists could access. Each module included text to
read, questions to answer, behavioral assignments, work sheets, and a
sleep diary to be filled out throughout treatment. The modules were:
introduction and facts about sleep; introduction to CBT for insomnia and
sleep hygiene; education on sleep medication and how to quit; sleep
restriction and stimulus control; stress management; managing fatigue;
handling negative thoughts about sleep; and planning ahead. The par­
ticipants were supposed to complete about one module a week. Each
module ended with a homework assignment consisting of a set of
structured, often free-text, questions to be sent to the therapist via the
secure messaging system on the website. The therapist would review
answers, work sheets and the sleep diary, give written feedback within
two weekdays, and give the participant access to the next module. The
participants could ask their therapist questions via the messaging sys­
tem, and these messages were to be answered within two weekdays.
Therapist adherence to the treatment protocol was ensured through the
internet-delivered format and continuous supervision. There were two
therapists, one who was in the final year of the Swedish 5-year univer­
sity program for clinical psychologists and had training in CBT, and one
who had a Bachelor of Science in psychology and had training in CBT.
The therapists received initial training in the CBT-i program and weekly
supervision.

_2.2.4. The active control group_
Participants received a short booklet with psychoeducation on sleep,
sleep disturbances, setting treatment goals, sleep hygiene, stress man­
agement, and mindfulness via the secure website. They could download
the booklet if wanted. They had no contact with the therapist. It was not
checked if the participants read the booklet or not.

_2.3. Feasibility – adherence, satisfaction, evaluation of the treatment's_
_strengths and weaknesses, and adverse events_

To assess adherence, the numbers of completed modules and
homework assignment reports were measured. The numbers of messages
between the participants and therapists were also measured.
In the intervention group, participants' satisfaction with treatment
was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen
et al., 1979) at post-treatment. The CSQ-8 contains 8 items and has a
total score ranging from 8 to 32.

_2.3.1. Subjective/open-ended evaluation of the treatment's strengths and_
_weaknesses, and adverse events_
One month after treatment, the participants from both groups were
interviewed via telephone. Adverse events were assessed through the
question “Did the treatment have any negative effects?” Participants
who answered yes were asked to expand upon this. They were also asked
if the treatment had any positive effects and, if so, asked to expand upon
this. Further, they were asked about their perceptions of the weaknesses
and strengths of the treatment, if there was anything missing or if any
part of the treatment was especially useful. Participants in the inter­
vention group who had ended the treatment in advance were asked why
they had done so.

_2.4. Efficacy – symptom measures_

_2.4.1. Primary symptom measure_
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin, 1993) was used to measure
self-reported insomnia severity. The psychometric properties of ISI are
adequate and it is sensitive to change (Bastien et al., 2001), including
when used online (Thorndike et al., 2011). It consists of 7 items, partly
corresponding to the symptoms in DSM-5, which assess the severity of


-----

sleep onset and sleep maintenance difficulties, sleep pattern satisfaction,
interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attrib­
uted to the sleep problem, and degree of concern or distress caused by
the sleep problem. Treatment response and remission rates were also
assessed (Morin et al., 2009): treatment responders were those whose
scores decreased by 8 points or more from pre-treatment to posttreatment or follow-up, and remitters were those whose absolute ISI
score at post-treatment or follow-up was below 8.

_2.4.2. Secondary symptom measures_

_2.4.2.1. Parent health. The Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 (PG-13) was_
used to assess symptoms of prolonged grief (Prigerson et al., 2009); it
contains 11 items covering cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symp­
toms, one duration item, and one impairment item. A study of the
Swedish PG-13 has shown satisfactory psychometric properties (Pohl­
kamp et al., 2018). The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) was used to assess depressive
symptoms; it contains 9 items. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)
was used to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(Weathers et al., 2013); it contains 20 items corresponding to the
symptoms in the DSM-5. A study of the Swedish PCL-5 has shown
adequate psychometric properties (Sveen et al., 2016). The Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was used to assess self-reported generalized
anxiety disorder symptoms (Spitzer et al., 2006); it consists of 7 items.
The Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS) (Eisma et al., 2012) was
used to measure grief-specific rumination; it contains 15 items that
measure different aspects of grief rumination. A study of the Swedish
UGRS has shown that it has satisfactory psychometric properties (Sveen
et al., 2019).

_2.5. Statistical analyses_

Data analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS version 25.0. De­
mographic, loss-related baseline data, responses, and remission rates
were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-squared tests, and
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Fisher's exact test was used
when the expected count of one or more cells was below five. All
outcome analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e.,
including measures from all patients, regardless of their adherence to
treatment. To examine the program effects on the primary and sec­
ondary outcome variables, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs)
with a linear scale response and autoregressive (first order) correlation
matrix were used. Intervention group, measurement timepoint, and the
interaction of group and measurement time point were chosen as fac­
tors/covariates. GEEs use all available observations instead of using only
participants with complete data for all time points, and are thus suitable
for intention-to-treat analyses when there are missing data. A sensitivity
analysis of the main outcome, ISI, was performed using a GEE with
missing data replaced by the last observation carried forward. For effect
sizes, Cohen's ds with pooled standard deviations were calculated using
observed data.

**3. Results**

_3.1. Participants and missing data_

Twenty-one bereaved parents were included in the study: 14 mothers
and 7 fathers. Demographic variables of the deceased children and their
parents are presented in Table 1 and missing data are presented in the
flowchart (Fig. 1).

Note: There were no significant differences between the intervention and control
group for any variables displayed in the table, except for education (X[2 ]= 5.7, p
_< 0.05)._

_3.2. Feasibility – treatment adherence, treatment satisfaction and adverse_
_events_

_3.2.1. Treatment adherence_
One participant dropped out of treatment immediately and did not
complete or read any modules, and one participant completed the first
module and then dropped out. One individual, after receiving the first
module, did not complete any homework assignments or modules.
An average of 4.4 (SD = 2.8) of the 9 modules were made available
and the participants completed the homework for 3.5 (SD = 2.9) of the
modules on average. The homework for the module on sleep restriction
and stimulus control, which is considered the core of the treatment, was
completed by 7 participants. On average, 18.6 messages were sent from
each participant to the therapist and 15.4 messages were sent from the
therapist.

_3.2.2. Treatment satisfaction_
Seven participants in the intervention group completed the CSQ-8 at
post-treatment, with a total mean score of 24.1 (SD = 5.5) from a
maximum score of 32, which represents a “good” overall level of satis­
faction (Larsen et al., 1979). Most participants reported that the quality
of treatment was good and were satisfied with the amount of help
received. Overall, four participants were very satisfied with the treat­
ment, while two were indifferent, and one person was quite dissatisfied.
Lack of time to complete the modules and treatment being too timeconsuming were the most common comments. All responded yes to
the question if they would recommend the treatment to a friend.

_3.2.3. Subjective/open-ended evaluation of the treatment's strengths and_
_weaknesses, and adverse events_
All members in both groups were contacted for a telephone inter­
view; 8 from the treatment group and 5 from the control group
answered. In the treatment group, 7 participants reported that the
treatment had positive effects. Most participants stated that they were
sleeping better. Other positives were more knowledge about sleep, using
relaxation techniques, and sleeping without interruptions. One person,
who was dissatisfied, stated that they had not experienced any direct
positive effects and that they lacked the time needed for completing the
treatment. In response to the question “Is there anything especially good
about the treatment?”, 4 stated that the support and responses from the
therapist were important and 2 thought the knowledge and suggestions
from the treatment had been helpful. Reasons for ending the treatment
before completing were that sleep restriction was too difficult and that
the treatment was too intensive and time-consuming. No one in the


-----

intervention group had experienced any negative effects of treatment.
One participant in the control group stated that the sleep booklet had
a slight positive effect, while no participant reported any negative effects
of the sleep booklet.

_3.3. Primary symptom outcome – insomnia severity_

Descriptive data for insomnia severity at each time point are shown
in Table 2. At baseline, there was no statistically significant difference in
insomnia severity between the intervention group and the control group
(Mann-Whitney U = 48, p > 0.05). A group comparison of change in
insomnia severity over all four timepoints revealed an overall statisti­
cally significant interaction effect in favor of the intervention group
(Wald χ[2 ]= 30.0, p < 0.001). The results were the same in the sensitivity
analyses (Wald χ[2 ]= 25.5, p < 0.001). The intervention group showed a
steady decrease in insomnia symptoms and had statistically significantly
lower levels of such symptoms at post-treatment (d = 1.6) and at followup assessments (9 months, d = 3.6; 18 months, d = 4.1) compared with
at baseline. The active control group had fluctuating levels of insomnia
symptoms across the three timepoints after treatment and symptom
levels were statistically significantly lowered only at post-treatment (d
= 1.1) and the 18-month follow-up (d = 1.5) compared with at baseline.
When comparing absolute insomnia levels at each timepoint, the inter­
vention group had statistically significantly lower levels at the 9-month
follow-up (d = − 1.5), but not at post-treatment (d = 0.1) or the 18

month follow-up assessments (d = − 0.6).
There were no statistically significant differences between the
intervention and control groups concerning treatment response (χ[2 ] =
0.04–3.90, p > 0.05) or remission rates (χ[2 ]= 0.3–4.7, p > 0.05) at any
assessment point. In the intervention group, there were 2 (20%) re­
mitters and 3 (30%) responders at post-treatment, 5 (50%) remitters and
3 (30%) responders at the 9-month follow-up and 2 (20%) remitters and
5 (50%) responders at the 18-month follow-up. In the control group,
there were 1 (9%), 1 (9%), and 3 (27%) remitters, and 2 (18%), 1 (9%),
and 2 (18%) responders, respectively, at the corresponding timepoints.

_3.4. Secondary symptom outcomes – symptoms of prolonged grief,_
_depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and grief rumination_

Descriptive data for the secondary outcomes for each measurement
time point are shown in Table 2. There were no differences between the
groups at baseline on the secondary measures of prolonged grief,
depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, except that grief rumi­
nation was more common in the control group (Mann-Whitney _U_ =
85.5, p > 0.05).
Group comparisons over all four timepoints revealed no overall
statistically significant interaction effects for any of the secondary
outcome measures (Wald χ[2 ]= 3.2–7.3, p > 0.05), except for the anxiety
measure (χ[2 ]= 15.36, p < 0.01). However, there was a general trend in
the treatment group for having a better outcome than the control group

**4. Discussion**

This study showed positive results regarding feasibility, accept­
ability, and preliminary efficacy of iCBT-i in bereaved parents 1 to 5
years after the loss of a child to cancer.
The study provided evidence for feasibility and acceptability, with
the treatment group reported satisfaction with the treatment and stating
that they would recommend it to a friend. The majority reported that it
had positive effects and no one reported any negative effects. However,
two individuals had wanted more support during sleep restriction.
Although the treatment was reported by some parents to be timeconsuming, the parents reported that they were sleeping better. In
addition, several participants appreciated the support from the
therapist.
The score for satisfaction with the iCBT-i, as reported in the CSQ-8,
was 24.1, which is good and comparable to previous studies on
internet-based CBT-i, which reported between 23.1 and 27.3 for the
same measure (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al., 2015b; Kaldo et al.,
2015). The participants in this study had completed a smaller number of
modules, 38%, as compared with those in previous studies, where
completion ranged from 68% to 82% (Blom et al., 2015a; Blom et al.,
2015b; Kaldo et al., 2015), and a smaller number of homework assign­
ments: 39% compared with 68% in Kaldo et al. (2015). However, 70% of
the individuals in this study completed the main assignments on sleep
restriction and stimulus control. Overall, the comparison suggested a
somewhat lower level of adherence in this study. There could be many
reasons for this. The bereaved parents in this study had high symptoms
levels, such as depression, posttraumatic stress and prolonged grief,
compared with a larger overlapping sample by Pohlkamp et al. (2019).
This suggests that the parents in this study were heavily burdened by
their loss, with a lot of comorbid symptoms, and might have found it
difficult to complete this version of CBT-i. The initial motivation might
have been lower in this study, possibly influenced by the recruitment
method: parents were offered treatment due to their participation in a
survey, without having actively sought it, as they would have in regular
care or when responding to an advertisement for a clinical trial. Also, the
two therapists were rather inexperienced with both internet-delivered
treatment and CBT for insomnia. However, they had university-level
training in CBT and were supervised by a licensed psychologist.
Furthermore, the numbers of messages sent between the therapists and
the participants were at a similar level as those reported by Kaldo et al.
(2015) and Blom et al. (2015a).
The treatment group improved significantly, with large within-group
effect sizes for the primary outcome, insomnia severity. There was a
pattern of an overall greater reduction of insomnia severity for the
treatment group if seen over all three follow-ups. However, the betweengroup effect size at post-treatment was very small for the primary
outcome and there were rather large fluctuations over the follow-up
time-points, most probably due to the small number of participants.
The secondary outcomes (prolonged grief, depression, posttraumatic
stress, anxiety, and grief rumination) showed positive results with small
to large effect sizes, although the overall change in symptoms compared
with the control group was not statistically significant, except in the case
of anxiety. The active control group also improved significantly, with
small to large effect sizes for the primary and secondary outcomes. The
treatment group had significantly lower levels of psychological symp­
toms than the control group at the 18-month follow-up, except for
insomnia severity, where the difference was not statistically significant.
The positive effect of iCBT-i in adults is well-known (Seyffert et al.,
2016), but this is the first study examining its effect in bereaved parents.
The main finding is that the insomnia treatment ameliorated insomnia
severity in bereaved parents. Interestingly, it was indicated that the
comorbid symptoms improved in the long term as well. The treatment
group had significantly lower symptom levels than the control group at


the 18-month follow-up, which indicates that the effect was not due
merely to symptoms levels abating in a natural bereavement process.
The effects included an improvement in grief rumination, which has not
been examined previously. Though there is a well-established associa­
tion between rumination and sleep disturbances (Pillai and Drake,
2015), only one previous study has examined the association between
grief rumination and insomnia symptoms, showing a moderate associ­
ation (Sveen et al., 2019).
Our results are in line with previous studies, suggesting that treating
insomnia with CBT-i is possible even when comorbid conditions are
present and, furthermore, that it seems to reduce the comorbid symp­
toms. For example, treating insomnia in adults with comorbid depres­
sion improves not only insomnia severity, but also symptoms of
depression (Blom et al., 2015a; van der Zweerde et al., 2019), and
treating posttraumatic stress disorder with CBT and CBT-i for sleep
disturbances reduces symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Ho et al., 2016).
However, this has not been examined in bereaved individuals with
prolonged grief disorder. A tentative conclusion from this study is that
treating insomnia reduces symptoms of prolonged grief disorder.

_4.1. Study limitations and strengths_

A limitation of this study was the small sample size and low statistical
power. The study needs to be replicated in larger samples. We had aimed
for a sample size of 60 participants, but could not recruit that many with
the current recruitment method. Only 59 individuals out of the 232 who
responded to the survey (i.e. 25%) signaled an interest in receiving more
information about the current study. This indicates that the demand for
this type of treatment, i.e. in the internet self-help format and not
focused on the primary problem (bereavement), could be rather low in
the group we targeted and that future studies should use a broader
recruitment or offer the treatment in another context. In addition, future
studies could compare iCBT-i with face-to-face CBT-i to examine
whether face-to-face treatment is more feasible in this population. Also,
lower response rates at the follow-ups make the results less certain. On
the primary outcome, the attrition was 10–40% in the intervention
group and 27–36% in the control group. Hence, the results should be
interpreted with caution, although our sensitivity analyses on the pri­
mary outcome did not indicate different results. A limitation is that may
be a recall bias of adverse events as the interview was conducted one
month post-treatment. A strength is that the risk for so-called therapist
drift, i.e., that the therapist changes the contents of the treatment along
the way, was minimized, as the therapeutic content in the intervention
largely consisted of standardized self-help material. Another strength
was that the active control group never received the CBT-i treatment;
hence, we could compare the groups at the long-term follow-ups.

_4.2. Clinical implications_

Many bereaved parents have multiple psychological symptoms,
including sleep problems, for many years after their loss. The present
study showed that iCBT-i appears to be feasible and acceptable for
bereaved parents who agree to try this treatment format. However, they
may need support and encouragement from a therapist, especially when
it comes to sleep restriction, which can be very demanding. Further­
more, this study yielded preliminary results that treating insomnia has a
positive effect on insomnia severity and also indicated positive effects on
other psychological symptoms, such as prolonged grief, depression,
anxiety, posttraumatic stress and grief rumination, in bereaved parents.
Taken together with previous findings (van Straten et al., 2018; Wu
et al., 2015), which show that insomnia can be effectively treated
despite comorbidity, the results of this study provide support that this is
the case also for bereaved individuals with insomnia. Thus, CBT-i could
be implemented within bereavement care. Further studies on the effect
of CBT-i in bereaved samples are needed both in samples with large
comorbid problems and in bereaved individuals with low comorbid

symptom levels.

**5. Conclusions**

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the feasibility
and efficacy of iCBT-i in bereaved parents. The study suggested that the
treatment is feasible and there were no reported adverse effects. The
results showed preliminary evidence that iCBT-i can effectively alleviate
insomnia, and to some extent comorbid problems, in bereaved parents,
and could thus be offered to bereaved parents with comorbid symptoms.
However, on insomnia severity the effect fluctuated rather much and
was very small (d = 0.1) at post-treatment, but large at the 9 months
follow-up (d = 3.6). Further research in larger samples and to clarify the
specific relationship between insomnia and the comorbid symptoms is
crucial. Given the high levels of insomnia and psychological symptoms
in bereaved parents, this burdened group deserves more attention.
