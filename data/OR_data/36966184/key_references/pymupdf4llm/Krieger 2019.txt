39 **Abstract**

40 **Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) for insomnia**


41 comprising different sleep-related cognitive and behavioral interventional components has

42 shown some promise. However, it is not known which components are necessary for a good

43 treatment outcome.


44 **Method: People suffering from insomnia (N = 104) without any other comorbid psychiatric**

45 disorders were randomized (2:2:1) to two guided internet-based self-help interventions for

46 insomnia (multi-component cognitive behavioral self-help intervention [MCT]; sleep

47 restriction intervention for insomnia [SRT]), and care as usual [CAU]. In all three conditions,

48 additional care or treatment was allowed. The primary outcome was insomnia severity

49 measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at eight weeks. Furthermore, the two active

50 conditions were compared regarding sleep efficacy from daily diary data over the eight

51 weeks, and other measures from the daily protocols. Secondary outcomes included sleep

52 quality, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, and quality of life at post-treatment

53 (eight weeks) and follow-up (six months after randomization).

54 **Results: Both conditions were more effective than CAU at post-treatment, with medium to**

55 large between-group effect sizes on the primary outcome (ISI; MCT: Cohen's d = -1.15; SRT:

56 _d = -0.68) and small to medium between-group effect sizes for secondary outcomes._

57 Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Active conditions did not differ from

58 each other on all measures from pre to post, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and

59 sleep protocol data throughout the intervention. Participants in MCT were significantly more

60 satisfied with the intervention than participants in SRT.

61 **Conclusions: Results of the present study indicate that CAU + MCT and CAU + SRT are**

62 both effective compared to CAU. There were no statistical differences regarding efficacy

63 between the two active conditions, but participants in MCT reported to be more satisfied with

64 the intervention.

69 **1. INTRODUCTION**

70 Insomnia is a significant public health problem, with one-third of the adult population


71 reporting symptoms of insomnia, and approximately 10% meeting diagnostic criteria for an


72 insomnia disorder (Ohayon, 2002, Simon and VonKorff, 1997, Morin and Jarrin, 2013).

73 Problems related to sleep, affect daily cognitive performance as well as mood, which in turn

74 affect quality of life as well as work productivity (Walsh, 2004). Insomnia has been proposed

75 to be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of many mental health disorders (Harvey

76 et al., 2011). As a consequence, insomnia is responsible for high social costs and the

77 economic burden of insomnia is very high, with the largest proportion of all expenses

78 attributable to insomnia-related work absences and reduced productivity (Daley et al., 2009).

79 Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychological treatment that targets

80 the maladaptive behaviors and dysfunctional thoughts that perpetuate sleep problems. CBT-I

81 is one of the most effective treatments for insomnia (Trauer et al., 2015, van der Zweerde et

82 al., 2018). A so-called multi-component therapy consisting of several aspects is recommended

83 by the current guidelines of both the American and European sleep societies (Riemann et al.,

84 2017, Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008). Typically, CBT-I consists of several components such as

85 stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive

86 restructuring (Perlis et al., 2010, Morin et al., 2006, Okajima et al., 2011). Of note, CBT-I has

87 also shown to have considerable treatment effects for depression comorbid with insomnia

88 (Cunningham and Shapiro, 2018, Wu et al., 2015).

89 Although a multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown to be effective, it is not

90 clear which components of a multi-component therapy are most helpful to treat insomnia

91 successfully. For example, there is empirical evidence that psychoeducation and sleep

92 hygiene are not likely to be effective components of a successful insomnia treatment (Morin

93 et al., 1994).

94 Several studies have investigated which components specifically contribute to treatment

95 outcome. In dismantling studies in a face-to-face setting, sleep restriction has shown to be one

96 of the most effective of these components (Spielman et al., 1987, Youngstedt and Kripke,

97 2004, Morin et al., 2006, Harvey et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2014). A recent review concluded

98 that sleep restriction is an effective single behavioral intervention for the treatment of

99 insomnia for sleep diary variables (Miller et al., 2014). Epstein and colleagues (Epstein et al.,

100 2012) conducted a dismantling study in older adults suffering from insomnia to compare


-----

#### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


101 multi-component therapy, sleep restriction alone, and stimulus control alone, to a waitlist

102 control group. They found initial evidence that stimulus control, sleep restriction, and multi

103 component therapy are equally efficacious. However, multicomponent therapy showed higher

104 remission rates and should, therefore, be recommended. Similarly, a study by Harvey et al.

105 (Harvey et al., 2014) compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with cognitive therapy

106 (CT) and behavior therapy (BT) in chronic insomnia and showed significant improvements


107 across all three treatment conditions. The authors found the greatest improvement for

108 insomniacs in the CBT group, while improvements in the BT group were faster but less

109 enduring and in the CT group improvements were delayed in action but more sustained.

110 Unfortunately, the availability of CBT-I is severely limited for many reasons, including lack

111 of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, expense,

112 and inaccessibility to treatment and clinicians (e.g., van Straten and Cuijpers, 2009). Online

113 interventions represent a potential solution to overcome several of the barriers to treatment

114 access (Andersson and Titov, 2014). Several randomized controlled studies of internet-based

115 self-help treatments for insomnia (iCBT-I) have shown its efficacy (e.g., van Straten et al.,

116 2014, Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ritterband et al., 2009), and recent meta-analyses (Seyffert et al.,

117 2016, Zachariae et al., 2016, Ye et al., 2016) show good results with large effects on insomnia

118 severity, and medium effects for sleep efficiency and sleep quality. There is evidence that

119 guided self-help interventions show better results compared to unguided interventions,

120 irrespective of whether it is internet-based or not (Jernelöv et al., 2012, Ho et al., 2014).

121 Regarding dismantling studies in online interventions, Kaldo and colleagues (Kaldo et al.,

122 2015) compared eight weeks of a guided multi-component iCBT-I with an active internet
123 based control treatment consisting of components with less empirical support for the

124 treatment of insomnia such as sleep hygiene, relaxation, mindfulness, and general stress

125 management. Notably, these components were only presented in an abbreviated form, and

126 there was no guidance. Multi-component ICBT was significantly more effective after eight

127 weeks. However, the two conditions did not differ anymore after 12 months due to a

128 continuous decrease in ISI among controls. A very recent study showed that a multi
129 component therapy is more efficacious than online sleep education across a range of

130 demographic groups (Cheng et al., 2018).

131 In summary, even though a considerable number of studies show positive effects for guided

132 internet interventions for insomnia, there is still a lack of knowledge about which components

133 of a multicomponent treatment are essential for the positive effects, and whether all


-----

134 components are necessary for an effective treatment. The current study aims to compare sleep

135 restriction, which is one crucial behavioral component of CBT-I, and a multi-component


136 cognitive behavioral treatment with an active waiting list control group. Furthermore, it aims

137 to compare the two active conditions. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that


138 compare two different forms of guided iCBT-I and the first study that investigates guided

139 internet-based sleep restriction.

140 **2. METHODS**

141 **_2.1 Study design_**

142 This study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two immediate

143 treatment groups to an active waiting list control group. All groups had access to CAU and

144 the waiting list control group was enrolled in the iCBT-I program after the active treatment

145 groups had completed the programme (after eight weeks). The immediate treatment group

146 was followed up for six months after randomization. We wanted to be able to detect a

147 standardized between-group effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.35. Smaller effect sizes were

148 considered to be irrelevant from a clinical point of view. A power analysis based on an

149 anticipated drop-out rate of 25% revealed that approximately 90 participants were needed per

150 active treatment group to show such an effect with a power (1-β) of .80 compared to the

151 control condition. Furthermore, 40 participants were estimated to be sufficient for the control

152 condition because effect sizes between the control condition and treatment groups were

153 assumed to be largely based on the previous trials, resulting in a sample size of 225

154 participants. For practicality reasons, we had to finish the recruitment procedure when 104

155 participants were randomized, therefore limiting our ability to detect small to medium

156 between-group effect sizes.

157 **_2.2 Participants and Procedure_**

158 Participants were recruited from June 2016 to July 2017 through newspaper advertisements,

159 online postings, flyers, and physician referrals. Inclusion criteria were a) age of 18 years or

160 older, b) meeting criteria for acute or chronic insomnia according to the International

161 Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014), c)

162 having access to the internet, d) good knowledge of the German language. Exclusion criteria

163 were a) known organic insomnia (e.g., due to restless legs syndrome, breathing-related sleep

164 disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), b) psychiatric comorbidities according to the


-----

#### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


165 MINI interview (Ackenheil et al., 1999), and c) acute suicidality. After consenting to study

166 participation and meeting the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria (assessed via the

167 baseline online questionnaire and an interview via telephone), participants were randomly


168 assigned to one of the three conditions (2:2:1). The allocation list was made using a

169 computerized random number generator and was concealed from the investigators and

170 participants. After the randomization, the participants received an email regarding their


171 allocation. All participants in the active conditions were advised to work through one session

172 per week and to start a new session after receiving weekly feedback by their guide. After

173 eight weeks, all participants were asked to fill out the post-assessment questionnaires online

174 and to participate in a second telephone interview to re-evaluate their diagnostic status. The

175 assessors could not be kept blind regarding group allocation because some participants

176 revealed information about the treatment during the interview. Six months after the beginning

177 of treatment, participants were contacted via email and asked to fill out the questionnaires

178 again and to take part in another interview. The trial was registered with

179 www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03110263) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the

180 Canton of Bern, Switzerland (2016-00295).

181 **_2.3 Primary outcome measures_**

182 The primary outcome of the present study was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for the

183 comparisons between the three conditions. Also, we used sleep efficacy (SE) reported by the

184 participants during the intervention in the morning protocol for the comparison between the

185 two active conditions.

186 **_Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)._** Insomnia severity was assessed with the Insomnia Severity

187 Index (ISI) (Bastien et al., 2001). Participants indicate the severity of sleep onset difficulties,

188 sleep maintenance difficulties, early morning awakening, satisfaction with current sleep,

189 interference with daytime functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to sleep

190 problems, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem for the previous

191 week. The German version of the ISI has shown acceptable psychometric properties (Gerber

192 et al., 2016). Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. Cronbach’s alpha at post was .83.

193 **_Sleep efficacy (SE)._** Participants in the two active conditions were asked to fill out an evening

194 and a morning protocol daily during the intervention phase to assess different parameters of

195 their sleep and its consequences. The protocols were in line with the protocols of the German


-----

#### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


196 Association for Sleep Research and Sleep medicine (DGSM). We assessed SE with data from

197 the morning protocol for every night during the treatment period.


198 **_2.4 Secondary outcome measures_**

199 Secondary outcomes included the following measures: Overall sleep quality was measured

200 with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989, Riemann and Backhaus,


201 1996). To assess maladaptive beliefs in insomnia, we used the 16-item version of the

202 Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) scale (Morin et al., 2007, Weingartz

203 and Pillmann, 2009). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the German short version of the

204 Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977), the

205 “Allgemeine Depressions‐Skala – Kurzform” (ADS-K) (Hautzinger and Bailer, 1993). To

206 assess the quality of life participants were asked how good or bad their health is on a visual

207 analog scale (QoL-VAS) from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health

208 you can imagine) (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman et al., 2011). At post-treatment, we assessed an

209 adapted version of a patient satisfaction questionnaire, the ZUF-8 (Schmidt et al., 1989). This

210 brief and reliable instrument was originally developed as a translation of the Client

211 Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson and Greenfield, 2004). As well, user

212 satisfaction was measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996).

213 **_Sleep protocol._** As described above, we assessed different variables with 1-item Likert-scale

214 questions in both active conditions using daily morning and evening protocols by the German

215 Association for Sleep Research and Sleep medicine (DGSM) within each of the internet-based

216 programs. Sleep quality (1 “very good” – 5 “very bad”), recovery (1 “very recovered” – 5

217 “very unrecovered”) and tiredness before going to bed (1 “not tired at all” – 5 “very tired”)

218 were assessed in the morning protocol. Daytime tiredness (1 “no daytime tiredness” – 8

219 “strong daytime tiredness”), concentration (1 “very unconcentrated” – 8 “very concentrated”),

220 mood (1 “very bad mood” – 8 “very good mood”), and relaxation (1 “unrelaxed” – 8 “very

221 relaxed”) were assessed in the evening protocol.

222 **_Diagnostic measures. Assessors interviewed participants via telephone at baseline (M.I.N.I_**

223 and ICSD-3). The German Version of the M.I.N.I. (Ackenheil et al., 1999) screened for

224 possible psychiatric comorbidities. The ICSD-3 (American Academy of Sleep Medicine,

225 2014) provides specific coding information for an insomnia diagnosis (Mayer et al., 2015).

226 Participants were interviewed at post-intervention to check whether they still fulfilled the

227 criteria for insomnia. Eight advanced master students in clinical psychology and the second

228 author conducted the interviews. All of the assessors had been trained in using the interviews

229 in a workshop including test interviews and feedback and were supervised by the second


230 author.

231 **_2.5 Description of conditions_**

232 **_Multicomponent internet-based guided treatment (MCT). The self-help program consists of_**


233 eight text-based sessions and tasks (see Table 1) and is based on interventions by Perlis et al.

234 (Perlis et al., 2006). The psychoeducational component covers information about the

235 processes of sleep, sleep hygiene and general information on stress management. The

236 behavioral techniques include sleep restriction (i.e., reducing the sleep window to enhance

237 sleep consolidation), stimulus control (e.g., getting out of bed after a certain time of

238 wakefulness), and relaxation (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation). The cognitive techniques

239 included belief restructuring (e.g., targeting unrealistic beliefs about sleep). Comparable

240 MCTs have already been successfully evaluated in other studies (Holmqvist et al., 2014,

241 Blom et al., 2015, van Straten et al., 2014). All participants received guidance during 8-weeks

242 of treatment. Guidance consisted of weekly messages in an integrated secured environment of

243 guides who monitored the participant’s progress in the program and provided feedback and

244 structure. The participants could also use the integrated message function to contact their

245 guide whenever they felt the need to and were informed that the guide would answer within

246 three working days. The main aim of the guides’ messages was to reinforce the independent

247 program use and maintain the participant’s motivation. When a participant was inactive for a

248 week, the guide offered support with the respective module.

249 **_Internet-based guided sleep restriction treatment (SRT). The 8-week treatment program_**

250 mainly consists of sleep restriction instructions that are embedded in an introductory and

251 psychoeducational module (see Table 1). Sleep restriction induces mild sleep deprivation to

252 enhance the endogenous sleep drive. A sleep window was proposed depending on the time a

253 participant wanted to get up. Every week, a new sleep window was calculated based on the

254 participants’ sleep diary data together with the participant to select the timing of the window

255 (e.g., earlier versus later in the night). A more lenient sleep window was suggested for

256 moderate-to-severe tiredness. The sleep window was regularly reviewed at each module after

257 it had been introduced. If the sleep diary data indicate a sleep efficiency of 90% or higher, the

258 participant was advised to add 30 min to the sleep window (Morin et al., 2006, Perlis et al.,

259 2010, Riemann and Spiegelhalder, 2015). The minimum sleep window for this intervention


-----

#### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


260 was set at six hours (Müller and Paterok, 2010). Guidance was the same as in the

261 multicomponent internet-based treatment (see also below).


262 **_Care as usual (CAU). Participants in the control group received access to the MCT program_**

263 after a waiting period of 8 weeks, at post-treatment of the active treatment conditions.

264 Because participants were allowed to use other resources from the healthcare system during


265 the study, we labeled this group as care-as-usual (CAU).

266 **_2.6 Guidance_**

267 The guides were one psychologist with a Master’s degree in clinical psychology in his first

268 year of a post-graduate CBT training program and eight Master students who were in their

269 last term of a graduate program in clinical psychology. All guides had an introduction to both

270 online interventions and training of the principals of iCBT. Furthermore, they were supervised

271 by the second and the last author and received support regarding email correspondence when

272 needed. For this, the guides contacted the second and the last author when needed. In the case

273 of uncertainties, the co-authors from the Sleep-Wake-Epilepsy-Center were asked for

274 additional advice. To ensure adherence, the second author regularly screened the content of

275 all messages sent. Participants were consecutively allocated to guides without randomization

276 to minimize waiting times. All guides provided guidance in both conditions.

277 **_2.7 Statistical analyses_**

278 All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS or R (R Core Team, 2018) and the

279 packages nlme (Pinheiro et al., 2018). ANOVAs and ??[2]-tests were used to detect differences

280 in baseline data. To compare the two active treatments with the waiting list, we analyzed all

281 primary and secondary outcome measures with mixed-effect models using unstructured

282 covariance matrices and restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with time-points

283 nested within subjects. This approach uses all available data of each subject without

284 substituting missing values and allows the inclusion of all participants in the analyses,

285 following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The models were further examined using

286 contrast analyses. Within- and between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated based

287 on estimated means and the pooled standard deviation from the observed means. We

288 compared the two active treatments on the basis of daily diary entries (max. 56) in the

289 program during the eight weeks (scaled from 0 to 1). Within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d)

290 were calculated based on the estimated means at the beginning and after eight weeks and the


-----

291 pooled SD throughout the 56 days. Within-group changes in outcome scores from post
292 treatment to follow-up were analyzed with mixed-effect models and REML for the active


293 conditions only, as the CAU group was offered the online intervention after eight weeks.

294 Participants were considered responders if their ISI change score compared with baseline was


295 greater than seven at post, and treatment remitters if their absolute ISI score at post was less

296 than eight, following previous recommendations (Morin et al., 2009). Applying a

297 conservative approach, we defined all missing data for response, remission and diagnostic

298 status as unchanged from baseline, i.e., first observation carried forward.

299 **3. RESULTS**

300 **_3.1 Baseline differences_**

301 Participants did not differ in primary and secondary outcomes or any demographic or

302 diagnostic variables (see Table 2) between the three conditions.

303 **_3.2 Study dropout analysis_**

304 In total, 16 of 104 participants (15.4%) did not complete the post-assessment questionnaires,

305 although they had been invited three times at weekly intervals via email. Non-completion

306 rates did not differ with respect to experimental group, ??[2](2, n=104) = 2.34, p = .31, V =

307 0.15, nor demographic data, nor baseline symptomatology (all p’s > .40).

308 **_3.3 Overall effects and pairwise comparisons at post-treatment_**

309 Observed and estimated means for all self-report measures assessed at baseline and post are

310 presented in Table 3. Linear mixed models with group as a fixed factor and time as a repeated

311 factor (pre--post) were fitted separately for each of the dependent measures. Significant group

312 _x time interaction effects were found for all primary and secondary outcomes, except for_

313 quality of life assessed with the QoL-VAS. Bonferroni-corrected consecutive contrast

314 analyses for models with a significant interaction effect, showed that both active treatments

315 were significantly superior to CAU on all involved measures except depressive symptoms and

316 quality of life. Regarding depressive symptoms assessed with the ADS-K, only the MCT

317 condition proved to be significantly superior to CAU (p = .012) while the SRT was not

318 significantly different from CAU (p = .168). Regarding quality of life, the MCT group

319 significantly differed from CAU (p = .020) while the SRT group did not differ from CAU (p

320 = .207). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the active conditions on

321 primary and secondary outcomes, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep assessed with

322 the DBAS-16. Here, the MCT group showed significantly lower scores indicating less


323 dysfunctional beliefs compared to the SRT group (p = .045).

324 **_3.4 Effect sizes at post-treatment_**

325 Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are presented in Table 3. For the ISI, the between-group effect sizes


326 at post-treatment were d = -0.46 for MCT vs. SRT (in favor of MCT), d = 1.15 for MCT vs.

327 CAU (in favor of MCT), and d = -.68 for SRT vs. CAU (in favor of SRT). For the ISI, within
328 group comparisons revealed large effect sizes in MCT (d = 1.62) and SRT (d = 1.41), and a

329 medium effect size for CAU (d = 0.64).

330 **_3.5 Response, remission, and deterioration_**

331 Regarding response (change in ISI > 7), 9.5% of the participants in the CAU (n = 2), 31.7% in

332 the SRT (n = 13), and 40.5% (n = 17) in the MCT condition were considered responders at

333 post-treatment. Significantly more cases in the MCT showed response compared to CAU,

334 ??[2](1, n=63) = 6.37, p = .012, V = 0.32. This was not the case for the SRT group compared to

335 CAU, ??[2](1, n=62) = 3.73, p = .054, V = 0.25. However, the two active conditions did not

336 significantly differ between each other ??[2](1, n=83) = 0.69, p = .41, V = 0.09.

337 Regarding remission (ISI post score < 8), 4.8% of the participants in the CAU (n = 1), 24.4%

338 in the SRT (n = 10), and 38.1% (n = 16) in the MCT condition were considered remitted at

339 post-treatment. Significantly more cases in the MCT remitted compared to the CAU, ??[2](1,

340 _n=63) = 7.90, p = .005, V = 0.35. This was not the case for the SRT group compared to the_

341 CAU, ??[2](1, n=62) = 3.67, p = .056, V = 0.24. Again, the two active groups did not differ

342 from each other ??[2](1, n=83) = 1.81, p = .178, V = 0.15.

343 No participant in any condition showed a reliable deterioration on the ISI (difference of 8 or

344 more) at post compared to the baseline score.

345 **_3.6 Diagnostic status at post-treatment_**

346 In total, 86 participants could be reached for a second clinical interview after the treatment

347 (MCT: n = 35 [83.3%]; SRT: n = 31 [75.6%]; and CAU: n = 20 [95.2%]). Results in the

348 intention-to-treat sample indicated that 81% (n = 17) in CAU, 52.4% (n = 22) in MCT, and

349 48.8% (n = 20) in SRT still fulfilled the criteria for an insomnia according to the ICSD-3

350 criteria at post-assessment. The groups differed significantly regarding the diagnostic status at


-----

351 post, ??[2](2, N=104) = 6.40, p = .04, V = 0.25. Both active groups showed fewer people still

352 suffering from insomnia than in the control condition, p’s < .028. The two treatments did not


353 significantly differ from each other at post-assessment, ??[2](1, n=83) = 0.11, p = .74, V = -0.04.

354 **_3.7 Comparing the two active treatments based on daily protocols_**

355 Participants in both active conditions were instructed to complete a daily protocol. Based on


356 these daily assessments we ran separate mixed models analyses with group and days (0-55),

357 recoded as Time from 0 to 1, and its interaction from baseline to post-assessment (eight

358 weeks) assuming a linear change for all protocol items. Results are presented in Table 4. All

359 interactions regarding the primary (sleep efficacy) and most secondary outcomes (sleep

360 _quality, feeling unrecovered, daytime tiredness, concentration, mood, and relaxation) were_

361 non-significant (all p’s > .10). An exception was tiredness when going to bed (p = .003),

362 which remained stable in MCT but increased significantly in SRT. Within- and between
363 group effect sizes were mostly in the small to medium range and can be seen in Table 4.

364 **_3.8 Maintenance of treatment effects at 6-month follow-up_**

365 All analyses in this section only include the two active conditions, as the CAU group had

366 already received access to the treatment after eight weeks. Mixed models analyses including

367 pre, post and follow-up scores (see Table 3) showed significant time effects for all scales

368 assessed at follow-up (ISI, PSQI, ADS-K, EQ_VAS), all ps < .027. Contrast analyses indicate

369 that follow-up scores improved from baseline, and post hoc tests using Bonferroni-correction

370 indicate stability from post-treatment to follow-up, as no significant differences were

371 detected. All Time X Group interactions were non-significant, F(2, 54.56-68.00) = 0.15-1.00,

372 all ps ≥ .35, therefore through all time points, neither of the conditions proved to be

373 significantly superior.

374 **_3.9 Diagnostic status at follow-up_**

375 Regarding insomnia diagnostic status at follow-up, 30 of 42 (71.4%) in the MCT and 24 of

376 41(58.5%) in the SRT condition could be reached for a diagnostic interview. Again using a

377 conservative approach defining missings as unchanged from baseline, 20 participants of 42

378 (47.6%) in the MCT condition and 25 of 41 participants (61.0%) in the SRT condition

379 fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at follow-up. This difference, however, was not statistically

380 significant, ??[2](1, n=83) = 1.49, p = .22, V = 0.13.

381 **_3.10 Patient Satisfaction_**

382 Regarding the ZUF-8 assessed after eight weeks, participants in the MCT (M = 3.42, SD =


383 0.55) condition showed significantly higher levels of satisfaction than participants in the SRT

384 (M = 2.99, SD = 0.57), t(65.92)=3.23, p = .002. Regarding usability assessed with the SUS,

385 the two interventions were rated equally, MCT: M = 4.39, SD = 0.60; SRT: M = 4.18, SD =


386 0.64; t(66)=1.43, p = .16.

387 **_3.11 Program usage_**

388 The average of completed modules in MCT was 6.66 (SD = 2.12) out of eight, mean

389 completed modules in SRT was 4.61 (SD = 0.80) out of five, over the eight weeks. For time

390 spent in the program, the median was 7.57 h in MCT, and 5.32 h in SRT. Using a non
391 parametric U-test, this difference was statistically significant p = .008.

392 Regarding the usage of the sleep restriction module, the median for time spent in this module

393 was 14.7 min in MCT and 13.0 min in SRT for all participants. Using a U-Test, this

394 difference was not significant, p = .45. Relatedly, for the number of adjustments of the sleep

395 window, the median was three in the MCT and two in the SRT. This difference was also not

396 significant, p = .57.

397 **_3.12 Guidance_**

398 On average, therapists wrote 9.66 messages (SD = 3.19, Md = 10) in MCT and 10.05

399 messages (SD = 3.38, Md = 10) in SRT. This difference was not significant, U = 757.5, p =

400 .44. Participants wrote on average 5.44 messages (SD = 4.10, Md = 5) in MCT and 6.12 in

401 SRT (SD = 5.81, Md = 5). This difference was not statistically significant, U = 836.0, p = .97.

402 The two groups furthermore did not differ regarding the number of words written by

403 participants (MCT: Md = 508; SRT: Md = 427; U = 755.0, p = .43) nor by therapists (MCT:

404 _Md = 1484; SRT: Md = 1494; U = 820.0, p = .85)._

405 **4. DISCUSSION**

406 The current study set out to compare two guided internet-based interventions to a waiting-list

407 control group for people suffering from insomnia. Both active groups showed significant

408 differences compared to the control group regarding the primary outcome. As such, the

409 present study adds to the growing literature of the efficacy of internet-based interventions for

410 insomnia also in people not suffering from other psychiatric conditions. Quality of life did not

411 increase compared to the waiting-list control condition in both active conditions. One reason

412 could be that potential participants with comorbid psychological disorders were excluded.


413 However, this finding has been reported in a previous study on iCBT-I with or without phone

414 support in which comorbid psychological disorders were not excluded and not assessed (Ho et


415 al., 2014).

416 Concerning the comparison of the two active conditions, the results of the present study

417 provide preliminary evidence that a multicomponent treatment (MCT condition) is not

418 superior with regard to insomnia severity to an intervention that focuses on sleep restriction

419 and omits working on dysfunctional cognitions (SRT condition). This was the case for

420 comparisons of insomnia severity at post as well as at follow-up assessment. However, results

421 indicate that the MCT group benefited significantly more regarding dysfunctional sleep
422 related beliefs. The additional module on cognitive restructuring could have caused this

423 difference. Additionally, on a descriptive level but not at a statistical level more people in

424 MCT compared to the SRT condition no longer fulfilled the criteria for insomnia at six

425 months. This is in line with results found in traditional CBT-I (Epstein et al., 2012, Harvey et

426 al., 2014).

427 Regarding depressive symptoms, only MCT proved to be superior to the control condition;

428 this was not the case for SRT. This might also be due to the extra module on cognitive

429 restructuring. However, the results of the present study on comorbid depressive symptoms

430 may be underestimated, if comorbid major depression had been permitted in the present

431 study. Nevertheless, the result that MCT may have a stronger effect on depressive symptoms

432 seems important because a recent RCT in people suffering from symptoms of depression and

433 insomnia revealed that ICBT-I is effective in the reduction of depressive symptoms (van der

434 Zweerde et al., 2018). This result is also consistent with another study showing that patients

435 who suffer from insomnia and depression profit highly from insomnia treatment (Blom et al.,

436 2017). The result of the present study suggests that cognitive restructuring may play an

437 important role.

438 A sleep restriction module was part of both active interventions. A review of treatment studies

439 for insomnia showed that the absolute minimal sleep window – also called “minimal time in

440 bed” – can vary considerably (Kyle et al., 2015). This is important since sleep restriction

441 treatment can be associated with reduced objective total sleep time, increased daytime

442 tiredness, and objective performance impairment (Kyle et al., 2014). In the present study, we

443 set the minimum sleep window at six hours. It cannot be ruled out that a shorter sleep window


-----

444 – although bearing more “pain” - would have led to more “gain” regarding treatment response

445 (Kyle et al., 2011). However, to minimize the risk of negative effects, we decided to use a


446 comparably long minimal time in bed. Future studies should systematically test the

447 association of different minimal time windows and treatment response.

448 All comparisons of different variables of sleep diary data, such as sleep efficacy, revealed no

449 significant differences between the two active conditions (all p-values > .10). However, it is

450 striking that - on a descriptive level - daytime tiredness decreased in MCT while it increased

451 in SRT throughout the interventions. Therefore, it can be assumed that more statistical power

452 would have led to a statistically significant difference between the two conditions regarding

453 daytime tiredness. More daytime tiredness should be considered a negative side effect of the

454 SRT condition. Of note, although participants had the same module on sleep restriction with

455 the same instructions and although usage of the sleep restriction module in both conditions

456 was similar, in MCT daytime tiredness decreased. One explanation for this finding could be

457 that if participants in a sleep intervention can choose from different interventions, they apply

458 the ones that work best for them or have fewer side effects. More research on which specific

459 interventions of internet-based treatments participants do apply and maintain in daily life is

460 needed.

461 Note that from a user perspective, participants in MCT were significantly more satisfied with

462 the intervention than participants in SRT. Also, more participants reported that they have a

463 specific preference for MCT (32.7%) than for SRT (5.8%) before the intervention started.

464 Considering that the amount of guidance and therefore the use of resources did not differ

465 between the two conditions, in sum, results from a patient perspective are in favor of MCT.

466 However, treatment preferences that may be associated with treatment outcome expectancies

467 could have influenced the results of the present study (Constantino et al., 2007).

468 There are some important limitations of the present study that have to be considered. First,

469 due to clinical considerations, we excluded participants if they met the criteria for a

470 psychiatric disorder. On the one hand, this limits the generalizability of our results, on the

471 other hand, the results of the present study have a higher internal validity for people suffering

472 from insomnia. Second, apart from a diagnostic interview, all measures were based on mere

473 self-report. Third, the power of the present study was not sufficient to yield significant small

474 to medium effects between the two active conditions. A future study to find significant

475 differences between these active conditions should be powered adequately. We assume that

476 small significant effects could be expected in a replication of the present study with more


-----

#### ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


477 power. The recruitment for the present study had to be discontinued since recruitment was

478 slower than expected. A reason for this slow recruitment could be that most people only seek

479 support to cope with insomnia when additional problems such as depression or anxiety arise.

480 Since we advertised that people with comorbid psychological disorders could not be included

481 in the present study, these people did not contact us. Fourth, we did not systematically assess

482 the negative effects associated with the two interventions apart from reliable deterioration.


483 Taken together, both active conditions, MCT and SRT, proved to be efficacious compared to

484 CAU alone. Also, there is preliminary evidence that MCT might be more efficient regarding

485 dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, probably due to the additional cognitive module included in

486 MCT. Furthermore, participants in MCT were more satisfied with the treatment compared to

487 participants in SRT. Considering the equally-used resources (e.g., messages sent, number of

488 words used in the messages) in both conditions, one could argue that MCT should be the

489 internet-based treatment of choice for people suffering from insomnia.

490 Highlighting the high potential health-economic benefit of providing low-threshold internet
491 based interventions for insomnia, two recent RCTs showed that improvements in insomnia

492 symptoms mediate improvements in functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep
493 related quality of life (Espie et al., 2018) and psychotic experiences and other psychological

494 symptoms (Freeman et al., 2017). Despite these encouraging results of internet-based

495 interventions for insomnia one has to bear in mind that not all people suffering from insomnia

496 can profit from internet-based interventions. In the current study, in the MCT condition,

497 around 60% did not fulfill the self-report-based criterion for remission regarding insomnia

498 severity and around 50 % still fulfilled the criteria for insomnia in a diagnostic interview at

499 post-treatment. As a consequence, research that improves existing interventions seems

500 necessary, or people who do not profit from internet-based interventions should be offered

501 complementary or other interventions in different settings. Related to the latter point, more

502 research on stepped care approaches in insomnia seems necessary. Likewise, generally more

503 research is needed in routine practice settings, such as in primary care or sleep clinics, to

504 generalize the encouraging results of internet-based treatments for insomnia.

**Highlights**

  - Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) is effective in insomnia

  - An abridged iCBT-I focusing on sleep restriction is effective in insomnia

  - The treatment gains remained stable up to 6-month follow-up

  - The effects of the two versions of iCBT-I did not differ from each other

  - Patients were more satisfied with the full version of iCBT-I
