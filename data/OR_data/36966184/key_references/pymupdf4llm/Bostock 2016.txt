 Therapy for Insomnia

### A Randomized Controlled Trial Conducted in the Workplace Environment

#### Sophie Bostock, PhD, Annemarie I. Luik, PhD, and Colin A. Espie, PhD


Objective: Evaluating digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) for
insomnia in a workplace environment. Methods: Within a randomized
controlled trial in a Fortune 500 company, we randomized 270 self-identified
poor sleepers [180 M/90 F: mean age 33.6 years (23 to 56 years)] to dCBT
(n ¼ 135) or waiting list (WL, n ¼ 135). dCBT comprised six online sessions
delivered by an animated therapist. Major assessments were at baseline and
posttreatment. Results: Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) scores were significantly higher for the dCBT group [interaction term: F (1,485) ¼ 15.63,
P < 0.0001], representing Cohen’s d of 1.10 following dCBT (d ¼ 0.34 for
WL). On the Work Productivity and Impairment questionnaire, ‘‘presenteeism’’ demonstrated significant improvements following dCBT

[F(1,485) ¼ 10.99, P ¼ 0.001: d ¼ 0.64 for dCBT, d ¼ 0.09 for WL]. Effects
for ‘‘abseenteeism’’ failed to reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.101).
Conclusions: dCBT is effective in improving sleep and work-based productivity in adults with insomnia.

##### BACKGROUND

nsomnia disorder comprises a complaint of poor sleep, occurring
at least three nights per week for at least 3 months, presenting

# I

with associated daytime effects.[1] Typically, insomnia is associated
with fatigue, impaired work productivity, reduced quality of life and
relationship satisfaction, and increased ill health.[2–5] Importantly,
and despite the fact that many people with insomnia do not actively
seek treatment, among those who do, such real-life impacts serve as
drivers of help-seeking.[6,7] However, despite the importance of
daytime factors, research has been conducted primarily in clinical
environments, and on sleep outcomes.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia has moderate to large, and durable, effects on sleep-onset latency (time taken
to fall asleep), and wake-time after sleep-onset (time awake during
the night), with smaller effects upon sleep duration (eg, [8,9]), when
recognized effect size criteria are applied [large (d ¼ 0.8), moderate
(d ¼ 0.5), small (d ¼ 0.3)].[10] There is also preliminary evidence that
CBT may yield health benefits (eg, [11–13]). Less well established is
the effect that CBT may have in the context of occupational wellbeing. This is surprising given that work performance is the second
most-cited area of impairment in insomnia disorder,[14] and that

epidemiological study suggests that trouble sleeping is associated
with lower productivity and attendance.[15] Reduced productivity
could be due to cognitive deficits associated with insomnia such as
lapses in attention and short-term memory,[16] and/or low mood,
reduced motivation, and self-regulatory capacity.[17] Pharmaceutical
studies have demonstrated some workplace benefit,[18,19] but to our
knowledge, this is the first workplace-based trial of CBT to evaluate
impact on sleep and occupational function. It should be noted that
the advantages and disadvantages of CBT relative to sleep medication in terms of efficacy and side effects are discussed elsewhere.[9]

Recently, digital CBT (dCBT) has widened access to therapy
and several trials have reported moderate to large improvements in
insomnia symptoms.[20–26] In the present study, we will use a dCBT
program that has been tested versus a placebo intervention.[22]

Our hypotheses were that dCBT would improve both sleep
and workplace performance by the end of treatment, compared with
waiting list (WL) control, and that when subsequently offered
dCBT, the former WL group would exhibit similar improvements.
We presumed that the most salient daytime sequelae of poor sleep in
a workplace setting would be perceived work performance, which
could be due to improvements in (for example) alertness, attention,
or cognitive performance. However, we did not plan this first study
to assess formally the meditational relationship between sleep
change and specific aspects of workplace functioning.

##### METHODS

 Setting and Participants

The study was conducted in a global ‘‘Fortune 500’’ company
(one of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue according to an
annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine). Its
workforce comprises predominantly office-based staff. The company concerned has comprehensive health insurance and employee
well-being programs, but at the time of the trial, this did not extend
to providing CBT for insomnia.

Participants were employees who had responded to a staff
well-being e-mail or attended a talk on the importance of sleep.
They were asked whether they wanted information about a sleep
trial and were recontacted if they left their email address for this
purpose (n ¼ 484). They were then directed to the trial Web site.
Unfortunately, in the interests of company confidentiality, we do not
have access to information on the full denominator, that is, the total
number of employees who had responded to the email or attended a
talk about sleep, over and above the 484 respondents. Consequently,
we are unable to report the total number of employees who received
information about the trial. Nevertheless, it is clear that there was
considerable interest such that our sample size requirement
(n ¼ 200, see below) was met within 24 hours; we enrolled all
270 people who gave their consent to participate and completed
baseline assessment within 24 hours of opening recruitment.

The trial was promoted as suitable for people suffering from
insomnia as defined by DSM-5. However, criteria were not formally
evaluated; rather, participants self-identified as having poor sleep.
All employees were 18 years or older, had reliable internet access,


-----

and were able to read and understand English. Participants who took
medication for sleep and other health problems were not excluded,
providing they reported their health to be stable. Figure 1 illustrates
the flow of participants and Table 1 provides demographic and
clinical information.

##### Research Design

The study was a parallel group, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) comprising two arms: dCBT and WL control. After the
controlled phase, WL participants entered a deferred dCBT arm,
allowing treatment replication to be investigated. The original
dCBT group completed a follow-up at 3 months. Major assessments
for the RCT phase were at baseline (Week 0) and posttreatment
(Week 8). Further assessments comprised a naturalistic follow-up of
the dCBT arm at Week 22 (3 months posttreatment), and posttreatment for the WL/dCBT replication arm (their Week 16). The trial
design is summarized in Fig. 1. We used a simple online randomization tool with an allocation ratio of 1:1, as recommended for large
clinical trials.[27] Hence, the research team were unable to influence
randomization, and had no access to future allocations. All assessment, treatment, and data-gathering procedures were conducted
online, and all queries/enquiries managed electronically. These
procedures ensured that the trial was genuinely an evaluation of


a completely online CBT approach. Participants completed an
explicit consent online. The study protocol was approved by a
management team of the company.

##### Assessment Measures

Our primary outcome measure was the Sleep Condition
Indicator (SCI)[28]; a brief, patient-reported outcome based upon
DSM-5 criteria. It comprises two quantitative items on sleep continuity, two qualitative items on sleep satisfaction/dissatisfaction,
two quantitative items on severity, and two qualitative items on
attributed daytime consequences. Psychometric studies demonstrate
reliability (range of a -0.81 to 0.89), temporal stability, and concurrent and discriminant validity.[22,29,30] The SCI generates a total
score in the range 0 to 32 but is recalculated to an intuitive 0 to 10
format so that the maximum score ‘‘10’’ represents sleep that is in
the best possible ‘‘condition.’’

Secondary outcomes were related to workplace productivity,
sleepiness, and mental health. The Work Productivity and Impairment questionnaire[31] yields two productivity metrics. ‘‘Absenteeism’’ represents work time that is missed, whereas ‘‘presenteeism’’
is defined as reduction in job effectiveness. Absenteeism is calculated as (hours missed from work due to sleep problems/(hours
missed from work due to sleep problems þ hours actually worked).

Presenteeism is calculated as how much poor sleep affected productivity at work/10. Values were reported ‘‘over the past 7 days.’’
Scores are multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The WPAI is
sensitive to the daytime effects of insomnia.[32] Sleepiness was
assessed by the question: ‘‘How likely is it that you would fall
asleep during the daytime without intending to, or that you would
struggle to stay awake while you were doing things?’’ (0, ‘‘no
chance,’’ 1, ‘‘slight chance,’’ 2, ‘‘moderate chance,’’ 3, ‘‘high
chance’’) derived from the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.[33] Mental
health was evaluated using the well-validated GAD-2 (Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-2)[34] comprising two items from the GAD-7 and
the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)[35] derived from two items
of the PHQ-9. Other descriptive demographic and clinical information was collected at baseline (see Table 1).

It should be noted that dCBT users were also invited to record
daily sleep diaries, from which the program algorithm deployed
sleep efficiency (the proportion of time in bed asleep, expressed as a
percentage: SE), to titrate the delivery of therapy and to measure
therapeutic progress. Diary data were based upon a single estimate


at baseline, whereas daily diary data were collected from session 1
onwards. Diary data were not collected at all from the WL group at
the start of the trial; therefore, it is not possible to make diary
comparisons during the active RCT phase. However, WL participants who accepted subsequent reallocation to dCBT then completed sleep diaries, making it possible to report uncontrolled data
on SE outcomes for each group. SE was the primary outcome in our
original placebo-controlled trial.[22]

##### Treatment Groups

 Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia

dCBT was delivered using an established program
[(www.sleepio.com and associated Sleepio App).[10,22]](http://www.sleepio.com/) The program
is fully automated and highly interactive, with no human contact. In
brief, content based on validated CBT manuals is presented by an
animated virtual therapist (‘‘The Prof’’) and tailored by the program’s algorithms to each individual’s characteristics, personal
goals, sleep diary data, and progress. Further support is provided


-----

by system-generated email/SMS prompts and access to a postmoderated online community.

##### Waiting List

Participants in the WL group did not receive any intervention
or advice. They completed all major assessments for the trial and
were offered dCBT upon completion of the posttreatment evaluation. In effect, they were a deferred entry to treatment group. All
participants in both groups received the program at no personal cost.

##### Data Analysis and Management

We wanted to have a sample large enough to test our
secondary outcomes of work-related productivity, as well as our
primary outcome of sleep improvement. Whereas the literature
indicates that a large effect size [ES: d ¼ (M1 - M2/dpooled)] of
around 1.0 might be anticipated for sleep variables,[8,22] we estimated
that a small to moderate ES would be more likely for a daytime
variable. Consequently, the study was planned with 80% power to
detect an ES ¼ 0.4, thus requiring a minimum sample of 200
(n ¼ 100 per group) at P value less than 0.05.

Data were analyzed using Linear Mixed Models using SPSS
(IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 21, 2012), which includes a flexible
and powerful procedure for fitting LMMs to longitudinal data sets.
LMMs are regarded as offering several advantages over traditional
repeated measures analyses of variance.[36] Fixed effects included
group allocation, time (pre-, posttreatment), with particular interest
in the group x time interaction, which we report here. Random
effects were run to account for between-subject variation. We also
conducted post hoc power calculations (d).[10]

##### RESULTS
Participants were 270 adults (67% M) with an average age of
34 years, which was broadly representative of company demographics (Table 1). All participants were employed (mostly fulltime) and the majority lived with a partner (60%). The sample was
generally in good health. In relation to sleep, all participants selfidentified as having a problem: difficulties with falling asleep
(sleep-onset problem) and remaining asleep (sleep maintenance
problem) were equally common (each subtype occurring in 60%

TABLE 2. Treatment Outcomes for Sleep and Daytime Measures


of the sample). Around one-third reported early morning awakening. These insomnia subtypes were not mutually exclusive, that is,
all participants exhibited concerns in relation to falling asleep and/
or remaining asleep and/or early morning awakening. Over 40% of
participants reported having sleep problems for more than 1 year.
Around one-quarter had asked their doctor for advice about sleep.
There were no significant differences between the dCBT and WL
groups on any of these characteristics, and baseline data in Table 2
confirm the groups were similar on the dependent variables
of interest.

Table 2 summarizes our trial results for all variables, and
Fig. 2 illustrates our findings on the SCI.

##### Randomized Controlled Trial

During the RCT phase, 98 of 135 dCBT participants (73%)
and 116 of 135 (86%) WL participants completed posttreatment
assessment (Fig. 1). Of the dCBT participants, 47% attended four or
more sessions. Data, however, were analyzed for all 270 participants. dCBTwas associated with a significant improvement in sleep
(1.66 points on the SCI, compared with 0.52 in the WL group). The
group x time interaction term (the main statistic of interest) for this
comparison was significant [F(1,485) ¼ 15.63, P < 0.0001]. A large
ES was observed for dCBT (d ¼ 1.10) and a small ES for WL
(d ¼ 0.34). This confirmed our expectation that sleep would be
improved following active intervention. There was some reduction
in associated daytime sleepiness in the dCBT condition relative to
WL [F(1,483) ¼ 4.13, P ¼.043]. Although the mean score approximated a slight-moderate chance of daytime sleepiness at baseline,
and post-dCBT score remained in this range, there was an ES
change of d ¼ 0.40, compared with no change in the WL group.

On the WPAI ‘‘presenteeism’’ scale, a 15.4% reduction in
reports of poor sleep affecting productivity at work was observed
following dCBT (2.4% following WL), representing a significant

[F(1,485) ¼ 10.99, P ¼ 0.001], and medium effect in terms of Cohen
criteria (d ¼ 0.67). There was no significant change in the WL
condition. On the ‘‘absenteeism’’ scale, a small effect was associated
with pre-post change after dCBT (d ¼ 0.32), with minimal effects
after WL, but the interaction term was not significant

[F(1,484) ¼ 2.70, P ¼ 0.101]. Looking specifically at the component

‘‘hours missedfromwork due tothe sleepproblem’’ inthepast 7 days,
the CBT baseline of 2.21 (SD 3.63) reduced by 1 hour to 1.07
(SD 2.70), with minimal change following WL [2.19 (SD 3.82) to
2.21 (SD 4.06)]. This change again was not statistically significant

[F(1,484) ¼ 3.07, P ¼ 0.080].

We did not observe any significant change associated with
dCBT relative to WL on symptoms of anxiety [F(1,481) ¼ 1.86,
P ¼ 0.173] or depression [F(1,481) ¼ 0.38, P ¼ 0.846]. However,
despite symptom levels being low at baseline, a medium pre-post ES
(d ¼ 0.50) was observed in the GAD-2.

Sleep diary data collected within the dCBT program indicated that SE increased from 76% to 87% across the 6 weeks, and
that 81% participants recorded sleep diaries for 2 weeks (or more),
67% for 3 weeks, 47% for 4 weeks, and 32% for 6 weeks or more.

##### Replication Phase

These data are presented on the right side of Table 2 for all
variables, and in Fig. 2 for the primary outcome (SCI).

Results may be summarized by saying that posttreatment
mean scores, and baseline to posttreatment change scores for the
WL group once reallocated to dCBT are broadly comparable to
outcomes obtained for the originally allocated dCBT condition.

More specifically, the WL to CBT group’s magnitude of
change on the SCI [1.76 (SD 1.78)] is comparable to that of the
dCBT group [1.66 (SD 1.58)], and ES data are also similar (d ¼ 1.05
and 1.10, respectively). Likewise, sleepiness reduced by a similar
amount (d ¼ 0.53). Replication effects are observed also for ‘‘presenteeism,’’ with if anything slightly stronger magnitude (d ¼ 0.74
compared with 0.64). A small effect emerged on the PHQ-2
following dCBT for the WL group (d ¼ 0.34). Importantly, no
between-group comparison made following active treatment was


significant on any variable [range of F ¼ 0.018 to 0.452, range of
P ¼ 0.502 to 0.893].

Sleep diary data from the WL participants who subsequently
participated in dCBT suggest that a similar improvement level to the
original dCBT group. SE increased from 77% at week 1 to 87% at
week 6.

##### Follow-Up

The original dCBT group transited into 3-month posttreatment follow-up. These data are uncontrolled, but consistently
suggest maintenance of therapy gains. This can be seen in Fig. 1
and Table 2 for the primary outcome of the SCI, and in Table 2
across all variables where baseline to posttreatment, and baseline to
follow-up change scores and ES appear similar.

##### Subgroup Analyses

Further analyses considered the possibility that outcomes
might be associated with specific subpopulations (gender, age, civil
status; health baseline; duration and subtype of insomnia, and use of
medical services or medications) but were all statistically nonsignificant. Moreover, these factors did not predict adherence to
the program, based on diary weeks completed.

##### DISCUSSION
Our results provide further confirmation that dCBT is effective in the treatment of persistent poor sleep, in this instance
presenting in the context of worker health and well-being. Effects
observed on the Sleep Condition Indicator were large in magnitude
(d ¼ 1.10), similar in end-point to those obtained in a previous
placebo-controlled RCT,[22] and durable over time. A feature of the
study was its replication design, following the controlled phase. Not
only was this an ethical research paradigm, given that CBT is
effective, but also the data from this reallocated group support
the direct impact of dCBT upon sleep, and to similar endpoints.
Uncontrolled sleep diary data provide supportive evidence of sleep
improvement. In our placebo-controlled trial,[22] the primary outcome was SE, because this captured insomnia symptoms regardless
of sleep-onset or sleep-maintenance subtype. In the present study, it
is was encouraging therefore to observe a 10% increase in SE
following dCBT, and that SE posttreatment of 87% was relatively
high; 85% is commonly regarded as the clinical cut-off for poor
sleep in insomnia samples.

However, given the nature of our participant group, we were
particularly interested to see whether dCBT would also be helpful
with daytime functioning, and planned our study to have sufficient
power to detect differences in these outcomes. Given that our
participants were drawn specifically from an occupational setting
(rather than, eg, from health care), the functional variable of greatest
interest was how they felt they performed at work. Results were
encouraging with demonstrable effects upon work-based productivity (‘‘presenteeism’’: d ¼ 0.64). The WPAI is self-report—
the extent to which (you believe) your productivity at work is
impaired by poor sleep. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the absolute
change (of some 15%) following dCBTwas similar to the difference
in presenteeism between good sleepers and insomnia sufferers
reported in a previous workforce survey (13%).[32] Previous investigation of nonsleep variables has indicated that CBT effects are not
accounted for solely by placebo factors (eg,[22,37–40]). We suggest
that our findings on presenteeism are worthy of further research
investigation, especially since they were also replicated (d ¼ 0.77).
In this regard, it is noteworthy that mechanisms implicated in
reduced productivity, during experimental sleep deprivation,
include reductions in attention, working memory, innovative thinking, and multitasking.[41–43] A greater tendency for ‘‘cyberloafing’’
(nonwork-related internet activity) has also been reported following


-----

short sleep, which has been argued to be associated with a reduction
in self-regulatory capacity.[44]

We also obtained significant effects on sleepiness (moderate
ES). This is interesting because people with insomnia do not
typically complain of excessive sleepiness, as indeed our baseline
data confirm. It may be that participants’ construct of sleepiness was
more focused than usual (ie, at work) in which case these data may
complement the notion of presenteeism. We must be cautious,
however, because we used only an unvalidated single-item proxy
for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

No other LMM analyses achieved statistical significance.
However, examination of ‘‘absenteeism’’ data shows that these were
(at d ¼ 0.3) below the threshold we set for detection of significant
differences. It is also noteworthy that worker absence pre-treatment
(4%) afforded limited room for improvement. For GAD-2, although a
medium effect was observed following dCBT, there was also a small
effectofWL.This,coupledwithlow baselinevaluesforGAD(andfor
PHQ-2), likely represents an unsatisfactory test in our mixed models
analysis. Future studies exploring such variables might need either
larger samples or to include more severe insomnia cases.

We acknowledge several important limitations to the study.
First, we did not include formal screening of other disorders of
sleep. It is possible that some participants may (also) have had sleep
breathing or sleep motor problems. Second, the sleep diary is a
staple tool of insomnia assessment. Whereas the dCBT group used
diaries as part of their therapy program, we did not gather such data
from WL participants and were therefore unable to make comparisons using such data. We have added uncontrolled sleep diary
information for SE; however, caution is advised for the interpretation of these data, as diary data were based upon a single retrospective estimate at baseline, whereas daily diary data were
collected prospectively from session 1 onwards. Other sleep-related
measures, such as actigraphy, would also be useful to consider in
future research. Third, on reflection, a larger sample size may have
enabled us to test whether or not statistically significant effects
might be demonstrable across our full range of daytime outcomes,
although floor effects were likely a factor in these relatively healthy
participants. Finally, these results, though based on a substantial
sample, represent data form a single company and should not be
taken to be generalizable at this point.

In conclusion, the results from this study are promising. They
provide an early indication that dCBT for sleep problems may be
readily accessed by staff participating in workplace well-being and
occupational health programs, and that this approach may benefit
people with insomnia in relation to their sleep and their productivity.
It is important that future research with dCBT continues to explore
the functional outcomes that are most salient to the environments in
which people live and to the complaints of poor sleep that they
present.
