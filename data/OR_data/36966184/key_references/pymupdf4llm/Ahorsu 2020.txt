###### 1. Introduction


###### Purpose: Insomnia has adverse effects on people with epilepsy. We aimed to test a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app-based intervention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. Methods: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and comprised individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and having moderate to severe insomnia. A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, consisting of a treatment group (CBT-I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). Primary out- comes were self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep hygiene behavior and objective sleep char- acteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: Current findings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency were significantly improved in the CBT-I group compared with the patient education group at all mea- surement points. Also, the CBT-I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that attitude, intention, coping planning, self-mon- itoring, and behavioral automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. Conclusion: Results support the use of the CBT-I app to improve sleep outcomes among people with epilepsy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.


###### Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases globally, affecting around 50 million people worldwide [1]. Individuals with epi- lepsy often have other physical and mental health conditions [2]. For ex- ample, higher incidences of anxiety, depression, and sleep–wake disorders are commonly observed in people with epilepsy [2], all of which have been shown to be associated with insomnia [2].

###### Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep despite good opportunities for sleep [3]. Insomnia can have significant negative consequences on a person including disruptions to psychoso- cial functioning (e.g., depression, daytime dysfunction, reduced quality of life (QoL)) and occupational functioning (e.g., job absence, reduced ability to do tasks, lowered job satisfaction, poor decision-making), as well as an increased burden on society (e.g., increased health costs, re- duced job productivity) [2–4]. Several treatment options have been used to manage insomnia in people with epilepsy; however, treatments are often dependent on the seizure type, the person's age, preexisting medical conditions, and potential side-effect profile [5]. Moreover, in Iran, the usual practice for improving sleep hygiene for those who have sleep difficulties is providing education through the provision of


-----

###### information sheets [4]. This practice is similar to those used in more de- veloped countries, such as the US [6]. Given well-documented evidence that information provision alone is not sufficient to change behavior, and the wide-spread use and popularity of smartphones, disseminating sleep information alongside behavioral change techniques (BCTs) using app-based methods, may be a useful way forward to improve the sleep of people with epilepsy. Indeed, the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app- based intervention (for details see Linardon et al. [7]) has shown to be effective in improving insomnia symptoms and that may overcome many of the challenges of treatment options for those with epilepsy. The CBT-I is a versatile program in that it can be held in individual or group sessions and either face-to-face or online (app-based), based on the therapist's priority, patient's progress, or both [8]. Currently, how- ever, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of the smartphone-deliv- ered CBT-I among people with epilepsy [9], although studies have demonstrated promising results among individuals with mental ill- nesses [7,10]. Building on previous research using CBT-I [11], the aim of this study was to test the novel CBT-I app-based intervention on insomnia symp- toms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to ex- amine the possible mechanisms among the factors. It was expected that individuals randomized to the CBT-I group would exhibit greater im- provements in insomnia, sleep, and social psychological outcomes at


###### the follow-up assessment points compared with participants in the con- trol (patient education) group. It was expected that the social psycho- logical factors would be higher at follow-up assessment points in the CBT-I group compared with the control group, and that relevant beliefs about sleep hygiene behaviors as specified by theory would serve as mediators between intervention conditions and sleep behavior at fol- low-ups.

 2. Material and methods

 This double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted on people diagnosed with epilepsy who have moderate to severe insomnia from August 2018 to October 2019. All procedures were carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study was approved by the Regional Science Ethical Committee (Registration No. IR.QUMS. REC.1397.129) and preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03683381).

 2.1. Design and study population

 This study used a two-armed randomized controlled trial design with four measurement points to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBT-I app-based intervention against a patient education only group on in- somnia, sleep, and social psychological outcomes in people with epi- lepsy. Participants were recruited from four neurology clinics in

###### Tehran and Qazvin, Iran. A list of all people with epilepsy was obtained from the clinics. Potential participants were approached by a trained re- search assistant (nurse) using short message service (SMS) text and fully informed of the purpose of the research. Interested participants were then assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the study. Participants were eligible to enter the study if they met the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of epilepsy according to the International League Against Ep- ilepsy criteria; (2) aged 18 years or older; (3) moderate or severe in- somnia as indicated by a score of 15 or higher on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); (4) speak, understand, and write in Persian; (5) no surgery planned in the next 6 months; (6) access to an Android smartphone or a desktop computer with Internet access; and (7) ab- sence of major cognitive impairment assessed using the Telephone ver- sion of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Participants were excluded if they (1) were diagnosed with a rapidly progressing neurological or medical disorder, (2) had an intellectual disability, (3) reported drug or alcohol misuse, (4) had untreated sleep apnea identified by an over- night (manually scored) polysomnography, or (5) were pregnant. The participants were first screened through an online interest form followed by a 20-minute telephone screening and an in-person semistructured interview. Through the interview, the inclusion and ex- clusion criteria were checked. Eligible participants then received infor- mation about the purpose of the study and were invited to participate. Participants who returned their signed informed consent form were asked to complete online baseline assessments as well as wearing an actigraphy watch for a week. All selected participants received a unique login username and password to access the CBT-I App. A total of 973 po- tential participants were contacted and screened and 512 (52.6%) par- ticipants qualified for this study. The flow of participants in the study is shown in Fig. 1.

 2.2. Sample size

 The sample size was calculated based on the effect size of previous online interventional studies on insomnia and specifically ISI [12,13]. Hence, using a two-tailed test with a small-to-medium effect size


###### (Cohen d = 0.40), with 85% power, at α = 0.05 and 25% dropout rate (taken into consideration, at least, 1-month follow-up), a total of 320 participants were recruited.

 2.3. Randomization and blinding

 Participants were randomly assigned to the CBT-I or patient educa- tion group using 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomization was stratified based on the clinics to avoid potential contamination. Randomization was performed by masked biostatistician using SAS 9.2 software. The participants, outcome assessors, and statisticians were blinded to group assignments.

 2.3.1. Intervention The intervention used the CBT-I mobile app [11], which was based on principles of prominent psychological theory [14] and self-help con- cepts [15]. Specific BCTs that mapped on to constructs underpinned in the theory were integrated into the mobile app, such as information about social and environmental consequences, advantages and disad- vantages of performing sleep hygiene behaviors, habit formation, habit reversal, reconstructing the physical environment, reconstructing the social environment, action planning, problem-solving, and self- monitoring of behavior. The intervention content was designed to be delivered over six weeks with exercises provided each week on the mo- bile app. All engagement was online, including any correspondence be- tween participant and support assistant (e.g., help needed to address challenges in accessing the program on the mobile phone) (see Majd et al. [11] for full details). Participants were instructed to engage in the content of the mobile app as it was released weekly to help treat their insomnia (see Tables 1 and 2 for BCTs and CBT-I content, respectively).

 2.3.2. Patient education The patient education group received standard information on in- somnia symptoms every week. This included information on physiolog- ical controls of sleep, sleep hygiene practices, healthy sleep behaviors,

BCT 5.3: Information about social and Week 1: Providing evidenced-based information on sleep: Adults need more than 7–8 h of sleep per
environmental consequences night to let the brain obtain full rest. Over one-third of adults have severe daytime sleepiness that
interferes with work, driving, and social functioning.

BCT 9.2: Advantages and Week 1: Getting participants to think of and weigh-up the advantages of having sufficient sleep and
disadvantages the disadvantages of insufficient sleep. For example, sample sentences such as ‘If I sleep enough, I
will have high performance’ and ‘If I sleep little, I will have health risk, such as high blood pressure’
are presented.

BCT 8.3: Habit formation Week 2: Getting participants to build sleep patterns. For example, participants are encouraged to go
to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekdays and weekend days. Participants
are also encouraged to make a comfortable bedroom for sleeping through listening to their bodies,
eating healthy foods, drinking safely, and doing relaxation exercises before sleep. Participants are
further requested to actively perform at least one of these sleep hygiene behaviors and to write
down the behavior that they will adopt for the week.

Week Content

1 Week 1 focused on providing information. The importance of sleep, the amount of sleep needed, the main causes of insomnia, complications and outcomes of
insufficient sleep (including short- and long-term), insomnia treatments (e.g., CBT-I), and the prevalence of insomnia in Iran were given. Additionally, participants were
asked to list the potential costs of poor sleep and the potential benefits of good sleep. At the end of the first week, participants were encouraged to use a notebook that
incorporated in the app's front page to record their sleeping information, including sleep time, wake-up time, and time spent being in bed.
2 Week 2 focused on developing good habits for healthy sleep. Participants were taught to identify negative habits which can disrupt sleep, such as smoking, caffeine
intake close to bed, excessive worrying, and uncomfortable bedroom environment (e.g., a dark, calm, and cool bedroom). Participants were then encouraged to think up
positive sleep habits to replace these negative sleep habits by reading a list of tips; for example, listening to their bodies, eating healthy foods, drinking safely, and
engaging in relaxation exercises before sleep. Participants were requested to write down their new habits which they can use for practice in Week 2. Participants were
also requested to list the habits that interrupt their sleep. At the end of this week, relaxation and meditation exercise techniques were provided in text and audio forms
with music tracks for the participants to practice. Participants were requested to perform these exercises every night before going to bed in comfortable places (for
example, in bed) without disturbance (e.g., setting their smartphones to silent mode).
3 Week 3 continued relaxation practices. Participants were asked to try and imagine a place where they feel comfortable (e.g., a pleasant place) before bedtime each
night. In addition, participants were taught how to link the bedroom only with sleep; that is, limiting the amount of time that they spend in bed. Thus, participants were
taught how to generate a ‘sleep efficiency chart’ and use this chart to calculate the amount of time that they are awake at night. Participants were also asked to use this
chart together with their sleep notes to monitor their sleep performance. At the end of each week (after Week 3), they were able to visualize their sleeping efficiency.
4 At the beginning of Week 4, participants were asked to monitor their sleep efficiency, as was taught in Week 3. The aim of Week 4 was to change misconceptions on
sleep. A list of common misconceptions with correct information about sleep was provided to participants. Participants were challenged for their misconceptions and
reviewed the differences between their thoughts and feelings. In addition, participants were encouraged to identify their unhelpful thoughts by writing down the
information regarding their last time efforts for sleeping in a table, including the situation, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
5 At the beginning of Week 5, participants were asked to review their sleep chart and check their sleep efficiency. In addition, participants were requested to write down
two situations in which they had good or bad sleep in the past week. Moreover, their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that accompanied the situations were requested
to be written down as well. Participants were then asked to think up plans specifying what (sleep hygiene behaviors), when (day), and where (place) they would sleep.
They were asked to use a tabular form in the app to write down this information. The app also reminded participants regarding their plans in their recorded sleeping
information (sleep time, wake up time, and time spent being in the bed) during past night. In addition, participants were encouraged to identify potential barriers that
might jeopardize their sleep, as well as strategies to overcome the barriers.
6 Week 6 focused on relating bed to sleep. Participants learned how to relate bed with sleep. All of the techniques learned in Weeks 1 to 5 (e.g., relaxation, sleep
education, cognitive restructuring, action planning, and coping planning) were summarized for the participants in the app. During Week 6, paradoxical intention was
used: participants were asked to sleep for fewer hours than normal sleep for one night to understand that sleep deprivation does not necessarily affect daily functioning.
At the end of Week 6, participants were asked to keep a sleep diary.

###### and changing lifestyle to promote healthy sleeping behaviors. This in- formation was presented as separate content from the CBT-I on the mo- bile app. Educational information was unlocked on a weekly basis for the participants to use and, as such, participants were asked to strictly follow the content of the mobile app as it was released weekly to help treat their insomnia. After the intervention, participants in control group were informed that they could access the CBT-I content of the app.

 2.4. Outcomes

 Primary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality (this scale, Pitts- burgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was included after preregistering in the ClinicalTrials.gov to further enrich our data and to conform with the Iranian neurology clinic protocols), insomnia severity, and sleep hy- giene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automa- ticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and QoL. All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one month, three months, and six months postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at base- line, and one month and six months postintervention. These time- frames were chosen to assess the short-, medium-, and long-term ef- fects of CBT-I on participant's outcomes, despite the program itself last- ing only 6 weeks—based on previous protocols (see Majd et al. [11]). All self-reported measures used in this study have been previously vali- dated in Persian [11,16–23]. Detailed information on each of the mea- sures is described below. Apart from the outcome measures described below, detailed information on participants' demographic characteristic and especially detailed information on their epileptic conditions such as type of seizure, age at onset, interventional types, type of antiepileptic drugs (mono/polytherapy), seizure frequency (30-day evaluation on both loss of awareness and aura in both partial and generalized sei- zures), seizure severity (using Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale), health


###### literacy (using eHealth Literacy Scale), and comorbid conditions (using Charlson Comorbidity Index).

 2.4.1. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) The PSQI is a 19-item self-rating questionnaire that can be com- pleted within 5 to 10 min. It has seven component scores, which are made up of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep ef- ficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each of these component scores is weighted equally from 0 to 3 (0, not in the past month; 1, less than once per week; 2, once or twice per week; and 3, three or more times per week). A global PSQI score is gotten from the sum of all the seven components yielding a score from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality
 [16,24].

 2.4.2. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) The ISI is a seven-item self-report scale that assesses participants' level of insomnia over the past two weeks. All items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (very se- vere problem). A total score is generated by summing up all seven items ranging from 0 to 28 with five subscores: 0–7 (absence of insom- nia), 8–14 (subthreshold insomnia), 15–21 (moderate insomnia), and 22–28 (severe insomnia) [17]. The internal consistency of the ISI in this present study was acceptable (α = 0.83).

 2.4.3. Sleep hygiene behavior Sleep hygiene behavior was assessed using a three-item scale devel- oped by Todd and Mullan [25]. The participants were asked to report how many days they had good sleep hygiene behavior over the past week (‘How many days did you make your bedroom restful over the past week?’) and then whether they avoided going to bed feeling hun- gry or thirsty, and avoided anxiety and stress-provoking activity before bed. Participants were asked to respond on an 8-point scale ranging from 0 to 7 [18]. The internal consistency of the sleep hygiene behavior scale in this present study was acceptable (α = 0.81).


-----

###### 2.4.4. Objective sleep characteristics Objective sleep characteristics were measured using a wrist actigraphy (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc. USA). Actigraphy is a small and portable device that records information on movement in 1-minute epochs over extended periods of time. Sleep characteristics such as total sleep time and sleep efficiency were extracted from the wrist actigraphy using the Sadeh algorithm. Patients were asked to wear the Actigraph on their nondominant wrist for seven consecutive nights in three as- sessment periods (i.e., baseline, one month, and six months after base- line). A daily sleep diary was also completed assist in interpreting the wrist actigraph data.

 2.4.5. Behavioral intention Behavioral intention was assessed using a six-item scale (e.g., ‘Over the next week, I intend to make my bedroom restful’), adapted from Kor and Mullan [26] and previous studies [4,18]. All items were scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree).

 2.4.6. Self-report Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI) The extent to which the sleep hygiene behaviors are habitual for an individual was assessed using the Self-report Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI) [19,27]. The SRBAI for the current study contained four items that started with the stem “Sleep hygiene behaviour is some- thing…” followed by “I do automatically’, ‘I do without having to con- sciously remember’, ‘I do without thinking’, and ‘I start doing before I realize I'm doing it’ as used in previous study.

 2.4.7. Action planning Action planning was assessed using four items adapted from previ- ous studies [4,18,20]. Participants were asked to indicate if they had made a detailed plan regarding (i) when, (ii) where, (iii) how, and (iv) how often they will perform sleep hygiene behaviors over the next six months. All items were scored on a five-point Likert scale, rang- ing from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree).

 2.4.8. Coping planning Coping planning was assessed using five items (e.g., ‘I have made a detailed plan regarding what to do if something interferes with my plans’) adapted from previous studies [4,18,20]. All items were scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree).

 2.4.9. Perceived behavioral control Perceived behavioral control was assessed using three items (e.g., ‘I am confident that every day I can prevent anxiety-provoking activity before bedtime’) adapted from previous studies [4,18]. All items were scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree).

 2.4.10. Self-monitoring of behavior Self-monitoring of behavior was assessed using three items (i.e., “I keep track of how much time I spend sleeping”, “I pay attention to how tired or rested I feel each day”, and “I take care to note the time that I go to bed and wake each day) adapted from a previous study
 [11]. All items were scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always).

 2.4.11. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item scale that assesses anxiety (seven items) and depression (seven items) in pa- tients with both somatic and mental problems. All items were scored on a 0–3 response scale with higher score representing higher levels of anxiety and depression [21,22].


###### 2.4.12. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Inventory (QOLIE-31) The Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Inventory (QOLIE-31) is a 31-item questionnaire clustered in seven multiitem scales being (a) overall QoL, (b) emotional well-being, (c) energy/fatigue, (d) cognitive functioning, (e) medication effects, (f) seizure worry, and (g) social functioning and one single item on overall health [23,28]. The QOLIE-31 overall score was obtained using a weighted average of the multiitem scale scores. The scale scores and overall score values range from 0 to 100, where higher values reflect more favorable states [23,28].

 2.5. Statistical analysis

 The study conformed to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were carried out to handle attrition. Descriptive statistics were used to sum- marize participant characteristics. To evaluate the magnitude of changes in primary and secondary outcomes over time across the two groups, linear mixed models (PROCMIXED) were performed. Moreover, the linear mixed models controlled for baseline variables and covariates (age, gender, education, and severity of seizure) that related to the out- come(s). Given the robust estimation (through full information maxi- mum likelihood estimation) that handles missing values common in repeated measured outcomes (e.g., loss-to-follow in posttreatment), the mixed modeling approach is a powerful statistical tool to evaluate group differences over time [29]. The analysis incorporated two be- tween-participant effects (between groups and between participants within groups) and three within-participant effects (between times, group by time interactions, and random variation). All p-values were two-sided and evaluated as statistically significant at the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

 3. Results

 Table 3 shows that the demographic characteristics of both CBT-I and patient education groups were similar. Specifically, the mean age of the patients with insomnia in the CBT-I group was 38.37 ± 13.45 years and the mean age of those in the patient education group was 37.99 ± 9.88 years. Slightly less than half of the participants were

###### male in each group (39.4% in the CBT-I group and 43.8% in the patient education group). The time used by all participants on the mobile app was 280 ± 127.16 min, with participants in the CBT-I group evidencing significantly longer duration of app use (mean 311 ± 154.39 min) com- pared with the patient education group (mean 250 ± 111.63 min; p = 0.004). Thirty-five (21.88%) and 32 (20%) patients in CBT-I and patient education group, respectively were found to be seizure-free over a 30- day baseline period. The CBT-I group showed rapid improvement in all sleep outcomes over time. Further, there were improved health outcomes over time for the CBT-I group. The patient education group also showed gradual improvement in sleep outcomes over time. Further, there were slight differences in health outcomes over time for the patient education group (see Table 4). There were significant intervention effects on the three primary out- comes: sleep quality (PSQI), severity of insomnia (ISI), and sleep hy- giene behaviors. Specifically, sleep quality was improved in the CBT-I group compared with those in the patient education group at all fol- low-up time points (ps b 0.001 for 1, 3, and 6 months). Similar improve- ments were observed in severity of insomnia (i.e., a significant decrease in the severity of insomnia among the CBT-I group compared with those in the patient education group at 1, 3, and 6 months following the inter- vention, ps b 0.001). Again, for sleep hygiene behaviors, the CBT-I group significantly engaged in more sleep hygiene behaviors compared with those in the patient education group at 1 month (p = 0.002), 3 months

Table 5 shows the findings of the linear mixed models predicting pri- mary outcomes between two groups, controlling for age, gender, educa- tion, and severity of seizure. The results on objective measures of sleep revealed that the CBT-I group had better sleep onset latency (ps b 0.001 for 1 month and 6 months), wake after sleep onset (p b 0.05 for 6 months), and sleep effi- ciency (p b 0.01 for 6 months) compared with the patient education group. Table 6 shows the findings of the linear mixed models predicting the outcomes between two groups, controlling for age, gender, educa- tion, and severity of seizure. Regarding the secondary outcomes, analyses indicated that the CBT- I group had better outcomes than did the patient education group(for detailed information see Appendix Tables 1–5). Mediation analyses fur- ther showed that the effects of the CBT-I on the primary outcome of sleep hygiene behaviors were mediated by changes in relevant social psychological factors toward sleep hygiene behaviors as specified by theory (for detailed information see Appendix Table 6).

 4. Discussion

 The present study aimed to test a novel CBT-I app-based inter- vention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. Results demonstrated support for the CBT-I

###### intervention in improving sleep outcomes as well as improved social cognitions and mental health outcomes. These findings are consis- tent with results of previous studies, which reported that mobile apps or internet-delivered CBT-I (or therapy) can be an effective method in treating insomnia [7,10,13]. Specifically, there were mod- erate-to-large effect sizes for the self-reported sleep outcomes but small effects for the objective actigraphy outcomes. The aforemen- tioned findings indicate that the mobile app CBT-I improves sleep problems for people with epilepsy. Moreover, the improvements seem to be larger than prior studies using traditional CBT-I to treat insomnia for general populations or people with epilepsy [30]. A pos- sible reason is that the mobile app CBT-I is more feasible than tradi- tional CBT-I as a mobile app was not limited by time or space. Therefore, the participants in the present study might gain larger benefits of the CBT-I than those using a traditional CBT-I. The find- ings are important given previous research has demonstrated that insomnia impairs the psychosocial and occupational functioning of people with epilepsy [2–4]. Thus, it can be concluded that the mobile app CBT-I is an effective way to treat insomnia in people with epi- lepsy taking into consideration the effect of epilepsy severity, age at onset, and antiseizure medication on sleep. Also, current findings suggest effects last in the long-term (i.e., 6 months postinterven- tion), an important contribution to the extant literature in this con- text as long-term effects of interventions are often not tested. Moreover, this study provided novel understandings of the key de- terminants in this context. In particular, attitudes, perceived behav- ioral control, action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity were found to be significant mediators of the intervention effect on sleep hygiene. This study has important implications for people with epilepsy who have insomnia and highlights that an app-based CBT-I interven- tion may be superior to providing information alone. Empirical evi- dence has shown that knowledge provision alone often does not always translate into behavior change and that interventions based on theory may be more effective than interventions that are atheo- retical [31]. Also, online interventions are flexible and cost-effective to deliver wide-ranging health programs [7,13,32], and demonstrate comparable efficacy to nononline interventions [33]. The findings from the current research support that an online, theory-based inter- vention is a promising approach to improving sleep and health out- comes of people with epilepsy; especially, those who can be trained to follow therapeutic instructions online or on the phone. In addition, this is the first study that examined the possible mecha- nisms involved in treating insomnia/sleep problems among people with epilepsy [11]. Thus, in as much as the health or psychological state is important, clinicians may also look at their attitude, inten- tion, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity as they do mediate the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes.


###### These findings, adding to existing predictive factors of insomnia [34– 36], would help clinicians such as epileptologists to appreciate the need for a holistic view during assessment and treatment. It is also worth mentioning that the participants (Iranians) are more collec- tivistic-centered and are, therefore, more willing to follow instruc- tions from authority figures than individuals from individualistic- centered society [37–39]. Thus, present findings may not translate to individuals from Western, individualistic cultures. Key strengths of the current study include the use of a rigorous randomized controlled trial design and the recruitment of a clinical sample who have moderate to severe insomnia. While the outcomes are an extensive range of behavioral and psychological variables established to predict sleep outcomes, participants were not repre- sentative of the population of Iranian people with epilepsy. For ex- ample, participants in the present study needed to use the app to receive the intervention. Therefore, people with epilepsy who have little literacy in using smartphone or desktop computer or have chal- lenges adhering to treatment protocols may not benefit from this mobile app CBT-I intervention. However, the online platform was useful in that it enabled monitoring of participant progress electron- ically and, thus, may have contributed to maintaining participant engagement throughout the program. Further, the mean age of par- ticipants was around 38 years; thus, findings may not generalize to younger or older samples. In addition, although the participants were blinded to group assignment, they could not be blinded to the intervention. Therefore, placebo effects on results cannot be ex- cluded. However, given the sustained effects across the six-month follow-up, it is reasonable to conclude that the CBT-I is an effective program to treat insomnia among people with epilepsy. Future stud- ies would, therefore, benefit from examining intervention effects among younger and older people with epilepsy. Furthermore, we did not assess change in antiepileptic drugs use across the interven- tion, which may provide informative knowledge to clinicians about the relationship between the intervention and antiepileptic drugs use, an area for future research to explore.

 5. Conclusion

 The results of the present study demonstrated that CBT-I has promis- ing effects in treating sleep problems for people with epilepsy. The inter- vention proved successful in improving sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency in those that received the CBT-I compared with those that only received patient education, and across all measurement points. Also, the CBT-I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient educa- tion group. Further, mediation analyses showed attitude, intention, cop- ing planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes.
