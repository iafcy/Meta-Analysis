Eight trained investigators independently screened titles in pairs of two. We calculated Fleiss\u2019 Kappa, a measure of the degree of consistency between two or more raters to ensure high inter-rater reliability, and aimed for a kappa higher than 0.85.49 For studies identified in the second review process, a second independent review was performed. Differences regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were resolved through consensus. We followed a similar method to review abstracts for all studies that passed the title screening stage, and included any study that met all of the abstract inclusion criteria (Table \u200b(Table33).",
