            "abstract": "## AIMS\nTo investigate the feasibility, acceptance and potential effectiveness of delivering a telecare service on the health outcomes and hospital service utilization of community-dwelling patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n## METHODS\nEligible participants were older people, with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and who had been admitted to hospital at least once for exacerbation during the previous year. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received a telecare device kit and they were asked to monitor their oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiration rate using the device and to transmit the data to an online network platform. A medication and purse-lip breathing reminder with a feedback function is also provided in the device kit. A community nurse monitors changes in the physiological parameters and takes immediate action to address the patients' needs. Participants in the control group received no other extra care. Study outcomes include user satisfaction, health-related quality of life, pulmonary function, hospital re-admission and use of emergency room services.\n## RESULTS\nTwenty-two participants in the intervention group and 18 in the control group were included in the analysis. The mean age of all 40 participants was 72.93 years. Overall, the participants in the intervention group expressed satisfaction with the telecare service. Some patients reported difficulty in reading the screen of the mobile phone and manipulating the tiny key-in buttons. No significant differences were found between the two time points (baseline and post-test period) with regard to health-related quality of life. No significant differences in pulmonary function and in the number of emergency department visits and hospital re-admissions between the study groups were found.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe high level of user satisfaction indicated the feasibility of conducting a large-scale randomized control trial to evaluate the effects of a telecare service on health outcomes of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n",

            "abstract": "Background. Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers-some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) (hypertension: Withings Blood Pressure Monitor; diabetes: Sanofi iBGStar Blood Glucose Meter; arrhythmia: AliveCor Mobile ECG) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program-making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management. Results & Conclusions. There was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.\n",

            "abstract": "Palpitation is a common symptom that sometimes results from a substantial cardiac arrhythmia. We compared the diagnostic yield of trans-telephonic event monitors with those of Holter monitoring in patients with intermittent palpitations. In all, 310 patients were randomly assigned to receive an event recorder or 24-hour Holter monitoring. Event recorders were used for seven days or until two recordings were obtained while symptoms occurred. The main end-point was an electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded during symptoms. The patients with palpitation recorded the one-lead ECG trace and sent it to a telemedicine call centre, where a nurse responded. There were 119 symptomatic patients in the event recorder group and 74 in the Holter group. The total costs were 6019 for event recording and 9605 for Holter monitoring. The average costs were 51 per symptomatic patient detected by event recorder monitoring and 130 per symptomatic patient detected by Holter monitoring. More patients therefore received a clear diagnosis, and more quickly, when using event recording than with Holter monitoring. For this reason, event recorders are preferable to Holter monitors for patients with palpitations.\n",

            "abstract": "Lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients. In a pilot study we demonstrated that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the system's effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 55) or control (n = 55) group, and 105 (95.5%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9.1 \u00b1 15.6 mmHg (SD; P < 0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.1 \u00b1 2.3 mmHg (SE; P < 0.005). Furthermore, 51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of <130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of control subjects (P < 0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4.1 \u00b1 3.76; exit, 5.2 \u00b1 4.30; P = 0.014). This study demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with automated self-care support reduced the blood pressure of diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved hypertension control. Home blood pressure monitoring alone had no effect on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative psychological effects.\n",

The potential of Web-assisted interventions for increasing physical activity and improving metabolism in older individuals holds great promise but to our knowledge it has not been studied.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe goal of our study was to assess whether a Web-based intervention increases physical activity and improves metabolic health in inactive older adults.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a 3-month randomized, waitlist-controlled trial in a volunteer sample of 235 inactive adults aged 60-70 years without diabetes. The intervention group received the Internet program Philips DirectLife, which was directed at increasing physical activity using monitoring and feedback by accelerometer and digital coaching. The primary outcome was relative increase in physical activity measured objectively using ankle- and wrist-worn accelerometers. Secondary outcomes of metabolic health included anthropometric measures and parameters of glucose metabolism.\n## RESULTS\nIn total, 226 participants (97%) completed the study. At the ankle, activity counts increased by 46% (standard error [SE] 7%) in the intervention group, compared to 12% (SE 3%) in the control group (P(difference)<.001). Measured at the wrist, activity counts increased by 11% (SE 3%) in the intervention group and 5% (SE 2%) in the control group (P(difference)=.11). After processing of the data, this corresponded to a daily increase of 11 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous activity in the intervention group versus 0 minutes in the control group (P(difference)=.001). Weight decreased significantly more in the intervention group compared to controls (-1.5 kg vs -0.8 kg respectively, P=.046), as did waist circumference (-2.3 cm vs -1.3 cm respectively, P=.036) and fat mass (-0.6% vs 0.07% respectively, P=.025). Furthermore, insulin and HbA1c levels were significantly more reduced in the intervention group compared to controls (both P<.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis was the first study to show that in inactive older adults, a 3-month Web-based physical activity intervention was effective in increasing objectively measured daily physical activity and improving metabolic health. Such Web-based interventions provide novel opportunities for large scale prevention of metabolic deregulation in our rapidly aging population.\n",

Pittsburgh, PA) is a physical activity and lifestyle monitor that objectively and accurately measures free-living energy balance and sleep and includes software for self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy intake. The real-time feedback of the SWA can improve individual self-monitoring and, therefore, enhance weight loss outcomes.\n## METHODS\nWe recruited 197 sedentary overweight or obese adults (age, 46.8 \u00b1 10.8 y; body mass index (BMI), 33.3 \u00b1 5.2 kg/m(2); 81% women, 32% African-American) from the greater Columbia, South Carolina area. Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups, a self-directed weight loss program via an evidence-based weight loss manual (Standard Care, n = 50), a group-based behavioral weight loss program (GWL, n = 49), the armband alone (SWA-alone, n = 49), or the GWL plus the armband (GWL+SWA, n = 49), during the 9-month intervention. The primary outcome was change in body weight and waist circumference. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis compared change in the intervention groups to the standard care group on weight and waist circumference status after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, energy expenditure, and recruitment wave.\n## RESULTS\nBody weight was available for 62% of participants at 9 months (52% standard care, 70% intervention). There was significant weight loss in all 3 intervention groups (GWL, 1.86 kg, P = 0.05; SWA-alone, 3.55 kg, P = 0.0002; GWL+SWA, 6.59 kg, P < 0.0001) but not in the Standard Care group (0.89 kg, P = 0.39) at month 9. Only the GWL+SWA group achieved significant weight loss at month 9 compared to the Standard Care group (P = 0.04). Significant waist circumference reductions were achieved in all 4 groups at month 9 (Standard Care, 3.49 cm, P = 0.0004; GWL, 2.42 cm, P = 0.008; SWA-alone, 3.59 cm, P < 0.0001; GWL+SWA, 6.77 cm, P < 0.0001), but no intervention group had significantly reduced waist circumference compared to the Standard Care group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nContinuous self-monitoring from wearable technology with real-time feedback may be particularly useful to enhance lifestyle changes that promote weight loss in sedentary overweight or obese adults. This strategy, combined with a group-based behavioral intervention, may yield optimal weight loss.\n",

Task-related practice is a critical component for improving patient outcomes.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo test the feasibility of providing quantitative feedback about daily walking performance and motivating greater skills practice via remote sensing.\n## METHODS\nIn this phase III randomized, single blind clinical trial, patients participated in conventional therapies while wearing wireless sensors (triaxial accelerometers) at both ankles. Activity-recognition algorithms calculated the speed, distance, and duration of walking bouts. Three times a week, therapists provided either feedback about performance on a 10-meter walk (speed only) or walking speed feedback plus a review of walking activity recorded by the sensors (augmented). Primary outcomes at discharge included total daily walking time, derived from the sensors, and a timed 15-meter walk.\n## RESULTS\nSixteen rehabilitation centers in 11 countries enrolled 135 participants over 15 months. Sensors recorded more than 1800 days of therapy, 37 000 individual walking bouts, and 2.5 million steps.

Remarkably modest time was spent walking. Wireless sensing, however, allowed clinicians to audit skills practice and provided ground truth regarding changes in clinically important, mobility-related activities.\n",

Participants receiving the telehealth intervention were taught to measure and record their vital signs (blood pressure, weight, temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) on a daily basis. These were then transmitted automatically via telephone to a secure Web site where they were monitored each day by the telehealth nurse.\n## RESULTS\nThe telehealth group had fewer ED presentations and hospital admissions and a reduced length of stay in comparison with the control group. These results were not statistically significant. However, the reduction in health service use was large enough to result in significant cost savings, with the annual cost savings of the telehealth group compared with the control group being $2,931 per person.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelehealth monitoring of patient vital signs reduced health service utilization for individuals with COPD and resulted in significant cost savings. In terms of individual health benefits, improvements in participants' self-management behaviors and control over their condition was evident.\n",

A randomized control trial tested the impact of 3 months of telehome monitoring on hospital readmission, quality of life, and functional status in patients with heart failure or angina. The intervention consisted of video conferencing and phone line transmission of weight, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms. Telehome monitoring significantly reduced the number of hospital readmissions and days spent in the hospital for patients with angina and improved quality of life and functional status in patients with heart failure or angina. Patients found the technology easy to use and expressed high levels of satisfaction. Telehealth technologies are a viable means of providing home monitoring to patients with heart disease at high risk of hospital readmission to improve their self-care abilities.\n",

A further 10 patients with SSc and 10 with RA were enrolled as controls to perform a similar home kinesiotherapy protocol with the aid of common daily-life objects. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at followup, after 6 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome of the trial was hand function measured by Dreiser's index (Functional Index for Hand OA, FIHOA), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Hand Mobility in Scleroderma (HAMIS) test (only for SSc).\n## RESULTS\nPatients with SSc showed an improvement of FIHOA in both arms (p < 0.01) but the HAQ (p = 0.016) and the HAMIS test (right hand p = 0.016, left hand p = 0.075) improved significantly only in the experimental arm. Patients with RA showed a statistically significant improvement of FIHOA (p = 0.013) and HAQ (p = 0.015) in the experimental arm, while patients in the control arm did not significantly improve. However, no statistically significant differences in outcome measures between treatment methods were observed. Withdrawals were higher in control arms (SSc 20%; RA 30%) than in experimental arms (SSc 10%; RA 10%).\n## CONCLUSION\nTelemonitoring of self-administered kinesiotherapy programs is a promising approach to the rehabilitation of hand functions in patients with rheumatic disease.\n",

It was powered for longitudinal analysis, but not for adjusted single-time point comparisons. The intervention group (n = 58) received modification of movement patterns augmented by motion-sensor movement biofeedback (ViMove, dorsaVi.com) plus guidelines-based medical or physiotherapy care. The control group (n = 54) received a placebo (wearing the motion-sensors without biofeedback) plus guidelines-based medical or physiotherapy care. Primary outcomes were self-reported pain intensity (VAS) and activity limitation (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)), all on 0-100 scales. Both groups received 6-8 treatment sessions. Outcomes were measured seven times during 10-weeks of treatment and at 12, 26 and 52 week follow-up, with 17.0 % dropout. Patients were not informed of group allocation or the study hypothesis.\n## RESULTS\nAcross one-year, there were significant between-group differences favouring the intervention group [generalized linear model coefficient (95 % CI): group effect RMDQ -7.1 (95 % CI-12.6;-1.6), PSFS -10.3 (-16.6; -3.9), QVAS -7.7 (-13.0; -2.4); and group by time effect differences (per 100 days) RMDQ -3.5 (-5.2; -2.2), PSFS -4.7 (-7.0; -2.5), QVAS -4.8 (-6.1; -3.5)], all p < 0.001.

If problems were identified from information from the website, the patient was contacted by telephone as necessary.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nPAP adherence after 3 mo, subjective sleep quality, and side effects\n## RESULTS\nSeventy-five patients were enrolled; 39 were randomized to telemedicine and 36 to standard care. The mean age \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) was 53.5 \u00b1 11.2 yr, mean AHI was 41.6 \u00b1 22.1 events/hr, and 80% of patients were male. After 3 mo, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm (191 min per day) versus the standard arm (105 min per day; mean difference = 87 min, 95% confidence interval (CI): 25-148 min, P = 0.006, unpaired t test). On days when PAP was used, mean adherence was 321 min in the telemedicine arm and 207 min in the standard arm (difference = 113 min, 95% CI: 62-164 min, P < 0.0001). Significant independent predictors of adherence included age, baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and use of telemedicine. On average, an additional 67 min of technician time was spent on patients in the telemedicine arm compared with the standard arm (P = 0.0001).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPAP adherence can be improved with the use of a web-based telemedicine system at the initiation of treatment.\n",

Both control and intervention participants received traditional education material on diet and physical activity. Laboratory data on weight and clinical indicators (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, or low-density lipoprotein), and self-reported data on physical activity, were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.\n## RESULTS\nAt 6 months, the intervention group increased leisure walking minutes by 164% compared with 47% in the control group. The intervention group also lost more weight than the controls (5.2 pounds compared with 1.5 pounds). There were no observed significant differences in vigorous exercise or clinical indicators between the 2 groups. Among intervention participants, greater OSN use, as measured by number of private messages sent, was associated with a greater increase in leisure walking and greater weight reduction over the study period.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe study provides evidence that interventions using OSNs can successfully promote increases in physical activity and weight loss.\n",

This study tested the utility of a wearable sensor/device (Fitbit(\u00ae) One\u2122; Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, CA) and short message service (SMS) text-messaging prompts to increase PA in overweight and obese adults.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nSixty-seven adults wore a Fitbit One tracker for 6 weeks; half were randomized to also receive three daily SMS-based PA prompts. The Fitbit One consisted of a wearable tracker for instant feedback on performance and a Web site/mobile application (app) for detailed summaries. Outcome measures were objectively measured steps and minutes of PA by intensity using two accelerometers: Actigraph\u2122 (Pensacola, FL) GT3X+ (primary measure) at baseline and Week 6 and Fitbit One (secondary measure) at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n## RESULTS\nMixed-model repeated-measures analysis of primary measures indicated a significant within-group increase of +4.3 (standard error [SE]=2.0) min/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) at 6-week follow-up (p=0.04) in the comparison group (Fitbit only), but no study group differences across PA levels. Secondary measures indicated the SMS text-messaging effect lasted for only 1 week: the intervention group increased by +1,266 steps (SE=491; p=0.01), +17.8\u2009min/week MVPA (SE=8.5; p=0.04), and +38.3\u2009min/week total PA (SE=15.9; p=0.02) compared with no changes in the comparison group, and these between-group differences were significant for steps (p=0.01), fairly/very active minutes (p<0.01), and total active minutes (p=0.02).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that the Fitbit One achieved a small increase in MVPA at follow-up and that the SMS-based PA prompts were insufficient in increasing PA beyond 1 week. Future studies can test this intervention in those requiring less help and/or test strategies to increase participants' engagement levels.\n",

To this end, we investigated the efficacy of telemonitoring physical activity and nutrition over 12 months in patients with metabolic syndrome in a randomized, parallel-group, open trial.\n## METHODS\nScreening all over Germany yielded 184 patients with metabolic syndrome. All patients attended a single 2-hour instruction meeting in their region concerning a combination diet and the importance of physical activity. Thereafter they were randomized into a control group (controls, n = 62) or one of 2 different intervention groups. Both intervention groups were issued accelerometers, which measured physical activity, recorded daily weight and calorie intake, and transmitted these data to a central server for use by patient carers. In the Active Body Control Program of University of Magdeburg (ABC) intervention group (n = 60), information and motivation was ensured by weekly letters. In the 4sigma telephone coaching (4S) intervention group (n = 58), this was accomplished by monthly telephone calls from the carers. Clinical and biochemical data for all patients were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 12 months without any regular face-to-face meetings between patients and carers. The primary endpoint was weight loss and the secondary endpoint was the presence of metabolic syndrome.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 12 months the dropout rates in the control, 4S, and ABC groups were respectively 35%, 17%, and 18%. The adjusted relative weight losses after 12 months were respectively 3.7%, 8.6%, and 11.4% (all p < 0.000 versus baseline). ABC was more effective than 4S (p = 0.041); 43% of the patients completing the study in the ABC group lost more than 15% of their baseline weight. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was no longer applicable in 58% of the cases in the ABC group, in 41% of the 4S group, and in 33% of the controls.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelemonitoring of physical activity and nutrition markedly improves weight loss and markers of metabolic syndrome.\n",
