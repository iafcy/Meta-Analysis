Efficacy of multiparametric telemonitoring on
respiratory outcomes in elderly people with
COPD: a randomized controlled trial

Abstract
Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with a high
health care resource consumption and health care expenditures, driven mainly by exacerbations-related
hospitalizations. Telemedicine has been proposed as a mean for timely detection of exacerbation, but the available
evidence is inadequate to provide conclusive information on its efficacy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
efficacy of a telemonitoring system in reducing COPD-related hospitalizations in an elderly population with COPD.
Methods: This is a parallel arms, randomized trial including patients aged 65 or older with COPD in GOLD stages II
and III enrolled in a Pulmonary Medicine outpatient facility. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a non-invasive
system able to telemonitor vital signs (oxygen saturation, heart rate, near-body temperature, overall physical activity)
or standard care, and were followed up for 9 months. The outcome measures were the number of exacerbations and
exacerbation-related hospitalization.
Results: Fifty patients were included in the telemonitoring group and 49 in the control group. The incidence rate of
respiratory events was 28/100 person/years in the telemonitoring group vs. 42/100 person/years in the control group
(incidence rate ratio: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.32 – 1.36). The corresponding figures for hospital admissions where 13/100
person/years and 20/100 person/years, respectively (IRR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.21 – 1.86).
Conclusions: In our study, COPD patients followed up with the aid of a multiparametric remote monitoring system
experienced a lower rate of exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations compared to patients followed up using
the standard model of care. These results need to be replicated in larger studies before they can be applied to the
general COPD population. Trial registration number: NCT01481506 (clinicaltrials.gov). Funding: co-financed by Lazio

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
highly prevalent condition that is expected to be the third
cause of death worldwide by 2020 [1]. It is also associated
with important risk of disability with a related very high
use of health care resources. It has been reported that hos-
pital care, which is mainly driven by exacerbations, is the
main component of health care expenditures, and exac-
erbations prevention can reduce costs [2]. Comorbidity,

mainly cardiovascular, substantially contributes to health
care costs [3]. Selected interventions, such as patient’s
education and dedicated health programs [4] as well as
some pharmacological measures [5], have achieved this
objective. Telemedicine has also been tried as a mean
for detecting worsening health status and to implement
timely interventions [6]. The relevant experience, how-
ever, is scarce because the vast majority of the studies are
small and lack a control group [7].
Telemonitoring of COPD patients has been so far
based upon programmed or on demand vocal interac-
tion or periodical transmission of expiratory peak flow
or transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SaO2) [8-11]. All

these interventions are monodimensional in nature and
episodic or periodic in their timing, and have yielded
mixed results with respect to cost reduction and quality
of life improvement. COPD, mainly in the presence of car-
diovascular comorbidity, is multidimensional in its impact
on health status [12,13].
Furthermore, older age can modulate the clinical
expression of COPD and its exacerbations by increas-
ing the relative weight of non respiratory symptoms such
as muscle weakness or dizziness [14]. Thus, a multidi-
mensional approach seems desirable for a comprehensive
monitoring of COPD patients, mainly if in the geri-
atric age, to identify timely changes in health dimensions
heralding COPD exacerbations. Such a monitoring sys-
tem has to be accurate, but also simple, economic and
user-friendly in order to be useful in clinical practice.
In the present study we present a randomized, parallel-
group trial of a multiparametric remote monitoring sys-
tem measuring physical activity, cardiac and respiratory
rates, near-body temperature and peripheral oxygen satu-
ration.
Methods
Study design
This was a single-center, unmasked, randomized trial
with 9 months of follow-up of multi-parametric telemon-
itoring vs. standard care. Patients were recruited among
those attending the Pneumology outpatient facilities of
the Campus Biomedico University in Rome by a study
researcher. Eligibility criteria were age ≥65 years and
diagnosis of COPD stage II or III according to the GOLD
criteria (http://www.goldcopd.org): forced expiratory vol-
ume in the first second (FEV1) / forced vital capacity
(FVC) < 0.7 and 30% <FEV1 percent predicted < 80%.
We excluded patients with a life expectancy < 6 months
and those with cognitive impairment severe enough to
preclude the use of the telemonitoring device. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee at the
Campus Biomedico University (#29/2009).
Intervention
The “SweetAge” monitoring system was developed specif-
ically for this study by a collaborative group of includ-
ing both research centers and business enterprises (see
“Acknowledgements”). It is made up by three main com-
ponents on the patient’s side:
1. a wristband that contained the sensors for heart rate,
physical activity, near-body temperature, and
galvanic skin response. The wristband also contained
a bluetooth transmitter;
2. a commercial pulse-oxymeter (Nonin Medical Inc.)
connected to a bluetooth transmitter coupled with
the wristband;
3. a commercial cellular telephone coupled with the
wristband via a bluetooth connection. The telephone
was equipped with a software that allowed the
reception of the data transmitted by the wristband
and acted as a gateway to send the data to the
monitoring system.
The system was extensively tested before the begin-
ning of the trial on both healthy controls and COPD
patients. The information obtained were compared to
those objectively measured, and a satisfactory agreement
was obtained. It should be noted that for oxygen satura-
tion the “SweetAge” system used a commercial device, and
therefore for this parameter we only tested the depend-
ability of the transmission system.
A dedicated software allowed real-time monitoring of
the information gathered by the devices listed above. This
monitor system was web-based and accessed through a
secure connection using a standard Internet browser. The
operation of the components of the patient’s side were
mostly automatic: the patients only had to wear the wrist-
band and to turn it on, while keeping the cell phone
in the range of the bluetooth transmission. The patient
was not aware of wristband operations, except for oxy-
gen saturation: a sound reminded the patient to wear the
pulse-oxymeter when the measurement were scheduled.
The system was set up to perform 5 measurement of
each parameter every three hours. Oxygen saturation was
measured over 1 minute, for the others parameters five
measurements of 1 minute each were performed at a sam-
pling rate of 60 Hz. The measurements were averaged
by the monitor system and displayed as the mean value
to the operator. The individual values were available on
demand. The patient could access the data at the moment
of measurement, as they were displayed on the telephone’s
screen.
The data received were evaluated every day by a physi-
cian skilled in the care of respiratory patients. The mon-
itor system displayed an alert when a measurement was
outside the predefined range. The limits for these alerts
could be customized for the individual patient by the user
of the system on the basis of the patient’s specific clinical
situation. This system, however, was intended for moni-
toring only, and the patients were instructed to contact
their usual health care provider in case of need.
In case of abnormal readings, the physician contacted
the patient to verify whether their symptoms had wors-
ened or new symptoms had arisen. In this event, the
patient’s adherence to therapy was checked and, if unsat-
isfactory, individually tailored interventions promoting
adherence were carried up. Otherwise, a diagnosis of
exacerbation was made and, on the basis of its severity a
office appointment (for mild exacerbations) or a hospital
admission was scheduled.

Outcome
The outcome measures of these study were: number of
exacerbations, defined as a sustained worsening of the
patient’s condition, from the stable state and beyond nor-
mal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and
necessitates a change in regular medications [15], and
number of hospital admissions. All the information were
gathered from clinical records, when available, or in per-
son/telephone interview.
Sample size
We anticipated a mean of 1.5 exacerbation/patient/year
[16], corresponding to a risk of 81% of having the event.
Allowing for a type I error rate of 5%, we calculated that
a sample size of 50 patients per group would provide a
80% power of detecting a 30% reduction of the risk. Par-
ticipants were allocated to the study groups in a 1:1 ratio
using a computer-generated random list of number.
Analytic approach
The demographic and functional characteristics of the
two groups were compared using descriptive statistics and
t-test or chi-square test, as appropriate. Physical disabil-
ity at baseline was evaluated using the basic Activities of
Daily Living [17] that investigates 6 domains providing
a score ranging from 0 (total disability) to 6 (no disabil-
ity). Cognitive function was investigated using the Mini-
Mental State Examination [18], a scale providing a score
ranging from 0 to 30, with lower scores (< 24) indicating
possible cognitive impairment. The risk for the outcome
of interest was evaluated by calculating incidence rates
and incidence rate ratios along with 95% confidence inter-
vals. All the analyses were performed using the “intention
to treat” approach. The analyses were performed using R
Statistical Software version 2.14 for Linux (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Wien, Austria, 2011).
Results and discussion
The flow diagram of the study is reported in Figure 1.
Overall we followed up 99 patients with a mean age of 74
years. Over the follow-up period, 20% of patients dropped
out from the study, but were followed for the outcomes
of interest. Reasons for drop out were: patient feeling
uncomfortable with the wearable device or thinking that
they disrupt the daily life rhythm.
About two-thirds (68%) of participants were men. The
average FEV1 was 54% of predicted (range 23% – 77%). As
shown in Table 1, there were no differences in the main
characteristics of participants in the two groups, although

controls had a slighly worse performance in instrumental
activities of daily living.
On average, the SweetAge equipment sent data for 150
days/patient, with a mean of 4 measurements/day. Con-
sidering the days in which the system was actually used,
the proportion of days with at least 3 measurements
ranged from 0% to 97% (mean: 60%, interquartile range:
50% – 80%). Per protocol, all the events detected by the
telemonitoring system triggered at least a telephone call
by the study researcher. Only one out of fourteen such
calls revealed a self-limiting problem, while in all other
cases other actions were undertaken.
Overall, we observed 19 events in the control group
and 13 events in the experimental group. Among controls,
15/49 (31%) participants experienced at least 1 respiratory
event, compared to 9/50 (18%) in the SweetAge group.
The incidence of multiple events was 8% among controls
and 4% in the SweetAge group (Figure 2). In terms of
incidence rate, we observed 28 events/100 person year in
the SweetAge group and 42 events/100 person year in the
control group, with and incidence rate ratio of 0.67 (95%
CI: 0.32 - 1.36) (Table 2).
In both groups, about half of the events have been hospi-
tal admissions (46% and 47% in the SweetAge and control

group, respectively). The corresponding incidence rate
was 13/100 person year in the SweetAge group and 20/100
person year in the control group, with an incidence rate
ratio of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.21 - 1.86). The average length of
stay was 9.7 days in the SweetAge group and 6.9 days in
the control group.
The SweetAge system revealed a worsening of periph-
eral oxygen saturation in the days preceding most of the
respiratory events (see Figure 3), allowing a timely inter-
vention (e.g. drug regimen modifications) or, in most
severe cases, to plan the hospital admission avoiding an
emergency room visit.
In our study, COPD patients followed up with the aid
of a multiparametric remote monitoring system experi-
enced a lower rate of exacerbations and COPD-related
hospitalizations compared to patients followed up using
the standard model of care. The presence of a control
group and the common operational framework guaran-
tees for the reliability of our data. In addition, we showed
that respiratory events can actually be timely detected by
a wearable system whose operations are fully automated
and require very little skills on the patient’s side.
Previous studies provided controversial results on the
possibility of preventing exacerbations through a tele-
health approach. A recent review, however, pointed out
that only four out of a thousand studies taken into account
had a control group [19]. A meta-analysis on this topic
[20] concluded that while home telemonitoring and tele-
phone support seem to be effective in reducing the rate
of hospitalization and emergency room visits, the evi-
dence on number of hospital days and on mortality are
conflicting. In our sample, telemonitoring could cut by
33% the risk for hospitalizations. However, the average
length of stay was longer in the study than in the control

group. This finding likely is consistent with a lower thresh-
old for hospitalization in the control group, i. e. for a more
stringent selection of patients needing hospitalization in
the study group. Thus, telemonitoring may be effective
promoting home care of less severe COPD exacerbations.
This result is in keeping with data showing that a “hos-
pital at home” approach is safe and successful in selected
patients [21].
Telephone contacts had a second step role in our tele-
monitoring design. Indeed, despite some positive evi-
dences [6,22,23], a recent metanalysis of 11 studies shows
that telephone based care was associated with greater
mortality than usual care [20] in people with COPD.
Furthermore, this approach could not benefit patients
with heart failure, a condition that, like COPD, is dom-
inated by dyspnea, even in a very large and well con-
ducted trial [24]. It should be noted that dyspnea, the
symptom most commonly collected in the telephone
interview of cardiac or respiratory patients, is subject
to large interindividual variability: non respiratory symp-
toms such as asthenia, leg discomfort/edema dominate
the clinical proportion in a consistent proportion of
COPD patients experiencing severe, even life-threatening
exacerbations [14]. Furthermore, in patients able to per-
form physical activity, the ergoreflex, which originates
from overworking respiratory muscles, causes periph-
eral sympathetic overdischarge and, eventually, peripheral
vasoconstriction, muscle ischemia and fatigue [25]. As a
consequence, patients decrease their already limited activ-
ity, which prevents the worsening of dyspnoea and post-
pones the recognition of the exacerbation. On these bases,
we resolved to monitor also non respiratory parameters
and to consider the telephonic interview as a second step
intervention driven by changes in monitored parameters.
Among the parameters monitored, only oxygen satu-
ration could timely identify COPD exacerbations. This
reflects the expected high specificity of O2 desaturation:
it is very unlikely that a condition other than respiratory
exacerbation accounts for this event. However, minor dif-
ferences in the precritical multiparametric profiles were
evident. The relatively short duration of the study and,
thus, the limited number of critical events prevented us
from verifying whether well defined and repeatable pat-
terns can be identified. A larger study might clarify this
issue, which is of practical as well conceptual interest.
Indeed, defining different trajectories towards the exacer-
bation would also shed light on phenotypic variability of
COPD.
This study has some limitations. We had a lower inci-
dence of events than expected and consequently the con-
fidence interval around our point estimates were large and
we cannot exclude that the better outcomes observed in
the telemonitoring group are due to random error. The
low rate of events observed may have different causes,
including the improved management of COPD in the
latest years. Evidence in support of a more aggressive

treatment of both COPD and their comorbidities, lead-
ing to hospitalization only of more severe exacerbations
has been reported by different studies [26,27]. At any rate,
despite the reduced statistical power, our results are in
line with other showing that remote arterial oxygen sat-
uration monitoring can reduce hospitalizations in people
with very severe COPD [28]. Larger studies, however, are
needed to confirm the effectiveness of this telemonitor-
ing system. Another potential limitation is that cannot
exclude that results were partly due to the education
provided to the patients, although cases and controls
were given the same basic instructions with regard to
perception of changing health status and were offered
the same ambulatory support. However, cases more fre-
quently attended the ambulatory to have information on
the use of the device, and this might have been a source of
difference between groups.
This study also has some methodological and techno-
logical strengths. On the methodological side, it was a rig-
orously designed and conducted randomized trial, which
guarantees for reliability of results. On the technologi-
cal side, at variance form the traditional telemonitoring
of COPD patients, monodimensional in nature or, if mul-
tidimensional, based on cumbersome technological tools
and procedures [20], our telemonitoring system was very
easy to use: the patient had to do little more than wearing
the device. Moreover, it allowed to monitor the patients
at different times of the day and in different conditions
(e.g. indoor vs. outdoor, at rest and during exercise, etc.),
and was suitable for both chronic monitoring and “on
demand” use.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data suggest that, compared to stan-
dard care, a multiparametric remote monitoring system
may reduce COPD exacerbations rates and COPD-related
hospitalizations. This favorable experience needs to be
replicated in larger populations in order to achieve suf-
ficient statistical power and to derive algorithms able to
identify the exacerbation in its “subclinical” stage accord-
ing to different individual profiles.
Unfortunately, enormous economic efforts are com-
monly devoted to pharmacologic, but not to technological
innovation. This trial adds further evidence to the con-
cept that telemonitoring is worth of implementation and
diffusion as a component of the care of COPD.
