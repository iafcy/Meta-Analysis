Abstract—Lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients.
In a pilot study we demonstrated that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages
on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control.
Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the
system’s effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of
244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n55) or control (n55)
group, and 105 (95.5%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory
systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9.115.6
mmHg (SD; P0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.12.3 mmHg (SE; P0.005). Furthermore,
51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of 130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of
control subjects (P0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive
medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened
depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4.13.76; exit, 5.24.30; P0.014). This study
demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with automated self-care support reduced the blood
pressure of diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved hypertension control. Home blood
pressure monitoring alone had no effect on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative psychological
effects. (Hypertension. 2012;60:51-57.) ●Online Data Supplement

owering blood pressure (BP) reduces the risk of cardio-
vascular and renal disease.1 However, in the majority of
hypertensive patients, particularly those with diabetes melli-
tus, BP is poorly controlled,2 despite excellent access to
health care and frequent visits to the physician.3 Such results
spurred development of chronic care models that engage
patients in their own care.4
Home BP monitoring promotes self-care, improves BP
control, and is endorsed by several prominent organiza-
tions as an adjunct to hypertension treatment.5 A recent
meta-analysis suggested that adding telemonitoring to
self-measurement of BP is even more effective in reducing
BP.6 In the telemonitoring studies, however, a physician or
member of the healthcare team reviewed the transmitted
data and contacted the patients to adjust antihypertensive
treatment.7–13 Thus, it is unclear whether the better out-
come was related to the use of a telemonitoring system or
the increased involvement of healthcare providers in the
treatment process.
Previously we reported the development of a home BP
telemonitoring system that provided self-care messages on
the smartphone of patients immediately after each reading.14
Messages were based on care paths defined by running
averages of transmitted readings. The system was designed to

eliminate the need for a health provider to review home BP
readings before management decisions were made. In a pilot
study, the system was highly effective in lowering the BP of
hypertensive diabetic patients.14 This study extends our
preliminary work by comparing its effectiveness in a random-
ized, controlled trial to home BP monitoring without self-care
support. The psychological effects of promoting patient
self-care were also examined.
Methods
Study Design
The study was a prospective, randomized, open, blinded primary
end-point trial, conducted in the offices or clinics of physicians
practicing in metropolitan Toronto. Men and women, 30 years of
age, with diabetes mellitus were recruited from family physicians’
office or hospital-based speciality clinics and advertisements in
public areas of hospitals. All of the potential participants underwent
24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring using the validated oscillometric
SpaceLabs 90207 recorders (SpaceLabs Healthcare, Inc, Issaquah,
WA). The recorders were programmed to measure BP at 20-minute
intervals during the day and every 30 minutes at night. Participants
were instructed to record the time they went to sleep at night and
awoke in the morning. Individuals fulfilling the study’s eligibility
criteria were randomly allocated to home BP monitoring with or
without self-care support. Group allocation schedule was based on
blocks of 4 and 6 patients randomly arranged and administered by a
person not directly involved in the study. Research ethics board of
the 5 participating hospitals approved the study protocol by June
2008, and all of the participants gave written informed consent. The
trial was completed in June 2010.
Study Subjects
Diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension, defined as
a mean daytime systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on ambulatory BP
monitoring, were eligible unless they had severe or end-stage organ
disease (liver, kidney, heart, and lung), a history of diabetic ketoac-
idosis, any illness with expected survival 1 year, severe cognitive
impairment, mental illness or disability, clinically significant cardiac
arrhythmia, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or were pregnant,
unsuitable for participation in the opinion of their primary care
physician, or not fluent in English. Subjects were not required to be
familiar with computers or have access to the Internet. All of the
eligible subjects were asked to monitor their BP at home daily for 7
days, taking 2 readings in the morning and 2 readings in the evening
using a validated Bluetooth-enabled home BP device (Life Source
UA-767, A&D Medical, San Jose, CA). The device was paired with
a smartphone that automatically transmitted every reading to a
central server for processing and storage. At the end of 7 days they
returned the equipment to the study staff. Control group subjects
were then issued with an identical-appearing home BP device
without built-in Bluetooth capability for use during the study. Each
participant provided medical and demographic information, identi-
fied their primary care physician, and completed the Anxiety
Sensitivity Index,15 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,16 and
comfort with self-measurement of BP questionnaires. The former 2
measures have previously undergone psychometric validation,15,16
and the internal reliability of the scale items of the latter measure,
which was created purposely for the study, was excellent ( of 0.86
within our sample).
Telemonitoring Self-Care Support System
We designed, developed, and piloted the system with no commercial
support.14 The patient component consisted of a custom software
application running on a BlackBerry smartphone (Research In
Motion, Inc, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) that was paired with a
Bluetooth-enabled home BP monitoring device. BP readings were
automatically transmitted by the smartphone to application servers,
which processed the information for trends and applied decisions
rules. The reporting and alerting component of the system sent a
self-care message to the screen of the patients’ smartphone imme-
diately after each reading. Messages related to the control of
hypertension were based on care paths defined by running averages
of transmitted readings. They instructed patients whose BP fell
outside the target range (predefined low and high values) to take
additional BP readings, which were then used to provide advice on
the urgency to make a follow-up visit with their physician. The
message to patients whose BP was within the target range indicated
that their hypertension was under control and that they should
continue to monitor their BP as recommended. Nonadherence to the
preset home BP measurement schedule triggered an automated voice
message that was sent to the patients’ home telephone, requesting
them to check the smartphone for a message. Critical alerts were
automatically sent to their physician’s office by fax whenever BP
readings exceeded predetermined threshold values. Simultaneously
an automated voice message was left on the patients’ home telephone
advising them to check their smartphone for a message, which
instructed them to contact their doctor immediately for advice. On
the day before the office visit to their physician, patients called a
dedicated telephone number to initiate the automated process to fax
a 1-page patient summary report to their physician. This process
could also be initiated by the physicians’ office. The summary report
contained a graphic presentation of readings with dates, the current
30-day average of transmitted BP readings, the previous 30-day
average, and the number of readings used to derive the averages.
There were no treatment recommendations. All of the electronic
transmissions were encrypted and deidentified to ensure confidenti-
ality of the personal health information.
Study Protocol
Participants in both groups were taught how to measure their BP
correctly, instructed to measure their BP 2 days per week twice in the
morning and twice in the evening, provided with a validated home
BP monitoring device with appropriate-sized upper arm cuff, and
given a booklet with detailed information on the self-measurement of
BP, treatment of hypertension, and goals of therapy. Their primary
care physician was given an outline of the study’s objectives and BP
treatment goal, asked to provide relevant medical information, and
given a copy of the 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring report. In
both groups, treatment decisions, including medication adjustments
and changes in lifestyle, were made by the patients’ primary care
physician.
Self-care support patients were taught how to use the telem-
onitoring system, review past readings on their smartphone and
the study-specific Web site (these activities were optional), and
generate a 1-page patient summary report. They were instructed
to take their smartphone to all doctor visits. The patient’s
physician was shown the patient summary report, asked to
indicate the low and high threshold BP values for critical alert
messages (default options were provided), and taught how to
change the threshold values. Optionally, they were shown how to
visit the study’s password-protected Web site. The research team
did not contact the subjects in either group or their physician
during the course of the study.
End Points
End point assessments were undertaken 1 year after randomiza-
tion. The primary end point was the change in mean daytime
ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary end points included changes
in 7 days of home BP readings, psychological questionnaire
responses, and prescribed antihypertensive medications. BP con-
trol was defined as 130/80 mmHg on 24-hour ambulatory BP
monitoring. Information on the number of hypertension-related
office visits made by patients during the study year was gathered
from the billing records of their physicians supplemented in cases
of missing data by patient self-report. Information on the dates
and number of transmitted readings, reminder messages, and
alerts was ascertained from data in the application servers. Full
adherence with the home BP measurement schedule (100%) in the
self-care support group was defined as a minimum of 8 readings

per week. No information on home BP monitoring use in the
control group was collected.
Statistical Methods
The study was designed to have a statistical power of 80% to
detect a 4-mmHg reduction in mean daytime systolic BP in the
self-care support group, as compared with control group, using a
2-tailed test with an  level of 5%. In the calculation we used an
SD of the difference of 7.16 mmHg that was obtained by pooling
estimates of studies that reported it on repeated ambulatory BP
monitoring on 2 separate occasions. Assuming a 10% dropout
rate, we estimated a total sample size of 113 patients (56 per
group). To fully exploit the repeated BP measurements in the
ambulatory recordings and home BP assessments, a mixed-model
ANCOVA was used to assess continuous variables, using baseline
BP and body mass index as continuous variables and group
membership as a discrete variable. We specified random subject
effects and fixed treatment effects. Linear contrasts were used to
test for group differences. BP status (controlled or not controlled)
was analyzed using logistic regression with baseline BP and body
mass index as continuous covariates and group membership as a
discrete variable. We compared the distribution of the number of
medications in the 2 groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Because of violations in normality distributions, the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale depression scores were normalized
using a square-root transformation. All of the individuals with
partial or complete outcome data were included in the final
analysis. Results are expressed as means and SD, median and
interquartile range, or proportions, unless otherwise specified. A
2-sided P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Participants
Of 244 diabetic patients screened for uncontrolled systolic
hypertension, 110 subjects fulfilled the trial’s eligibility
criteria and were randomized to the self-care support group
(n55) or control group (n55). Reasons for ineligibility and
failure to complete the study are outlined in the flowchart of
the study population (Figure). There were 96 family physi-
cians and 16 specialists involved in providing care to study
subjects.
Baseline Characteristics
The demographic and clinical characteristics of study partic-
ipants at entry are listed in Tables 1 and S1 (please see the
online-only Data Supplement). There were no significant
differences between groups for these features apart from a
borderline higher percentage of subjects with dyslipidemia in
the self-care support group. There was also no difference in
the mean number of antihypertensive medications per patient
(Table 1) or drug classes (Table S2).
Blood Pressure

primary end point, decreased significantly only in the

(SD;

7.12.3 mmHg (SE; P0.005). There was also a signif-
icant decrease in mean daytime diastolic BP, 24-hour BP,
and night-time BP from baseline in the self-care group and
no significant changes in the control group (Table 2). The
same results were observed using 7 days of self-measured BP
at home instead of ambulatory BP monitoring as the outcome
measure (Table S3). Furthermore, 51% of self-care support
subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of
130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of control subjects
(P0.05).

(Table S4). In addition, there was no significant difference
in the number of visits to family physicians or combined
visits to family physicians and specialists (median number
of 6 in self-care support group and 7 in control group),
even when the small percentage of self-reported data was
excluded (Table 5S). Information on the experience of
using the self-care support system is summarized in Table
S6. Of the total (critical and noncritical) alerts, 75.3% were
sent because average BP readings were above pre-
established threshold values (Table S7). There were 3 high
and 2 low critical alerts.
Psychological Variables
Psychological variables at baseline and outcome are summa-
rized by group in Table 3. Using the self-care support system
did not affect anxiety but worsened depression (P0.014),
and the between-group effect on depression was significant
(P0.032). Comfort with home BP monitoring decreased
significantly in both groups (P0.001), with no between-
group difference.
Discussion
The study demonstrated that home BP telemonitoring com-
bined with self-care support reduced the BP of diabetic
patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and im-
proved hypertension control. Our system was fully auto-
mated, and self-care messages, which were sent immediately
after each BP reading, were based on care paths defined by
running averages of transmitted readings. The BP results
confirmed our pilot study findings14 and were the same
whether 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring or 7-day home
BP measurements were used to assess outcome. In the
self-care support group, 51% achieved the guideline-
recommended BP target of 130/80 mmHg,1 which was
substantially higher than that of 37.5% among treated hyper-
tensive diabetic patients in a recent BP survey in the United
States.2
Patients with chronic conditions inevitably engage in
self-care activities.4 In the case of hypertension, this may take
the form of self-measuring BP, making lifestyle changes, or
experimenting with prescribed treatment. However, for self-
care activities to be effective they need to be based on reliable
information and a meaningful collaboration with healthcare
providers in an overarching framework of maintaining auton-
omy.4 Our study confirmed this precept. We found, as have
others, that better hypertension control can be achieved when
self-measurement of BP is part of a plan that increases patient

engagement in making management decisions. Previous stud-
ies achieved good results by directly linking home BP
monitoring with some form of regular professional supervi-
sion, such as telecounseling8 or implementing action plans
established by a pharmacist,9 nurse,10–12 or family physi-
cian.7,13 These interventions required a health professional to
examine all of the transmitted readings for trends and extreme
values and to contact patients with a management plan. In this
study we were able to independently test the contribution of
home BP telemonitoring by automating these activities,
including the process of responding immediately to critical
BP alerts.
Our study was not specifically designed to study the
mechanisms accounting for the better hypertension control.
Telemonitoring certainly promotes self-care, may improve
medication adherence,17 and has been used successfully to
intensify antihypertensive drug treatment.9,13 However, sev-
eral telemonitoring studies, including our own, have shown
that better outcomes can be achieved without a change in the
number or types of antihypertensive medications prescribed
or in the proportion of subjects whose treatment was adjusted
during the study.8,10,17 In one study this improvement was
related to better adherence to antihypertensive medications.17
Another study showed a decrease in BP in the home moni-
toring service group irrespective of whether there was a
medication change.7 It seems likely that multiple factors,
which have not yet been systematically evaluated, are playing
an important role in reducing BP and achieving target.
In keeping with other home BP monitoring studies of
1-year duration,18–20 we found that self-measurement of BP
on its own failed to lower BP. This finding is not unexpected
based on results of attitude surveys of primary care physi-
cians and patients on home BP monitoring. In a survey
conducted several years ago, American physicians indicated
their reluctance to use home BP monitoring results as the
primary means of making management decisions.21 In On-
tario, only 19% of physicians preferred home BP monitoring
to office or ambulatory readings to guide treatment deci-
sions.22 In France, only 36% of general practitioners who
encouraged their patients to do home BP monitoring
actually used the readings to adjust antihypertensive treat-
ment.23 Furthermore, the attitude of French physicians did
not change from 2004 to 2009, despite strong recommen-
dations of national and international guideline committees
to incorporate home BP monitoring into making treatment
decisions.5 Patients also have an ambivalent attitude to-
ward home BP monitoring. Although the majority of
patients have access to a home BP monitoring device and
are encouraged by their physician to use them, only a third
actually communicated the results to their doctor. Even
more disturbingly, 40% of those with alarming readings
did nothing specific about the results.21 These findings
suggest that the use of home BP monitoring in ongoing
clinical management of hypertension is still not well
accepted by physicians and that home BP monitoring
without linkage to an effective support system does not
provide any direct benefits for patients.
A potential disadvantage of home BP monitoring is the
possibility that patients may become preoccupied with mea-
suring their BP or for those with an anxiety disorder their
symptoms may worsen.5 Like others,13 we found no change
in anxiety score with telemonitoring. However, we did
observed a significant increase in depression score in the
self-care support group. The clinical significance of this
observation is unclear. The discrepancy between the anxiety
and depression effects might suggest that the depression
effect is a chance finding. However, it is known that selective
self-focused attention to bodily symptoms can have unex-
pected negative psychological consequences.24 It is possible
that the intervention contributed to depression by increasing
participants’ attention to their hypertension, even if there was
evidence of improved BP control. Future studies will need to
first replicate our finding and, if confirmed, to find ways to
mitigate the effect.
The study’s limitations need acknowledgement. First, in-
terventions were not masked. However, the same results were
obtained using 2 different methods to assess BP outcomes.
Second, the results may not be generalizable to hypertensive

patients at lower risk for cardiovascular disease or whose
hypertension is easier to control. Third, the study was not
designed to examine in detail mechanisms accounting for the
better outcome in the self-care support group. This now needs
to be undertaken. Fourth, the study did not measure adher-
ence to the recommended home BP measurement schedule in
the control group, record office BP readings, or assess
changes in weight and hemoglobin A1C. Finally, there was
no formal cost-effective analysis. Nonetheless, in designing
the system, we used commercially available hardware and
communicated directly with patients as cost-saving mea-
sures.14 In the future, even greater savings may be achieved
by using the patients’ own smartphone, as smartphones are on
track to outnumber conventional cell phones in the United
States in 2012.25
Perspectives
Home BP telemonitoring combined with automated self-care
support significantly reduced uncontrolled systolic hyperten-
sion in diabetic patients without the use of more or different
antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to
physicians. The mechanisms accounting for the improvement
need to be explored further. Home BP monitoring without
linkage to a patient support system had no effect on BP. The
finding that promoting self-care may have negative psycho-
logical effects requires further study. A major reason for the
failure of physicians to fully endorse the use of home BP
monitoring is the possibility of adverse behavioral effects
associated with its use.21–23 Finally, despite reminder mes-
sages, there was a decline over time in the number of BP
readings per week in the self-care support group, suggesting
a fatigue effect with this intervention. The finding highlights
the need for changes in or additions to the current system to
counter this negative trend.

Novelty and Significance
What Is New?
●Research included development of a fully automated self-care support
system for home BP monitoring.
●We focused on using smartphone technology to facilitate self-care support.
●We also focused on assessing the psychological effects of promoting
self-care.
What Is Relevant?
●Control of hypertension is still poor among hypertensive diabetic patients.
●Improving BP control significantly reduces cardiovascular disease risk.
●Self-care support is a key component of chronic disease models.
Summary
New system improved hypertension control of diabetic patients
with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Home BP monitoring alone
had no effect on BP. Promoting patient self-care may have
negative psychological effects.
