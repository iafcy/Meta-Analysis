Impact of Home-Based Exercise Training with Wireless 
Monitoring on Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome 
Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
Recent studies have suggested a favorable effect of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on patients 
with cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of home-based 
exercise training with wireless monitoring on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 55 ACS patients 
undergoing PCI were randomly divided into home based exercise training with wireless 
monitoring cardiac rehabilitation (CR, n = 26) and usual care (UC, n = 29). Exercise 
capacity and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks. Change of 
metabolic equivalent of the tasks, maximal exercise time and QOL were significantly 
increased (+2.47 vs +1.43, P = 0.021; +169.68 vs +88.31 sec, P = 0.012; and +4.81 vs 
+0.89, P = 0.022, respectively), and the change of submaximal rate pressure product, and 
of submaximal rate of perceived exertion were significantly decreased (-28.24 vs -16.21, 
P = 0.013; and -1.92 vs -1.62, P = 0.018, respectively) in the CR group compared to the 
UC group after 12 weeks. CR using home-based exercise training with wireless monitoring 
led to improvement of exercise capacity and QOL relative to conventional care in ACS 
patients undergoing PCI. Our findings suggest that early scheduled CR may be considered 
in ACS patients undergoing PCI.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) recently has been 
stressed among the approaches for proper cardiac disease man-
agement including diet control, medications, percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (1, 
2). Although home-based, as is the case for in-hospital, CR has 
been shown to improve exercise capacity and quality of life 
(QOL) of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), those par-
ticipating in CR programs have difficulties with compliance (3-
6). Also, objective monitoring and exercise standardization is 
difficult for home-based training because of individual exercise 
prescription, self measurement of heart rates,  heterogeneity 
among patients, and lack of previous research on effects of 
home-based exercise training for acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS) patients.
  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the ef-
fects on exercise capacity and QOL of home-based exercise 
training with wireless monitoring for exercise standardization 
in ACS patients undergoing PCI. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The study participants comprised 60 ACS patients who under-
went successful PCI at our hospital from October 2010 to May 
2011. Patients were randomly allocated to either the CR group 
or the usual care (UC) group. Twenty six patients in the CR 
group and 29 patients in the UC group completed follow-up 
and were available for endpoint analysis (Table 1). The reasons 
for drop out of patients in the CR group were: inability to exer-
cise due to general weakness (n = 2), dizziness (n = 1) and pa-
tient refusal (n = 1); one patient in the UC group was not able to 
exercise due to general weakness. Patients between 18 and 80 
years old with a diagnosis of ACS and having undergone PCI 
were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: chronic sta-
ble angina pectoris or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 
III-IV; left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%; chronic 
renal failure; and inability to exercise. 
Intervention protocol
The CR group received standard medical therapy and a CR pro-

gram, which consisted of educational rehabilitation and exer-
cise training. For educational rehabilitation, the researcher ed-
ucated the subjects in person prior to their hospital discharge 
on risk factors for heart disease, diet control, and how to insti-
tute exercise training. 
  From the second to the twelfth weeks after hospital discharge, 
exercise training consisted of scheduled gait exercise at home 
four to five times weekly 50 min each including flexibility exer-
cise for 20 min (warm-up exercise for 10 min and cool-down 
exercise for 10 min) and main exercise of gait for 30 min. Study 
participants also conducted treadmill exercise once to twice 
while in hospital during the study period. They were instructed 
to perform for 2 weeks after hospital discharge the main exer-
cise at home while wearing the wireless monitoring equipment 
provided (HeartCallTM, U-HEART, Korea) to check their heart 
rates through electrocardiography. A phone call was made to 
them once weekly for counseling, and to minimize risk factors 
and establish exercise intensity in stages (Fig. 1). 
  Exercise intensity was increased in stages from 40% to 80% 
based on heart rate reserve calculated by the difference between 
maximum heart rate and resting heart rate, which was mea-
sured by a gradual symptom-limited exercise stress test. Target 
heart rate was derived from the Karvonen formula: Target heart 
rate = (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate) × percentage + 
resting heart rate. Exercise intensity was 40% weeks 2 to 4, 50% 
weeks 5 to 6, 60% weeks 7 to 8, 70% weeks 9 to 10, and 80% weeks 
11 to 12. The UC group received ordinary medical therapy, diet 
control, and conducted exercise at home on their own and with-
out participating in a CR program.
Gradual symptom-limited exercise stress test
Both groups twice underwent gradual symptom-limited exer-
cise stress testing, at baseline and after week 12. The gradual 
symptom-limited exercise stress test was conducted using the 
modified Bruce protocol with a treadmill to examine exercise 
load (Marquette, GE, Fairfield, CT, USA). Heart rate and blood 
pressure were measured for two minutes during each exercise 
stage using a 12-channel real-time electrocardiogram monitor-
ing system and an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM, 
GE), respectively. Exercise capacity was assessed by submaxi-
mal rate pressure product (RPPsubmax), submaximal rate of 
perceived exertion (RPEsubmax), metabolic equivalent of the 
tasks (METs), and maximal exercise time (ETmax). RPPsubmax 
and RPEsubmax were measured at stage 3, and the 6-20 Borg 
scale was used for the measurement of RPEsubmax. 
Quality of life questionnaire
QOL of both groups was measured at baseline and after week 
12 using a 20-item questionnaire by adding the scores corre-
sponding to each answer. The QOL questionnaire, which was 
independently filled out by all patients based on a previous 
study (7) and with a Cronbach’s alpha reliability of 0.766, in-
cluded: sleep, fatigue, anxiety, chest pain, nutrition, and social 
psychological status.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Pack-
age for the Social Sciences (version 15.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc, 
Chicago, IL, USA). The sample size was determined using a sta-
tistical power of 80% and a type 1 error of 0.05. The Levene-test 
for equal variances was used to verify homogeneity between 
the two groups in terms of gender, age, height, weight, medica-
tions and risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

  Paired t-tests were used to compare the changes in exercise 
capacity, and QOL between baseline and after week 12 in each 
group. Independent t-test was used to test the significance of 
the difference between groups. The statistical significance level, 
P, was set at 0.05.
Ethics statement
The study protocol was approved by the institutional medical 
review board of Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center 
(IRB approval No. 10-1019), and written informed consent was 
obtained from all patients.
RESULTS 
The median age of the CR group was 54 yr with 85% male, while 
the median age of the UC group was 57 yr with 76% male. There 
were no significant differences between the two groups in hei­
ght, weight, and in distribution of medications and risk factors 
such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyper-
lipidemia (P = NS). Baseline exercise capacity assessed by RPP­
submax, RPEsubmax, METs, and ETmax, and QOL were not 
significantly different between groups (P = NS). 
Exercise capacity and quality of life 
The CR group showed significantly decreased RPPsubmax and 
RPEsubmax (159.72 ± 41.11 vs 131.48 ± 22.06 bpm․mmHg, 
P = 0.002, and 10.56 ± 1.98 vs 8.64 ± 1.75, P < 0.001, respective-
ly) and significantly increased METs, ETmax and QOL score 
(7.14 ± 1.86 vs 9.61 ± 1.80, P < 0.001, 670.16 ± 153.42 vs 839.84 ±  
106.65 sec, P < 0.001, and 56.31 ± 5.67 vs 61.12 ± 5.91, P < 0.001, 
respectively) between baseline and after 12 weeks. The UC group 
showed significantly decreased RPEsubmax (11.38 ± 2.32 vs 
9.76 ± 2.01, P < 0.001) and significantly increased METs and 
ETmax (7.07 ± 2.07 vs 8.50 ± 2.05, P = 0.001, and 676.66 ± 145.87 
vs 764.97 ± 125.95 sec, P = 0.001, respectively) between base-
line and after 12 weeks.
  Furthermore, the CR group showed significant improvements 
in the change of RPPsubmax (-28.24 vs -16.21 bpm․mmHg, 
P = 0.013), RPEsubmax (-1.92 vs -1.62, P = 0.018), METs (+2.47 
vs +1.43, P = 0.021), ETmax (+169.68 vs +88.31 sec, P = 0.012), 
and QOL (+4.81 vs +0.89, P = 0.022) compared to the UC group 
(Table 2).
DISCUSSION  
Intervention programs including exercise and medical therapy 
may prevent coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death. 
Regular exercise training is in most individually recommended 
to patients as intervention for coronary artery disease (8) aim-
ing to induce various physiological adaptations, increase oxy-
gen levels in the arteries (9), and decrease rate of perceived ex-
ertion during physical activities or exercise, thereby improving 
cardiac exercise capacity. In the present study, the CR group 
showed significantly decreased RPPsubmax and RPEsubmax 
(-18.7% and -18.2%, respectively) and significantly increased 
METs and ETmax (+34.6% and +25.3%, respectively).
  In line with the present study, in-hospital cardiac rehabilita-
tion for IHD patients had been associated with significantly im-
proved exercise capacity (10-12). Previous studies, however, 
were based on heterogeneous populations including ACS and 
stable angina patients (6, 13), while the present study included 
ACS patients only. In addition, in previous studies home-based 
exercise training was performed through individual exercise 
prescription, and heart rates were measured by the patients 
themselves, whereas in the present study they were instructed 
to use wireless monitoring equipment. Therefore, patients in 
the CR group were able to reduce the anxiety they felt over ex-
ercise during the early period after discharge, and their heart 
rates measured through monitoring verified whether their ex-
ercise intensity was adequate, which in turn enabled prescrip-
tion of exercise intensity in stages. 
  Recent studies showed that QOL of IHD patients is improved

by a CR program even in patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion (4, 14, 15). Similarly, in the present study, the CR group 
showed a significant increase in QOL score (+8.5%). In most 
IHD patients, anxiety over exercise, social participation, and re-
turn to their job during an early period after hospital discharge 
may play a major factor that reduced their QOL. Possible expla-
nations of improvement of QOL in the CR program are that the 
invention program may ameliorate participant’s risk factors by 
education and increase exercise capacity by gradual exercise 
loading, resulting in improvement of their job performance and 
a better QOL. 
  The timing and safety of exercise performance are an impor-
tant aspect in ACS patients after hospital discharge. Previous 
investigations have reported that the exercise program was laun­
ched at least 4 to 6 weeks after discharge (14, 15), whereas the 
present study started the CR program in all patients 1 week af-
ter discharge without any cardiac complications. Furthermore, 
most patients in the present study safely completed our CR 
program without cardiac symptoms and only two patients in 
the CR group complained of atypical chest discomfort. These 
observations suggest that an individually tailored CR program 
can safely be used in the acute phase (1 week later) after hospi-
tal discharge in ACS patients who underwent PCI.  
  Similar to the current study, Ades et al. (16) demonstrated 
the favorable effect of cardiac rehabilitation exercise at home 
on QOL using transtelephonic monitoring. The possible bene-
fits of wireless monitoring include the ability to reduce the anxi-
ety felt by patients over exercise during an early period after 
discharge, to verify the adequacy of exercise intensity by mea-
suring their heart rates through wireless monitoring, and to 
prescribe exercise intensity in stages. These findings encourage 
further research on wireless monitoring to allow safer physical 
activity and exercise and popularization of wireless monitoring. 
  The present study has several limitations. First, due to the 
short study period, comparison with previous studies on a 
long-term basis was difficult. Second, because the subjects 
were ACS patients, who are relatively poorly represented in 
numbers among heart disease patients, the number of study 
participants was too small to generalize its results. Third, al-
though the patients performed exercise on wireless monitoring 
equipment and were counseled and managed through phone 
calls, quantification of exercise was difficult. Fourth, because of 
the diverse patient job characteristics, standardization of indi-
vidual job load was difficult. Fifth, although used in a previous 
study (7), the QOL questionnaire used in the present study may 
need further validation. 
  The present study assessed the effects of home-based exer-
cise training by scheduled walking started at an early period af-
ter hospital discharge in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Com-
pared to the UC control group, CR using home-based exercise 
training with wireless monitoring can improve not only exer-
cise capacity but also QOL in this patient subset. Therefore, our 
findings suggest that scheduled early CR may be considered in 
ACS patients undergoing PCI. In particular, the finding that pa-
tients were able to reduce their anxiety by using the wireless 
monitoring equipment during exercise at home is considered 
clinically meaningful and more studies on its clinical applica-
tion are warranted to complement the present study.
