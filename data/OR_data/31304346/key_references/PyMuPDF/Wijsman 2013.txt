Abstract
Background: Lack of physical activity leads to detrimental changes in body composition and metabolism, functional decline,
and increased risk of disease in old age. The potential of Web-assisted interventions for increasing physical activity and improving
metabolism in older individuals holds great promise but to our knowledge it has not been studied.
Objective: The goal of our study was to assess whether a Web-based intervention increases physical activity and improves
metabolic health in inactive older adults.
Methods: We conducted a 3-month randomized, waitlist-controlled trial in a volunteer sample of 235 inactive adults aged 60-70
years without diabetes. The intervention group received the Internet program Philips DirectLife, which was directed at increasing
physical activity using monitoring and feedback by accelerometer and digital coaching. The primary outcome was relative increase
in physical activity measured objectively using ankle- and wrist-worn accelerometers. Secondary outcomes of metabolic health
included anthropometric measures and parameters of glucose metabolism.
Results: In total, 226 participants (97%) completed the study. At the ankle, activity counts increased by 46% (standard error
[SE] 7%) in the intervention group, compared to 12% (SE 3%) in the control group (Pdifference<.001). Measured at the wrist,
activity counts increased by 11% (SE 3%) in the intervention group and 5% (SE 2%) in the control group (Pdifference=.11). After
processing of the data, this corresponded to a daily increase of 11 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous activity in the intervention
group versus 0 minutes in the control group (Pdifference=.001). Weight decreased significantly more in the intervention group
compared to controls (−1.5 kg vs −0.8 kg respectively, P=.046), as did waist circumference (−2.3 cm vs −1.3 cm respectively,
P=.036) and fat mass (−0.6% vs 0.07% respectively, P=.025). Furthermore, insulin and HbA1c levels were significantly more
reduced in the intervention group compared to controls (both P<.05).
Conclusions: This was the first study to show that in inactive older adults, a 3-month Web-based physical activity intervention
was effective in increasing objectively measured daily physical activity and improving metabolic health. Such Web-based
interventions provide novel opportunities for large scale prevention of metabolic deregulation in our rapidly aging population.

Introduction
Lack of physical activity is perhaps one of the greatest risk
factors for contemporary societal health problems. Insufficient
physical activity contributes to obesity and has been associated
with increased risks of cardiovascular disease [1,2], diabetes
mellitus [3], cognitive decline [4,5], and premature mortality
[6,7]. For the older age groups, this is of particular relevance
as physical activity decreases with age, while the prevalence of
metabolic disease and its complications increase as a function
of age. Intervention studies directed at increasing physical
activity have been shown to be effective and may improve
metabolism [8], including the older populations [9,10]. However,
most 
of 
these 
interventions 
have 
used 
face-to-face
communication, making them costly and time-consuming, thus
hampering the potential of implementation as preventive
programs at a larger scale.
Modern technologies, such as Internet and email, provide
interactive ways to administer digital coaching and feedback
on physical activity and have potential for wide-scaled
implementation. A recent meta-analysis on Web-based physical
activity intervention studies showed promising results in
increasing daily physical activity [11]. Many of these, however,
used either small study populations, included study populations
under the age of 60, or did not measure physical activity
objectively. Moreover, it is unclear what the effect is of such
Web-based physical activity interventions on outcomes of
metabolic health in old age [12,13].
Since 2005, Internet use has doubled in 65-75 year olds in the
Netherlands [14]; 70% of this age group is familiar with using
the Internet and therefore provides a target for Web-based
interventions. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined
whether a 3-month Web-assisted intervention directed at
increasing daily physical activity was effective in 60-70 year
old inactive individuals. The intervention comprised an Internet
program aimed at increasing physical activity, which focused
on effective components of health behavior change including
self-monitoring by accelerometer and goal setting with the help
of digital coaching. Furthermore, we studied the effect of this
intervention on metabolic health including anthropometric
measures and markers of glucose and lipid metabolism.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The study recruited participants aged 60-70 years from the
region of Leiden, Netherlands. The recruitment strategy included
advertisements in local newspapers and press notification,
directing participants motivated to increase physical activity to
the study website where they completed an online questionnaire
that assessed the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: (1)
age between 60 and 70 years, (2) no history of diabetes or use
of glucose lowering medication, (3) absence of disability
impeding increase in physical activity, and (4) possession and
use of personal computer with Internet connection. If all of the
above criteria were met, potential participants filled out an email
address where they subsequently received a questionnaire asking
for current physical activity and personal data such as full name
and address. The presence of an inactive lifestyle was then
assessed by a self-reported physical activity questionnaire:
general practice physical activity questionnaire, GPPAQ [15].
This yielded four categories of physical activity: inactive,
moderately inactive, moderately active, and active. We defined
inactive as having less than 3 hours of exercise and cycling
combined weekly, corresponding to the inactive, moderately
inactive, or moderately active category. Participants in the active
category of GPPAQ did not meet inclusion criteria for our
definition of an inactive lifestyle.
Subjects who met all inclusion criteria received detailed study
information in print. If willing to participate, participants
received an online questionnaire on education, smoking status,
medical history, and medication use, and visited the study center
at baseline and after 3 months (13 weeks). At the baseline visit,
subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention group or
a waitlist control group (in which the participants received the
intervention program after 3 months when the study ended) by
the study physician or research nurse. Randomization was
performed by a computerized program for intervention versus
waitlist control in a ratio of 1:1, with a block size of 12.
Stratification was performed by gender. Concealment of
treatment allocation was ensured by randomizing at the end of
the first study visit, after all baseline measurements and
instructions at the study center were completed. Blinding of this
intervention was not possible and therefore not applied. Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was
approved by the medical ethical committee of Leiden University
Medical Center, Netherlands. An independent physician was
available for questions regarding study information.
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size of the study was based on the assumption of a
mean 10% higher increase (SD 25%) in daily physical activity
counts as measured using accelerometers on the ankle and wrist
in the intervention group compared to the control group during
a 3-month period. For this effect size with a power of 0.80 at
alpha 0.05 (two-sided), we calculated a sample size of 198
participants for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Based on
an estimated drop-out rate of 15%, we aimed to include 232
participants and stopped after successful inclusion of 235
participants.

Intervention
Subjects in the intervention group received a commercially
available Web-based physical activity program (DirectLife,
Philips, Consumer Lifestyle, Amsterdam) directed at increasing
daily physical activity. The DirectLife program is based on the
stages of change and I-change health behavior change models
[16,17] and takes into account the individual’s current activity
level. It then provides a personal goal. Briefly, DirectLife
consists of three elements: (1) an accelerometer-based activity
monitor, (2) a personal website, and (3) a personal e-coach, who
provides regular updates of the individual’s physical activity
status by email and gives advice to increase physical activities
(Multimedia Appendix 1). By means of these elements, the
program aims to increase awareness about one’s own physical
activity behavior, to give feedback on recent actual physical
activity, and to provide support to make sustainable changes in
physical activity behavior. The activity monitor of DirectLife
is based on the Tracmor tri-axial accelerometer and has been
validated against doubly labeled water for the estimation of
total daily life energy expenditure [18]. The DirectLife monitor
is the consumer version of the Tracmor. Intervention group
participants received the program, including the accelerometer,
directly after randomization at the first study visit. They then
received a link by email for registration and access to the Web
program. Participants of the program were instructed to
continuously wear the activity monitor throughout the day to
measure daily physical activity (Multimedia Appendix 2). Data
were uploaded through an Internet connection to the database
of the commercial provider. After an initial 8-day “assessment
period” starting 1 week after the study visit, in which the current
level of daily activity was measured, a target was set to increase
the level of daily activity during a 12-week Web-based
interactive coaching program. Participants were given a target
for daily activity, which increased weekly, and data from the
accelerometer were used for regular feedback (Multimedia
Appendix 3). Coaching included general recommendations on
physical activities, and coaches were available for further
questions and advice by email correspondence. All participants
were in contact with one of the digital coaches available for the
DirectLife program during the entire study period.
The control group was placed on a 3-month waiting list, after
which they received access to the intervention program at the
end of the study. No specific instructions regarding daily
physical activity were given.
Measurements
Baseline Questionnaire
Enrollment and follow-up took place from November 2011 to
August 2012. In preparation for the first visit to the study center,
all participants completed a Web-delivered questionnaire on
education, smoking status, and medical history, including
medication use. Education was categorized as low (primary
education and lower vocational education), intermediate
(secondary education and intermediate vocational education),
or high (high vocational education and university).
Primary Outcome
At baseline and 3-month follow-up, daily physical activity was
measured during 7 days following the visit at the study center,
using an ankle- and wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer
(GENEActiv, Kimbolton, Cambs, United Kingdom). Wear was
started on a random weekday, and GENEActive monitors were
returned after 7 days by standard mail. We chose to assess the
primary outcome using accelerometers other than the one
included in the intervention program in order to avoid
interpretation of the intervention as an outcome. Both
GENEActiv monitors were worn 24 hours per day on the right
side. The GENEActiv wrist accelerometer provides a simple
summary statistic of total activity counts has been validated for
measuring daily physical activity against doubly labeled water
[19]. We chose to additionally assess total activity counts using
an ankle accelerometer as we hypothesized that this location
would be more sensitive to walking and cycling behavior
[20,21], the latter being a very frequent activity in our target
population in the Netherlands. Primary outcome was the
individual’s relative change in activity counts after the
intervention compared to baseline, measured at wrist and ankle.
As a derivative outcome, we calculated from the wrist
accelerometer the minutes per day spent in moderate or vigorous
activity, which has been validated against indirect calorimetry
[22].
Measurement frequency was set at 85.7 Hz, and raw acceleration
values in “g” were recorded continuously on each axis over 7
consecutive days. Prior to processing, data were plotted for
visual identification of non-wear and device faults. Non-wear
was determined visually using thresholds of movement in
combination with self-reported non-wear from participants.
Short periods of non-wear (eg, bathing) were accepted, and data
for these periods were not imputed. Accelerometer data from
participants contributing to GENEActiv data for 5 days or more
within the 7-day period were included in the analysis. Data from
each axis were processed by a high pass RC filter (fc=0.27 HZ)
before computation of the resultant acceleration for each
recorded time point: R=(x2 + y2 + z2)0.5. The average of each
24-hour integral of these values over the first 5 days was used
as the average daily activity count for the assessment period.
As a measure of physical activity, we used total activity counts
recorded at both the ankle and the wrist accelerometer
independently. Data collected from the right wrist of each
participant over 5 days of continuous movement monitoring
were processed to yield activity counts for successive 1-minute
epochs and classified according to the appropriate MET cut-off
points according to the method of Esliger [22], to establish the
average number of minutes (epochs) spent daily in moderate
and vigorous physical activity. Outcome assessment was done
by an independent researcher who was blind to study arm
allocation (MC).
Secondary Outcomes
Body height was measured without shoes using a stadiometer.
Body weight was assessed at both visits without shoes using a
measurement scale. Waist circumference was obtained in a
standing position halfway between the anterior superior iliac

spine and the lower rib. Hip circumference was measured
halfway between the trochanter major and the iliac crest.
Lean body mass and body fat percentage were assessed by
bio-electrical impedance (BIA) analysis using a commercial
portable device with hand-to-foot single frequency measurement
(Biostat 1500, Euromedix, Leuven, Belgium). Blood pressure
was measured twice at each visit using a hand-held
sphygmomanometer after 5 minutes of lying down. The mean
of the two consecutive measurements was used. Heart rate was
measured at the wrist after at least 5 minutes of lying down.
Grip strength was measured to the nearest kilogram three times
using a Jamar hand dynamometer (Sammons Preston, Inc,
Bolingbrook, IL, United States) with the dominant hand. The
highest value was used for analysis. Framingham risk scores
were calculated using NIH criteria [23].
Biochemical Assessments
Fasting blood samples were drawn from each participant at both
visits in the morning. Samples were transferred to the lab within
2 hours, aliquotted, and frozen at −80°C. All serum
measurements were performed in one batch after completion
of the entire study with fully automated equipment. Fasting
glucose, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels
were determined using the Modular P2 analyzer (Roche, Almere,
Netherlands), and fasting serum insulin using immunoassay by
Immulite 2500 (DPC, Los Angeles, CA, United States).
Glycated hemoglobin was determined by high-performance
liquid chromatography (Primus Ultra2, Trinity Biotech
Company, Kansas City, MO, United States). C-reactive protein
(hsCRP) was determined using a high-sensitive immunoassay
(COBAS integra, Roche, IN, United States). Low density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the
Friedewald formula in participants without hypertriglyceridemia
[24].
Statistical Analyses
Differences between baseline and follow-up within groups were
tested using a paired sample Student t test of the means. For
skewed variables, ln (natural logarithm) transformation was
used. The effect of the intervention on physical activity was
assessed by an unpaired 2-sided t test, comparing the relative
change in daily physical activity counts between the intervention
group 
and 
control 
group. 
For 
relative 
change 
in
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, a nonparametric test
was used due to skewness of data. The effect of the intervention
on secondary outcomes was assessed using an unpaired 2-sided
t test, comparing the change in the secondary outcome between
the intervention group and control group. Primary analyses were
performed by ITT principle. Our study did have one follow-up
measurement only, and loss to follow-up was very low. We
therefore did not use imputation to replace our data, and
participants from whom data were lost were not in the ITT
analysis. For per-protocol analysis, we included in the
intervention group only those participants who finished the
12-week plan of the intervention program, as assessed by
uploaded accelerometer data of the participant in week 12 of
the DirectLife intervention program. All analyses were
performed with SPSS version 20.0. Statistical significance was
accepted at P<.05.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Figure 1 shows the inclusion flow chart of participants. A total
of 631 participants completed the questionnaire on the study
website. Of those, 235 participants (37%) met inclusion criteria
and were randomized: 119 in the intervention arm, 116 in the
control arm. Nine participants did not complete the study: 5 and
4 participants in the intervention and control group, respectively.
Final analyses of outcomes therefore included 114 participants
in the intervention group and 112 control participants.
Baseline characteristics of randomized participants are shown
in Table 1. The study groups were similar for all parameters.
The majority of participants were male and middle or highly
educated. A substantial number of the study participants used
antihypertensive medication: 46% and 38 % of participants in
intervention and control group, respectively. On average,
participants were overweight with a mean BMI of 28.9 kg/m2
(SD 4.7) and 29.l kg/m2 (SD 4.7) in the intervention and control
group, respectively. There was no significant difference in
baseline activity level between groups.

Figure 1. Consort flowchart of participants.
Adherence to the Intervention Program
All 114 participants who completed the study in the intervention
arm received the intervention program during the visit to the
study site at baseline. Of these, 109 participants (95.6%) started
the intervention program after completing the first assessment
week of the intervention program. In total, 104 participants
(91.2%) completed the 12-week intervention program.
Primary Outcome: Physical Activity
Accelerometer data were available for 107 intervention and 109
control participants for ankle monitors, and 108 and 105
intervention and control participants for wrist monitors,
respectively. After 13 weeks, daily physical activity as measured
by the ankle accelerometer increased by 46% (SE 7%, P<.001)
in the intervention group, compared to 12 % (SE 3%, P<.001)
in the control group (Pdifference<.001). Daily physical activity
measured by the wrist accelerometer increased by 11% (SE 3%,
P<.001) in the intervention group, and by 5% (SE 2%, P=.027)
in the control group (Pdifference=.11). In the intervention group,
there was a mean increase of 11.1 minutes per day (SE 2.1)
spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity, compared to a mean
decrease of 0.1 minutes (SE 1.5) in the control group (P for
relative difference=.001) (Figure 2). In the per-protocol analysis,
taking into account only those 91% (n=104) of participants who
completed the intervention phase of the DirectLife program,
results did not change.

Secondary Outcomes: Parameters of Metabolic Health
Changes in parameters of metabolic health within and between
groups are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 (data represent mean
changes with SE; P value for difference between intervention
and control group using an unpaired 2-sided t test). A significant
effect of the intervention on weight loss was seen with a mean
change of −1.49 kg (SE 0.26) in the intervention group
compared to −0.82 kg (SE 0.21) in the control group
(Pdifference=.046). Likewise, waist circumference decreased more
in the intervention vs control group: −2.33 SE 0.36 cm vs −1.29
SE 0.34 cm, Pdifference=.036. Fat percentage also decreased more
in the intervention vs control group: −0.64 SE 0.23 vs 0.07 SE
0.22, 
Pdifference=.025. 
Glucose 
metabolism 
improved
significantly; HbA1c decreased more in the intervention group
(−0.05%, SE 0.01) compared to the control group (−0.01%, SE
0.01, Pdifference=.049). Similarly, fasting ln insulin levels (−0.16,
SE 0.04 vs −0.04 SE 0.04, Pdifference=.037) improved
significantly in the intervention group compared to controls, as
did the HOMA-index (−0.20 SE 0.05 vs −0.06 SE 0.04,
Pdifference=.035). Total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides levels
improved in the intervention group, but these differences were
not significant between groups. A decrease of more than 2
mmHg in systolic blood pressure was observed in both groups
(Pdifference=.83) and a decrease in resting heart rate of over 5
beats per minute in the intervention group and almost 4 beats
per minute in the control group (Pdifference=.15). No significant
change in grip strength was seen in either of the groups. In the
per-protocol analysis, taking into account only those 91% of
participants who completed the intervention phase, differences
did not materially change.

Figure 3. Changes in a selection of metabolic parameters.
Discussion
Principal Findings
In this study, we describe the effect of a Web-assisted physical
activity intervention. We found a significant increase in daily
physical activity in the intervention group compared to the
control group. Furthermore, we showed that the intervention
resulted in a significant improvement in body composition and
parameters of glucose metabolism compared to the control
group.
To our knowledge, our study is one of the first to show that a
Web-based intervention can increase daily physical activity in
older people from the general population. Attempts have been
made to incorporate the Internet as an additional tool (eg, to
generate computer-tailored advice) or intervention strategy (eg,
forum, e-buddy) to promote physical activity in the elderly
[25,26]. A recently published study showed the effects of a
Web-based intervention in seniors, albeit with use of
self-reported outcomes [27]. Furthermore, a Web intervention
has been used in an elderly study population of 50 patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [28].The
intervention was primarily directed at COPD self-management,
used self-reported exercise as secondary outcome, and compared
two different interventions instead of intervention vs a control
group, making it difficult to compare their results with our study.
Thus far, our study is the first to objectively assess the effects
of a Web-based intervention on increasing physical activity in
an older population. It is striking that—among an older and
inactive population—a Web-based intervention was so effective.
The baseline metabolic condition of our participants suggested
that we included a study population with indication of the
presence of metabolic syndrome: a large proportion of our study
sample was overweight or obese, had high waist circumference,
and/or used antihypertensive medication. This population, we
believe, is particularly relevant for interventions aimed at
prevention of age-related cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
The increase in daily physical activity differed between
accelerometer measurement locations; a more pronounced
increase was found when using the ankle monitor. At the wrist,
the increase in daily physical activity was smaller and not
significantly different between groups when looking at total
activity counts, but was statistically significant when assessing
the increase in validated number of minutes spent in
moderate-to-vigorous activity. The larger difference seen
between groups in the ankle monitor compared to the wrist
monitor is in line with our hypothesis that the ankle location is
more sensitive to detect differences in daily physical activity
such as cycling behavior. The Dutch population has the highest
bicycle use worldwide, and it is likely that especially cycling
and walking were stimulated in the inactive study population.
In the control group, we also found a small but significant
increase in daily physical activity as measured by wrist and
ankle accelerometers, but not when assessing the number of
minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity. We expected
an increase in physical activity in the control group as well, due
to an increased awareness of physical activity because of the
repeated trial-related measurements [29]. This finding illustrates
the need for performing studies in a controlled manner and
strengthens our finding that, despite this observation in the
controls, the intervention group increased daily physical activity
significantly more. Furthermore, there is a need for better
understanding the measurements of physical activity patterns
from the accelerometer to further underpin the behavior changes
associated with such interventions.

Few data exist on the effect of Web interventions directed at
physical activity on metabolic health in the general population.
Three previous smaller Web-based intervention trials studied
outcomes related to metabolic health in populations without
chronic disease. Bosak et al studied the effect of a 6-week Web
intervention directed at increasing physical activity in 22
participants (mean age 50 years) with metabolic syndrome but
found no significant improvements in physical activity, fitness,
or lipid levels [30]. After a 16-week Web-based physical activity
intervention in inactive adults (mean age 41 years), Carr et al
[12] found some improvement in triglycerides levels in the
intervention group (n=14) only, but not in any other markers of
body composition, lipid, or glucose metabolism, and differences
were not compared to the control group (n=18). Hurling et al
studied the effects of a 9-week Web-based intervention on
anthropometric outcomes and blood pressure in 77 subjects
(healthy adults with a mean age of 40 years) [13] and found a
significant decrease in body fat between groups, but no effects
regarding systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In our study, we
also found no significant effect on systolic blood pressure and
markers of glucose metabolism. Part of the explanation of why
our results differ from the previous studies is that we studied a
large sample of older participants with overweight and an
inactive lifestyle, likely resulting in a higher burden of metabolic
derangement. This has resulted in a higher statistical power to
detect differences in health compared to the smaller studies.
Alternatively, our intervention may have been especially
effective since it was able to deliver personalized feedback on
physical activity levels, thereby stimulating behavior change.
Finally, we may have selected participants that were more
motivated than the participants of the other studies, possibly as
the result of chance or our selection process.
Limitations and Strengths
In our study, we used a waitlist control group. In general, a
potential bias in this design is the existence of attention bias,
meaning that results could be achieved due to the extra attention
given to the intervention group compared to the control group,
instead of intervention aspects such as goal setting and
self-monitoring. However, the attention given to the intervention
group in our study comprised emailing and contact with the
coach, which was an essential part of the intervention program
under study. Therefore, we believe that the intervention was
effective in increasing physical activity and improving metabolic
health.
The present study shows the large potential of using
Web-assisted interventions for increasing physical activity and
increasing metabolic health in a very relevant and aging
population. We were able to include over 200 highly motivated
participants and improve their metabolic profile within 3 months.
However, it is unclear whether compliance can be sustained
and whether long-term positive effects can be expected. The
very few studies that reported on longer term follow-up and
showed a significant increase in PA also after a shorter
follow-up period, suggested that physical activity may increase
further after 12 compared to 6 months [31]. This study, however,
was performed in a primary care setting and used
non-Web-based digital intervention methods such as face-to-face
counseling. Evidence for long-term effectiveness of Web
interventions is therefore required.
Our study population consisted of highly educated and motivated
participants, which may hamper the generalizability of our
results. Future study should assess the effects of Web-based
interventions in elderly in a primary care setting using a
population that better represents the general population. A
drawback of the present study was that we did not record any
dietary behaviors. It is possible that changes in diet account for
a proportion of the observed beneficial effects on metabolic
health. On one hand, it would be interesting to study which
dietary changes are associated with increasing metabolic health,
and insight in such behavior could increase the potential to
increase effectiveness of such the intervention by specific
coaching on this subject. On the other hand, a potential implicit
role for dietary factors in the observed effect in the present study
does not mitigate the relevance of these results. Another
drawback is the fact that we did not have data on longer term
follow-up.
The main strength of our study was the use of objectively
measured daily physical activity. The majority of studies
directed at increasing physical activity used self-reported
physical activity measures, which could have resulted in an
overestimation of the effect size. More recent studies used
pedometers, which are unable to assess all types of physical
activity and to give direct feedback to the wearer. With the use
of tri-axial accelerometers, outcome assessment was blinded
for participants as well as for study physicians and nurses.
Another strength of the study was the use of a home-based
intervention. This minimized the need for face-to-face contact
and subsequently may have explained the low drop-out rate and
high adherence to the intervention [6].
Conclusions
Our results show that using a Web-based intervention in older
inactive people at risk for metabolic disease increases daily
physical activity and improves metabolic health after 3 months.
High retention rates in the intervention group were found,
indicating that this Web-based intervention was feasible for use
in an older population. Our findings show the large potential of
Web-based interventions for large scale prevention of metabolic
deregulation in a rapidly aging population.
