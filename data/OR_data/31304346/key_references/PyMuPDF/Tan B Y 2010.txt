ABSTRACT
Introduction : Arrhythmias are often 
intermittent, and a normal electrocardiogram 
(ECG) may not be diagnostic. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate the usefulness 
of HeartWave500 (HW), a novel web-based 
ambulatory ECG monitoring device. 
Methods: A total of 120 patients from the 
National Heart Centre, Singapore were 
prospectively randomised in a three to one ratio 
to either HW or a standard transtelephonic 
(TT) event recorder. HW records five leads 
and transmits to an internet server, while 
TT transmits audio data to a central station. 
Monitoring was conducted for two weeks. The 
diagnostic yield was calculated in two ways: the 
percentage of patients successfully diagnosed as 
a function of time, and the absolute number of 
new diagnoses per patient per week.
Results: 33 patients (14 male, 19 female; mean 
age 49.6 +/− 11.1 years) were randomised to TT. 
87 patients (32 male, 55 female; mean age 43.7 
+/− 12.2 years) were randomised to HW. At the 
end of two weeks, the percentage of patients 
diagnosed with any arrhythmia was similar for 
both groups (66.7 percent for TT versus 67.8 
percent for HW). There was a trend toward 
significance for the number of diagnoses per 
patient per week for Week 2 between TT and 
HW (0.58 +/− 0.75 versus 0.34 +/− 0.55, p is 
0.06). Transmitted ECGs were read earlier 
for HW (18 minutes vs. 1107 minutes, Mann-
Whitney non-parametric test, p is less than 
0.05). Transmitted recordings that were 
unreadable were also significantly lower for 
HW (8.0 percent vs. 17.6 percent, chi-square 
test, p is less than 0.05).
Conclusion: HW and TT have similar diagnostic 
yields. There is a trend toward a shorter 
monitoring time for HW. The ability of HW 
to record and transmit via the web, the earlier 
review of data and low unreadable data make 
HW an attractive alternative to TT.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiac arrhythmia is a potential cause of palpitations. 
Due to the paroxysmal nature of the symptoms, 
a conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) can be 
generated in only a third of patients. The demand for 
an ambulatory form of electrographic monitoring was 
recognised as early as the 1940s, when Dr Norman 
Jeff Holter developed a 34 kg backpack that could 
simultaneously record and transmit ECGs. The modern 
“Holter” monitor has shrunk dramatically and can record 
up to 1–2 days of continuous data. The specificity of 
the monitor is low however, with a reported diagnostic 
yield of only 33%–35%.(1-3) A transtelephonic (TT) 
electrographic monitor is capable of recording 
electrographic data and converting it to an audio signal. 
These signals are then transmitted by telephone to a 
central station. A TT device can monitor patients for a 
longer time, and the recordings have better correlations 
with patient symptoms. The reported diagnostic yield 
for TT is 55%–83%.(2-4)
	
With the rapid development of telemedicine 
worldwide, a web-based ambulatory monitoring device 
would be the next logical step. The aim of our study 
was to explore the usefulness of HeartWave500 (HW) 
(NextWave Biomedical, Singapore), a novel internet-
based ambulatory ECG monitoring device. The HW 
(Fig. 1) was developed as a replacement for our current 
TT event recorders. It is no larger than a personal digital 
assistant, runs on AA batteries, and records using five 
leads. It is an event recorder that can record up to

three events at any one time. The recorded ECGs are 
downloaded onto a computer with the use of a standard 
universal serial bus port. The images are then emailed 
as an attachment to a central mainframe computer. A 
computer-generated provisional diagnosis is available 
immediately. Should an abnormal rhythm be detected, a 
telephone short message service (SMS) is forwarded to 
a technician or physician. Patient information, baseline 
ECGs and the transmitted recordings can be accessed 
via the secure website. Symptoms can be reported and 
medical advice can be dispensed online, thus providing 
reassurance to patients.    
METHODS
Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either 
HW or a standard TT event recorder (RhythmCard, 
Intromedix Inc Central station: Cardiocomm GEMS 
II, CardioComm Solutions Inc, Victoria, BC, Canada). 
Informed written consent was obtained, and all the 
patients were counselled on the proper use of either 
the TT or HW device by our trained staff. One trial 
transmission was performed in the hospital under 
supervision in order to ensure proficiency with 
handling the devices. Helplines were made available 
to all patients throughout the two-week duration of 
monitoring. The patients were encouraged to maintain 
a diary of symptoms. Baseline characteristics for age, 
gender, race and drug therapy were recorded. History 
of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia 
and smoking were noted. Symptoms of palpitations 
were defined as any feelings of abnormal heartbeat 
or rhythm experienced by the patient. Presyncope 
was defined as having symptoms of light-headedness 
or dizziness, while syncope was the complete loss of 
consciousness. The durations of all the three symptoms 
were documented (< 1 min, 1–5 min, 6–120 min or > 
120 min).
	
The diagnoses were divided into either benign 
cardiac 
rhythms 
(normal 
sinus 
rhythm, 
sinus 
arrhythmia, sinus tachycardia [heart rate > 100/
min], premature ventricular contractions, low atrial 
rhythm, wandering atrial pacemaker, occasional 
atrial premature beats and normal paced rhythm), or 
clinically significant cardiac rhythms (ventricular 
tachycardia, sinus bradycardia [< 50/min], complete or 
high-grade heart block, ventricular flutter/fibrillation, 
supraventricular tachycardia [SVT], atrial flutter, 
atrial fibrillation [AF] and junctional tachycardia). For 
the HW device, a computer-generated diagnosis was 
also available. These include normal sinus rhythm, 
sinus 
arrhythmia, 
sinus 
tachycardia, 
premature 
ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, sinus 
bradycardia, second-degree heart block and ventricular 
flutter/fibrillation.        
	
For the purpose of this study, initial transmission 
of a particular rhythm was considered as a diagnostic 
event, while further transmission of the same rhythm 
was not considered as a new diagnosis. Transmissions 
of a different arrhythmia were considered to represent 
additional diagnoses. The diagnostic yield for both 
the TT and HW devices were calculated in two ways: 
the percentage of patients successfully diagnosed as 
a function of time; and the absolute number of new 
diagnoses per patient per week. For the first outcome, 
the cumulative percentage of patients with one, two or 
three diagnoses as a function of time was calculated. 
For the second outcome, the absolute number of new 
diagnoses made in a given week was divided by the 
number of patients who continue to wear either the TT 
or HW device.
	
  The data was analysed using the Stata program 
(Stata, College Station, TX, USA). A comparison 
between the continuous variables was performed 
using the Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney non-
parametric test. For categorical variables, a comparison 
was made using the Pearson chi-square test. The 
cumulative percentage of patients with any diagnosis 
as a function of time was estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier technique. For the second outcome (number 
of diagnoses/patient/week), a comparison was made 
between the two devices using the Student’s t-test.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of both the TT and HW 
groups of patients are shown in Table I. 33 patients were 
randomised to the TT group. Their mean age was 49.6 
± 11.1 (range 23–73) years, with 14 (42%) male and 19 
(58%) female. All 33 patients had palpitations (seven 
[21%] patients < 1 min, 12 [36%] patients 1–5 min, nine

[27%] patients 6 min–1 hr, five [15%] patients > 1 hr in 
duration). Ten patients had presyncope (four patients < 
1 min, three patients 1–5 min, two patients 6 min–1 hr 
and one patient > 1 hr in duration). Two patients had 
syncope. One patient had a previous history of non-
sustained ventricular tachycardia and another had mitral 
valve prolapse. Four patients were on anti-arrhythmic 
drugs, two were on Vaughan Williams class II drugs, 
atenolol (Beacons Pharmaceuticals, Singapore) and 
propanolol (Astra Zeneca UK Ltd, London, UK), one 
was on Vaughan Williams class IV drugs, diltiazem 
(Beacons Pharmaceuticals, Singapore) and one on 
Vaughan Williams class I drugs, disopyramide (Pfizer 
Inc, New York, NY, USA)
	
87 patients were randomised to the HW group. 
Their mean age was 43.7 ± 12.2 (range 21–56) years, 
with 32 (37%) male and 55 (63%) female. 83 (95%) 
patients had symptoms of palpitations at presentation 
(20 [24%] patients < 1 min, 21 [25%] patients 1–5 min, 
31 [37%] patients 6 min–1 hr, 11 [13%] patients > 1 hr 
in duration). 24 patients had presyncope (eight patients 
each for < 1 min and 6 min–1 hr, seven patients for 1–6 
min, one patient for > 1 hr in duration). Three patients 
had previous syncopal episodes. 21 patients had a 
history of arrhythmia or structural heart disease. Six had 
a history of AF. Of these, one patient had a previous AF 
ablation, while another had a previous surgical Maze 
procedure. Three patients had previous documented 
SVT. Two patients had previous atrial ectopics 
documented, while another two had ventricular ectopics. 
One patient had both atrial and ventricular ectopics 
and one was known to have arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular cardiomyopathy. One patient had a history 
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Three patients 
had previous permanent pacemaker implantation, 
and one patient had a ventricular septal defect repair 
procedure performed as a child. Two patients were on 
only Vaughan Williams class I drugs, flecainide (iNova 
Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, Thornleigh, NSW, Australia) 
and propafenone (Abbott Laboratories,  Abbott Park, 
IL, USA), seven patients were on class II drugs alone 
(four on atenolol, three on propanolol) while two 
patients were on both flecainide and bisoprolol [Merck 
Serono, Geneva, Switzerland]. Four patients were on 
Class III drugs (two on sotalol [Pharmaforte Pte Ltd, 
Singapore], and two on amiodarone [Sanofi-Avents, 
Paris, France]). There was no statistically significant 
difference in the baseline characteristics for age, gender, 
race, symptoms and duration at presentation, as well as 
history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking 
status between the two groups.
	
For TT, a total of 108 transmissions were made 
by 33 patients over the two weeks of monitoring. Of 
these, 19 (18%) were unreadable. The median time 
from ECG transmission to being read by a technician 
was 1,107 (range 2–19,581) minutes. Normal sinus 
rhythm was diagnosed in 16 patients, sinus arrhythmia 
in 12, sinus tachycardia in eight, premature ventricular 
contractions in four, atrial premature beats in two, and 
sinus bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia and 
atrial fibrillation in one patient each. For HW, the 87 
patients in this group had 609 attempts at recordings 
and a corresponding 609 attempted transmissions (from 
patient diaries). 493 (81%) attempts at recording were 
successful, and of these successful recordings, 445 
(90%) were transmitted. However, the central station 
received only 424 transmissions; the remaining 21 
transmissions were unsuccessful. The median time 
from ECG transmission to being read by a technician 
was 18 (range 0–3,511) minutes. Of the 424 successful 
transmissions, 19 (4%) were unreadable recordings. 
Normal sinus rhythm was diagnosed in 63 patients, 
sinus arrhythmia in 18, sinus tachycardia in nine, 
premature ventricular contractions in ten, atrial 
premature beats in three, sinus bradycardia in one, AF 
in two (2%) and normal paced rhythm in three (3%) 
patients. A comparison between the physician diagnosis 
and computer-generated diagnosis was also made. Of 
the 424 transmissions, a consistent diagnosis was made 
by both the reporting physician and the computer-
generated report in 313 (74%) cases.

as a function of time was calculated for both devices. 
The TT device yielded 0.55 ± 0.71 diagnoses/patient/
week in Week 1 and 0.58 ± 0.75 diagnoses/patient/week 
in Week 2. For HW, 0.62 ± 0.77 diagnoses/patient/week 
were made in Week 1 and 0.34 ± 0.55 diagnoses/patient/
week in Week 2. There was a trend toward significance 
for Week 2 between TT and HW (p = 0.066) but not 
for Week 1 (p = 0.6253). The cumulative percentage of 
patients with one, two or three diagnoses as a function 
of time was also calculated. At the end of two weeks, 
66.7% of patients in TT vs. 67.8% of those in the HW 
group had one or more diagnoses made (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Compared to a standard Holter, the superiority of patient-
activated TT devices in terms of efficacy and cost-
effectiveness is well proven. Studies have shown that a 
monitoring duration of two weeks is the most cost-effective. 
In a study by Reiffel et al, it was found that 87% of patients 
would have an initial transmission corresponding to 
palpitations in the first two weeks.(5) Only an additional 
9% yield would be achieved if monitoring was extended 
to four weeks. This was the basis for the two-week 
monitoring period utilised in this study.
	
Two outcomes were used to compare the 
effectiveness of HW. The cumulative percentage of 
patients with one, two or three diagnoses as a function 
of time was similar between TT and HW (66.7% vs. 
67.8%). However, at the end of Week 2, there was a 
trend toward significance for the second outcome of 
the number of diagnoses/patient/week in favour of HW 
(0.58 ± 0.75 vs. 0.34 ± 0.55, p = 0.066). This suggests 
that a monitoring duration of two weeks may not be 
necessary for HW (with only an additional 0.34 ± 0.55 
diagnoses/patient made in Week 2). There are several 
possible explanations for this outcome. First, there 
is feedback on the recorded data via a liquid crystal 
display (LCD screen on HW), thus allowing patients 
to re-record, should the signals be sub-optimal. For 
TT, the converted audio signals have to contend with 
inherent noise levels on fixed telephone lines (our 
current TT devices do not support data transmission 
via the global system for mobile communications). 
Consequently, up to 18% of transmitted data from TT 
is unreadable compared to 4% for HW. Better quality 
data in multiple channels in HW means that fewer 
transmissions are required before a diagnosis is made, 
thereby cutting down on the monitoring time. Also, 
transmissions are read on the next working day for TT. 
Unlike the HW server, there is no SMS service in TT 
when an abnormal rhythm is detected. On a weekend, 
this often means that transmitted data is read only on the 
following Monday. This would account for the median 
time of transmission to review of 1,107 minutes in TT, 
compared to 18 minutes for HW. Early diagnosis of 
significant arrhythmias may be potentially significant, 
as earlier detection of AF, for example, could have 
suggested the need for anticoagulation therapy. There 
is also added reassurance for the HW user, as there is 
immediate feedback.
	
The potential application of HW in clinical 
practice is substantial. The recent Catheter Ablation 
for the Cure of Atrial Fibrillaton Study used a TT 
ECG recorder for patients one month after ablation.(6) 
Routine daily 30-second recordings were conducted for 
three months. This study showed a substantial number 
of asymptomatic AF recurrences, which was consistent 
with another study by Senatore et al, where up to 50% 
of AF recurrences were asymptomatic.(7) A device 
like HW that can transmit consistently, for prolonged 
periods of time and in multiple leads would be superior 
in detecting AF in this setting. HW can also be used 
in patients with chronic heart disease who work out in 
public gymnasiums. In a study by Kouidi et al, TT was 
used as a monitoring tool for this subset of high-risk 
patients and was shown to be safe and efficacious.(8) A 
device like HW that gives immediate feedback on a large 
LCD screen, a readily available computer-generated 
diagnosis and immediate SMS warning system would 
be superior to TT. In our study, only three patients in 
the HW group had a permanent pacemaker implanted. 
Although a normal paced rhythm was detected for all 
three patients, the usefulness of HW in this setting 
remains to be examined. 
	
However, there are practical drawbacks to the HW. 
It records five leads, which would take considerable 
time and effort to put on. Furthermore, due to its 
Fig. 2 Kaplan-Meier curves showing the cumulative diagnostic 
yield of transtelephonic and HeatWave500 device for patients 
with one, two or three diagnoses as a function of duration of 
monitoring.

multiple functions, the current model uses more energy. 
In the two-week monitoring period, patients often had 
to change batteries at least once, thus increasing the 
cost. The use of the internet as a transmitting medium 
also has its drawbacks, especially if patients are not 
computer savvy. The current computer-generated 
report software only has 74% consistency with a 
physician-read diagnosis.
	
In conclusion, HW is an exciting new device 
that offers a glimpse of what future cardiac monitors 
would look like. It incorporates an essential and 
everyday medium in our lives: the internet. With 
advancing wireless and battery technology, many of 
its drawbacks are not insurmountable. In fact, the next 
generation of HW devices is already on the drawing 
board.
