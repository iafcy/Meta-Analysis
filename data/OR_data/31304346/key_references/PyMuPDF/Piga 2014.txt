ABSTRACT.
Objective. To describe a feasibility study focused on a telemonitoring approach to self-managed
kinesiotherapy sessions for the rehabilitation of hand function in patients with systemic sclerosis
(SSc) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods. Ten patients with SSc and 10 with RA were enrolled in a 3-month controlled trial
(approval no. 9751/2012 – Italian Department of Health) to perform a home kinesiotherapy protocol,
consisting of strengthening and mobility exercises, using a newly developed telemedicine system (a
portable device and the related telemonitoring infrastructure). A further 10 patients with SSc and 10
with RA were enrolled as controls to perform a similar home kinesiotherapy protocol with the aid of
common daily-life objects. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at followup, after 6 and 12
weeks. The primary outcome of the trial was hand function measured by Dreiser’s index (Functional
Index for Hand OA, FIHOA), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Hand Mobility in
Scleroderma (HAMIS) test (only for SSc).
Results. Patients with SSc showed an improvement of FIHOA in both arms (p < 0.01) but the HAQ
(p = 0.016) and the HAMIS test (right hand p = 0.016, left hand p = 0.075) improved significantly
only in the experimental arm. Patients with RA showed a statistically significant improvement of
FIHOA (p = 0.013) and HAQ (p = 0.015) in the experimental arm, while patients in the control arm
did not significantly improve. However, no statistically significant differences in outcome measures
between treatment methods were observed. Withdrawals were higher in control arms (SSc 20%; RA
30%) than in experimental arms (SSc 10%; RA 10%). 
Conclusion. Telemonitoring of self-administered kinesiotherapy programs is a promising approach
to the rehabilitation of hand functions in patients with rheumatic disease. (J Rheumatol First Release

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are
chronic rheumatic diseases with different pathogenetic
mechanisms and outcomes that affect hand disability, which
in turn strongly influences the activities of daily living1,2,3.
SSc is an autoimmune disease that targets the vasculature
ultimately leading to fibrosis in the skin, the muscu-
loskeletal system, and internal organs. Although SSc may
affect various joints, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and the
proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the hands are
primarily involved4. Thickening of the skin, tendon, and
muscle can result in contractures of the fingers and hand
impairment5. RA is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease
primarily affecting synovial joints, mostly the wrist, and the
MCP and PIP of the hands. Patients with RA often experience
joint and tendon restrictions and adhesions due to fibrosis.
These patients are prone to muscle atrophy as well as erosion
of cartilage and bone, which can lead to substantial loss of
function and, in the later stage, deformities6.

Recovering hand function in patients with SSc and RA
requires pharmacological treatment together with rehabili-
tative and kinesiotherapy interventions7,8,9. Rehabilitation
provided by occupational therapists and/or physiotherapists,
also called physical therapy, includes joint protection
advice, heat, and manual mobilization techniques9,10.
Kinesiotherapy consists of adapted physical exercises
actively performed by patients. It is aimed at improving or
maintaining functional abilities and usually follows an early
rehabilitative intervention11,12. Few studies have specifi-
cally investigated the effect of physical exercise on the
recovery of hand function in SSc and RA; therefore estab-
lished guidelines for intervention are lacking11,12. Kinesio -
therapy requires constant monitoring by health profes-
sionals, but closely assisting every patient can be difficult,
because of the reduced availability of specialized facilities
and qualified staff, especially in remote, usually rural,
communities. Patients might be able to self-manage the
exercises at home.
The Recovery of Movement and Telemonitoring
(Re.Mo.Te.) project was undertaken to develop a telemed-
icine system to be used at home by patients with hand
impairment for telemonitoring of self-administered kinesio-
therapy (Appendix 1). This project originated the Re.Mo.Te.
system, which consists of a portable standalone electronic
device and the related telemonitoring infrastructure13. The
system was then tested in the Re.Mo.Te. clinical trial in
which patients with SSc and RA with hand impairment were
enrolled. This article describes the Re.Mo.Te. clinical trial. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Re.Mo.Te. trial intervention. The Re.Mo.Te. clinical trial was set up as
a pilot study to investigate the effectiveness of and the adherence to a
self-managed hand kinesiotherapy protocol assisted by telemonitoring in
patients with SSc and RA. Adherence to protocol was defined as the
percentage of complete workout sessions over those scheduled.
The intervention protocol was defined starting from the exercises
patients can perform at home, some derived from the literature9,10,11 and
others conceived ex novo, using common daily-life objects (Appendix 2).
Such exercises were engineered with sensor tools subsequently embedded
in the Re.Mo.Te. portable device (Figure 1A and Appendix 2). The
exercises were adapted to avoid joint stress and overload and to improve
strength and mobility. Strength exercises require isometric muscle
contraction, whereas mobility exercises are low resistance or without
resistance, and both should be performed by the patients at the maximum
pain-free intensity. To standardize the treatment provided, all patients
attended an individual training session, including a practical section, where
they were taught how to perform the kinesiotherapy exercises according to
the trial protocol. To make sure that the effort was performed only with
fingers, patients were trained to keep the wrist in a neutral position during
the exercises, resting on a flat surface when possible. To avoid threatening
the validity of the comparison between cases and controls, we defined the
working variables at the beginning and did not change them over the
duration of the trial.
The Re.Mo.Te. telemonitoring system. Re.Mo.Te. is a newly developed
system13 designed through close cooperation between rheumatologists and
bioengineers. It leads the patient in the execution of home rehabilitation
exercises for the hand and allows health professionals to remotely oversee
the results of workouts. Re.Mo.Te. consists of a portable device and the
related telemonitoring infrastructure and exploits the store-and-forward
approach: acquisition and storing of clinical information (e.g., data, image,
sound, video) that is then forwarded to (or retrieved by) another site for
clinical evaluation. The standalone device is integrated in a portable
briefcase and includes a set of sensor tools to quantitatively analyze the
execution of the exercises by measuring the physical variables of interest
(Appendix 2). It is installation-free and neither a computer nor an Internet
connection is required at the patient’s home. For safety reasons, it is
battery-powered and its use is disabled when charging. The tools were
designed to reduce the risk of mechanical injuries, with moving elements
covered in soft-touch material. The device provides 2 operating modes:
real-time and store-and-forward. The first mode was designed for use in a
clinical setting, under the supervision of a health professional who controls
the device through a Bluetooth connection and a dedicated user interface on
his/her computer, analyzing in real time the signals coming from the sensor
tools to assess the quality of the execution. This operating mode is useful
for training patients and for delivering the exercises at outpatient thera-
peutic clinic. The store-and-forward mode is used when the device is
entrusted to the patients for autonomous home use. 
The device guides the patient in the execution of the exercises,
providing both visual (through LED and small character display) and audio
(buzzer) feedback. The device manages the wireless transmission of the
main statistics, summarizing the rehabilitation session, through an
embedded GSM/GPRS module. A monitoring software interface is also
provided for the doctors to supervise the patients’ progress throughout the
rehabilitation period in a deferred way. The telemonitoring software
interface allows recognizing (1) the kinesiotherapic sessions performed by
the patient (Figure 1B); (2) the number of sets and repetitions performed for
each exercise; and (3) how the patient performed the exercises, providing
adequate statistics (i.e., maximum, minimum, average, and SD of the
relevant physical characteristics: time, speed, force, torque, etc.). The
statistics are presented in graphs to the physician (Figure 1C), but can also
be downloaded as spreadsheet files. The system offers a fast remote
analysis of the home sessions, enabling identification of low adherence to
the protocol or poor performance.
Preliminary evaluation, eligibility, and consent. Fifty patients with RA and
40 patients with SSc, diagnosed according to the American College of
Rheumatology classification criteria, and referred to our rheumatology
outpatient clinic, were screened with the aim of identifying 20 patients per
disease homogeneous for demographic, clinical, and functional character-
istics. The presence of tender and swollen joints, deformities, functional
deficit, or impairment in the hands and wrists was evaluated. Participants
were eligible if they had a Dreiser’s index score ≥ 6 and had been receiving
stable medications for 3 months. Exclusion criteria were irreversible
anatomical damage such as bony ankylosis, tendon rupture, joint dis -
location and subluxation, active arthritis, and digital ulcers. A 28-joint
Disease Activity Score (DAS28) higher than 2.6 was an exclusion criterion
for patients with RA. Changes of therapy were not allowed during the trial
and were a reason for withdrawal from the study. Twenty patients per
disease, matched for sex, age, disease duration, Health Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ) and Dreiser’s Algo-Functional index (Functional
Index of Hand OA, FIHOA) scores, were enrolled from February 2012 to
June 2012. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The
protocol of the clinical trial, with a medical device not assessed for
compliance with European safety standard for commercial use, was
reviewed by the Ethics Committee (Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria of
Cagliari, no. 245/2011), and the trial was authorized by the Italian
Department of Health (approval no. 9751/2012). 
The experimental arm. Once matched in pairs, patients were assigned to the
experimental or the control arm by permuted block randomization. Ten
patients with SSc and 10 with RA were trained on the autonomous use of
the experimental device by investigators. Every patient received individual
1-h training on the proper and safe use of the device, along with a user
manual comprehensively describing the functioning and maintenance of

the device. Moreover, they received an illustrated booklet describing the
exercises. The kinesiotherapy protocol of the experimental arm consisted of
4 strengthening and 3 mobility exercises (Appendix 2), to be repeated 5
days per week for 12 weeks, each session lasting a maximum of 50 min.
Every workout was conducted at home by patients using the Re.Mo.Te.
device and remotely monitored by physicians through the Re.Mo.Te.
telemonitoring interface. Telemonitoring data were checked twice per
week, allowing physicians to report on the adherence to protocol. To be
aware of possible complications and minimize nonadherence and
withdrawals, the investigators contacted patients by telephone if the
following warning flags were detected: (1) loss of 1 or more workout
sessions, or (2) a worsening trend in exercise statistics during the week.
The control arm. The remaining patients received individual training for 30
min to perform a kinesiotherapy protocol at home consisting of 3 strength-
ening and 3 mobility exercises (Appendix 2) using common objects, to be
repeated 5 days per week for 12 weeks, each session lasting a maximum of
45 min. Patients received a booklet with pictures describing the exercises.
This protocol is based on 1 exercise fewer, because of the difficulty in
standardizing exercise number 6 (Appendix 2) using common household
items. For patients enrolled in the control arm, no additional contact other
than followup was scheduled, unless an adverse event occurred. At each
visit they were asked to report on their weekly adherence to protocol.
Baseline and followup assessments. At baseline and at followup, after 6 and
12 weeks, every patient was assessed by a rheumatologist using HAQ,
FIHOA, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36), pain visual
analog scale (VAS), and VAS Global Health (GH). Hand disability in
patients with SSc was also bilaterally evaluated by the Hand Mobility in
Scleroderma (HAMIS) test. The DAS28 was calculated for patients with

RA, not as an outcome measure but to highlight any increase in inflam-
matory activity. Likewise, patients with SSc were evaluated for active joint
inflammation, defined by the presence of synovitis and tendon friction rubs
at clinical assessment. Afterward, a kinesiotherapist quantitatively assessed
the hand strength (grip and pinch) measured through a sphygmomano -
meter14. The maximum hand abduction and the range of movement (ROM)
of MCP joints for both hands was measured through a goniometer. 
At the end of the followup, the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction
with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0) was administered to the patients
enrolled in the experimental arms15. The purpose of the QUEST 2.0 was to
evaluate patient satisfaction with the assistive device and the related
services. It consists of 12 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale where 1
stands for “completely unsatisfied” and 5 for “completely satisfied”. The
patients also pinpointed the 3 items they considered the most important for
the device evaluation.
Outcomes. The Re.Mo.Te. trial was primarily designed to determine the
effectiveness of the kinesiotherapy experimental protocol in improving
hand function, as mediated by increases in strength, dexterity, and range of
motion (ROM), in patients with SSc and RA16,17,18. The secondary goal of
this trial was to compare the experimental protocol versus a similar
workout to highlight differences in hand function improvement and in
patient compliance. Accordingly, the primary outcome of the trial was hand
function measured by HAQ, FIHOA, and the HAMIS test for patients with
SSc. Maximum hand abduction, joint ROM, grip strength, and pinch
strength were secondary outcomes. The SF-36, VAS pain (0–100), and
VAS-GH (0–100) were outcomes for quality of life (QoL) assessment.
Compliance to protocol was defined by the number of patients who
completed the 3-month trial. If a major violation to protocol occurred, the
patient was withdrawn from the study. Major violations were defined as (1)
a whole week without performing the workout sessions, or (2) more than 2
missed workout sessions per week, every week. Compliance for patients in
the experimental arm was derived from the telemedicine system, while for
those in the control arm it could only be indirectly inferred.
Statistical analysis. Data processing and statistical analyses were
performed using MedCalc package for Windows, version 12.7.0.0
(MedCalc Software). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the
normality of variable distribution between groups. The only variables with
abnormal distribution between groups at baseline were the results of
HAMIS test for both hands in patients with SSc. Repeated measures
ANOVA and pairwise comparison between each visit and the immediately
preceding one were used to address within-subject effect and compare
quantitative variables throughout followup. Only data from patients who
completed the clinical trial were included in this statistical analysis. A
mixed model ANOVA providing a grouping variable (experimental
arm/control arm) was used to address the between-subject and interaction
effects. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Bonferroni correction was applied to pairwise comparison results.
RESULTS
Patients with SSc. Patients in each arm showed improve -
ment in primary outcomes, but no statistically significant
difference between subjects was highlighted when findings
from the 2 arms were compared. Table 1 summarizes results
(mean, SD) from patients with SSc. The FIHAO signifi-
cantly improved in both arms (p = 0.006), whereas the HAQ
(p = 0.016) and the HAMIS (right hand p = 0.016; left hand
p = 0.075) improved only in the experimental arm. Regard -
ing secondary outcomes, patients in both arms achieved
statistically significant results over time on pinch strength
and MCP ROM measures for the dominant (right) hand, but
grip and pinch strength measures for nondominant (left)
hand significantly improved only in patients treated experi-
mentally. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differ-
ences in secondary outcome measures between treatment
methods were demonstrated. No QoL outcomes improved
during followup in both arms. 
Two patients from the control arm reported discontinuing
the protocol for more than 1 week for no specific reason and
were withdrawn from the study. One patient from the exper-
imental arm discontinued the exercise protocol because of
major abdominal surgery and was withdrawn from the trial.
Patients in the experimental arm performed 93.4% ± 8.7%
of the scheduled workout sessions (range from 71.4% to
98.8%; Figure 2); all of them were contacted by phone at
least once during the study period following the telemoni-
toring detection of a warning flag. No adverse event related
to the use of the device was recorded.
Patients with RA. Table 2 summarizes results (mean, SD)
from patients with RA. Patients in the experimental arm
experienced a progressive improvement of the variables
under study, pointing out that the positive effect of the
telemedicine-assisted exercise protocol was sustained
during followup. In particular, FIHAO (p = 0.013) and HAQ
(p = 0.015) showed a statistically significant improvement
over time but, although patients included in the control arm
did not significantly improve, no statistically significant
differences between subjects were highlighted when primary
outcome findings from the 2 arms were compared. 
Patients in the experimental arm achieved statistically
significant results in secondary outcomes over time on both
grip and pinch strength, the latter showing a significant
improvement when compared to results from patients
enrolled in the control arm. Patients in experimental and
control arms obtained good results on MCP ROM for both
hands, but the validity of comparison between groups was
threatened by an interaction effect.
According to DAS28, no disease relapse was recorded
during the trial in either group. The reduction of DAS28
experienced by patients in the experimental arm is mainly
due to the lowering of VAS-GH, a patient-reported compon -
ent of the DAS28 composite index, rather than an effect of
the kinesiotherapy treatment on inflammatory activity. 
Three patients in the control arm reported major viola-
tions to the protocol and were withdrawn from the study.
One patient from the experimental arm received intra -
articular steroid for rhizarthrosis and was withdrawn from
the trial. Patients in the experimental arm performed 89.1%
± 6.2% of the scheduled workout sessions (range from
77.9% to 97.6%; Figure 2); all were contacted by phone at
least once during the study period because of the telemoni-
toring detection of a warning flag. No adverse event related
to the use of the device was recorded.
Satisfaction interview. The QUEST 2.0 results are shown in
Figure 3. The total QUEST score was 4.47 ± 0.30 (min 3.83;
max 4.83), while the services subscale scored 4.79 ± 0.32

(min 4.00; max 5.00), and the device subscale scored 4.31 ±
0.38 (min 3.50; max 4.87). The lower score reached by the
device subscale can be attributed to the size and weight of
the prototype.
DISCUSSION
The novelty of Re.Mo.Te. consists in the application of
telemedicine to hand rehabilitation in patients with disabling
rheumatic diseases. The kinesiotherapy workout proposed
in the trial includes strengthening, mobility, and dexterity
exercises for rehabilitation of the hand in SSc and RA. The
findings from both arms of the Re.Mo.Te. trial are consistent
with those of previous studies, which found that kinesio-
therapy in patients with SSc and RA improves hand function
by increasing muscular strength and endurance, improving
ROM and dexterity9,10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Although we
were not able to demonstrate statistically significant differ-
ences in outcome measures between treatment methods,
probably because of the small sample, patients enrolled in
the experimental SSc and RA groups showed a significant
change over time on a higher number of both primary and
secondary outcomes when compared to controls. However,
it remains to be proved whether such effectiveness is exclu-
sively related to telemedicine. 
Adherence to any exercise program is necessary to
ensure its effectiveness in increasing strength and improving
mobility, but patient compliance to home treatment
programs is typically low and declines over time23,24. Low
compliance with home kinesiotherapy is confirmed by the
rate of withdrawals due to lack of adherence to treatment,
recorded in the control arm of our study for both SSc (20%)
and RA (30%). Conversely, no withdrawal secondary to lack
of adherence was recorded in the experimental arms. The
measured adherence to the protocol for patients enrolled in
the experimental arms was continuous over time and
reached about 90% for both diseases. Therefore, the better
results achieved in the experimental arms could be
attributed to the rehabilitation treatment implemented by

Re.Mo.Te. technology, allowing health professionals to
remotely monitor the workout and to intervene, minimizing
protocol violations and maximizing patient compliance and
adherence to treatment. There are, however, other possible
explanations. The awareness of being monitored by health
professionals may have promoted a change in the behavior
of patients by increasing the intention to adhere to the
exercise regime. Moreover, a better performance might have
been ensured by the ergonomic tools embedded in the exper-
imental device and the sensorial feedbacks. Finally, although
the experimental and the control interventions were almost
equal in terms of duration, intensity, and specificity of the
exercises, the difference between the 2 arms in number of
exercises may have weakened the validity of the comparison.
Telemedicine is rapidly becoming a promising option in
many branches of medicine25,26,27,28,29,30 and in rehabili-
tation as well31. Few patients with rheumatic disease who
have hand impairment are referred to rehabilitative therapy
and even fewer use this service32. Re.Mo.Te. may offer
improved access to healthcare over distance and the oppor-
tunity to increase the intensity and duration of the rehabili-
tation program, satisfying both the need to exercise at home
and the need for continuous supervision of kinesiotherapy.
Moreover, the Re.Mo.Te. technology was appreciated and
welcomed by patients. Indeed, according to the results
obtained by QUEST 2.0, patients were satisfied with the
services and the device in general and with the ease of use
(4.9 ± 0.32) and effectiveness (4.2 ± 0.80) in particular,
which the larger majority of them considered the most
important aspects of Re.Mo.Te.
Notwithstanding some limitations, our preliminary study
suggests how promising and effective the approach of
telemonitoring self-directed kinesiotherapy sessions could
be for the rehabilitation of hand function in patients with
rheumatic disease. However, further larger studies will need
to be undertaken to evaluate the telemonitoring effect on
rehabilitation. Ongoing research will investigate the
cost-effectiveness of a personalized program of kinesio-
therapy driven by Re.Mo.Te. and specifically designed for
the needs of the individual patient, as well as the technical
support and organizational setup necessary to provide this
new approach as a standard of care.
