Abstract
Objective To determine whether mobile phone based monitoring
improves asthma control compared with standard paper based monitoring
strategies.
Design Multicentre randomised controlled trial with cost effectiveness
analysis.
Setting UK primary care.
Participants 288 adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma
(asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score ≥1.5) from 32 practices.
Intervention Participants were centrally randomised to twice daily
recording and mobile phone based transmission of symptoms, drug use,
and peak flow with immediate feedback prompting action according to
an agreed plan or paper based monitoring.
Main outcome measures Changes in scores on asthma control
questionnaire and self efficacy (knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy
asthma questionnaire (KASE-AQ)) at six months after randomisation.
Assessment of outcomes was blinded. Analysis was on an intention to
treat basis.
Results There was no significant difference in the change in asthma
control or self efficacy between the two groups (ACQ: mean change
0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in change
−0.02 (95% confidence interval −0.23 to 0.19); KASE-AQ score: mean
change −4.4 v −2.4, mean difference 2.0 (−0.3 to 4.2)). The numbers of
patients who had acute exacerbations, steroid courses, and unscheduled
consultations were similar in both groups, with similar healthcare costs.
Overall, the mobile phone service was more expensive because of the
expenses of telemonitoring.
Conclusions Mobile technology does not improve asthma control or
increase self efficacy compared with paper based monitoring when both
groups received clinical care to guidelines standards. The mobile
technology was not cost effective.
Trial registration Clinical Trials NCT00512837.
Introduction
Globally, an estimated 300 million people have asthma,
presenting a considerable and increasing burden of disease to
healthcare systems, families, and patients.1 Despite two decades
of asthma guidelines,2 asthma remains poorly controlled in a
substantial proportion of people.3 Structured asthma
management—which in the United Kingdom is predominantly
delivered in primary care4—can improve outcomes in terms of
exacerbations, admissions to hospital, and days lost from school
and work.5 The concept of supported self management, engaging
both clinicians and patients in delivering and implementing
regular monitoring of control and adjustment of treatment, is a
key recommendation of national and international guidelines.6 7
The theoretical model developed by Glasziou and colleagues,
using asthma as an exemplar, describes the complementary and
evolving roles of periodic support from professionals and

ongoing self monitoring by patients.8 Our recent qualitative
study suggests that people with asthma perceive a role for mobile
technology in aiding transition from clinician supported phases
while control is gained to effective self management during
maintenance phases.9
Poor adherence to monitoring and drugs is a potentially
modifiable factor associated with poor control.10 In contrast with
paper diary monitoring, in which as few as 6% of readings might
be recorded,11 trials with electronic recording devices have
shown rates of compliance of over 60%,12 especially if the
patient is aware that their health behaviour is being observed.13
Timely feedback of results to the patient can objectively show
severity of symptoms and the impact of compliance with drug
treatment. Mobile phones, the most pervasive and accessible
form of technology globally,14 offer a highly convenient system
for self monitoring coupled with instantaneous feedback,
potentially engaging the patient in the monitoring and
management of their asthma.
Set within the Medical Research Council’s framework for the
design and evaluation of complex interventions,15 16 our phase
III trial was underpinned by preliminary work that suggested
that mobile phone based self monitoring of asthma care was
feasible to deliver and acceptable to both patients and
clinicians.9 12 17 We hypothesised that, in adolescents and adults
with poorly controlled asthma offered treatment according to
the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline
Network (BTS-SIGN) asthma guideline,6 the use of mobile
phone based monitoring of lung function and symptoms with
feedback to patients would improve both control of asthma and
patient self efficacy at six months compared with paper based
monitoring strategies.
Methods
Our multicentre, investigator blinded randomised controlled
trial was conducted in UK primary care in 2008-9. A detailed
protocol has been published elsewhere18; we made no important
changes to our methods during the trial.
Practice recruitment
The primary care research networks in Norfolk and Yarmouth,
East Kent, North of England, and Essex and Hertfordshire
identified and recruited practices.
Participants
We recruited patients aged 12 and over who were registered
with participating practices, had poorly controlled asthma
(defined as score ≥1.5 on asthma control questionnaire (ACQ)19),
and had, or were willing to borrow, a compatible mobile phone
handset and a contract with a compatible network. We excluded
people who had other lung disease, were unable to communicate
in English, or were receiving specialist care for severe/difficult
asthma, and those whose general practitioner advised against
inclusion for major social/clinical problems.
Recruitment of patients
We searched practice computer databases to identify potentially
eligible patients. After the GP had screened the computer lists,
we sent postal invitations to all eligible patients, with up to one
written reminder.
One researcher (SDM or SM) prescreened respondents by
telephone to determine whether they fulfilled the criterion of
poorly controlled asthma and whether they had a contract with
a compatible mobile phone network and a compatible handset.
Patients with an incompatible handset but who subscribed to a
compatible network were offered the opportunity of borrowing
a handset for the duration of the trial.
Potential participants attended a baseline assessment visit in
their general practice at which they were provided with further
information about the trial, eligibility was confirmed with the
seven question version of the ACQ (which includes FEV1 (forced
expiratory volume in one second) in addition to the six questions
described below as a primary outcome measure), and written
consent was obtained. All consenting patients who met the
eligibility criteria were enrolled into the trial.
Primary outcome measures
Asthma control questionnaire (ACQ)—The primary outcome
measure was the change in asthma control between baseline
and six months as measured by ACQ (six question version).20 21
The ACQ measures clinical goals of asthma management on a
scale of 0 (good control) to 6 (poor control), is responsive to
change,20 and has a minimum important difference within
individuals of 0.5.22 Postal administration gives comparable
results with supervised completion.23
Knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire
(KASE-AQ)—Self efficacy was measured as the change in
KASE-AQ between the intervention and control groups at six
months. The KASE-AQ has three independently scored
subscales of 20 items of which we used two: “self efficacy,”
which measures perceived ability to control asthma, and
“attitude to asthma.”24 Scores range from 20 (minimum score)
to 100 and are responsive to change.25 We omitted the outdated
knowledge subscale.
Secondary outcome measures
Full details of the secondary outcome measures of interest are
in the published protocol.15 Briefly, we included:
• Mini-asthma quality of life questionnaire (mini-AQLQ):
score from 1 (greatest impairment) to 7, with a minimum
important difference of 0.526
• Adverse occurrences obtained from the practice records,
including admissions for exacerbations of asthma (defined
as acute deteriorations of asthma for which the patient
sought medical advice), prescribed courses of oral steroids,
and unscheduled consultations
• Prescriptions of asthma drugs recorded in the patients’
healthcare record
• Modified patient enablement instrument (mPEI): scale of
0 to 12 (most enabled)27
• Engagement with process (proportion of patients defaulting
from clinical follow-up).
Baseline assessment
We undertook a baseline assessment comprising history of
asthma, current smoking status, presence of comorbidity, and
FEV1 with a Piko meter (nSpire Health, Enfield, UK). The use
of the Piko meter to record peak flows was demonstrated and
a meter given to the patient for use throughout the trial. The
ACQ, KASE-AQ, mini-AQLQ, and mPEI questionnaires were
self completed under supervision.
Randomisation and protection against bias
All consenting participants were stratified by practice and
centrally randomised (Health Services Research Unit, University
of Aberdeen) to mobile phone or paper based monitoring with

a 1:1 allocation with random block sizes of two or four;
telephone randomisation ensured concealment until the treatment
was assigned. The practice nurse informed the patient of
allocation to ensure the researchers were blinded to allocation
throughout data collection and analysis.
Mobile phone monitoring
The practice nurse forwarded contact details of patients allocated
to the intervention (mobile) group to OBS Medical (Abingdon,
UK), who contacted the patient at a time convenient to them
(normally within a week), downloaded the t+ Asthma application
(fig 1⇓) onto their (or a loaned) phone, tested its functionality,
trained the patient in its use, provided details of web access,
and followed up with a technical support call after one week of
use.
The t+ Asthma application enabled twice daily recording and
transmission of symptoms, drug use, and peak flow. The mean
of the five best peak flow values in the first 50 readings (after
discarding the lowest five and highest five readings, which
preliminary work suggested were often outliers28) was taken to
be the target peak flow value (100%) and used to define the
80% and 60% thresholds for a traffic light display. As new data
were generated, the target peak flow value was adjusted to the
mean of the five best peak flow values (after discarding outliers)
in the most recent 50 readings. The recorded peak flow was
displayed within the traffic light zones and the patient was
prompted to follow their agreed action plan (fig 1⇓). Incursion
into the red or amber zones triggered contact by an asthma nurse
from OBS Medical on the next working day. Appendix 1on
bmj.com gives the protocol for these support calls. Both the
patient and their clinician were able to access the patient data
record via a password protected website.
Paper based monitoring
Patients in the control (paper) group were asked to keep a paper
diary, recording the same data as the intervention group
(symptoms, drug use, and peak flow readings) twice daily.
Clinical care in both groups
To ensure that our trial specifically tested the impact of the
technology, we opted to provide the paper group with the same
clinical care as the intervention group, rather than using
(probably less intensive) usual care as a comparator. Before
randomisation, the practice asthma nurse delivered a 30 minute
standardised education session encompassing information on
asthma, asthma treatment, inhaler technique, monitoring, and
a personalised asthma action plan based on both symptoms and
peak flows completed in accordance with the advice of the
BTS-SIGN asthma guideline. Instruction on mobile or paper
monitoring was provided after randomisation according to
allocation.
Throughout the trial the practices’ asthma nurse provided clinical
care in accordance with the stepwise approach advocated by
the BTS-SIGN asthma guideline.6 Patients were reviewed
monthly (including the option of telephone reviews according
to preference and clinical condition) until the nurse judged that
control was achieved on the basis of clinical monitoring.
Recognition of control in the context of a clinical review was
discussed during the training.29 When control was attained, the
patient was discharged from monthly follow-up but was
encouraged to continue monitoring on a maintenance basis,
seeking professional advice if needed.
Data collection
A researcher blinded to allocation collected primary outcome
data at the final trial visit; non-attendees were sent the
questionnaires by post. Interim data were collected by postal
questionnaires at three months. The practice asthma nurses
recorded the duration of each review at the end of the
consultation and noted whether the patient’s asthma was now
controlled and whether a further appointment was needed. The
researcher extracted data on adverse events (including
admissions, unscheduled asthma consultations), asthma
treatment categorised by BTS-SIGN guideline step,6 and use of
healthcare resources over the six month trial period from the
primary care records at baseline and at the end of the trial.
Questionnaire data were scanned on the trial database. Data
from records and other trial data were entered manually.
Sample size calculations
Using an estimated standard deviation of change in ACQ score
of 0.25,19 we estimated that a sample size of 125 per arm would
have 90% power with a two sided 5% significance level to detect
a difference in mean change in ACQ score of 0.1 or more
between groups. With a standard deviation of 13.3,25 a sample
size of 39 in each arm would have 90% power with a two sided
5% significance level to detect a mean difference in mean
KASE-AQ (self efficacy scale) score of 10 or more between
groups.
Data analysis
Our main analysis was on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. We
assumed that participants who did not attend the three or six
month assessment had not improved their control and their
previous results were therefore carried forward.30 A per protocol
analysis was undertaken as a sensitivity analysis.
At baseline we described groups in terms of sociodemographic
factors, history of asthma, ACQ, mini-AQLQ, KASE-AQ, and
mPEI scores. We compared prespecified changes between
groups from baseline in outcome measures using appropriate
univariate techniques (t test, Mann-Whitney test). We used
repeated measures analysis of variance, adjusted for age and
sex, to examine trends over time in ACQ, mini-AQLQ,
KASE-AQ, and mPEI scores both between and within groups.
All two way interactions between outcome and age and sex
were examined.
We compared the proportion of participants whose ACQ and
mini-AQLQ score had improved by more than 0.5 (the minimum
important difference),31 the proportion in whom asthma remained
poorly controlled (ACQ >1.519), and the proportion whose
asthma was “well controlled” (ACQ <0.7519) at six months.
We assessed costs from the perspective of the NHS. The total
cost of the monitoring service for a projected maximum of 156
participants was allocated to each participant with the estimated
reimbursed transmission costs. Costs were estimated by using
unit costs obtained from standard sources32-34 (see table A in
appendix 2 on bmj.com for details). We used t tests to compare
costs between groups.
All analyses were agreed a priori. We did not plan, or undertake,
any interim analysis.

a potentially eligible population of 13 101 (mean (SD) age 48.2
(17.9): 63% female), of whom 1020 were excluded by their
practice. A total of 12 081 postal invitations were issued: 1016
people (8.4%) expressed an interest in participating and were
prescreened for eligibility (poor control and compatible mobile
phone and network). The 393 potentially eligible patients were
invited to attend the baseline assessment and 288 gave informed
consent and were randomised: 145 to the mobile group and 143
to the paper group. Ten people had missing or incomplete ACQ
scores at baseline and were excluded after randomisation,
leaving 139 patients in each group for the intention to treat
analysis.
Baseline characteristics
Demographic characteristics of participants, FEV1, smoking
status, current asthma treatment, and baseline questionnaire
scores were similar in both groups (table 1⇓). Patients who did
not complete the final questionnaires were older (51.7 (SD 17.7)
v 40.7 (SD 17.3); P<0.001) than patients who contributed to the
final data collection, with no sex difference.
Primary outcomes
Asthma control—There was no significant difference in the
change in asthma control in the two groups (ACQ: mean change
0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in
change −0.02 (95% confidence interval −0.23 to 0.19) (table
2⇓). Figure 3 shows changes over time⇓. Over half the patients
in both groups improved by more than the minimum important
difference (table 3⇓). At six months, 29/139 (21%) of
participants in the mobile group and 31/139 (22%) of the paper
group had achieved the “well controlled” threshold of ACQ
≤0.75.19 Similarly, 69/139 (50%) of participants in the mobile
group and 67/139 (48%) of the paper group still scored above
the “poorly controlled” threshold of ACQ ≥1.50.19
Self efficacy—The intention to treat analysis found no significant
difference between the groups in change in the self efficacy and
attitude scales of the KASE-AQ (table 2⇓).
Secondary outcomes
Asthma related quality of life—Similarly, the intention to treat
analysis showed no significant difference between the groups
in change in mini-AQLQ score (table 2⇓), though more patients
in the mobile group improved their quality of life by more than
the minimum important difference than in the paper group (table
3⇓).
Enablement—The intention to treat analysis found no significant
difference between the groups in change in the mPEI scores
(table 2⇓).
Per protocol sensitivity analysis
The per protocol analysis included only data from participants
who had complete information for each respective questionnaire
at all time points. The results of this sensitivity analysis
confirmed the findings of the intention to treat analysis (see
table B in appendix 2 on bmj.com).
Attendance for reviews, change in treatment,
and unscheduled healthcare
In both groups the median number of asthma consultations was
two, with 37% of the patients in both groups attending only the
baseline and one follow-up appointment (table 4⇓). Most patients
in both groups had increased treatment with asthma drugs
according to the BTS-SIGN treatment steps (82 (59%) in the
mobile group and 74 (55%) in the paper group), and the nine
patients not treated according to BTS-SIGN steps at baseline
were receiving a recommended treatment schedule by the end
of the trial (fig 4⇓). There was no significant difference between
the groups in the number of acute attacks, steroid courses
prescribed, unscheduled GP or nurse consultations, out of hours
visits, attendances at emergency department, or admissions
(table 5⇓).
Trends over time
Analysis of the repeat values over the three time points of the
trial is shown in table C in appendix 2 on bmj.com. There was
no significant difference in the improvement over time in any
of the outcome measures.
Cost of the monitoring services
Table 6 gives details of the cost to the health service of providing
the two monitoring services⇓. The only significant cost
difference between the two groups was in relation to the
telemonitoring service (about £69 (€83, $108) per patient). The
mean cost of providing respiratory care (including the nurse
monitoring reviews) was £246 (SD £226) in the mobile group
compared with £245 (SD £201) in the paper group (mean
difference −£1.26 (−£51.47 to £48.95).
Discussion
Summary of main findings
The use of mobile phone technology did not significantly
improve clinical outcomes, or increase self efficacy, compared
with paper based monitoring when delivered in the context of
guideline standard clinical care for the management of asthma.
Healthcare costs were similar in both groups, with the
telemonitoring expenses being an additional cost in the mobile
group.
Strengths and limitations
We exceeded our estimated sample size for the intention to treat
analysis, though not for the per protocol sensitivity analysis.
The results, however, are consistent, and it is unlikely that a
smaller attrition rate would alter our conclusions. Our a priori
basis of carrying the previous result forward18 assumes that
non-responders did not improve their control, which probably
underestimates the degree of change in both groups.
The low recruitment rate (2.4% of those invited) reflects both
the low response rate (8.4% of those invited) and our
requirement that participants should have poorly controlled
asthma and a compatible mobile phone system. A slightly higher
proportion of the participants was female, compared with the
potentially eligible population. The 10 patients excluded after
randomisation because of missing baseline ACQ scores were
distributed between the two arms (four in the mobile group, six
in the paper group), and were recruited from eight different
practices, reducing the risk that this introduced important bias.
Our multicentre trial was conducted in primary care, the setting
for most asthma care in the UK, and included both an intention
to treat analysis and a per protocol sensitivity analysis. We built
on extensive formative work, which underpinned the hypothesis
and informed the practical design of the intervention and the
outcomes measured.9 12 17 23 Although the patients and nurses
were clearly aware of the mode of monitoring that they were
using, our trial procedures ensured that the researchers who
undertook data collection and the trial statisticians were blinded
to allocation (for example, randomisation was undertaken by

the practice nurses, technical issues were dealt with by OBS
Medical, patients were instructed not to reveal allocation, in the
event of an inadvertent breach a second researcher attended the
practice for subsequent data collection).
Interpretation with reference to other research
Our findings exemplify the challenges of evaluating complex
eHealth interventions35 and the concern that potential benefits
have thus far tended not to be substantiated by subsequent
empirical evidence.36 Some studies using mobile phones37 and
internet based monitoring have shown benefit in adults38 39 and
children40 when compared with “usual care.” Usual care,
however, is likely to be considerably less intensive than that
experienced by intervention groups, so that it is often impossible
to determine whether the observed benefits in these trials were
because of the enhanced clinical care or the technological
intervention. To overcome this, we provided the same structured
clinical and educational intervention in both groups and showed
that when the only difference is the mode of monitoring and
associated feedback, the link with mobile phone technology had
no significant effect.
Our hypothesis, building on formative work,9 12 13 17 was
predicated on the theory that using a mobile phone to monitor
and receive instantaneous feedback on their asthma control
would help patients to integrate management into everyday life,
engage them more fully in their care, and thus potentially
improve asthma control. Patients in both groups, however,
attended a similar number of monthly clinical reviews,
suggesting that the mobile phone monitoring did not improve
compliance with care. Similarly, most patients in both groups
stepped up their treatment during the course of the trial.
Participation in the trial probably resulted in greater engagement
of patients and asthma nurses in both groups with “guideline
standard care” (as opposed to “usual care”), potentially
contributing to the improvement we observed in both groups.
Spontaneous improvement over the timescale of the trial is
another plausible explanation.
Despite the significant improvements in ACQ score in both
groups, only about a fifth achieved the well controlled threshold
of ACQ=0.75. While it has been shown that even better control
can be achieved in trials with maximal doses of drugs in selected
patients with asthma,41 the degree of improvement we observed
is of the same order as that shown in “real life” trials,42 in which
adherence is variable and comorbidity is common. To increase
generalisability, we did not exclude smokers so some overlap
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is possible.
The cost of the t+ asthma service was additional to the health
service costs, which were otherwise similar in both groups,
making it the more expensive option. This might not extrapolate
directly to normal clinical practice where, for example,
economies of scale in a regional service could reduce the cost
per patient. In addition, many other factors will affect both costs
and benefits. Technological advances, such as smart phone
applications, will increase functionality and widespread adoption
might drive down costs. As part of the commercial arrangement
with OBS Medical additional clinical support was available to
the mobile group from the t+ asthma nurse, though its
contribution is unclear as it was not a closely monitored
component of the trial.
A recent systematic review concluded that telehealthcare in
asthma could have a role in reducing hospital admissions in
high risk patients and in those with severe disease,43 and some
studies have suggested that those with poorly controlled asthma
might be more ready to comply with novel monitoring44 or take
regular drug treatment45 than those with already well controlled
asthma. Our trial, which recruited people with poorer control
and lower baseline spirometry results than other trials,38 39 did
not find a beneficial effect in this group.
Conclusions and implications
In people with poorly controlled asthma, the mobile phone based
model of monitoring did not offer any advantages over and
above paper based care when guideline standard clinical support
services were provided to both groups. While mobile phone
technology will appeal to some people,17 18 it is not the crucial
ingredient and carries cost implications. Its place in clinical care
might depend on whether it is a cost effective option for
enhancing “usual care” to the standards recommended by
guidelines.46 Policymakers internationally should consider the
findings from this multicentre trial when considering the merits
of investment in models of asthma care based on telehealthcare.

What is already known on this topic
Mobile phones offer a highly convenient system for self monitoring coupled with instantaneous feedback, potentially engaging patients
in the monitoring and self management of their asthma
Some interventions using mobile phones in asthma care have shown benefit compared with “usual care,” but it is often impossible to
determine whether the observed benefits were because of the mobile phone intervention or the associated enhanced clinical care
What this study adds
The mobile phone based model of monitoring did not offer any clinical advantages over and above paper based care when guideline
standard clinical support services were provided to both groups
Clinically relevant improvements were seen in both groups, suggesting that the telemonitoring was not the crucial ingredient in improving
outcomes
The mobile phone based model of asthma care was more expensive than paper based model
has spoken for AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Chiesi,
GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Teva and undertaken advisory group work
for Chiesi.

Figures
Fig 1 Mobile phone monitoring system. t+ Asthma application, running on web enabled handset, allowed patient to record
symptoms, drug use, and peak flow from Piko meter. Automated display plotted peak flow as normal (≥80% green zone),
in need of attention (60-79% amber zone), or in need of urgent action (<60% red zone) and prompted patients to follow
their agreed action plan. Incursion into red or amber zones also triggered contact by t+ Asthma nurse from OBS Medical
on next working day to ascertain what had happened and what learning points had arisen. Data were automatically transmitted
to secure website on remote server hosted by OBS Medical, every time application was used by patient. Patient and clinician
were able to access patient data record via password protected website, which also provided general information about
asthma
