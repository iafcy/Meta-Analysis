The purpose of this randomized field study was to determine the effects of
telehomecare on hospitalization,emergency department (ED) use,mortality,
and symptoms related to sodium and fluid intake,medication use,and physical
activity. The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure. The authors
used logistic regression to study the effects of telehomecare on health
services utilization and mortality and a general linear model to analyze
changes in self-reported symptoms. On average,patients in the telehomecare
groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did
patients in the control group. Differences were statistically significant at 60
days but not 120 days. Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for
patients using telehomecare compared to control patients. The technology
enables frequent monitoring of clinical indices and permits the home health
care nurse to detect changes in cardiac status and intervene when necessary.

Telehomecare is a telephone-based technology that enables individuals
to transmit,electronically,health-related data to nurses and other health
providers. The convergence of telephone systems and information technol-
ogy has enormous implications for managing chronic illnesses such as
heart failure (HF). Anecdotal reports suggest that telehomecare is appropri-
ate for persons who need timely monitoring and feedback about their health
status. However,research is needed to confirm these assumptions.

This article discusses findings from an empirical study that tested the
effects of a telehomecare intervention in a sample of Medicare-eligible per-
sons with HF, a major health problem affecting more than 5 million
Americans (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,2007). The economic
burden of this disease is staggering; total medical expenditures for HF are
estimated to be $33.2 billion in 2007,and elders with HF have the highest
rehospitalization rate of all adult patients (American Heart Association
[AHA], 2007). The major goals of treatment for persons with HF are to
increase self-management, improve health status, and decrease the costly
use of health services; thus,telehomecare appears to be a disease manage-
ment strategy with much potential.
Background
A form of telemedicine,“telehomecare”is a telephone-based communi-
cation system with medical peripherals that is used in the home setting.
Patients use the medical devices to assess their health status and transmit
the data to clinicians for review and action. Nurses and other clinicians use
the data to monitor patients’health and teach patients and their caregivers
self-management behaviors. Measurement and transmission of blood pres-
sure, temperature, weight, blood glucose levels, and pulse oximetry are
possible with the newest generation of models. Some models also provide
audio and video contact and digital stethoscopes.
Empirical studies of telehomecare are increasing,albeit slowly. Johnston,
Wheeler, Deuser, and Sousa (2000) conducted the first published study of
telemedicine in a sample of home health care patients and concluded that
this technology is effective, well received by patients, and offers quality
care while reducing costs. A review of the literature found several studies
that tested for a specific relationship between telehomecare and hospital-
ization, with mixed results. Bondmass, Bolger, Castro, and Avitall (1999)
and Benatar, Bondmass, Ghitelman, and Avitall (2003) studied the effects
of home monitoring and found that admissions and length of hospital stay
were significantly decreased for HF patients after the implementation of
telehomecare. Cordisco, Beniaminovitz, Hammond, and Mancini (1999)
evaluated a device that asks patients symptom-related questions, records
their weight,and transmits the information to nurses for evaluation. Patients
using the technology had lower rehospitalization rates and emergency
department (ED) visits. Shaul(2000) tested telehomecare with elders who
had one or more chronic illnesses and were at risk for rehospitalization and
found that telehomecare patients had fewer hospitalizations, although results

were not statistically significant. A study with diabetic home care patients
found that those using telehomecare were significantly less likely to be rehos-
pitalized (Bowles & Dansky,2002; Dansky,Bowles,& Palmer,2003).
More recently, a study conducted by a Veterans Affairs program found
that telehomecare use resulted in greater improvements in mental health,
but no statistically significant differences were found in inpatient admis-
sions or ED visits (Hopp et al.,2006). Although the study was randomized,
the sample size consisted of only 37 patients,all of whom had a variety of
diagnoses. Jerant,Azari,and Nesbitt (2001) compared the use of home tele-
homecare to nurse telephone calls and usual outpatient care. Mean HF-
related readmissions were lower in the telehomecare group and telephone
group, but the between-group difference was not significant, suggesting
that telehomecare may not offer incremental benefits beyond telephone
follow-up and may be more expensive.
The studies described here consisted of small sample sizes, making it
difficult to draw conclusions regarding the clinical efficacy of telehome-
care. Bowles and Baugh (2007), in their review of telehomecare studies,
suggest that a causal relationship between telehomecare and positive clini-
cal outcomes has yet to be shown because most prior studies have had small
sample sizes. Despite these difficulties,the increasing use of telehomecare
in clinical agencies is a compelling reason to continue research on its effi-
cacy and effectiveness.
In this article,we report empirical findings related to the effects of a tele-
homecare system on hospital and ED encounters,mortality,and HF symp-
toms in a sample of persons with HF. Furthermore,we describe the features
of different types of telehomecare systems and compare clinical outcomes
for each.No previous studies have examined differences in outcomes based
on type of machine,a unique contribution of the current study.
Methods
Design
The research design was a prospective,randomized field experiment,with a
treatment group and equivalent control group in 10 home health agencies
(HHAs) located in one mid-Atlantic state. Patients in the treatment groups
received a telehomecare system for the duration of their home health services,to
be used in conjunction with usual home health care. (Note:The standard episode
of home health services under Medicare regulations is 60 days. Patients may be
discharged before then. If continued care is required, they are recertified
for another 60-day episode.) Equipment was removed when the patient was

Dansky et al. / Telehealth and Clinical Outcomes 185
discharged from home health services. Patients in the control groups received
routine home visits only. Data on all patients were collected for 120 days.
Sample and Procedures
The study sample was drawn from a pool of patients admitted to the 10 par-
ticipating HHAs for skilled home care. Patient enrollment began in March 2004
and ended December 31, 2005. All patients with primary or secondary diag-
noses of HF and ability to communicate in conversational English were eligi-
ble to participate and were recruited for the study. During the admission visit,
the home health nurse documented that the patient was cognitively intact,able
to see and hear the equipment,and had a phone line in the home. The nurse
explained the purpose of the study and obtained written consent making sure
the patient understood that refusal would not affect their home care.
(Procedures were approved by the university institutional review board and met
Health Information Portability and Accountability Act requirements.) The pro-
ject manager at each HHA randomly assigned the patient to the intervention or
control group,using a sealed,opaque envelope technique. There was one inter-
vention group and one control group at each HHA. Each patient in the study
received a packet of information on HF,providing basic facts on the disease,
guidelines on self-management,and specific instructions on when to notify his
or her home care nurse or personal physician.
We conducted a series of training sessions with supervisors and regis-
tered nurses at each HHA. The purpose of these sessions was to review pro-
cedures for recruiting and enrolling patients,and to address quality of care
issues. In addition, a nurse researcher on the study team reviewed the HF
clinical pathways used at each HHA to determine if the pathways addressed
specific guidelines recommended by the AHA and to assess congruence in
care across agencies. We concluded that all agencies had clinical pathways
in place that were similar and up to date with AHA guidelines. After enroll-
ment began, we conducted monthly conference calls to address technical
issues and emphasize consistency in patient care among the HHAs.
The Telehomecare Systems
Telehomecare systems were purchased or leased from vendors whose
products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal
Communications Commission. The systems operate over telephone lines via
a standard modem, linking a central station at the HHA to remote units in
homes or other settings. Two types of systems were used in this study,a one-
way (asynchronous) monitoring system and a two-way (synchronous) moni-
toring system. The HHA determined the type of system used.

186 Clinical Nursing Research
The one-way monitoring system allows a patient to take his or her own
measurements (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, weight) through peripheral
devices and transmit the readings to the HHA. The one-way monitoring
systems used in the study were either the HomMed Health Monitor or the
ViTel Net system. The one-way systems are used independently by the
patient and are typically programmed to be used every day at a predeter-
mined time (usually 11:00 a.m.). If the nurse who checks the transmitted
data observes abnormal values,he or she may call the patient or the home
care nurse for further information or intervention.
The two-way system (Aviva) adds a video camera and digital stetho-
scope to the monitoring device, permitting two-way synchronous interac-
tion between nurse and patient. Monitoring sessions are scheduled by the
home care nurse according to the patient’s condition and care plan,usually
two to three times per week. Patients can use the system as often as they
wish to monitor their condition, but for the model used in this study, the
data were stored offline, and later transmitted to the nurse during the syn-
chronous connection. During this live connection, the nurse reviewed all
data downloaded from the patient’s independent use of the equipment and
discussed the results with the patient. The nurse also used the digital stetho-
scope to listen to the patient’s heart and lungs. Vital signs,blood sugar,or
pulse oximetry readings were collected as ordered by the physician. The
nurse used the audio and video to interact with the patient to discuss symp-
toms,diet,medications,and physical activity.
Regardless of the type of system being used,a central station at the HHA
tracks and displays data for analysis by the home health nurses and physi-
cians. If a patient’s clinical measurements fall outside of preset parameters,
alarms enable immediate detection of problems. The central station also is
designed to flag late or missing measurements to alert clinicians to a poten-
tial problem. An authorized clinician can access the patient’s medical record
data in the database viewing vital signs data and still images. Access to the
electronic medical record is restricted to users who are on the internal net-
work and who have authorized user names and passwords. Communications
among the central station,network server,and electronic medical record data-
base are encrypted for privacy. The systems in this study were not pro-
grammed to provide health instruction or educational material.
Instruments and Measures
Study data were collected on admission,60 days later to coincide with a
standard “episode of care” for home health services and 120 days after

admission. Three research assistants who were blinded to the study group
collected patient data via a telephone interview at each data point. The
research assistants were all graduate students in health services and trained
to use the instruments in the study.
Health services utilization data were collected at 60 and 120 days from
the patient’s medical record at the HHA. In addition,the research assistant
asked the patient,during the telephone interviews,if any ED visits or hos-
pitalizations had occurred. This self report was verified by a review of the
hospital records for the appropriate time period.
The Omaha System Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes (PRSO) was
used to measure symptoms of HF related to sodium and fluid intake,medica-
tion effectiveness, and physical activity. The PRSO is suited for assessing
patients with a wide range of functioning. The internal consistency of the
scales,tested in previous studies,ranges from .76 to .82 (Martin,Scheet,&
Stegman,1993). The instrument assesses symptoms that may be related to
sodium and fluid intake, such as presence of edema, shortness of breath,
and weight gain. For physical activity,the distance walked and severity of
symptoms, such as shortness of breath on exertion, were assessed. Side
effects and medication efficacy were assessed to determine symptom status
related to medications. The blinded research assistant evaluated patient
responses to probe questions in each area and assigned a numerical score
ranging from 1 (extreme symptoms) to 5 (no symptoms). In this coding
scheme,a higher score indicates more favorable status.
Additional data were collected from the HHAs to control for factors that
may influence patient outcomes, including gender, age, race, number of
comorbidities, and severity. The home health nurse collected these data
using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set admission instrument
(the standardized assessment tool mandated for all Medicare reimbursable
HHA admissions).
Analysis and Results
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables of interest (see
Table 1).
Group assignment was dummy coded for control (0) and telehomecare
(1) initially,and then for control (0),one-way monitor (1),and monitor and
video (2) in subsequent analyses. (To simplify terminology in this section,
we refer to the one-way monitoring systems as “monitor”and to the moni-
tor and video systems as “video”.)
Student ttests were conducted to determine if the groups differed on any
baseline characteristics such as age, race, or severity score. None of the

demographic or clinical characteristics were found to be significantly dif-
ferent for the groups at baseline. At Time 3, patients in the telehomecare
groups had a greater length of stay in home care (69 days versus 62 days).
The number of days in home care (HHA days) was significantly correlated
with several outcomes,and thus,was included as a control variable.
In three separate equations, logistic regression was used to predict the
likelihood of hospitalization, ED visits, or death. The objective of these
analyses was to determine the relationship between type of intervention and
clinical outcomes,controlling for other significant factors. An advantage of
this procedure is that logistic regression has no assumptions about the dis-
tribution of the predictor variables; they can be any combination of contin-
uous,discrete,or dichotomous variables (Tabachnik & Fidell,2001).
Hospitalizations
We conducted several analyses to test for differences in hospitalizations.
First, we compared the proportions of patients in the three groups with
regard to having none versus one or more hospitalizations during episodes
of care and during the duration of the study. Table 2 shows a trend for tele-
homecare patients to be somewhat less likely than control patients to have
had one or more hospitalizations, particularly during the entire study
period, as opposed to the immediate episode of care. However, the differ-
ences among proportions are not statistically significant. Small sample size
precluded the comparisons from achieving statistical significance—power
is estimated at below .45.
The average number of hospitalizations, controlling for the number of
days in home care (HHA days), was similar for the control and treatment
groups for both periods (60 and 120 days). Overall, there was a tendency
for telehomecare patients,as a group,to have fewer hospitalizations at both
points in time; however,the differences were statistically significant only at
60 days. Likewise, comparisons among groups for patients with one or
more hospitalizations showed that patients in the control group had the
highest number of hospitalizations in both time periods.
Within the telehomecare groups,patients with the video systems had the
lowest number of hospitalizations at both points in time (see Table 2).
However, the within-group comparisons were not statistically significant;
small sample sizes precluding the analyses from achieving statistical sig-
nificance (power is estimated at below .30). Similarly, logistic regression
models did not identify significant predictors of the likelihood of having
one or more hospitalizations at either 60 days or during the entire 120-day
study period.

Emergency Visits
Telehomecare patients had fewer ED visits than patients in the control
group. At 60 days,approximately 30% of the control group had had an ED
visit,compared to 24% of the monitor group and 18% of the video group.
The differences are less striking at 120 days, but follow the same pattern:
36% of the control group had an ED visit,compared to 30% of the monitor
group and 31% of the video group. On the whole, only 22% of the tele-
homecare patients (monitor or video) reported an ED visit during their 60-
day episode of treatment. Because of the small sample size and resulting
lack of statistical power, the difference in proportions did not achieve sta-
tistical significance (z=1.31,p=.09).
Logistic regression models of ED visits at 60 and 120 days reflect these
findings. Compared to the nonintervention (control) group, patients using
either type of telehomecare system were less likely to have one or more ED
visits. The difference between the nonintervention and video group was sta-
tistically significant at 60 days: The odds ratio (OR) for the video group
was 0.35 (p < .05). The monitor group was also less likely to have had an
ED visit (OR =0.69,p>.10),but the size of the effect was not statistically
significant. The ORs for both intervention groups were lower but not sig-
nificantly different from the control group at 120 days. The tendency for
telehomecare system users to have fewer ED visits persisted beyond the
episode of care. During the entire study period (120 days),more than 36%
of the control group patients had one or more ED visits,compared to 30.2%
in the intervention group. However,this difference was not statistically sig-
nificant (z=0.78,p=.22)
These findings are echoed by a comparison of marginal means,control-
ling for number of HHA days, which showed a tendency for the control
group to have, on average, more ED visits than either intervention group.
Again,small sample size precluded the comparisons from achieving statis-
tical significance—power is estimated at .42.
Although the comparisons of proportions and means did not achieve sta-
tistical significance, the findings suggest that the use of the telehomecare
system may have decreased the overall incidence of visits to the ED. At 60
days, the average number of ED visits for members of the control group
(0.42) is 40% higher than the monitor group (0.30) and twice as high as the
video group (0.21). These figures represent a potential savings in the
number of ED visits that may be clinically and financially significant.

Mortality
We used logistic regression to model the likelihood of death at 120 days.
Results show that the intervention group was not a statistically significant
predictor of death. However, patients in the intervention groups tended to
be less likely to die than patients in the control group, and that effect is
much more pronounced for the one-way monitoring group (p=.11) than for
the video group (p = .47). The statistical power of this analysis at the .05
level is estimated to be .65.
HF Symptoms
We used a General Linear Model to analyze changes in symptoms of HF.
Very small sample sizes at Time 3 precluded analyses of data across the three
data points; thus, we analyzed changes from Time 1 to Time 2 only.
Controlling for HHA days in each of the models from Time 1 to Time 2 (diet-
related symptoms,physical activity status,and medication effectiveness) we
found that telehomecare patients reported fewer symptoms than control
group patients,although the differences were not always statistically signifi-
cant. Further post hoc analysis found that patients in the one-way monitoring
group showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported symptoms
related to diet and medications than patients in either the video group or
control group (see Table 4).
Limitations
A limitation to this study is the sample size. Using Cohen’s (1988)
power analysis method, a conservative effect size of 0.2 would require a
sample size of 394 to achieve statistical power of .80. Despite aggressive
recruiting efforts, repeated training sessions for managers and nurses, and
an extended study period,we were not able to meet recruiting goals in sev-
eral of the HHAs. Our final sample size was 284 at Time 3. Patient failure
to complete telephone interviews at either Time 2 or Time 3 further reduced
the sample size. The small number of participants in some of the models
greatly reduced the statistical power.
A second limitation is that there was no control on what type of system
the participant received because the intervention was dependent on the sys-
tems used by the HHA. Random assignment to a type of system would fur-
ther enhance the rigor of this design.

Conclusions
Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that telehomecare has
positive effects on outcomes related to HF. Regarding symptoms, the
repeated measures analysis of symptom scores found that telehomecare
patients improved more than control group patients, for symptoms related
to sodium and fluid intake, and in medication effectiveness, but not for
physical activity status. We suggest that the monitoring provides a feedback
mechanism that supports appropriate behaviors to manage HF.
The score for physical activity symptoms evaluated the patient’s ability
to walk or climb stairs without shortness of breath or fatigue. Study find-
ings suggest it may be difficult to achieve improvements in physical activ-
ity with telehomecare monitoring and that in-person physical therapy may
be needed to address the debilitating effects of HF on physical activity.
Patients who used a telehomecare system experienced fewer hospitaliza-
tions than those who did not,and patients in the video group had the lowest
number of hospitalizations during the 120-day study period and during the
home health episode of care. We conclude that the frequent monitoring of
clinical measures enabled the nurse to assess cardiac status and intervene in
a timelier manner than home visits alone would permit. Furthermore, the
increased number of nurse encounters via the video system facilitates other
important nursing activities,such as teaching,providing feedback,and offer-
ing psychosocial support. We did not test this relationship and recommend
that the structure and content of video visits be studied.
For persons with HF,study findings suggest that telehomecare monitoring
may reduce ED use. As noted in Table 4,approximately 70% of patients who
used telehomecare had no ED events during the 120 days,compared to 64%
of patients in the control group. Furthermore,the adjusted mean number of
events was lower for telehomecare patients at both 60 days and 120 days. The
ability for the nurse to act quickly on symptoms that otherwise would lead to
a costly ED visit or hospitalization is clearly a clinical benefit of using the
telehomecare system. Because statistically insignificant results do not rule
out the possibility of clinically important results,and given the difficulty of
fielding large studies of home care patients,we suggest that future research
investigate the clinical importance of telehomecare as an intervention. The
minimally important clinical difference of a therapy is defined as the small-
est treatment effect that would result in a change in patient management,
given its costs and inconveniences (Jaeschke,Singer,& Guyatt,1989).
The future of telehomecare is promising. Emergent technologies that use
the Internet offer research opportunities to study home-based management of

chronic illnesses. Although similar to telephone-based technologies,they are
different in that they require visual and manual skills to use a computer and
adequate health literacy. As noted by Nguyen, Carrieri-Kohlman, Ranki,
Slaughter,and Stulbarg (2004),these resources may be beyond the reach of
disadvantaged individuals or those with limited reading levels. Thus, an
empirical study comparing Internet-based and telephone-based technologies
would be an important step in advancing chronic illness management.
In summary,we suggest that telehomecare,as an intervention,improves
quality of care because it provides frequent monitoring of clinical indices
that signal changes in cardiac status. The system permits the nurse to detect
changes and intervene when appropriate. In addition, the system provides
feedback to the patient, possibly facilitating self-management behaviors,
such as taking additional diuretics or decreasing fluid intake, that amelio-
rate clinical symptoms before a crisis.
Our results will add to the growing body of literature that will inform
and guide managers and policymakers who are responsible for integrating
telehomecare into chronic disease protocols,funding health care programs,
and creating policies that encourage the use of technology to support health
care services. This information is critical for moving telehomecare from its
current limited use to becoming an integral component of the nation’s
health care delivery system.
