Study Objectives: First-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway pressure (PAP). Al-
though PAP is a highly efficacious treatment, adherence to PAP is still a substantial clinical problem. The objective of this study was to determine
whether PAP adherence can be improved with a telemedicine monitoring system.
Design: A nonblinded, single-center, randomized controlled trial that compared standard PAP treatment versus PAP treatment and a telemedicine
monitoring system
Setting: University sleep disorders program in British Columbia, Canada
Patients: Adult patients (≥ 19 yr of age) with moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 events/hr determined by polysomnog-
raphy) prescribed PAP
Interventions: Patients were randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating PAP machine or an autotitrating PAP machine that trans-
mitted physiologic information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that could be reviewed. If problems were identified from
information from the website, the patient was contacted by telephone as necessary.
Measurements: PAP adherence after 3 mo, subjective sleep quality, and side effects
Results: Seventy-five patients were enrolled; 39 were randomized to telemedicine and 36 to standard care. The mean age ± standard deviation
(SD) was 53.5 ± 11.2 yr, mean AHI was 41.6 ± 22.1 events/hr, and 80% of patients were male. After 3 mo, mean PAP adherence was significantly
greater in the telemedicine arm (191 min per day) versus the standard arm (105 min per day; mean difference = 87 min, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 25-148 min, P = 0.006, unpaired t test). On days when PAP was used, mean adherence was 321 min in the telemedicine arm and 207 min in
the standard arm (difference = 113 min, 95% CI: 62-164 min, P < 0.0001). Significant independent predictors of adherence included age, baseline
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and use of telemedicine. On average, an additional 67 min of technician time was spent on patients in the tele-
medicine arm compared with the standard arm (P = 0.0001).
Conclusions: PAP adherence can be improved with the use of a web-based telemedicine system at the initiation of treatment.

DISCUSSION
Figure 2—CPAP usage. In our single-center, randomized controlled trial, telemedi-
cine monitoring improved PAP adherence at 3 mo in patients
with moderate to severe OSA.
Telemedicine has been used in previous studies to promote
and reinforce CPAP therapy; the results have been mixed. Tay-
lor and colleagues randomized 114 patients to either a telehealth
(intervention) arm or traditional care.11 In the intervention arm,
a cognitive behavioral intervention was applied. Questions re-
lated to CPAP use and quality of sleep were sent to patients
electronically. The patients’ responses were monitored by a
sleep medicine practitioner, and the patient telephoned if neces-
sary. Adherence was not significantly different between the tra-
ditional and intervention groups (4.22 versus 4.29 hr per night;
P = 0.87). Failure to show benefit may have been due to diffi-
culties in contacting patients (sometimes delayed several days).
Furthermore, the intervention only provided self-reported data
to the healthcare provider; objective compliance and detailed
physiologic information (as was used in our study) may have
been more effective.
In a relatively small study, Smith and colleagues random-
ized 19 patients who were nonadherent with CPAP for 3 mo
to either a telemedicine intervention or placebo.12 Both groups
were scheduled for telehealth sessions with a nurse (14 30-min
sessions over 12 wk) using a video teleconferencing system in
the patient’s home. The intervention group received specific
advice about CPAP, whereas the placebo group had advice fo-
cused on a neutral health topic (i.e., vitamins). Although the
numbers of patients were small, by the end of the study there
was a significantly greater rate of adherence (90% versus 44%,
P = 0.033) in the intervention group compared with the placebo
group. In a small study by DeMolles et al., a computer tele-
phone system in addition to usual care was used in 15 patients
and compared to usual care only in another 15 patients.13 The
group using the telehealth system had better CPAP adherence
by the end of the study that trended to significance (4.4 versus
