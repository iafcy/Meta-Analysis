ABSTRACT
Background. Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming
increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their
health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and
consumers–some of which have been shown to lead to improved health
management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have
been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide
study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. Methods. We
conductedaprospectiverandomizedcontrolledtrialofadultswhohadsubmitteda
2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac
arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that
corresponded to their condition(s) (hypertension: Withings Blood Pressure

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac arrhythmias are chronic diseases with a
significant health burden. The high prevalence and well-characterized complications of
theseconditionsresultinnegativeimpactstoqualityoflife,morbidity,andmortality.Vast
medical,scientific,andengineeringresourceshavebeendevotedineffortstofindwaysto
improve diagnosis, treatment, management, and prevention, including advances in
diagnostictechnology(Willitsetal.,2014;Zhangetal.,2014;NationalInstituteforHealth
and Care Excellence, 2015), dissemination of identifiable risk factors (Wilson et al., 1998;
Chobanian et al., 2003; American Diabetes Association, 2014), and development of
pharmaceuticals (The ALLHAT Officers and Coordinators for the ALLHAT Collaborative
Research Group, 2000; The ALLHAT Officers, 2002; Uzu et al., 2005; Ernst et al., 2006).
Nevertheless, the continued maintenance of these efforts and the costs associated with
directpatientcareofindividualswiththeseconditionsremainsasizablefractionofhealth
care costs (Kim et al., 2011; Davis, 2013; Yang et al., 2013).
Despite these efforts, the management of these conditions remains challenging
(Hansen et al., 2005). Patient engagement, medication adherence, and adherence to
treatment strategies is variable and often suspect (Guyatt et al., 1986; Hansen et al.,
2005). Furthermore, poor communication between patients and their health care
providers can accentuate these issues. The end result is often a major clinical
decompensation event that could have been largely preventable. In addition to these
clinicalconsequences,thesechallengesalsoresultineconomicconsequencessuchashigh
utilization of inpatient resources and emergency departments, as well as readmissions
(Sander & Giles, 2011). One would surmise that better, more informed management of
disease would lead to better long-term health outcomes and thereby lower health care
resource utilization.
Understanding both this problem of day-to-day poor health care management and
ubiquity of smartphones and other mobile computing platforms in our daily lives,
numerous device manufacturers have developed biomedical sensors designed for patient
consumers which measure meaningful physiologic metrics (National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2015). These sensors often utilize a smartphone to display
information,whilesomecanemploytheinternetnetworkconnectivityofthesmartphone

appropriately using such devices can monitor their condition in their own real world
setting–potentiallymakingmanagementofdiseasemorepersonalizedandmoreengaging.
Blossetal.(2016),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.1554 2/16
This data may provide individuals with early recognition of disease symptoms and
consequences of behaviors, which can allow patients and providers to make proactive
healthcaredecisions,therebyleadingtoimprovedhealthoutcomesandpotentiallyreduce
health care utilization. However, there is potential that such monitoring may lead to a
short-term increase in health care resource utilization even if appropriate, or over-
utilization while patients are learning to recognize which readings constitute normal
variation and which readings indicate a health issue requiring medical attention.
Inlargepart,thejuryisstilloutifchronicdiseasemonitoringusingmobilehealthand
digitalmedicinetechnologywill,onitsown,improvehealthoutcomes(Steinhubl,Muse&
Topol, 2013; Steinhubl, Muse & Topol, 2015). Many previous studies have shown
improvements, but many others have shown none (Free et al., 2013a; Free et al., 2013b;
Hamineetal.,2015;Karhulaetal.,2015).Whetherornotapatienthasimprovedhealthas
a result such monitoring likely depends on the behavior of the individual and the
technology itself. Motivated individuals using an informative device which captures
actionable data are likely to see improvements, while unmotivated individuals using
devices which capture meaningless or nonactionable information will see no benefit.
What has yet to be fully explored is how such monitoring will impact health care
utilizationifdigitalmedicinetechnologybecomesembracedbythemedicalestablishment
in the face of an increasingly informed, technology-embracing patient population
(Boeldt et al., 2015).
In light of this, we conducted a prospective, randomized-controlled trial designed to
assess the impact of mobile health monitoring on short-term health care utilization in
individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or arrhythmia. The intervention consisted of a
comprehensive, integrated monitoring system that included wireless medical devices
designed to be used with a smartphone, a smartphone with appropriate monitoring
applications, a web-based care management portal and iOS-based mobile application
where patients could access their data, and a staff of nurses and technicians available for
assistance.Giventhepotentialforbothshort-termandlong-termimpactsonhealthcare

to standard disease management practices. We also examined how this intervention
influenced health self-management. We conducted this mobile health management
strategy on 160 employees and dependents from a large health care system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study design
The research design was a prospective, simple randomized controlled, two-group, pre-
post intervention trial. Of 21,691 individuals insured by Scripps Health (employees and
dependents) and who submitted at least one claim in 2012, 3,998 individuals age 18 or
overwhohadbilledaclaimwithacurrentproceduralterminology(CPT)coderelatedto
hypertension, insulin-dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes, and/or with
arrhythmia were identified and, if eligible, offered study participation. No stratification
with respect to condition was employed. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are
included in Supplemental Methods. The study period was six months and the trial took
Blossetal.(2016),PeerJ,DOI10.7717/peerj.1554 3/16
place between July 2013 and December 2014. The study was approved by the Scripps
Institutional Review Board (approval # IRB-12-6019).
Study recruitment
The 3,998 eligible individuals were ranked according to the amount of their 2012 health
insurance claims billed for the three study conditions. Recruitment proceeded in blocks
starting with individuals in the highest 25% in terms of dollar amount, then the highest
50% and so on. For each block of individuals, a letter was sent describing the trial and
diseasemanagementprogram.Withintwotofourweeks,theletterwasfollowedupwitha
telephone call made by a HealthComp nursing staff member in which the study was
explained.HealthCompisthethirdpartyadministratorforScrippsHealth.Amaximum

corresponded to their condition(s): a Withings Blood Pressure Monitor (hypertension),
Sanofi iGBStar Blood Glucose Meter (diabetes), or AliveCor Mobile ECG (arrhythmia).
As part of the intervention, participants were also supplied with an online account to
HealthyCirclesTM. HealthyCircles is a Qualcomm Life health care coordination and
managementplatformwithanintegratedsuiteofmanagementandconsumerportalsthat
can deliver chronicdisease education and connect users to their families, caregivers, and
healthcareprofessionals.Aspartofthestudy,HealthCompnursingstaffhadaccesstothe

wirelessly uploaded to the patient’s HealthyCircles account and made available to the
HealthComp nurses as well as the patient via the study phone or a computer. Example
displays are included in Figs. S1–S3. Also included in the management platform were
reminders for monitoring, information about the participant’s disease condition, and
general health behavior recommendations. Participants randomized to the intervention
groupweretrainedonhowtousetheirphone,theHealthyCirclesmobileapplicationsand

randomized to the control arm, were enrolled in the HealthComp disease management
program,whichinvolvedoutreachbyHealthCompnursingstaffforpurposesofrelaying

chronic disease management. In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings
wererecordedatbaselineandfollow-uponindividualswithhypertension,whereasblood
glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were recorded on diabetics. Participants were also
provided with a contact email and phone number they could use to reach a study staff
member for technical and other study support.
Participants in the monitoring group were asked to take readings as follows:
hypertension: twice per day, three days per week, first one in the morning; insulin-
dependent diabetes: three times per day, once before each meal, and once before bed
every day; non-insulin dependent diabetes: once per day before meal, three times per
week; and arrhythmia: when symptomatic (Table S4). If their monitoring fell below the
leveldefinedinthe“PoorCompliance”range,theHealthCompnursewouldsendasecure
email through the HealthyCircles message center reminding them of the monitoring
schedule. They were also asked some compliance-related questions and provided with
strategies for getting back on schedule with the program. If the participant’s physician
recommended a monitoring schedule that was more frequent than that required for the
study, participants were encouraged to follow their physician’s instructions. Also, if
participants experienced other symptoms, for example hypertension: visual changes,
“bounding” pulse, chest discomfort, nausea; diabetes: fatigue, visual changes,
pre-syncopal symptoms, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting; arrhythmia: chest discomfort,
palpitations, rapid heart rate, feeling of “skipped beats,” dyspnea, nausea, pre-syncopal
symptoms they were recommended to take additional measurements. Individuals
were instructed on how to navigate the online disease management program at

utilization as measured by health insurance claims and visits to the hospital during the
study period (details below). Secondary outcomes were health self-management as
indicatedbyvalidatedmeasuresofhealthlocusofcontrol(Wallston,Stein&Smith,1994),
health self-efficacy (Lorig et al., 1989), and patient activation (Hibbard et al., 2005).
Health insurance claims
All health insurance claims from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 were
collected on each study participant. For each individual, the total claims, condition-
specific claims, pharmaceutical claims amounts (all in dollars) were calculated.

Health self-management
Informationonhealthself-managementwascollectedthroughthebaselineandfollow-up
survey. The outcomes of interest were: 1) the four subscales of health locus of control
(Internal, Chance, Doctor, Others) as assessed by the Form C of the Multidimensional
HealthLocusofControl(MHLC)18-itemscale(Wallston,Stein&Smith,1994);2)health
self-efficacyasassessedbytheStanfordPatientEducationResearchCenter(PERC)6-item
scale (Lorig et al., 1989); and 3) patient activation using the Patient Activation Measure
13-item measure (Hibbard et al., 2005). Health locus of control measures an individual’s
belief that his or her health is dependent on factors within his or her control; health
self-efficacy measures an individual’sconfidence managing hisor herhealth; and patient
activation measures an individual’s skills and knowledge in managing his or her
own health.

association statistics. Equivalencetesting was performed usingthe twoone-sided testfor
equivalence using a magnitude of region of similarity equal to half a standard deviation
for each outcome. The study was designed to be powered (a priori) to detect a one
office visit difference between the control and monitoring arm (assuming a standard
deviation of two office visits).
RESULTS
Participant demographics and information
Study participantdemographicsare presentedin Table 1. Participants in the control and
monitoring groups were roughly equivalent with respect to common demographics and
disease, which is consistent with the randomization process. A total of 89 had only
hypertension, 9 non-insulin dependent diabetes, 6 arrhythmia, 5 insulin-dependent
diabetes, and 51 with more than one of these conditions. The study enrollment flow
chartis presentedin Fig.S7.Ofthe160individualsenrolledin thestudy,130completed
both the baseline and follow-up assessments (n = 65 control, n = 65 monitoring;
p = 0.14). Using Google Analytics we observed a total of 3,670 sessions (after quality
control filtering) to the HealthyCircles online disease management program over
the course of the study (Fig. S8), with 7.17 page visits per session, and average
session durationof11minutesand18seconds.GoogleAnalyticsdoes notprovideeasily
accessible individual user website traffic data. We assessed weekly compliance of the
intervention in the monitoring group based on device usage (e.g., an individual
with hypertension would be compliant in a given week if they used the device
at least six times that week). We observed compliance rates were largely uniform
(mean = 50%), with 66% of individuals deemed compliant at least one-third
of the weeks.
Health insurance claims

differed statistically between conditions.
We did not observe any differences in health insurance claims between control and
monitoring groups during the 6 months of study enrollment (Table S6). This trend also
persisted when we accounted for baseline claims (Table 2). The average total amount of
health insurance claims in the monitoring group was $6,026 while the average amount
in the control group was $5,596 (p = 0.62). We note these averages are consistent with
average total amount in health insurance claims across the entire sampling frame
(mean = $5,305), indicating that health insurance claims in the monitoring group were
notgrosslydifferentfromtheaveragepatient(i.e.,individualsnotenrolledinthestudy).

We also did not observe any differences between the groups with respect to office visits
(p = 0.46), inpatient stays (p = 0.82), emergency room visits (p = 0.06), or pharmacy
claims (p = 0.60). The total health insurance claims amount during enrollment also did
not differ by condition (p = 0.50), and we similarly observed no differences in claims
specific to each condition or multiple conditions (Table S6).
Alternatively, we examined the differences in health care utilization using an
equivalence testing approach. Using a magnitude of region of similarity equal to half a
standarddeviationforeachoutcome,ingeneralwediscoveredthathealthcareutilization
was roughly equivalent between groups (Table 2). We discovered that monitoring and
control groups were roughly equal with respect to total health insurance claims dollars

Among the 138 individuals who enrolled in the study with a prior indication of
hypertension, we obtained both baseline and follow-up systolic and diastolic blood
pressure readings on 112 participants (n = 61 monitoring; n = 61 control). The average
systolic blood pressure did not differ between baseline and end-of-study in the
monitoring group (p = 0.32), control group (p = 0.12), or between groups (p = 0.56).
However, the average diastolic blood pressure dropped 3.6 mmHg in the monitoring
group (p = 0.035) and 6.1 mmHg in the control group (p= 0.0036); though again there
was no difference between groups (p = 0.35). Likewise, among the 47 individuals who
enrolled in the study with a prior indication of diabetes, we obtained hemoglobin A1c
levels on 31 participants at both time points. However, hemoglobin A1c levels did
not differ between baseline and the end-of-study within each group or between groups
(p = 0.98).

DISCUSSION
Our study constitutes a major advancement over existing studies that have examined
mobile health technologies by virtue of its design features. First we deployed a gold-
standardprospective,randomizeddesignwithaninterventionthatincludedmultiplekey
components relevant for management of three chronic conditions with high morbidity
and mortality. This intervention included the use of three state-of-the-field wireless
smartphone-enabled remote monitoring medical devices. Furthermore, data from the
devices was aggregated using the Qualcomm Life cloud-to-cloud data integration
capability. Data visualizationwas then provided to study participants through an online
carecoordinationapplicationwhereparticipantscouldviewtheirdevicereadingsthrough
webandmobilemediumsthroughoutthecourseoftheinterventionperiod.Thus,wefeel
that compared to previous studies in the mobile health space, our intervention more
closely mirrors a future in which chronic disease monitoring using mobile biomedical
sensors is embraced by the health care community. This requires a system that brings
together device manufacturers, mobile health telecommunication expertise, health care
providers, and employee wellness programs–all of which we utilized in the development
and implementation our mobile health monitoring intervention.
Weenrolled160studyparticipantsinthestudy,achievinglowdrop-outparticularlyin
the monitoring group where 87% of participants completed all aspects of the study.
We also had relatively good compliance among individuals in the monitoring group.
Hypertensivestudyparticipantsonaveragerecordedonebloodpressuremeasurementper
day, roughly what we requested (twice per day, three days per week; 6 total per week).
In total, individuals in the monitoring group provided over 9,000 blood pressure, blood
glucose,andelectrocardiogramreadingswhichwewillarenowexaminingforinteresting
trends in the entirety of data we collected. Interestingly, these individuals used the
HealthyCirclesonlinediseasemanagementprogramsomewhatsparingly(3,670usesover
six months for 65 study participants). Instead, many users preferred the mobile tracking
applications. Future research could explore different means of providing data back to
individuals monitoring their condition.
Overall we found little in terms of differences in health insurance claims between
individuals enrolled in the control and monitoring arm. This is significant because we
were powered to detect a moderate difference–approximately a doubling of health
insuranceclaimsdollars.Thissuggeststhatwhiletheremaybesmallshort-termincreases
inhealthcareutilizationasaresultofmobilehealthmonitoring,thereislikelynotamajor
effect. Our equivalence testing results reiterated this finding. We also expect that any
short-term effect would decrease over time as a user’s comfort with monitoring and
understanding of their data improves. Importantly, our six month study period fails to
capture the potential competing long-term decrease in health care utilization that may
occur as a result of monitoring leading to improved health management and health
outcomes. Taken collectively, we feel any apprehension directed at consumer mobile
health monitoring with respect to over-utilization of health care resources should
be tempered.

Meanwhile, we found some evidence of improved health self-management in
individuals who received the intervention, which was characterized by a decrease in the
propensitytoviewhealthstatusasduetochancefactors.Onepossibleexplanationisthat
this shift was due to the ability to remotely, and at will, track personal biometric indices
importantforone’scondition.Anotherexplanationisthattheactualinformationgleaned
from the readings prompted the users to consider how they might make behavioral
changes that would impact those metrics. Clarifying this mechanism of action could
enablethedevelopmentoffuturedigitalmedicineinterventionsthatarerefinedinsucha
way as to optimally impact health locus of control.
We encountered several challenges executing this project as a result of its complexity.
Oneparticularchallengewaseffectivelydealingwiththeinvolvementofandcollaboration
betweenmultipleentities,includingindustry,research,andclinicalpartnersinthedigital
medicine space. Necessary legal agreements, data pipelines, and working arrangements
wererequired to facilitate the study initiation and execution.In total,thestudy involved
over five different Scripps departments, ten different companies, development and
execution of at least eight different contracts or legal agreements, five different terms of
use that a study participant could potentially have to agree to, and creation of six
participant instruction or “set-up” guides. As this demonstrates, the conduct and
deployment of digital medicine trials can present unique challenges that future work in
this area could help address. We also encountered technological issues. Out of 75
individuals enrolled in the monitoring group, 21 (28%) experienced issues that required
the research team to log at least one help desk ticket due to technical issues with the
participant’s phone, device(s), or connection to the online portal. Furthermore,
10 of these individuals had more than one help desk ticket submitted and at least
20 individuals had to have either the iPhone and/or the device replaced altogether.
Technical issues are, of course, inevitable when pursuing innovative interventions that
leveragenewtechnologies.However,inorderforsuchinterventionstoeffectivelyprovide
benefit to the user they have to be seamless in order to minimize participant fatigue.
Exposing study participants to such issues has the potential to create biases in the study
results. Though we did not observed a difference in drop-out rate between individuals
who submitted a help desk ticket and those that did not (p = 0.27), minimizing
technological issues should be an important consideration in the design of future digital
medicine trials.
In conclusion, we have presented the first prospective randomized trial of a digital
medicineinterventionwithmultiplesmartphone-enabledbiosensors,dataaggregatedand
visualized through an online connected health platform, deployed with three high
morbidity and mortality chronic diseases examining health care utilization. Our results
suggest there is little to no short-term increase in health care utilization as a result of
participation in a comprehensive mobile health monitoring care coordination platform.
Meanwhile, we did see some improvement in health self-management. Future work
should explore the potential reduction in long-term health care utilization as a result of
potentially improved health management due to mobile health monitoring.
