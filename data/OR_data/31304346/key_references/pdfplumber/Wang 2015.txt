FOLLOW-UP ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS
ON THE FITBIT ONE
AND SMS PA PROMPTS
At follow-up, a greater proportion of com-
parison (versus intervention) participants re-
ported that, on a typical day, they viewed their
Fitbit trackers ‘‘Very Often’’ or ‘‘Often’’ for steps
(90% versus 71%) and distance (70% versus
55%). Those who self-reported that they fre-
quentlyviewedtheirtrackerwereassociatedwith
greaterincreasesinPA(evenmoresocompared
with the Web site). In the intervention group,
approximatelyhalfindicatedthatthethreedaily
textmessageswere‘‘TooMany.’’Additionally,in
anopen-endedquestionaboutthetext-messaging
intervention,acommonresponseamongpartici-
pants was that they had stopped reading them
altogether when they noticed that the messages
were ‘‘automated.’’ Other notable phrases were
that the messages were ‘‘inconvenient,’’ ‘‘annoy-
ing,’’and‘‘impersonal.’’
