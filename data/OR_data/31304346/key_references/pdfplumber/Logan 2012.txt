mmHg (SD; P(cid:3)0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.1(cid:2)2.3 mmHg (SE; P(cid:3)0.005). Furthermore,
51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of (cid:3)130/80 mmHg compared with 31% of
control subjects (P(cid:3)0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive
medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened
