Aims: To investigate the feasibility, acceptance and potential effectiveness of delivering a
telecare service on the health outcomes and hospital service utilization of community-
dwelling patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Methods: Eligible participants were older people, with moderate or severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and who had been admitted to hospital at least once for exacerba-
tion during the previous year. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention
or control group. Participants in the intervention group received a telecare device kit and
they were asked to monitor their oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiration rate using
the device and to transmit the data to an online network platform. A medication and
purse-lip breathing reminder with a feedback function is also provided in the device kit.
A community nurse monitors changes in the physiological parameters and takes imme-
diate action to address the patients’ needs. Participants in the control group received
no other extra care. Study outcomes include user satisfaction, health-related quality of
life, pulmonary function, hospital re-admission and use of emergency room services.

Results: Twenty-two participants in the intervention group and 18 in the control group were
included in the analysis. The mean age of all 40 participants was 72.93 years. Overall, the
participants in the intervention group expressed satisfaction with the telecare service. Some
patients reported difficulty in reading the screen of the mobile phone and manipulating the
tiny key-in buttons. No significant differences were found between the two time points
(baseline and post-test period) with regard to health-related quality of life. No significant
differences in pulmonary function and in the number of emergency department visits and
hospital re-admissions between the study groups were found.
Conclusion: The high level of user satisfaction indicated the feasibility of conducting a large-
scale randomized control trial to evaluate the effects of a telecare service on health outcomes
of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

1. Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a broad
term that covers several lung conditions, including chronic
bronchitis and emphysema, and is characterized by airflow
limitation that is not fully reversible [1]. The World Health
Organization has estimated that COPD will become the third
leading cause of death globally by 2020 [2]. Although the
exact prevalence of the disease in Hong Kong is not known,
a local study suggested that about 9% of people over the age
of 70 years suffer from COPD [3]. This group of older people
with COPD usually have poor health outcomes and a high
rate of health services use. According to an epidemiologi-
cal report, the 1-year hospital re-admission rate for COPD
was 2.2 episodes, whereas the 1-year mortality rate was 14%
[4]. Although there is currently no cure for COPD, appropri-
ate self-care and symptom management techniques, such as
adherence to medication, purse-lip breathing, and prompt
medical care for any exacerbations are crucial to improve the
respiratory status and health-related quality of life of these
patients [5]. Such interventions were also found to be effective
in reducing hospital admissions among patients with COPD
[6].
The traditional health service delivery model in Hong Kong
is generally facility-bound, i.e., patients have to go to a doctor’s
clinic or a hospital to receive care. In many instances, patients
are only treated in the later stages of acute manifestations,
which results in worse health outcomes and an increased
need for hospitalization and emergency room visits. With
an increase in aging populations, a trend to adopt proactive
self-care has been seen worldwide [7]. There is accumulating
evidence to suggest that telecare services play a significant
role in the improvement of patients’ self-care and manage-
ment of chronic illnesses [8,9]. A recent systematic review of
nine studies on home telehealth (home telemonitoring and
telephone support) for COPD patients indicated that it was
effective in reducing the use of medical services [10]. Wireless
and Internet-connected devices enable healthcare providers
to monitor outpatients continuously by receiving and pro-
cessing critical health information. As health monitoring and
prompt initiation of optimal treatment of exacerbations are
the critical components in successful management of COPD,
telecare may be a highly relevant model for this group of
patients. However, this model has not been tested in older
people with COPD in the healthcare system in Hong
A
Kong.
feasibility study was conducted to investigate the accep-
tance and potential effectiveness of delivering a telecare
service, which uses a combination of modern broadband com-
munication infrastructure, databases and software for critical
decision analysis and support, on the health outcomes and
hospital service utilization of COPD patients living in the
community (excluding those living in nursing homes). The
objectives were: (1) to examine user satisfaction with the tele-
care service and (2) to examine the effects of the telecare
service on health-related quality of life (HRQL), lung function,
and hospital service utilization in older people with COPD.
2. Study context
2.1. Organizational setting
Potentially eligible patients were recruited at a major acute
general hospital with over 1400 beds during their follow-up
clinic visits in 2010. COPD patients discharged from the hos-
pital received follow-up care in a specialist outpatient clinic
every 8–16 weeks. Community nurses offer education on self-
care management to patients in their own homes.
2.2. System details
2.2.1. The ASTRI telecare system (ATS)
The ATS is a means of providing healthcare to patients
through a combination of a modern broadband communica-
tions infrastructure, including Internet and wireless systems,
and databases and software for critical decision analysis and
support. The system comprises a device kit, an online net-
work platform, a call center and a networking system. The
device kit includes a specially designed mobile phone, a res-
piratory rate sensor, and a pulse oximeter (Fig. 1). Using this
set of devices, patients can measure their oxygen saturation,
pulse rate and respiration rate at home. The results are dis-
played on the mobile phone and sent to the patients’ personal
health database on a remote online server. A medication and
purse-lip breathing reminder with a feedback function is also
provided in the device kit. The patients can contact emergency
services (999 police call) for urgent assistance by pressing the
‘Confirm’ key on the mobile phone. A platform and a server
have been created, in which the personal health data are mon-
itored and recorded (Fig. 2). A community nurse-led call center

was established and a community nurse monitors changes in
the physiological parameters and takes immediate action to
address the patients’ needs. The health data are transmitted
through the General Packet Radio Service to a base station
and all health data can be accessed remotely by healthcare
providers.
3. Methods
3.1. Study design and participants
This was a single-center, randomized, non-blind, parallel-
group study. Eligible participants were older people (aged
60 years and over), with moderate or severe COPD according to
the classification of the Global Initiative of Obstructive Lung
Disease [1], who had been admitted to hospital at least once
for exacerbation during the previous year. We excluded older
people who were not able to communicate, had impaired cog-
nitive function, were illiterate, had hearing problems or were
unable to operate the telecare device. The final participants
were randomly assigned to the intervention or control

group.
Study flow
3.2.1. Ethical considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from the Clinical Research
Ethics Committee of the hospital. A research nurse
identified eligible patients from the clinical management
system of the hospital and these were invited to the specialist
outpatient clinic for baseline data collection. Prior to data
collection, eligible patients were given an information sheet
on the purpose and nature of the study, and their written con-
sent was obtained. The patients were informed of their right
to refuse to participate at any time without giving reasons
and that refusing to participate would have no impact on the
care they received from the hospital services. Patients who
consented to participate were randomized to receive telecare
or usual care following a simple randomization procedure
(drawing a slip of paper with the group assignment marked
on the slip). Pre- and post-test data were collected by research
assistants who were not involved in the intervention.
3.3. Interventions
The community nurse conducted home visits to all partici-
pants in both groups and offered education on self-care and
i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f m e d i c a l i n f o r m a t i c s 8 1 ( 2 0 1 2 ) 674–682 677
symptom management techniques which included use of
medication, purse-lip breathing, modification of lifestyle, and
exercise. In addition, participants in the intervention group
received the device kit. They were asked to monitor their oxy-
gen saturation, pulse rate and respiration rate using the device
three times a day from Monday to Friday and to transmit
the data to the online network platform. Due to budget con-
straints, no evening and weekend services were provided in
this feasibility study. The community nurse who monitored
the telecare system at home instructed the participants on
the use of the device for self-monitoring during the home
visit through demonstration and return demonstration. Par-
ticipants in the control group received no other extra care or
intervention.
3.4. Study outcomes
To evaluate the feasibility of the telecare service, a number
of study outcomes were measured at baseline and 2 months
after the start of the study, as outlined below. Two months was
chosen as the follow-up period as most patients would receive
follow-up care in the specialist outpatient clinic every 8 weeks.
Positive short-term clinical outcomes and high level of user
satisfaction were also found in a study of a telemedicine
program (home telemonitoring and nurse visit) for recently
discharged older patients delivered over a 2-month period [11].
3.4.1. User satisfaction
Patient satisfaction was measured by a self-developed 10-item
user satisfaction questionnaire, which measures the patients’
satisfaction with using the telecare service in terms of its use-
fulness, acceptability, and ease of use, their level of confidence
in using the telecare device, and their satisfaction with the
support from the community nurse in charge of the telecare
service. Each item is rated on a ‘1–5’ Likert scale, in which a
higher score indicates a higher level of satisfaction. The User
Satisfaction Questionnaire also includes three open-ended
questions to identify the patients’ perception of the telecare
system. Post-test data on user satisfaction were collected from
the intervention group 2 months after the start of the study.
3.4.2. Health-related quality of life (HRQL)
HRQL was measured using the Chinese version of the Chronic
Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), which is a 20-item tool to
measure disease-specific HRQL in patients with chronic res-
piratory disease [12]. The scale consists of four subscales that
measure dyspnea (five items), fatigue (four items), emotional
function (seven items), and mastery (four items). Each item
is rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The overall CRQ score can
range from 7 to 28; a higher score indicates better disease-
specific quality of life. The psychometric properties of the
Chinese version of CRQ have been established; construct- and
criterion-related validities were supported by significant cor-
relations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and
the New York Heart Association classification, respectively
[13]. High internal consistency and a 2-week test-retest relia-
bility were reflected by a Cronbach’s ˛ of 0.95 and an intra-class
correlation coefficient of 0.75, respectively. Both groups com-
pleted pre-test and post-test for
3.4.3.
HRQL.
Pulmonary function
The pulmonary function of COPD patients was measured by
the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the FEV1/forced
vital capacity (FVC) ratio. The FEV1 refers to the great-
est volume of air that can be breathed out in the first
second of a deep breath. The FVC is the greatest volume of
air that can be breathed out in a whole deep breath [1]. Nor-
mally, at least 70% of the FVC comes out in the first second
(i.e., the FEV1/FVC ratio is >70%); a lower value indicates poorer
pulmonary function and more severe COPD. In this study, the
Spirobank G was used to measure both FEV1 and FVC. Pul-
monary function tests were performed on patients in both
groups at baseline and after 2 months.
3.4.4. Hospital re-admission and use of emergency room
services
The number of hospital re-admissions and emergency room
service utilization during the 2-month evaluation period were
retrieved from the hospital’s clinical management system for
both groups.
3.5. Data analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, frequencies
and percentages) were used to examine the central tendency
and distribution of the patients’ demographic and clinical data
and outcome measures. Independent t-tests and chi-square
tests were used to examine the equivalence of the demo-
graphic and clinical data and baseline outcome measures
between the intervention and control groups. The depen-
dent variables including CRQ dimensions and FEV1/FVC were
examined for normality. Skewness, kurtosis and inspection
of the normal Q–Q plot showed that these data satisfied the
requirements of normality. Two-way repeated-measure analy-
sis of variance was used to examine any difference in the study
outcomes between the intervention and control groups over
the evaluation period. SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used, and the level of significance was set at 0.05.
4. Results
4.1. Participant flow
A total of 603 COPD patients had been admitted to the study
hospital at least once for exacerbation during the previous
year. Seventy-one patients with moderate, severe or very
severe COPD were assessed for eligibility. Nine were not eli-
gible due to illiteracy (N = 3), hearing problems (N = 2), inability
to operate the telecare device (N = 3), or need to travel out-
side Hong Kong during the study period (N = 1). Nine did not
give their consent. Fifty-three patients underwent random-
ization, and 30 were assigned to the intervention group. Eight
withdrew before the intervention and 22 underwent it. Two
patients withdrew due to worsening physical condition. Two
patients withdrew due to financial reasons (no extra money
to attend the follow up and not able to afford the additional
cost of recharging the batteries of the device every other day).
Two patients refused to use the belt to measure their respira-
tion rate in cold weather. One refused further participation as

he commented that the device was difficult to carry around
at work. Another patient found participation too demand-
ing with regard to the frequency of telemonitoring per day.
Twenty-three were assigned to the control group. Of 62 poten-
tial patients approached, 45 agreed to participate, a response
rate of 72.6%. During the study, four patients in the control
group were lost to follow-up. One patient in the control group
was admitted to hospital during the post-test data collection.
Twenty-two participants in the intervention group and 18 in
the control group were included in the analysis. No patients
were excluded from the analysis.
4.2. Recruitment
Eligible participants were recruited and were invited to visit
the clinic at the time of randomization (baseline) and for the
post-test examination. The mean duration of the intervention
was 54.36 days; the mean duration of follow-up was 65.18 days
for the intervention group and 68.44 days for the control group.
4.3. Baseline data
4.3.1. Demographic and clinical findings
The mean age of all 40 participants in the final sample was
72.93 years (SD, 6.04), with a minimum age of 60 and maxi-
mum age of 83 years. The majority were male (97.5%), married
(82.5%), and had received primary (6 years of primary educa-
tion, usually starting at age six) or less than primary school
education (85.0%). The Eighty-five percent of them were living
with families or spouses, and 15% were living alone. All were
retired, four (10%) were house- or wheelchair-bound, and 30
(75%) could climb up several flights of stairs. Their mean mini-
mental state examination score was 27.35 (SD, 1.79) and their
mean body mass index was 21.47 (SD, 4.00).
Of the participants, 25% had moderate, 32.5% had severe
and 42.5% had very severe COPD. The pulmonary function
tests measured in the laboratory within the last year showed
a mean FEV1 (% predicted) of 37.8% (SD, 14.43%). The mean
FEV1/FVC ratio was 41.63%, within a range of 22–69%. The
number of hospital re-admissions for COPD exacerbation over
the past year ranged from one to 10 (mean, 2.62; SD, 1.93). The
average length of stay in hospital due to COPD exacerbation
over the past year was 7.84 (SD, 8.55) days, with a range of
2–47 days. The frequencies and frequency distributions of the
baseline demographic and clinical information for each group
are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
4.3.2. Pulmonary function and quality of life of
participants at baseline
The mean and SDs for FEV1(% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio (%)
as measured by Spirobank G, and HRQL measured by the CRQ
assessed after randomization are presented in Table 3.
The activities that caused shortness of breath in most par-
ticipants with COPD at baseline include: walking, performing
activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, showering, eating or
dressing), participating in social activities, and performing
chores (e.g., housework, shopping for
Table
groceries).

4.3.4. Satisfaction with telecare services: quantitative
findings
Twenty participants (91%) indicated that they were satisfied
with the telecare service. Over 60% of participants were satis-
fied with the medication prompt and preferred telecare service
to monitor their respiratory condition at home. All partici-
pants (100%) were satisfied with the support from the nurse
offering the telecare service, and most (86.3%) commented
that the explanation on the use of telecare equipment was
adequate. Half of the participants indicated that automated
health care advice was necessary, and 54.5% indicated that
the telecare service was useful to help manage their disease
at home. The negative items of the questionnaire were reverse
scored and all items had a mean score above 3. A total user sat-
isfaction score was calculated from total scores and ranged
from 28 to 42 (mean = 35.86; SD = 4.17) (Table 4).
4.3.5. Satisfaction with telecare service: qualitative
findings
4.3.5.1. Overall comments. Open-ended comments on the
telecare service were also invited. Overall, the participants
expressed satisfaction with the telecare service because it
facilitated clinical monitoring of patients in their homes. They
commented that the telecare service facilitated timely
and
care
easy access to a qualified health professional, who could
assess their health status, assess the seriousness of the prob-
lem, and help them to decide on the best possible action. The
majority of participants stated that they preferred to use the
telecare device to monitor their respiratory condition at home
and would like an extension of the study period. Their pos-
itive comments included ‘I feel my health has improved. . .’,
‘I had a better understanding of my health. . .’, and ‘I want to
stay connected with the nurse for future enquires’. One par-
ticipant remarked that he was pleased to see an improvement
in his oxygen saturation level immediately after performing
the purse-lip breathing.
Negative comments included: ‘I cannot see much dif-
ference as the intervention itself is not curative. . .’ One
participant expressed anxiety while using the self-monitoring
device and stated that “I think my health is not good when the
readings go down quickly” (as shown on the pulse oximeter).
4.3.5.2. Satisfaction with the nursing service. Nine participants
commented that the nurse offering the telecare support was
helpful in terms of timely care and prompt follow-up actions.
The explanations on how to use the telecare device were clear
and thorough. The health education and advice provided by
the nurse were regarded as very useful.
4.3.5.3. Comments on the telecare device and medication
prompt. With regard to technical issues, some participants
stated that they encountered no difficulties in using the tele-
care device. Five of the participants commented that the
mobile phone provided was far too technologically advanced
for them and they did not know how to operate it when unex-
pected characters or screen displays (e.g., SMS, different layout
on screen) appeared. Some reported that the data transmis-
sion from the pulse oximeter and respiratory rate sensor to
the mobile phone were very unstable with a few failures. Some
mobile phones broke down and the nurse was required to fix
the problems.
In this study, although the majority of participants were
able to read the screen with eyeglasses, some participants
stated that the mobile phone display screen was too small and
the words were too small to read. The small touch screen also
created problems due to decreased sensation and poor control
of the finer movements of hands. Some patients required the
help from a family caregiver to transmit the data. In addition,
the push buttons of the mobile phone were very small. The
large push button used to initiate an emergency call to the
police was also too sensitive.
Quite a few participants experienced problems in using
the ‘belt’ to measure their respiratory rate. Their concerns
included: ‘It is difficult to strap the belt in the correct posi-
tion level’, ‘It makes me more short of breath. . .’, ‘The switch
button is difficult to press when it’s on my body’ and ‘I won’t be
able to finish the measurement without the help from my care-
giver’. Some participants stated that it was inconvenient to use
the belt in winter because of the cold weather and bulky win-
ter clothing. With regard to the mobile phone, pulse oximeter
and the respiration rate sensor, the participants needed to
recharge the batteries every other day. The procedure was
reported to be a complicated process that involved different
electric wires and adaptors. The power supply connection

trough was too small and confusing which made plugging it
in too difficult for older people. In addition, a long time was
needed to recharge the batteries fully and the battery life was
too short. Concerning the medication alert, some participants
stated that they remembered to take their medications and
managed their illness well, so the medication prompt was not
very helpful to them.
4.3.6. Suggestions for improvement
Some suggestions for improvement from the patients’ per-
spectives included adding a blood pressure monitor to the
multi-parameter devices, and extending the telecare service
to weekends and public holidays. Suggestions from the com-
munity nurse included adding more options and capabilities
to the ATS. These included a built-in program that analy-
ses the health parameters, customizes reports, and creates
easy-to-read charts and graphs showing the trends of oxy-
gen saturation and respiration rate. Built-in functions to print,
save and convert the results from any page would also facili-
tate patient monitoring and easy access to information.
4.3.7. Changes in pulmonary function and health-related
quality of life over time
Two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance was used to
identify any differences in the change in values of FEV1 (%
predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio (%), and dimension scores of CRQ
between the study groups across the baseline and post-test
period. No significant differences were found between the two
time points with regard to dyspnea, fatigue, emotion or mas-
tery dimensions of CRQ. Two-way repeated-measure analysis
of variance also demonstrated no significant pre-test and post-
test differences in pulmonary function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC
ratio) for either the intervention and control groups (Table 5).
4.3.8. Health service utilization and hospital readmission
Fisher’s exact tests were used to identify any significant
differences in the number of emergency department vis-
its and hospital re-admissions between the study groups
and none were observed (Table 6). The total number of
emergency/hospitalization visits due to COPD for the inter-
vention group during the study period was seven. One patient
admitted twice during the study period. Three out of these
seven admissions happened during weekend. There

patient’s respiration rate and advice on the use of bronchodila-
tor inhaler and breathing exercise was found to be helpful
in relieving their breathlessness. Only one patient visited
emergency department and subsequently admitted despite
telecare service.
4.3.9. Compliance with self-monitoring of oxygen
saturation and respiration rate regimen
On average, 79% of the participants in the intervention group
successfully transmitted their oxygen saturation data to the
ASTRI system three times a day, and 60% transmitted their
respiratory rates. About 98% of the participants successfully
transmitted their oxygen saturation data to the ASTRI system
once a day, and 83% transmitted their respiratory rates.
5. Discussion
This study was limited by the short duration of implemen-
tation and the small number of participants. No blinding of
outcome assessors may also have introduced bias. Despite
the existence of these limitations, however, the high level
of user satisfaction indicated the feasibility of conducting a
large-scale randomized control trial to evaluate the effects of
a telecare service on health outcomes of community-based
patients with COPD.

Through self-monitoring and the provision of automated
self-care prompts, the older people in this study felt able to
manage their respiratory disease at home better. As effec-
tive self-care management is a cornerstone of the successful
management of chronic diseases, this service is of great impor-
tance to COPD care. Because COPD is a long-term respiratory
disease that is associated with frequent exacerbations and
hospitalizations, it is imperative to adopt an innovative care
model to improve the health outcomes of these patients.
This was the first study to examine the effects of a telecare
service on respiratory status, symptom control, HRQL, and
the use of health services among older Chinese people with
COPD in Hong Kong. By connecting a nurse station to the
patients’ home environment, the telecare system close moni-
tors patients at home so that a nurse can intervene quickly
following the early detection of worsening symptoms. The
system simultaneously improves self-management through
the use of personalized reminders to take medication and
perform breathing exercises. Nevertheless, this study did not
demonstrate the positive effects of the telecare service on the
use of health services by COPD patients as reported in previous
studies [10,14,15]. This may be related to the short evaluation
period (2 months) used in this study, whereas other studies fol-
lowed the patients for about 6 months to 1 year. With regard
to HRQL and disease severity, although we used a more sen-
sitive disease-specific measure to capture subtle changes in
these outcomes, the findings were similar to those reported
previously, i.e., that telecare was not effective in this domain
[14,15]. In this study, we only recruited 40 participants due to
time constraints, and future studies should use a larger sam-
ple. Moreover, we only measured short-term outcomes and it
would be helpful if participants were followed up for a longer
period.
User friendliness and acceptability are top priorities in
designing telemonitoring and telecare devices [16]. COPD
mainly affects older people who are more liable to have a lower
literacy level, reduced sensory and psychomotor functions,
and a reduced activity tolerance level. In this study, some
patients reported difficulty in reading the screen of the mobile
phone and manipulating the tiny key-in buttons. Moreover,
some patients also indicated that the use of separate health
monitoring devices for oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
was rather complicated. The physical exertion associated with
putting on the chest belts to monitor respiratory rate triggered
dyspnea in a few patients, and some had difficulty in switch
this device on. With regard to the pulse oximeter, the fre-
quent need to recharge the battery also increased the patients’
energy consumption.
In conclusion, this study indicated that the telecare ser-
vice is a feasible and acceptable model to enhance the care of
community-based older Chinese people with COPD. The high
level of patient satisfaction with this service implies the need
to consider expanding its use to the management of COPD.
Improvements are needed to ensure the ease of use of the tele-
care device, such as a larger touch screen and keypad buttons.
For the monitoring device, a design with multi-monitoring
functions and power-saving characteristics could be adopted
to simplify its operation and avoid causing the patients unnec-
essary physical exertion. To help nurses to use the telecare
system, simplified charts and/or graphic diagrams could

What was known before?
• Evidence suggests that home telehealth for COPD
patients was effective in reducing the use of medical
services.
• Wireless and Internet-connected devices enable
healthcare providers to monitor outpatients contin-
uously by receiving and processing critical health
information.
What the study has added?
• This study indicated that the telecare service is a fea-
sible and acceptable model to enhance the care of
community-based older Chinese people with COPD.
• COPD mainly affects older people who are more liable
to have a lower literacy level, reduced sensory and
psychomotor functions, and a reduced activity toler-
ance level. These factors need to be taking into account
when designing telecare device to facilitate monitoring
of patients in their homes.

ized control trial is currently being planned to examine the
effects of a newly improved telecare device kit to enhance the
care of patients with COPD.
