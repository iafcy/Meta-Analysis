Abstract
Background—Walking-related disability is the most frequent reason for inpatient stroke
rehabilitation. Task-related practice is a critical component for improving patient outcomes.
Objective—To test the feasibility of providing quantitative feedback about daily walking
performance and motivating greater skills practice via remote sensing.
Methods—In this phase III randomized, single blind clinical trial, patients participated in
conventional therapies while wearing wireless sensors (tri-axial accelerometers) at both ankles.
Activity-recognition algorithms calculated the speed, distance, and duration of walking bouts.
Three times a week, therapists provided either feedback about performance on a 10-meter walk
(speed-only) or walking speed feedback plus a review of walking activity recorded by the sensors
(augmented). Primary outcomes at discharge included total daily walking time, derived from the
sensors, and a timed 15-meter walk.

Results—Sixteen rehabilitation centers in 11 countries enrolled 135 participants over 15 months.
Sensors recorded more than 1800 days of therapy, 37,000 individual walking bouts, and 2.5
million steps. No significant differences were found between the two feedback groups in daily
walking time (15.1±13.1min vs. 16.6±14.3min, p=0.54) or 15-meter walking speed (0.93±0.47m/s
vs. 0.91±0.53m/s, p=0.96). Remarkably, 30% of participants decreased their total daily walking
time over their rehabilitation stay.
Conclusions—In this first trial of remote monitoring of inpatient stroke rehabilitation,
augmented feedback beyond speed alone did not increase the time spent practicing or improve
walking outcomes. Remarkably modest time was spent walking. Wireless sensing, however,
allowed clinicians to audit skills practice and provided ground truth regarding changes in clinically
important, mobility-related activities.

INTRODUCTION
Mobility outcomes after disabling stroke are highly dependent on the intensity of
rehabilitation training and practice.1–3 Surveys using a diary or videotaping of physical and
occupational therapy sessions, however, describe modest amounts of supervised skills
practice during inpatient stroke rehabilitation.4–6 Given the sense that perhaps too little
treatment of sufficient cardiovascular intensity is provided,7 sporadic efforts have been
made to increase the type and quantity of skills practice.8–10
Past interventions to increase patient participation in therapies have been limited by the lack
of an objective, inexpensive method to continuously measure the quantity and quality of
patients’ movements, i.e., parameters that go beyond a step counter in the case of walking.
Wireless health technologies, including unobtrusive physiologic sensors and advanced
activity-recognition algorithms, offer the possibility of daily patient monitoring.11–13 When
tested for several days in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke,14 these wireless sensors
returned accurate, reliable activity summaries even for patients who walked slowly (i.e. <0.5
m/s).
The Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity (SIRRACT) trial is the first
international, multi-center trial to deploy a wireless, Internet-based remote sensing strategy
in patients disabled by stroke. It was designed as a follow-up to the multicenter Stroke
Inpatient Rehabilitation With Reinforcement of Walking Speed (SIRROWS) trial that found
that feedback about walking speed, from a timed 10-meter walk three times a week, led to
significantly higher speeds at discharge from inpatient stroke rehabilitation as compared to
no such feedback.8 For SIRRACT, investigators employed remote wireless sensing to
monitor all lower extremity movements performed by patients during the course of daily
activities. Activity summaries derived from sensor data were used to provide an augmented
feedback intervention that was compared to feedback about walking speed alone.

Our aim for this trial was to motivate patients and their therapists to engage in greater skills
practice to obtain improved walking-related outcomes. We endeavored to demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying sensors in inpatient rehabilitation centers regardless of culture,
language, or familiarity with clinical research. Finally, we anticipated using the rich data set
generated by the wireless sensors during inpatient therapy to characterize changes in a
variety of walking-related parameters.
METHODS
Study design and setting
This phase III, single blind, parallel group, randomized control trial was carried out at 12
international and 4 American inpatient rehabilitation centers. Investigators at the UCLA
Wireless Health Institute designed and managed all aspects of the trial. Since no funding
was provided to individual sites, the protocol was designed for implementation within each
site’s usual rehabilitation practices and structure. Instructions about procedures were
provided from an online manual of operations with videos (http://www.sirract.ucla.edu).
Training webinars, email responses to questions, and automated assessment reminders
enabled trial management via the Internet. All demographic information and blinded study
outcomes were entered into a secure online clinical database with separate logins and
webpage views for the treating clinicians and blinded assessors.
Selection criteria
Sites were recruited from the membership of the World Federation of NeuroRehabilitation
and the American Society of NeuroRehabilitation. Inclusion criteria included stroke of any
type with residual hemiparesis, the ability to walk 5 steps within 10 days of admission for
rehabilitation, and admission to the facility within 35 days of stroke. Exclusion criteria
included aphasia limiting the ability to follow 2-step commands and ongoing medical
disease limiting participation in physical therapy. Patients who had suffered a prior stroke
were eligible for participation if they had experienced full motor recovery.
Randomization and baseline data collection
After eligibility criteria were entered into the central database, participants were assigned to
a speed-only feedback (SF) or augmented feedback (AF) trial arm by a computer using a
concealed allocation sequence. A block randomization design was employed to achieve
equal group numbers at each study site.
Baseline demographic data including age, gender, stroke type, hemiparetic side, and NIH
Stroke Scale score were entered into the clinical database by site investigators. A blinded
observer at each location collected a stopwatch-timed 15-meter walk, the distance walked in
3 minutes, and Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) score.
Wireless sensor system
The inertial sensor system and activity-recognition algorithms were previously described
and tested for short-term reliability.14 Three sets of tri-axial accelerometers (Gulf Coast
Data Concepts, Waveland, MS) were mailed to each site’s coordinator. Therapists placed

one sensor on each ankle before participants got out of bed each morning and removed them
once they were in bed at the end of the day; sensor use during weekends was optional. A soft
snap band secured each sensor proximal to the medial malleolus, flush against the bony
tibia. Every night, sensors were plugged into a local computer to recharge while
accelerometer data were uploaded to the central server at UCLA for secure storage and
processing.
Sensor calibration and data processing
In recognition of the variations in gait speed and stand and swing symmetry that occur in
patients who need inpatient rehabilitation after stroke, we chose to generate individual
templates of each participant’s gait from a pair of standardized walks. On study entry
participants performed two stopwatch-timed 10-meter walks at self-selected casual and
safest fast walking speeds. A hybrid classifier employing dynamic time warping and Naïve
Bayes algorithms generated statistical models of each participant’s gait based on the two
walks. Repeat walks were performed and the templates updated weekly for the remainder of
each participant’s rehabilitation stay to account for expected changes in gait parameters.
New activity data that were uploaded to the central server at UCLA underwent
preprocessing followed by classification to identify periods of a participant’s daily activity
that matched his or her walking template. For this trial, a bout of walking was defined as
lasting at least 5 seconds. Bouts separated by 5 seconds or more were labeled as separate
walking episodes. After classification the system calculated gait parameters for each
identified walking bout (speed, duration), as well as for each day’s total walking activity
(number of walking bouts, average walking speed, total time spent walking, total distance,
total steps). Personalized bar graphs summarizing daily step count, average and maximum
walking speed, and distance walked were updated and made available to therapists for the
AF intervention.
Feedback intervention
Three times a week after performing a stopwatch-timed 10-meter walk at their fastest safe
walking speed, all participants received standardized verbal feedback from their therapists
similar to that used in SIRROWS. For example, “Very good! You walked that in (number
of) seconds.” Then, (a) “Keep working to improve further” or (b) “Keep up the good work
and continue to practice” or (c) “I believe you will soon be walking faster with more
practice.”
In addition to receiving immediate verbal feedback about walking speed, participants in the
AF group also reviewed the results of their summary activity graphs with the therapists.
Using a scripted statement, therapists encouraged these patients to meet or exceed their prior
activity levels. For example, (a) “You are showing some improvement” or (b) “You have
not yet increased your (walking speed, distance, steps).” Then, “Let’s see if you can make
further improvements today.”

Study outcomes
Primary outcomes were the average daily time spent walking recorded by the sensors and a
stopwatch-timed fastest safe 15-meter walking speed collected by a blinded observer prior to
patient discharge from the rehabilitation unit. The blinded observer also collected FAC
scores and 3-minute walking distances at the time of discharge to serve as secondary
outcomes. Participants’ perceptions of their function were collected using the Stroke Impact
Scale (SIS-16). Sensor ease of use was assessed using Likert-style questionnaires.
Power analysis
We aimed to increase the time spent walking by 30%. Our power calculation was based
upon admission-to-discharge changes in walking speed reported in the SIRROWS trial.8 An
effect size of 0.4 could be detected with a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and a power
of 0.8 if 92 subjects were recruited to each group, assuming no more than 10% attrition. An
interim futility analysis to be performed by a statistician blinded to intervention assignment
was planned after the first 100 subjects had completed participation in the trial.
Statistical analyses
Baseline comparisons between the SF and AF groups were performed using t-tests, chi-
squared tests, or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate. Primary outcomes for all
participants who received the intervention were analyzed using t-tests. Linear mixed effects
models were constructed to evaluate for differences in the rate of change in walking time
between feedback groups. Functional walking groups were identified from within baseline
15-meter walking speeds by post hoc quartile analysis. Two-way ANOVAs were used to
compare primary outcomes between functional sub-groups. Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consent
Investigators at UCLA provided a standard IRB template that was approved by each site’s
local institutional review board after any necessary modifications. All subjects provided
written informed consent prior to participation. The study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01246882). A Data Safety Monitoring Committee was not formed
for this trial given the low perceived risk to participants and the simplicity of the trial’s
design.
RESULTS
Recruitment and baseline demographics
Study sites reported screening 156 patients who were highly likely to meet entry criteria
between March 2011 and October 2012 (Figure 1). Interim outcomes analysis performed
after the first 100 participants completed the study did not identify any significant difference
between groups and the decision was made to halt the trial after a total of 125 subjects had
completed participation. On closure of the study, 135 patients had received the intervention
and 125 completed the trial (83% of all randomized participants).

At baseline, subjects in the two intervention groups were found to be equally matched for
age, gender, stroke location, and disability (Table 1). Patients with a range of walking
disabilities at entry were included. There was no significant difference in either the length of
stay in rehabilitation or in the median number of days of trial participation between the two
intervention groups (Table 2).
Wireless sensor usage and algorithm outputs
We recorded 2117 days of rehabilitation from the 135 participants. Accounting for
weekends and holidays, sensor data were obtained for 84.4% of all study days. Technical
problems including sensor desynchronization, hardware failure, and incorrectly collected
walking templates prevented the machine-learning algorithms from classifying activity for
226 therapy days. We obtained 18,579 hours of fully processed data from 1891 therapy
days. The algorithms identified over 37,000 discrete walking episodes and 2.5 million steps.
On average, the sensors were actively recording data for over 8 hours a day.
Outcomes
We found no significant difference between groups in the average daily time spent walking
over the duration of the trial (SF: 15.1 ± 13.1 min; AF: 16.6 ± 14.3 min; p=0.54). Between
study entry and discharge from rehabilitation, there was no difference between groups in the
rate of change in time spent walking (p=0.32). No significant difference in final 15-meter
walking speed was found between groups after accounting for baseline demographic
variables (SF: 0.93 ± 0.47 m/s; AF: 0.91 ± 0.53 m/s; p=0.96). The intervention groups did
not differ on secondary or patient-reported outcomes including the FAC, 3-min walking
distance, and SIS-16 scores (Table 2). Questionnaires completed by study participants at
discharge revealed that the sensors had been comfortable to wear (87%) and did not interfere
with movement (97.6%) either some or all of the time.
By post-hoc analysis, we identified three functional impairment groups based on mean
baseline 15-m walking speeds of 0.13m/s (severely affected), 0.38m/s (moderately affected),
and 1.12m/s (mildly affected). The SF and AF interventions did not differ in the distribution
of participants between functional groups (p=0.15). As shown in Figures 2 and 3, both the
time spent walking and 15-m walking speed differed between functional groups (time:
F=13.48, p<0.001; speed: F=45.31, p<0.001). Remarkably, the mean time spent in walking
practice was less than 8 min a day in the severe group and 12 min daily in the moderate
group. Within each functional group, the SF and AF interventions did not result in
significantly different primary outcomes (time: F=0.48, p=0.62; speed: F=0.29, p=0.75).
Unique sensor-derived outcomes
Daily remote monitoring with sensors provided a unique opportunity to evaluate walking
performance and patterns of activity during inpatient rehabilitation. As seen in Figure 4,
participants employed a range of speeds when walking, with the greatest variation in speeds
present during shorter walking bouts. Across all study participants, the majority of
continuous daily walking bouts lasted between 10 and 30 seconds. 124 participants had at
least one therapy day during which they engaged in continuous walking for 2 or more
minutes, and on average 62% of these participants’ days included longer walking bouts. AF

was not associated with a greater amount of time spent in longer (≥ 2 minutes) walking
bouts (SF:7.5 ± 6 min; AF:9.0 ± 8 min; p=0.33). Remarkably, when evaluating for changes
in total time spent walking over the course of rehabilitation we found that 30% of
participants decreased their total daily walking time.
Over the duration of the study, sensor-derived average daily walking speeds closely
paralleled those of the weekly casual 10-meter template walks (r=0.977, p<0.001). A weaker
positive correlation was present between the maximum daily speed calculated from the
sensors and 15-meter walking speeds collected by the blinded observer (r=0.647, p<0.001).
These findings support the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of hybrid motion
classification algorithms using bilateral inertial sensor recordings.
DISCUSSION
The SIRRACT investigators completed the first large, multicenter randomized clinical trial
that demonstrates the feasibility, validity, and sensitivity of continuous remote activity
monitoring to facilitate a walking-related intervention. International study sites of varied
cultures and languages, some of which do not routinely participate in clinical research, were
able to obtain laboratory quality data on a daily basis. Data were successfully collected,
transferred, and processed solely by Internet-based protocols in a timely fashion, which
greatly lowered the cost of the trial. Therapists and patients were highly compliant with
sensor use and the devices were reported to be an unobtrusive means of recording walking
activities during inpatient rehabilitation.
Across all participants, the augmented feedback intervention was not associated with a
greater amount of time spent walking. Disability did not appear to be the primary factor
limiting participation, as post-hoc analysis demonstrated that even patients who walked at
potential community ambulation speeds (i.e. ≥0.8 m/s)15 on study entry did not increase
their practice time with augmented feedback. Two patterns in the daily activity data suggest
explanations for why additional feedback did not result in more practice. First, only a
fraction of all walking bouts were of sufficient length that one could assume they
represented practice directed at skilled walking and not the performance of activities of daily
living. Second, almost a third of all participants decreased the time spent walking over the
course of their stay in rehabilitation. These patterns likely reflect constraints inherent to the
acute rehabilitation environment (e.g. hallway length, practice time used to reduce gait
pattern deviations and learn to employ an assistive device or orthotic, scheduled therapist
time, patient fatigue) and the time allocated to manage other rehabilitation priorities. Given
that the design of this trial was not meant to change how rehabilitative therapies were
delivered, these constraints may have limited participants’ opportunities to ambulate more
frequently regardless of walking ability. Clearly, walking was not used specifically to
improve cardiovascular fitness.
Although there were no between-group differences in 15-meter walking speed, distance
walked in 3 minutes, or FAC scores, both intervention groups significantly increased their
average 15-meter walking speed between study entry and discharge, surpassing the criterion
for a meaningful change in gait speed.16 A fair correlation was found between daily walking

speeds and those on the 15-meter outcome test, suggesting that, although participants
increased their ability to walk faster over the course of inpatient rehabilitation, this was not
reflected as much in their daily self-selected walking speed. The magnitude of the walking
speed achieved by the SF and AF groups at discharge was similar to that reported for the
179 participants in SIRROWS8 (0.91m/s for feedback vs. 0.73m/s for no feedback about
walking speed). Indeed, given the degree of improvement in SIRROWS, the investigators
were uncertain that further improvements would be achieved in SIRRACT through
additional feedback. The changes in walking speed seen in both studies (0.45m/s in
SIRROWS and 0.39m/s in SIRRACT) were greater than those reported for more intensive
interventions, including robotic step training17 and outpatient body weight-supported
treadmill with over-ground training and home-based exercise.18 A direct comparison with
these interventions is not possible, however, due to study differences including time from
stroke onset and range of initial walking speeds. SIRRACT does confirm the positive effect
of regular verbal feedback on walking speed, a simple intervention that has not yet been
incorporated into most inpatient rehabilitation practices.
Limitations of this trial were primarily related to the absence of funding. The site PIs and
coordinators carried out all tasks voluntarily, so they could not screen all admissions for
eligibility, possibly allowing for bias in subject recruitment. The requirement for participants
to provide two 10-meter walks for sensor calibration may have served as an inadvertent
additional selection criterion leading to the recruitment of less affected patients, although the
protocol allowed a timed walk over a shorter distance if necessary. In addition, the central
UCLA site could not monitor how consistently feedback was delivered to the AF group at
study sites, potentially confounding the feedback’s effect on participants and preventing the
determination of whether therapists were introducing bias. Information regarding the content
and dose of therapies provided at each study site was not collected, precluding a comparison
of participants’ walking performed during versus outside of formal therapy times. As
mentioned above, the allocation of time spent across a range of rehabilitation activities may
have constrained the ability of therapists to increase the amount of time devoted to physical
practice in the inpatient setting, limiting the potential effectiveness of the AF intervention.
Finally most sites were unable to follow up their patients after discharge. The study protocol
asked them to try to obtain a 30-day and 90-day follow-up, but this was not practical due to
transportation and funding constraints. Thus, we could not identify delayed effects from the
two interventions.
Wireless sensors and classification algorithms enabled an appraisal of skills practice that
was novel for a stroke rehabilitation trial. For example, participants’ engagement in the
practice of skills other than walking was identified from within the continuous data streams.
We collected templates and monitored the frequency with which repetitive movements
including cycling, knee extensions, and leg lifts were performed (not shown, due to wide
variations across sites). Most important for the conduct and outcomes of this study, the
system was able to recognize and quantify walking performed at speeds below 0.5m/s, a
recognized limitation of pedometers19 and other commercial inertial sensor systems.20 We
have also begun to examine the data for more complex daily and weekly motor skill changes
over the course of rehabilitation, such as stride-to-stride variations, limb asymmetries in

stance and swing times, and smoothness of lower extremity swing accelerations. The
acquisition of such data usually requires a formal gait laboratory assessment.
Our findings argue for the feasibility and utility of continuous activity monitoring to
accurately assess skills practice as it is actually performed by patients during formal and
self-directed rehabilitative activities. Related technologies have assessed gait speed in
community dwelling elderly21 and quantified changes in gait22 as well as aspects of the
intensity of physical activity7 for patients participating in acute inpatient rehabilitation at a
single site. Additional advancements in reducing sensor size, increasing energy efficiency,
and developing inexpensive communications standards will make possible real-time
feedback based upon the continuous collection of data from the home and community.
Wireless health technologies, in combination with telemedicine infrastructure, may become
valued neurologic tools for clinical trials or daily care that monitor compliance with skills
training and exercise for secondary prevention, as well as provide feedback and ratio-scale,
ecologically sound outcome measurements.23
