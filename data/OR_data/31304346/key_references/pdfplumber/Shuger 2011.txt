Abstract
Background: The SenseWear™ Armband (SWA) (BodyMedia, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA) is a physical activity and lifestyle
monitor that objectively and accurately measures free-living energy balance and sleep and includes software for
self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy intake. The real-time feedback of the SWA can improve
individual self-monitoring and, therefore, enhance weight loss outcomes.
Methods: We recruited 197 sedentary overweight or obese adults (age, 46.8 ± 10.8 y; body mass index (BMI),
33.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2; 81% women, 32% African-American) from the greater Columbia, South Carolina area.
Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups, a self-directed weight loss program via an evidence-based
weight loss manual (Standard Care, n = 50), a group-based behavioral weight loss program (GWL, n = 49), the
armband alone (SWA-alone, n = 49), or the GWL plus the armband (GWL+SWA, n = 49), during the 9-month
intervention. The primary outcome was change in body weight and waist circumference. A mixed-model
repeated-measures analysis compared change in the intervention groups to the standard care group on weight
and waist circumference status after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, energy expenditure, and recruitment
wave.
Results: Body weight was available for 62% of participants at 9 months (52% standard care, 70% intervention).
There was significant weight loss in all 3 intervention groups (GWL, 1.86 kg, P = 0.05; SWA-alone, 3.55 kg, P =
0.0002; GWL+SWA, 6.59 kg, P < 0.0001) but not in the Standard Care group (0.89 kg, P = 0.39) at month 9. Only
the GWL+SWA group achieved significant weight loss at month 9 compared to the Standard Care group (P =
0.04). Significant waist circumference reductions were achieved in all 4 groups at month 9 (Standard Care, 3.49 cm,
P = 0.0004; GWL, 2.42 cm, P = 0.008; SWA-alone, 3.59 cm, P < 0.0001; GWL+SWA, 6.77 cm, P < 0.0001), but no
intervention group had significantly reduced waist circumference compared to the Standard Care group.
Conclusions: Continuous self-monitoring from wearable technology with real-time feedback may be particularly
useful to enhance lifestyle changes that promote weight loss in sedentary overweight or obese adults. This
strategy, combined with a group-based behavioral intervention, may yield optimal weight loss.
