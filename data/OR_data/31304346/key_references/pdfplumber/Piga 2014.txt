ABSTRACT. Objective. To describe a feasibility study focused on a telemonitoring approach to self-managed
kinesiotherapy sessions for the rehabilitation of hand function in patients with systemic sclerosis
(SSc) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods. Ten patients with SSc and 10 with RA were enrolled in a 3-month controlled trial
(approval no. 9751/2012 –Italian Department of Health) to perform a home kinesiotherapy protocol,
consisting of strengthening and mobility exercises, using a newly developed telemedicine system (a
portable device and the related telemonitoring infrastructure). A further 10 patients with SSc and 10
with RA were enrolled as controls to perform a similar home kinesiotherapy protocol with the aid of
common daily-life objects. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and at followup, after 6 and 12
weeks. The primary outcome of the trial was hand function measured by Dreiser’s index (Functional
Index for Hand OA, FIHOA), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Hand Mobility in
Scleroderma (HAMIS) test (only for SSc).
Results.Patients with SSc showed an improvement of FIHOA in both arms (p < 0.01) but the HAQ
(p = 0.016) and the HAMIS test (right hand p = 0.016, left hand p = 0.075) improved significantly
only in the experimental arm. Patients with RA showed a statistically significant improvement of
FIHOA (p = 0.013) and HAQ (p = 0.015) in the experimental arm, while patients in the control arm
did not significantly improve. However, no statistically significant differences in outcome measures
between treatment methods were observed. Withdrawals were higher in control arms (SSc 20%; RA
30%) than in experimental arms (SSc 10%; RA 10%).
Conclusion.Telemonitoring of self-administered kinesiotherapy programs is a promising approach
to the rehabilitation of hand functions in patients with rheumatic disease. (J Rheumatol First Release
