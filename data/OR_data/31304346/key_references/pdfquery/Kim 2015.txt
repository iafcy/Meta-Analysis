Randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness 
of remote patient monitoring and physician care 
in reducing ofﬁce blood pressure 

The effectiveness of remote patient monitoring and physician care for the treatment of hypertension has not been demonstrated 
in a randomized clinical trial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of remote patient monitoring with or 
without remote physician care in reducing ofﬁce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. A total of 374 hypertensive 
patients over 20 years of age were randomized into the following three groups: group (1) control, the patients received usual 
clinical care with home BP monitoring; group (2) the patients were remotely monitored and received ofﬁce follow-up; and group 
(3) the patients received remote monitoring without physician ofﬁce care using the remote monitoring device. For each group, in- 
ofﬁce follow-up care was scheduled every 8 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in sitting SBP at the 
24-week follow-up. No difference between the three groups was observed in the primary end point (adjusted mean sitting SBP 
was as follows: group 1: − 8.9 ± 15.5 mm Hg, group 2: − 11.3 ± 15.9 mm Hg, group 3: − 11.6 ± 19.8 mm Hg, (NS). Signiﬁcant 
differences in achieving the target BP at the 24th week of follow-up were observed between groups 1 and 2. The subjects over 
55-years old had a signiﬁcant decrease in the adjusted mean sitting SBP in groups 2 and 3 compared with that of the control 
group. Remote monitoring alone or remote monitoring coupled with remote physician care was as efﬁcacious as the usual ofﬁce 
care for reducing blood pressure with comparable safety and efﬁcacy in hypertensive patients.

INTRODUCTION 
Although achieving the target blood pressure (BP) is the most 
important prognostic factor for the treatment of hypertension, the 
latest NHANES 2007–2008 survey showed that only 50.1% of all 
hypertensive patients met this objective.1 Numerous factors have been 
shown to be associated with improved BP control. Critical among 
these factors is the degree of patient awareness and adherence to the 
treatment. A previous study demonstrated that self measurement of 
home BP is associated with improved treatment compliance, indicat- 
ing that self measurement might help increase treatment adherence.2 
Recent studies have shown that telemonitoring of home BP might be 
more effective than conventional treatment in achieving target BP.3,4 
To date, no randomized clinical trial has compared the efﬁcacy of 
conventional home BP monitoring to a web-based remote patient 
monitoring device. The clinical trial presented here had two major 
objectives. First, to determine whether remote monitoring home- 
based BP monitoring is more efﬁcacious in reducing ofﬁce BP 
compared with conventional treatment with home BP measurement. 
Second, to determine whether there is a difference in blood pressure 
lowering according to web-based remote patient monitoring with or 
without remote physician care (LG Smart Care system, LG Electronics, 
Seoul, Korea). 
METHODS 
Study design 
This study was a multi-center, randomized, parallel, interventional, open-label 
trial involving the following clinical centers in South Korea: Yonsei University, 
Yeungnam University and Keimyung University (Clinical Trials GOV NCT 
01335984). The clinical trial was performed between 20 December 2010 and 3 
April 2013. The remote monitoring system used in this study was the LG Smart 
Care system. 
The eligible participants were assigned to the three groups with equal 
probability according to the randomization code. Because this study is an open- 
labeled trial, blinding was not performed. The group 1 (control) patients 
(n = 124) received typical clinical care using home BP monitoring validated 
with the BHS protocol (UA 767PBT, A&D medical, Tokyo, Japan) with no 
remote monitoring and ofﬁce follow-up (FU) visits at 8-week intervals for

Remote patient monitoring and hypertension 
Y-N Kim et al 
24 weeks.5 The subjects were instructed to measure and record their home 
BP measurement in their diary and bring the data to each ofﬁce visit. The 
subjects were instructed on the proper intake of their medications, as well as 
maintenance of their usual healthy lifestyle modiﬁcations of their dietary and 
exercise habits. The group 2 (n = 124) patients received remote monitoring of 
home BP through the LG Smart Care system; however, they did not receive 
remote physician care. These patients receive in-ofﬁce physician care at FU 
appointments every 8 weeks for 24 weeks. The group 3 (n = 126) patients 
received remote monitoring of home BP and remote physician care without in- 
ofﬁce physician care. Remote physician care was provided every 8 weeks for 
24 weeks by the attending physician of the subject. For the remote monitoring, 
routine contact was made with the patient every week from the 1st to 9th week 
and once every 4 weeks from the 10th to the 24th week. In addition, the patient 
was contacted in the following cases: (i) when the 1-week average home BP was 
⩾ 160/100 mm Hg; (ii) when the measured BP was ⩾ 180/120 mm Hg; and (iii) 
if the patient did not measure the BP at home for 3 consecutive days. The 
patients were instructed to measure the BP at home in the dominant arm, once 
in the morning and once in the evening. The patients enrolled in the remote 
monitoring arm (group 2, group 3) were educated regarding the use of the 
supplied netbook computer and the LG Smart Care system. All the data were 
uploaded onto the server by Bluetooth and constantly monitored by healthcare 
professionals (physicians, nurses, a nutritionist, an exercise trainer) involved in 
the study. In addition to the BP data that was obtained, the patients were 
instructed to upload the records of their daily dietary intake, as well as the types 
and duration of 
the exercise programs, which were monitored by the 
nutritionist and the exercise trainer. The adherence to anti-hypertensive 
medications was assessed by records in a medication diary provided to the 
patients at the time of enrollment. The adherence was calculated by the number 
of days anti-hypertensive medications were taken, divided by the study 
duration. 
Ambulatory BP was measured in the non-dominant arm using a validated 
ambulatory BP monitoring 
(A&D TM-2430, A&D 
(ABPM) device 
Medical, San Jose, CA, USA). The daytime average BP was deﬁned as 
the average of the BP measurements obtained from 0700 hours to 2259 hours. 
The night time average BP was deﬁned as the average of the BP measurements 
obtained from 2300 hours to 0659 hours. The white-coat effect was deﬁned as a 
baseline daytime average systolic/diastolic ABPM o135/85 mm Hg (130/80 for 
DM and/or CKD), respectively. For the patients enrolled in the web-based 
monitoring-only arm (group 2), an in-person ofﬁce visit to the attending 
physician was required every 8 weeks. The attending physicians cared for the 
patient based upon the data obtained through the remote patient monitoring, 
as well as the data obtained in the ofﬁce. For the patients enrolled in the remote 
monitoring/remote treatment arm (group 3), the attending physician assessed 
the status of the patient by remote monitoring. Anti-hypertensive medications 
were adjusted and prescribed by the attending physicians according to the 
patient’s data. The hypertension treatment regimen, based on the major clinical 
guidelines, was left to the discretion of the attending physician.6–8 For the 
remote physician monitoring arm, the necessary medications were delivered to 
the patient. 

The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved 
by 
Shinchon 
Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University 
Severance Hospital, Yeungnam University Hospital and Keimyung University 
Hospital. All the procedures were performed in accordance with the institu- 
tional guidelines. All the patients provided informed consent prior to being 
enrolled. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Inclusion criteria 
1. Hypertensive patients over 20 years of age whose ofﬁce BP was uncontrolled 
with one or more anti-hypertensive medications (systolic BP (SBP) ⩾ 140 
mm Hg; for diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
SBP ⩾ 130 mm Hg). 




2. Secondary hypertension. 
3. HbA1c4 11%. 
4. Hypertensive patients requiring admission care. 
5. CKD with a serum creatinine level of 41.5 times the upper limit of 



7. History of acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, con- 
gestive heart failure and/or valvular heart disease within the last 6 months. 
8. Chronic debilitating illness. 
9. Autoimmune disease. 
10. Patients taking medications that might inﬂuence BP (sedatives, hypnotics, 
lithium, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, 
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, alpha agonists, 
steroids). 

or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
12. Patients with a history of alcoholism. 
Statistical analysis 
The study was initially designed to enroll 564 patients (under the assumption of 
a 25% dropout rate), which was later revised to enroll 495 patients equally to 
each of the three intervention groups, under the assumption of a 20% dropout 
rate because the dropout rate was lower than expected (Figure 1). With a 
sample size of 165 patients per group, the trial had 80% power to detect 
(α = 0.05; two-sided test) a between-treatment difference between the group 1 
and groups 2 and 3 of 3.8 mm Hg in the SBP change from baseline with a s.d. 
for the SBP of 11.43 mm Hg, with a 20% dropout rate. The between-treatment 
difference of 3.8 mm Hg and an s.d. of 11.43 mm Hg were estimated from 
similar hypertension trials.9–11 
The primary end point was the difference in the sitting SBP at the 24th week 
of FU by the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis compared with the baseline 
measurement. The secondary end points were as follows: (i) the difference in 
the sitting diastolic BP (DBP) at the 24th week of FU by the ITT analysis 
compared with the initial measurement; (ii) the percentage of patients 
achieving the target BP (o140/90 mm Hg and o130/80 for patients with 
DM and/or CKD); (iii) the difference in the 24 h ambulatory BP at the 24th 
week of FU by the ITT analysis compared with the initial measurement; (iv) the 
percentage of patients achieving the target daytime ambulatory BP (o135/85- 
mm Hg, o130/80 for DM and/or CKD); (v) the difference in the average 
home SBP/DBP at the 24th week of FU by the ITT analysis compared with the 
initial measurement; and (vi) drug adherence ((the number of days taking anti- 
hypertensive medications/the number of days enrolled in the clinical trial) × 
100). A subgroup analysis according to age (55 years), gender and the presence 
of DM/CKD was performed. 
For the statistical analysis, the baseline characteristics were analyzed using 
analysis of variance for the continuous variables and the χ2 method for the 
discrete variables. The difference in the adjusted mean BP reduction was 
assessed using the analysis of covariance. The statistical analysis was performed 
using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 
RESULTS 
A total of 440 patients were screened for the study. Among the 440 
subjects (66 failed to meet the inclusion criteria), 374 patients were 
randomized into three groups and analyzed by an ITT analysis (group 
1: 124, group 2: 124, group 3: 126). Among the 374 patients initially 
randomized, 331 patients were available for the per-protocol analysis 
(group 1: 115, group 2: 111, group 3: 105, Figure 1). There were no 
signiﬁcant differences between the three groups in terms of age, 
gender, the body mass index, smoking or alcohol intake (Table 1).

No signiﬁcant differences were observed among the three groups in 
terms of the baseline SBP (Table 2, P = non signiﬁcant). There were 
no signiﬁcant differences 
in the 24 h ambulatory BP, daytime 
ambulatory BP or night time ambulatory BP (Supplementary Table 
1). Among the subjects who underwent measurement of the baseline 
ABPM data, no signiﬁcant differences in the proportion of subjects 
with the white-coat effect were observed (Supplementary Table 1). The 
analysis of 
there were no 
signiﬁcant differences between the three groups in terms of the 
decrease in the adjusted mean sitting SBP at the 24th week in the 
FU (group 1: − 8.9 ± 15.5 mm Hg, group 2: − 11.3 ± 15.9 mm Hg, 
group 3: − 11.6 ± 19.8 mm Hg, P-value = non signiﬁcant, Table 2). 
There was a signiﬁcant difference between the groups 1 and 2 in terms 
of achieving the target BP (SBP and DBP) at the 24th week of FU 
(Table 3). The subgroup analysis revealed that in the subjects over the 
age of 55, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the adjusted mean sitting 
SBP in the groups 2 and 3 compared with that in the control group 
(Table 2). Among the subjects over the age of 55, the patients in the 
group 2 and 3 achieved the target BP by the 24th week of FU at a 
signiﬁcantly higher rate than the patients in group 1 (Table 3). 
Baseline and FU ABPM was performed in 96/124 subjects in group 1 
(77.4%), 89/124 (71.8%) in group 2 and 87/126 (69.1%) in group 3. 
The analysis of the ABPM data in the subjects with true uncontrolled 
hypertension showed a signiﬁcant difference in terms of the changes in 
the ABPM SBP compared with the baseline within all three groups at 
FU (Table 4). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the change in 
the ABPM SBP among the groups (Table 4). When the average 1-week 
home BP measurements (excluding the 1st day of measurement) were 
compared, the patients in the group 3 demonstrated a signiﬁcant

DISCUSSION 
The recently published 2013 ESH/ESC guidelines for the management 
of arterial hypertension state that various communication technologies 
might theoretically be advantageous in improving BP control by 
having a favorable effect on improving self-monitoring, adherence and 
feedback from healthcare personnel.6 The effectiveness of remote 
monitoring has not been shown in a randomized clinical trial.4,12–14 In 
this context, several key ﬁndings from this study should be mentioned. 
The ﬁrst key ﬁnding from this study is that this study is the ﬁrst to 
demonstrate that remote monitoring alone (group 2) or remote 
monitoring coupled with remote physician care (group 3) was as 
efﬁcacious as the usual ofﬁce care for reducing BP in patients with 
hypertension. To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate 
the safety and efﬁcacy of remote physician care in reducing BP. 
Although the Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure 
Monitoring Study demonstrated that web communications with 
remote pharmacist care is associated with signiﬁcantly better target 
to randomize the 
BP achievement at 1 year, 
effectiveness of remote physician care in reducing BP.15,16 In large 
countries, this ﬁnding is important for the care of hypertensive 
patients who reside in sparsely populated regions and have limited 
access to healthcare. The initial hypothesis was that remote monitoring 

with or without remote physician care would reduce BP more 
signiﬁcantly than usual ofﬁce care. The reason for the lack of 
difference in the primary end point might be because the usual care 
group patients in this study were instructed to measure their BP at 
home. The EPACUM-HTA study demonstrated that home BP 
monitoring is associated with a 92% drug compliance rate compared 
with 74% in the control group.2 The high drug-adherence rate in the 
control group in this study (Table 3) supports this data and might 
inﬂuence the negative result for the primary end point. Second, this 
work was a relatively large, randomized study to assess the effective- 
ness of remote patient monitoring/remote physician care compared 
with that of usual care in reducing BP, which includes home BP 
monitoring. Although we observed no signiﬁcant difference in the 6- 
month FU sitting SBP (the primary end point), there was a signiﬁcant 
beneﬁt in the target BP achievement and the sitting SBP reduction in 
the subjects over the age of 55. Although efﬁcacy was demonstrated in 
a subgroup analysis, the results have merit in that they demonstrate 
the clinical efﬁcacy of remote patient monitoring in a randomized 
clinical trial. The signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in the subgroup of patients over 
the age of 55 might be explained by the signiﬁcantly better adherence 
to the home healthcare device, as demonstrated by the signiﬁcantly 
higher number of home BP measurements in the group of patients 
over 55 years age (Supplementary Table 5). The lack of a signiﬁcant 
difference in the average daytime SBP of ABPM is difﬁcult to explain. 
This phenomenon is not explained by the white-coat effect because 
there was an equal distribution of this variable among the three study 
groups. The signiﬁcant difference in the average home BP, which has 
previously been demonstrated to be well correlated with ABPM- 
measured BP, supports the efﬁcacy of remote monitoring in reducing 
BP. That the FU ABPM data was available in only 72.7% of the study 
population might have confounded the results. Our data show that a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the subjects in the remote monitoring and 
remote treatment group reduced the number of BP medications they

were taking by the FU. This ﬁnding is in agreement with that of a 
previous study, which showed that home BP monitoring reduces the 
number of medications taken by the patients compared to the number 
of medications taken by the patients in the control group.17 This study 
is the ﬁrst to show that BP medication use could be reduced by remote 
monitoring. 
The third important ﬁnding results from our use of home BP 
monitoring in the control arm. Home BP monitoring is gaining wide 
acceptance for the treatment of arterial hypertension, with studies 
showing that up to 70% of hypertensive patients regularly check their 
BP using an ofﬁce BP measuring device.3,18,19–21 Home BP monitoring 
has been demonstrated to improve HTN control, as well as have a 
strong predictive value for future cardiovascular events.20–22 We used 
the home BP monitoring arm as the control group to more accurately 
reﬂect real-world clinical practice, as well as to determine whether 
remote monitoring with or without remote physician monitoring has 
additional beneﬁts in treating hypertension. 
There are several limitations to this study. First, the study was 
initially designed to enroll 495 patients and equally randomize this 
sample into the three intervention groups. With a sample size of 165 
patients per group, the trial was designed to have an 80% power to 
detect (α = 0.05; 
two-sided test), with an assumption of a 20% 
dropout rate. The study as designed needed at least 396 study subjects. 
The ﬁnal actual enrollment of 374 subjects results in this study being 
marginally underpowered. The second limitation is that we have no 
plausible explanation for the efﬁcacy of remote monitoring/remote 
physician care in reducing ofﬁce SBP and average home BP in subjects 
over the age of 55. Although, in theory, remote monitoring should 
have improved the drug adherence of the study population, there was 
no signiﬁcant difference between the three study groups in terms of 

anti-hypertensive drug adherence (Table 3). We postulate that remote 
monitoring of and feedback regarding the data on the patient BP, diet 
and exercise patterns might have a beneﬁcial effect in reducing BP. 
In conclusion, this clinical trial assessed the effectiveness of web-based 
remote patient monitoring with or without remote physician care (LG 
Smart Care) in reducing ofﬁce BP in patients with hypertension. We 
found no signiﬁcant differences in terms of the change in the mean 
SBP in the 24-week FU (primary outcome). The subgroup analysis 
revealed that patients over the age of 55, who received remote patient 
monitoring, with or without remote physician care, had a signiﬁcant 
decrease in their SBP at the 24-week FU. The web-based remote 
monitoring and remote physician care of hypertension was safe, with 
no signiﬁcant increases in adverse events compared with those in the 
control group.
