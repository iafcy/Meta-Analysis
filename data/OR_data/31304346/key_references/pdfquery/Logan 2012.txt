Abstract—Lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, yet hypertension is poorly controlled in diabetic patients. 
In a pilot study we demonstrated that a home blood pressure telemonitoring system, which provided self-care messages 
on the smartphone of hypertensive diabetic patients immediately after each reading, improved blood pressure control. 
Messages were based on care paths defined by running averages of transmitted readings. The present study tests the 
system’s effectiveness in a randomized, controlled trial in diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Of 
244 subjects screened for eligibility, 110 (45%) were randomly allocated to the intervention (n(cid:1)55) or control (n(cid:1)55) 
group, and 105 (95.5%) completed the 1-year outcome visit. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean daytime ambulatory 
systolic blood pressure, the primary end point, decreased significantly only in the intervention group by 9.1(cid:2)15.6 
mmHg (SD; P(cid:3)0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 7.1(cid:2)2.3 mmHg (SE; P(cid:3)0.005). Furthermore, 
51% of intervention subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of (cid:3)130/80 mm Hg compared with 31% of 
control subjects (P(cid:3)0.05). These improvements were obtained without the use of more or different antihypertensive 
medications or additional clinic visits to physicians. Providing self-care support did not affect anxiety but worsened 
depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (baseline, 4.1(cid:2)3.76; exit, 5.2(cid:2)4.30; P(cid:1)0.014). This study 
demonstrated that home blood pressure telemonitoring combined with automated self-care support reduced the blood 
pressure of diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and improved hypertension control. Home blood 
pressure monitoring alone had no effect on blood pressure. Promoting patient self-care may have negative psychological 
effects. 



vascular and renal disease.1 However, in the majority of 
hypertensive patients, particularly those with diabetes melli- 
tus, BP is poorly controlled,2 despite excellent access to 
health care and frequent visits to the physician.3 Such results 
spurred development of chronic care models that engage 
patients in their own care.4 
Home BP monitoring promotes self-care, improves BP 
control, and is endorsed by several prominent organiza- 
tions as an adjunct to hypertension treatment.5 A recent 
meta-analysis suggested that adding telemonitoring to 
self-measurement of BP is even more effective in reducing 
BP.6 In the telemonitoring studies, however, a physician or 
member of the healthcare team reviewed the transmitted 
data and contacted the patients to adjust antihypertensive 
treatment.7–13 Thus, it is unclear whether the better out- 
come was related to the use of a telemonitoring system or 
the increased involvement of healthcare providers in the 
treatment process. 
Previously we reported the development of a home BP 
telemonitoring system that provided self-care messages on 
the smartphone of patients immediately after each reading.14 
Messages were based on care paths defined by running 
averages of transmitted readings. The system was designed to

eliminate the need for a health provider to review home BP 
readings before management decisions were made. In a pilot 
study, the system was highly effective in lowering the BP of 
hypertensive diabetic patients.14 This study extends our 
preliminary work by comparing its effectiveness in a random- 
ized, controlled trial to home BP monitoring without self-care 
support. The psychological effects of promoting patient 
self-care were also examined. 

Study Design 
The study was a prospective, randomized, open, blinded primary 
end-point trial, conducted in the offices or clinics of physicians 
practicing in metropolitan Toronto. Men and women, (cid:1)30 years of 
age, with diabetes mellitus were recruited from family physicians’ 
office or hospital-based speciality clinics and advertisements in 
public areas of hospitals. All of the potential participants underwent 
24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring using the validated oscillometric 
SpaceLabs 90207 recorders (SpaceLabs Healthcare, Inc, Issaquah, 
WA). The recorders were programmed to measure BP at 20-minute 
intervals during the day and every 30 minutes at night. Participants 
were instructed to record the time they went to sleep at night and 
awoke in the morning. Individuals fulfilling the study’s eligibility 
criteria were randomly allocated to home BP monitoring with or 
without self-care support. Group allocation schedule was based on 
blocks of 4 and 6 patients randomly arranged and administered by a 
person not directly involved in the study. Research ethics board of 
the 5 participating hospitals approved the study protocol by June 
2008, and all of the participants gave written informed consent. The 
trial was completed in June 2010. 
Study Subjects 
Diabetic patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension, defined as 
a mean daytime systolic BP of (cid:1)130 mm Hg on ambulatory BP 
monitoring, were eligible unless they had severe or end-stage organ 
disease (liver, kidney, heart, and lung), a history of diabetic ketoac- 
idosis, any illness with expected survival (cid:3)1 year, severe cognitive 
impairment, mental illness or disability, clinically significant cardiac 
arrhythmia, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or were pregnant, 
unsuitable for participation in the opinion of their primary care 
physician, or not fluent in English. Subjects were not required to be 
familiar with computers or have access to the Internet. All of the 
eligible subjects were asked to monitor their BP at home daily for 7 
days, taking 2 readings in the morning and 2 readings in the evening 
using a validated Bluetooth-enabled home BP device (Life Source 
UA-767, A&D Medical, San Jose, CA). The device was paired with 
a smartphone that automatically transmitted every reading to a 
central server for processing and storage. At the end of 7 days they 
returned the equipment to the study staff. Control group subjects 
were then issued with an identical-appearing home BP device 
without built-in Bluetooth capability for use during the study. Each 
participant provided medical and demographic information, identi- 
fied their primary care physician, and completed the Anxiety 
Sensitivity Index,15 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,16 and 
comfort with self-measurement of BP questionnaires. The former 2 
measures have previously undergone psychometric validation,15,16 
and the internal reliability of the scale items of the latter measure, 
which was created purposely for the study, was excellent ((cid:2) of 0.86 
within our sample). 
Telemonitoring Self-Care Support System 
We designed, developed, and piloted the system with no commercial 
support.14 The patient component consisted of a custom software 
application running on a BlackBerry smartphone (Research In 
Motion, Inc, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) that was paired with a 
Bluetooth-enabled home BP monitoring device. BP readings were 
automatically transmitted by the smartphone to application servers, 
which processed the information for trends and applied decisions 

rules. The reporting and alerting component of the system sent a 
self-care message to the screen of the patients’ smartphone imme- 
diately after each reading. Messages related to the control of 
hypertension were based on care paths defined by running averages 
of transmitted readings. They instructed patients whose BP fell 
outside the target range (predefined low and high values) to take 
additional BP readings, which were then used to provide advice on 
the urgency to make a follow-up visit with their physician. The 
message to patients whose BP was within the target range indicated 
that 
they should 
continue to monitor their BP as recommended. Nonadherence to the 
preset home BP measurement schedule triggered an automated voice 
message that was sent to the patients’ home telephone, requesting 
them to check the smartphone for a message. Critical alerts were 
automatically sent to their physician’s office by fax whenever BP 
readings exceeded predetermined threshold values. Simultaneously 
an automated voice message was left on the patients’ home telephone 
advising them to check their smartphone for a message, which 
instructed them to contact their doctor immediately for advice. On 
the day before the office visit to their physician, patients called a 
dedicated telephone number to initiate the automated process to fax 
a 1-page patient summary report to their physician. This process 
could also be initiated by the physicians’ office. The summary report 
contained a graphic presentation of readings with dates, the current 
30-day average of transmitted BP readings, the previous 30-day 
average, and the number of readings used to derive the averages. 
There were no treatment recommendations. All of the electronic 
transmissions were encrypted and deidentified to ensure confidenti- 
ality of the personal health information. 
Study Protocol 
Participants in both groups were taught how to measure their BP 
correctly, instructed to measure their BP 2 days per week twice in the 
morning and twice in the evening, provided with a validated home 
BP monitoring device with appropriate-sized upper arm cuff, and 
given a booklet with detailed information on the self-measurement of 
BP, treatment of hypertension, and goals of therapy. Their primary 
care physician was given an outline of the study’s objectives and BP 
treatment goal, asked to provide relevant medical information, and 
given a copy of the 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring report. In 
both groups, treatment decisions, including medication adjustments 
and changes in lifestyle, were made by the patients’ primary care 
physician. 
Self-care support patients were taught how to use the telem- 
onitoring system, review past readings on their smartphone and 
the study-specific Web site (these activities were optional), and 
generate a 1-page patient summary report. They were instructed 
to take their smartphone to all doctor visits. The patient’s 
physician was shown the patient summary report, asked to 
indicate the low and high threshold BP values for critical alert 
messages (default options were provided), and taught how to 
change the threshold values. Optionally, they were shown how to 
visit the study’s password-protected Web site. The research team 
did not contact the subjects in either group or their physician 
during the course of the study. 
End Points 
End point assessments were undertaken 1 year after randomiza- 
tion. The primary end point was the change in mean daytime 
ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary end points included changes 
in 7 days of home BP readings, psychological questionnaire 
responses, and prescribed antihypertensive medications. BP con- 
trol was defined as (cid:3)130/80 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory BP 
monitoring. Information on the number of hypertension-related 
office visits made by patients during the study year was gathered 
from the billing records of their physicians supplemented in cases 
of missing data by patient self-report. Information on the dates 
and number of transmitted readings, reminder messages, and 
alerts was ascertained from data in the application servers. Full 
adherence with the home BP measurement schedule (100%) in the 
self-care support group was defined as a minimum of 8 readings 







2 refused full 24-h ambulatory 
monitoring and 7-day home 
monitoring at exit (1 agreed to a 
daytime recording only) 
per week. No information on home BP monitoring use in the 
control group was collected. 
Statistical Methods 
The study was designed to have a statistical power of 80% to 
detect a 4-mm Hg reduction in mean daytime systolic BP in the 
self-care support group, as compared with control group, using a 
2-tailed test with an (cid:2) level of 5%. In the calculation we used an 
SD of the difference of 7.16 mm Hg that was obtained by pooling 
estimates of studies that reported it on repeated ambulatory BP 
monitoring on 2 separate occasions. Assuming a 10% dropout 
rate, we estimated a total sample size of 113 patients (56 per 
group). To fully exploit the repeated BP measurements in the 
ambulatory recordings and home BP assessments, a mixed-model 
ANCOVA was used to assess continuous variables, using baseline 
BP and body mass index as continuous variables and group 
membership as a discrete variable. We specified random subject 
effects and fixed treatment effects. Linear contrasts were used to 
test for group differences. BP status (controlled or not controlled) 
was analyzed using logistic regression with baseline BP and body 
mass index as continuous covariates and group membership as a 
discrete variable. We compared the distribution of the number of 
medications in the 2 groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
Because of violations in normality distributions, 
the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale depression scores were normalized 
using a square-root transformation. All of the individuals with 
partial or complete outcome data were included in the final 
analysis. Results are expressed as means and SD, median and 
interquartile range, or proportions, unless otherwise specified. A 
2-sided P value (cid:3)0.05 was considered statistically significant. 

Study Participants 
Of 244 diabetic patients screened for uncontrolled systolic 
hypertension, 110 subjects fulfilled the trial’s eligibility 
criteria and were randomized to the self-care support group 
(n(cid:1)55) or control group (n(cid:1)55). Reasons for ineligibility and 
failure to complete the study are outlined in the flowchart of 
the study population (Figure). There were 96 family physi- 
cians and 16 specialists involved in providing care to study 
subjects. 
Baseline Characteristics 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of study partic- 
ipants at entry are listed in Tables 1 and S1 (please see the 
online-only Data Supplement). There were no significant 
differences between groups for these features apart from a 
borderline higher percentage of subjects with dyslipidemia in 
the self-care support group. There was also no difference in 
the mean number of antihypertensive medications per patient 
(Table 1) or drug classes (Table S2). 
Blood Pressure 
At 12 months, mean daytime ambulatory systolic BP, the 
primary end point, decreased significantly only in the 
support group by 9.1(cid:2)15.6 mm Hg (SD; 
self-care 
P(cid:3)0.0001), and the mean between-group difference was 
7.1(cid:2)2.3 mm Hg (SE; P(cid:3)0.005). There was also a signif- 
icant decrease in mean daytime diastolic BP, 24-hour BP, 
and night-time BP from baseline in the self-care group and 
no significant changes in the control group (Table 2). The 
same results were observed using 7 days of self-measured BP 
at home instead of ambulatory BP monitoring as the outcome 
measure (Table S3). Furthermore, 51% of self-care support 
subjects achieved the guideline recommended target of 
(cid:3)130/80 mm Hg compared with 31% of control subjects 
(P(cid:3)0.05). 
Intervention Effects 
There were no significant changes or between-group dif- 
ferences in the total number of antihypertensive medica- 
tions at exit ((cid:4)0.15(cid:2)1.19 in self-care support group and

in the number of visits to family physicians or combined 
visits to family physicians and specialists (median number 
of 6 in self-care support group and 7 in control group), 
even when the small percentage of self-reported data was 
excluded (Table 5S). Information on the experience of 
using the self-care support system is summarized in Table 
S6. Of the total (critical and noncritical) alerts, 75.3% were 
sent because average BP readings were above pre- 
established threshold values (Table S7). There were 3 high 
and 2 low critical alerts. 
Psychological Variables 
Psychological variables at baseline and outcome are summa- 
rized by group in Table 3. Using the self-care support system 
did not affect anxiety but worsened depression (P(cid:1)0.014), 
and the between-group effect on depression was significant 
(P(cid:1)0.032). Comfort with home BP monitoring decreased 
significantly in both groups (P(cid:3)0.001), with no between- 
group difference. 
Discussion 
The study demonstrated that home BP telemonitoring com- 
bined with self-care support reduced the BP of diabetic 
patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension and im- 
proved hypertension control. Our system was fully auto- 
mated, and self-care messages, which were sent immediately 
after each BP reading, were based on care paths defined by 
running averages of transmitted readings. The BP results 
confirmed our pilot study findings14 and were the same 
whether 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring or 7-day home 
BP measurements were used to assess outcome. In the 
self-care support group, 51% achieved the guideline- 
recommended BP target of (cid:3)130/80 mm Hg,1 which was 
substantially higher than that of 37.5% among treated hyper- 
tensive diabetic patients in a recent BP survey in the United 
States.2 
Patients with chronic conditions inevitably engage in 
self-care activities.4 In the case of hypertension, this may take 
the form of self-measuring BP, making lifestyle changes, or 
experimenting with prescribed treatment. However, for self- 
care activities to be effective they need to be based on reliable 
information and a meaningful collaboration with healthcare 
providers in an overarching framework of maintaining auton- 
omy.4 Our study confirmed this precept. We found, as have 
others, that better hypertension control can be achieved when 
self-measurement of BP is part of a plan that increases patient

engagement in making management decisions. Previous stud- 
ies achieved good results by directly linking home BP 
monitoring with some form of regular professional supervi- 
sion, such as telecounseling8 or implementing action plans 
established by a pharmacist,9 nurse,10–12 or family physi- 
cian.7,13 These interventions required a health professional to 
examine all of the transmitted readings for trends and extreme 
values and to contact patients with a management plan. In this 
study we were able to independently test the contribution of 
home BP telemonitoring by automating these activities, 
including the process of responding immediately to critical 
BP alerts. 
Our study was not specifically designed to study the 
mechanisms accounting for the better hypertension control. 
Telemonitoring certainly promotes self-care, may improve 
medication adherence,17 and has been used successfully to 
intensify antihypertensive drug treatment.9,13 However, sev- 
eral telemonitoring studies, including our own, have shown 
that better outcomes can be achieved without a change in the 
number or types of antihypertensive medications prescribed 
or in the proportion of subjects whose treatment was adjusted 
during the study.8,10,17 In one study this improvement was 
related to better adherence to antihypertensive medications.17 
Another study showed a decrease in BP in the home moni- 
toring service group irrespective of whether there was a 
medication change.7 It seems likely that multiple factors, 
which have not yet been systematically evaluated, are playing 
an important role in reducing BP and achieving target. 
In keeping with other home BP monitoring studies of 
1-year duration,18–20 we found that self-measurement of BP 
on its own failed to lower BP. This finding is not unexpected 
based on results of attitude surveys of primary care physi- 
cians and patients on home BP monitoring. In a survey 
conducted several years ago, American physicians indicated 
their reluctance to use home BP monitoring results as the 
primary means of making management decisions.21 In On- 
tario, only 19% of physicians preferred home BP monitoring 
to office or ambulatory readings to guide treatment deci- 
sions.22 In France, only 36% of general practitioners who 
encouraged their patients to do home BP monitoring 
actually used the readings to adjust antihypertensive treat- 
ment.23 Furthermore, the attitude of French physicians did 
not change from 2004 to 2009, despite strong recommen- 
dations of national and international guideline committees 
to incorporate home BP monitoring into making treatment 
decisions.5 Patients also have an ambivalent attitude to- 
ward home BP monitoring. Although the majority of 
patients have access to a home BP monitoring device and 
are encouraged by their physician to use them, only a third 
actually communicated the results to their doctor. Even 
more disturbingly, (cid:6)40% of those with alarming readings 
did nothing specific about the results.21 These findings 
suggest that the use of home BP monitoring in ongoing 
clinical management of hypertension is still not well 
accepted by physicians and that home BP monitoring 
without linkage to an effective support system does not 
provide any direct benefits for patients. 
A potential disadvantage of home BP monitoring is the 
possibility that patients may become preoccupied with mea- 
suring their BP or for those with an anxiety disorder their 
symptoms may worsen.5 Like others,13 we found no change 
in anxiety score with telemonitoring. However, we did 
observed a significant increase in depression score in the 
self-care support group. The clinical significance of this 
observation is unclear. The discrepancy between the anxiety 
and depression effects might suggest 
the depression 
effect is a chance finding. However, it is known that selective 
self-focused attention to bodily symptoms can have unex- 
pected negative psychological consequences.24 It is possible 
that the intervention contributed to depression by increasing 
participants’ attention to their hypertension, even if there was 
evidence of improved BP control. Future studies will need to 
first replicate our finding and, if confirmed, to find ways to 
mitigate the effect. 

The study’s limitations need acknowledgement. First, in- 
terventions were not masked. However, the same results were 
obtained using 2 different methods to assess BP outcomes. 
Second, the results may not be generalizable to hypertensive 






patients at lower risk for cardiovascular disease or whose 
hypertension is easier to control. Third, the study was not 
designed to examine in detail mechanisms accounting for the 
better outcome in the self-care support group. This now needs 
to be undertaken. Fourth, the study did not measure adher- 
ence to the recommended home BP measurement schedule in 
the control group, record office BP readings, or assess 
changes in weight and hemoglobin A1C. Finally, there was 
no formal cost-effective analysis. Nonetheless, in designing 
the system, we used commercially available hardware and 
communicated directly with patients as cost-saving mea- 
sures.14 In the future, even greater savings may be achieved 
by using the patients’ own smartphone, as smartphones are on 
track to outnumber conventional cell phones in the United 
States in 2012.25 
Perspectives 
Home BP telemonitoring combined with automated self-care 
support significantly reduced uncontrolled systolic hyperten- 
sion in diabetic patients without the use of more or different 
antihypertensive medications or additional clinic visits to 
physicians. The mechanisms accounting for the improvement 
need to be explored further. Home BP monitoring without 
linkage to a patient support system had no effect on BP. The 
finding that promoting self-care may have negative psycho- 
logical effects requires further study. A major reason for the 
failure of physicians to fully endorse the use of home BP 
monitoring is the possibility of adverse behavioral effects 
associated with its use.21–23 Finally, despite reminder mes- 
sages, there was a decline over time in the number of BP 
readings per week in the self-care support group, suggesting 
a fatigue effect with this intervention. The finding highlights 
the need for changes in or additions to the current system to 
counter this negative trend.

What Is New? 
● Research included development of a fully automated self-care support 
● Improving BP control significantly reduces cardiovascular disease risk. 
● Self-care support is a key component of chronic disease models. 

● We focused on using smartphone technology to facilitate self-care support. 
● We also focused on assessing the psychological effects of promoting 

What Is Relevant? 
● Control of hypertension is still poor among hypertensive diabetic patients. 

New system improved hypertension control of diabetic patients 
with uncontrolled systolic hypertension. Home BP monitoring alone 
had no effect on BP. Promoting patient self-care may have 
negative psychological effects.

† the number of GP visits for eight patients with self-reported data did not differ significantly 
from the 92 patients with data was provided by the GP (median 5 vs 5, p=0.82). Similarly there 
was no difference when the number of other caregiver visits were included (median 5 vs. 6.5,
