diagnoses than 24-hour Holter monitoring in 
patients with palpitations 





Summary 
Palpitation is a common symptom that sometimes results from a substantial cardiac arrhythmia. We compared the diagnostic 
yield of trans-telephonic event monitors with those of Holter monitoring in patients with intermittent palpitations. In all, 310 
patients were randomly assigned to receive an event recorder or 24-hour Holter monitoring. Event recorders were used for 
seven days or until two recordings were obtained while symptoms occurred. The main end-point was an electrocardiogram 
(ECG) recorded during symptoms. The patients with palpitation recorded the one-lead ECG trace and sent it to a telemedicine 
call centre, where a nurse responded. There were 119 symptomatic patients in the event recorder group and 74 in the Holter 
group. The total costs were h6019 for event recording and h9605 for Holter monitoring. The average costs were h51 per 
symptomatic patient detected by event recorder monitoring and h130 per symptomatic patient detected by Holter monitoring. 
More patients therefore received a clear diagnosis, and more quickly, when using event recording than with Holter monitoring. 
For this reason, event recorders are preferable to Holter monitors for patients with palpitations.

clues are not always accurate.2 Twenty-four-hour Holter 
monitoring is usually used, but the yield of this test is low 
in patients whose symptoms occur infrequently.3–6 
Another method of studying palpitations is trans- 
telephonic event recording;7 the recordings can be 
transferred to a receiving station for diagnosis and 
management.8 The strengths of Holter monitoring include 
its simplicity and the lack of need for patient activation. 
The continuous monitoring allows capture of 
asymptomatic arrhythmias or arrhythmias associated with 
loss of consciousness, as well as documentation of 
circadian variation in arrhythmia occurrence. However, 
the period of monitoring may be limited and is often 
inadequate to diagnose the cause of symptoms; it may also 
limit the ability of patients to perform many normal 
activities and require the patient to keep a diary to 
correlate symptoms and arrhythmia. An event recorder 
requires manual patient activation to record data, but it 
can be left with the patient for a long period of time until 
symptoms occur, and allows the patient to have a normal 
daily life. 

diagnostic yield of trans-telephonic monitoring using an 
event recorder with Holter monitoring in patients with 
intermittent palpitations. 
Methods 
....................................................................... 
In all, 310 patients were randomly assigned to receive 
event recorder monitoring or 24-hour Holter monitoring. 
Event monitoring was used for seven days, or until two 
recordings were obtained while symptoms occurred. The 
main end-point was an electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded 
during symptoms. The patients with palpitation recorded 
the one-lead ECG trace and sent it to a telemedicine call 
centre, where a nurse compared the trace with a baseline 
one, checked the patient’s symptoms and decided to end 
the telephone call, or in presence of major arrhythmia to 
request the cardiologist’s intervention. 
The system information ﬂow is the following: a 
telephone call arrives (e.g. from general practitioners, 
patients, health centres) and the user is automatically 
identiﬁed through the stored telephone number or 
identity code. The telephone call is answered by an 
operator who recalls the patient’s data stored in the 
enrolment phase and activates the ‘new call procedure’, 
inserting new data relating to the present call (a control 
one or a call made in the presence of symptoms). At this 
point, the trace can be received and the user is connected 
to the cardiologist or the nurse on duty, who may be at 
home but will be connected to the central database 
through the Internet. The specialist or the nurse examines 
the stored information and compares the trace with the 
baseline one; they collect information about the patient’s 
history and clinical symptoms, and provide a tele- 
consultation and/or nursing triage. At the end of the call, 
the reported ECG trace is sent to the user by email or fax, 
and the data are transferred to the Web server, from where 
they are made available via the Internet to approved users. 
The teleworking model used by the staff involved depends 
on a PC connected to the central system through the 
Internet via a secure pathway (a virtual private network). 
Results 
....................................................................... 
Most of the patients were women (Table 1). The mean age 
of the patients was similar in both groups. There were 119 
symptomatic patients in the event recorder group and 74 
in the Holter group. There were 81 documented 
arrhythmias (68% of symptomatic patients) in the event 
recorder group and 53 (72% of symptomatic patients) in 
the Holter group. 
During Holter monitoring, only two patients suffered 
from palpitation. There was no difference between the two 
methods in detecting supraventricular and ventricular 
tachycardia, or in excluding arrhythmic events. Event 
recorder monitoring recorded 13 episodes of

average costs were h39 per patient for event recorder 
monitoring and h62 per patient for Holter monitoring. 
The average costs were h51 per symptomatic patient 
detected by event recorder monitoring and h130 per 
symptomatic patient detected by Holter monitoring. 
Discussion 
....................................................................... 
The present study conﬁrmed the advantage of the near 
realtime diagnosis that was possible using event recorder 
monitoring. Diagnoses were produced more quickly than by 
Holter monitoring. Furthermore, the costs were lower with 
event recorder monitoring. For this reason, event recorders are 
preferable to Holter monitors for patients with palpitations.

Summary 
Chronic heart failure (CHF) remains a common cause of disability. We have investigated the use of home-based telecardiology 
(HBT) in CHF patients. Four hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study: 230 in the HBT group and 196 in the 
usual-care group. HBT consisted of trans-telephonic follow-up and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, followed by visits from 
the paramedical and medical team. A one-lead ECG recording was transmitted to a receiving station, where a nurse was 
available for reporting and interactive teleconsultation. The patient could call the centre when assistance was required 
(tele-assistance), while the team could call the patient for scheduled appointments (telemonitoring). The one-year clinical 
outcomes showed that there was a signiﬁcant reduction in rehospitalizations in the HBT group compared with the usual-care 
group (24% versus 34%, respectively). There was an increase in quality of life in the HBT group (mean Minnesota Living 
Questionnaire scores 29 and 23.5, respectively). The total costs were lower in the HBT group (h107,494 and h140,874, 
respectively). The results suggest that a telecardiology service can detect and prevent clinical instability, reduce 
rehospitalization and lower the cost of managing CHF patients.
