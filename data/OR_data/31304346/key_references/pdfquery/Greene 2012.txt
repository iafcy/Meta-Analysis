Abstract 
Background: Online social networks (OSNs) are a new, promising approach for catalyzing health-related behavior change. 
To date, the empirical evidence on their impact has been limited. Purpose: Using a randomized trial, we assessed the impact 
of a health-oriented OSN with accelerometer and scales on participant’s physical activity, weight, and clinical indicators. 
Methods: A sample of 349 PeaceHealth Oregon employees and family members were randomized to the iWell OSN or a 
control group and followed for 6 months in 2010-2011. The iWell OSN enabled participants to connect with “friends,” make 
public postings, view contacts’ postings, set goals, download the number of their steps from an accelerometer and their 
weight from a scale, view trends in physical activity and weight, and compete against others in physical activity. Both control 
and intervention participants received traditional education material on diet and physical activity. Laboratory data on weight 
and clinical indicators (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, or low-density lipoprotein), and self-reported data on physical 
activity, were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: At 6 months, the intervention group increased leisure 
walking minutes by 164% compared with 47% in the control group. The intervention group also lost more weight than the 
controls (5.2 pounds compared with 1.5 pounds). There were no observed significant differences in vigorous exercise or 
clinical indicators between the 2 groups. Among intervention participants, greater OSN use, as measured by number of 
private messages sent, was associated with a greater increase in leisure walking and greater weight reduction over the study 
period. Conclusions: The study provides evidence that interventions using OSNs can successfully promote increases in 
physical activity and weight loss.

Since the mid-1980s, the prevalence of obesity among 
adults in the United States has more than doubled.1,2 Obe- 
sity is now implicated in approximately 15% of deaths, 
making it the second leading actual cause of mortality in the 
United States after tobacco.3 
A landmark 2007 study found that social networks may 
play an important role in obesity.4 Using 31 years of data 
from the Framingham Heart Study, Christakis and Fowler4 
found that an individual’s likelihood of becoming obese 
was highly influenced by whether or not someone in their 
social network became obese. The impact was stronger 
when a closer friend or a friend of the same sex became 
obese. The authors argue that if social networks could con- 
tribute to the obesity epidemic, networks should also be 
able to be used to spread positive health behaviors and curb 
the obesity epidemic. 
Research on the health and behavioral impacts of social 
networks was published just as online social networks 
(OSNs) exploded in popularity. OSNs allow people 
to construct an online profile within a bounded system, 
connect with or “friend” other users, communicate via the 
website with other members, post announcements to one’s 
network or all viewers, and view information about their 
network.5 The technology also enables uploads of data 
from devices such as accelerometers and scales. In 2011, a 
Pew Internet survey reported that 65% of US adults who 
are online (78% of all adults are online) use OSNs like 
Facebook or Twitter, up from 16% in 2006.6,7 There have

been calls for public health interventions to take advantage 
of OSNs to influence behavior through support, informa- 
tion transfer, social influence, modeling, and transmission 
of social norms.8,9 
Research into the public health uses of OSNs is just 
starting to be published and is still primarily descriptive. 
Studies have demonstrated that an existing smoking cessa- 
tion OSN has the characteristics required for sustainability 
of social support and social influence, and that using 
Facebook for a wellness intervention is possible but 
requires allowing users to limit which members of their 
network can view their participation.10-12 Studies are only 
beginning to examine the impacts of social networks and 
few have yet taken advantage of the abundance of data col- 
lected by OSNs. A recent study by Graham et al13 found no 
additional benefit of OSN compared to an online smoking 
cessation program. 
This study is a randomized trial of a health-oriented 
OSN, iWell.14 The iWell OSN combined an online platform 
for social networking with an accelerometer and a weight 
scale that both wirelessly uploaded data for tracking over 
time. The goal of this study was to examine whether the 
intervention group had greater increases in physical activ- 
ity, weight loss, and improvements in clinical indicators 
over 6 months compared with those in the control group, 
who did not use the iWell OSN. Furthermore, the study 
examined the extent to which use of the social network was 
associated with weight loss and physical activity among 
those in the intervention group. 
contact’s postings, view their physical activity or “steps,” 
view their weight, and compete against others in the net- 
work on the number of “steps” walked or run. The iWell 
OSN also allowed participants to set individual health- 
related goals and to receive motivational messages. 

Participants were recruited from PeaceHealth Oregon 
employees and their family. Participants were between 18 
and 79 years old, had stable medication for 3 months, and 
had expressed concern about their weight or health in an 
online screener survey. People with prior bariatric surgery, 
20 or more pounds of weight loss in the prior 3 months, or 
serious health issues (eg, recent cardiovascular event, can- 
cer, or bipolar disorder) were excluded. All participants 
were compensated with a cookbook at their 3-month fol- 
low-up and a $25 Amazon.com gift card at the 6-month 
follow-up. 
At baseline, 513 people enrolled in the study. A total of 
349 people, or 68%, participated for the full 6 months and 
are included in the analysis. Equal percentages of inter- 
vention and control group participants dropped out of the 
study (32%). Those who stopped participating were not 
significantly different from those who continued in terms 
of baseline physical activity levels, clinical indicators, or 
gender. They did, on average, have higher baseline body 
mass index than those who participated for the full 6 
months (33 vs 31 kg/m2) and they were younger. 


This 6-month randomized trial of the iWell OSN was con- 
ducted in 2010-2011. Following enrollment, participants 
were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group 
and followed over 6 months. Participation included provid- 
ing laboratory samples at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months 
(at no cost to the participant). The study was approved by 
the Human Subjects’ Committees of PeaceHealth and the 
University of Oregon and was registered on http://clinical- 
trials.gov in October 2010. 
All participants received printed lifestyle guidelines on 
diet and exercise during their first study visit. These materi- 
als included a sample daily meal plan with recommended 
serving sizes, a handout about recommended daily levels of 
exercise, and a number of articles about the benefits of exer- 
cise and healthy eating.15-17 
Intervention participants were provided access to the 
iWell OSN and were given an accelerometer that allowed 
them to capture their physical activity or “steps” for upload 
to the iWell OSN and a wireless weight scale for uploading 
weight data. With the iWell OSN, participants could con- 
nect (“friend”) others in the network, send individual mes- 
sages to their friends, make public postings, view their 
The main independent variable was whether or not the par- 
ticipant was randomized to the intervention or control 
group. For the supplementary analyses among the interven- 
tion group—which examined how use of the iWell OSN 
was related with weight loss and physical activity—the 
number of number of messages participants sent to indi- 
viduals in the iWell OSN and the number of uploads of 
accelerometer data were examined. 

Dependent measures included study participants’ physical 
activity, weight, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Weight, cho- 
lesterol, and triglycerides were measured by staff at the 
PeaceHealth Laboratory. 
A comprehensive, validated self-report measure called 
the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing 
Physical Activity (SQUASH) was used to measure physi- 
cal activity.18 Respondents completed the SQUASH online, 
separate from the laboratory data collection, and unfortu- 
nately 25% of participants failed to complete the SQUASH 
surveys.

Initially, the intervention and control groups’ demographic 
characteristics and baseline dependent variables were com- 
pared to assess the similarity of the 2 groups. 
To test the impact of the intervention, the dependent 
variables were examined at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 
months. Independent sample t tests were used to assess 
whether there was greater change for the intervention 
group compared with the control group. The principal anal- 
ysis included the sample of 349 study participants, who 
participated in the study for the full 6 months. Supplementary 
intention-to-treat analyses were consistent with what is 
presented in the primary analyses and are available on 
request from the authors. 
Regression models were developed to examine the rela- 
tionship between use of the iWell OSN and accelerometer, 
and increases in leisure time walking and weight loss over 
the study period among the intervention participants. Two 
independent variables were used. One measure of OSN use 
was selected because of the high correlation between 
potential measures, which would result in problems 
with multicollinearity. The number of private messages 
participants sent to others in the iWell OSN (as recorded by 
the OSN) was selected because it exhibited a strong rela- 
tionship with change in physical activity and weight change 
in bivariate analyses. The second measure was the number 
of uploads of accelerometer data. Control variables in the 
regression models included gender, age-group, and whether 
or not the participant had a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 at 
baseline. 

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study sample, who 
were overwhelmingly female (79%), non-Hispanic white 
(93%), and 50 years or older (60%). There were no statisti- 
cally significant baseline differences between the interven- 
tion and control groups in terms of demographics or 
physical activity, weight, or clinical indicators. 
Table 2 shows that the intervention group significantly 
increased weekly leisure walking from 129 to 341 minutes, 
on average, a 164% increase over the 6-month study period, 
compared with a 47% increase for the control group. The 
intervention group had larger increases in 9 other areas of 
physical activity compared to the control group; however, 
none of those differences were statistically significant (see 
the appendix). 
The intervention group also lost more weight over the 
6-month study period than did the control group (mean 5.2 
vs 1.6 pounds). There were, however, no significant differ- 
ences between the intervention and control groups in terms 
of change in low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipo- 
protein values. Although the intervention group had a

bChange from baseline was significantly different for intervention and control groups at P < .01. 
significant reduction in triglycerides at 3 months compared 
with the control group, it was not sustained at 6 months. 
In multivariate regressions, the number of messages sent 
by participants was positively related to increases in leisure 
time walking minutes and it was negatively related to 
weight change (Table 3). In other words, the more messages 
a participant sent on the iWell OSN, the more likely he or 
she increased the number of minutes walked, and reduced 
his or her weight. None of the factors—the number of accel- 
erometer uploads, obesity, age, or gender—was related to 
change in leisure time walking or weight. 

This study found that people randomized to a health-ori- 
ented online social network with an accelerometer and 
wireless scale increased the amount of leisure-time walking 
from approximately 6.5 miles a week to 17.1 miles a week 
over 6 months. This was a significantly greater increase 
than that observed within the control group, which increased 
walking from approximately 7.1 miles weekly to 10.4 
miles. Furthermore, those randomized to the iWell OSN 
shed 3 times as many pounds as the control group (5.2 vs 
1.6). The intervention, however, neither significantly 
improved vigorous physical activity, such as running or 
high-intensity housework, nor did it improve their triglyc- 
erides or cholesterol levels relative to the control group. 
Intervention participants who used the iWell OSN more, 
specifically sending more private messages, increased the 
amount of time spent walking and lost more weight than 
participants who used the OSN less. These findings suggest 
a dose–response relationship, in which greater use of the 
iWell OSN was associated with more minutes walking and 
greater weight loss. OSNs may be an important way to sup- 
port people in following through on their desires to increase 
physical activity and become healthier. 
Given the study design, the findings are generalizable 
only to those who want to improve their health, which was 
a requirement for study participation. The findings are also 
generalizable only to similar OSNs with wireless devices 
that enable uploading of physical activity and weight data. 
Future studies may want to examine the impact of the OSN 
separately from the wireless devices. Additionally, future 
work should include more diverse study participants. 
Other study limitations include the use of a self-report 
measure of physical activity, which was used because the 
control group did not have accelerometers and also because 
accelerometers might have affected measurement of base- 
line physical activity. The SQUASH, however, is a reliable 
measure, and in this sample, increases in reported walking 
were positively correlated with weight loss. Another limita- 
tion was the relatively high attrition rate, though our inten- 
tion-to-treat analysis resulted in substantively similar 
findings. Future work should examine the extent to which 
OSNs can promote long-term behavior change and sus- 
tained weight loss. Research is also needed to examine 
whether OSNs can promote diet change in addition to 
increased physical activity. This may result in more evident 
changes in cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which may 
be observed relatively quickly in dietary interventions.19

In summary, this study provides promising evidence that 
OSN participation when paired with monitoring tools can 
promote greater levels of physical activity and weight loss. 
The development of strong, OSNs may be a relatively low- 
cost and scalable way to positively influence health-related 
behavior.
