Abstract 
Background: The SenseWear™ Armband (SWA) (BodyMedia, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA) is a physical activity and lifestyle 
monitor that objectively and accurately measures free-living energy balance and sleep and includes software for 
self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy intake. The real-time feedback of the SWA can improve 
individual self-monitoring and, therefore, enhance weight loss outcomes. 
Methods: We recruited 197 sedentary overweight or obese adults (age, 46.8 ± 10.8 y; body mass index (BMI), 
33.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2; 81% women, 32% African-American) from the greater Columbia, South Carolina area. 
Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups, a self-directed weight loss program via an evidence-based 
weight loss manual (Standard Care, n = 50), a group-based behavioral weight loss program (GWL, n = 49), the 
armband alone (SWA-alone, n = 49), or the GWL plus the armband (GWL+SWA, n = 49), during the 9-month 
intervention. The primary outcome was change in body weight and waist circumference. A mixed-model 
repeated-measures analysis compared change in the intervention groups to the standard care group on weight 
and waist circumference status after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, energy expenditure, and recruitment 
wave. 
Results: Body weight was available for 62% of participants at 9 months (52% standard care, 70% intervention). 
There was significant weight loss in all 3 intervention groups (GWL, 1.86 kg, P = 0.05; SWA-alone, 3.55 kg, P = 
0.0002; GWL+SWA, 6.59 kg, P < 0.0001) but not in the Standard Care group (0.89 kg, P = 0.39) at month 9. Only 
the GWL+SWA group achieved significant weight loss at month 9 compared to the Standard Care group (P = 
0.04). Significant waist circumference reductions were achieved in all 4 groups at month 9 (Standard Care, 3.49 cm, 
P = 0.0004; GWL, 2.42 cm, P = 0.008; SWA-alone, 3.59 cm, P < 0.0001; GWL+SWA, 6.77 cm, P < 0.0001), but no 
intervention group had significantly reduced waist circumference compared to the Standard Care group. 
Conclusions: Continuous self-monitoring from wearable technology with real-time feedback may be particularly 
useful to enhance lifestyle changes that promote weight loss in sedentary overweight or obese adults. This 
strategy, combined with a group-based behavioral intervention, may yield optimal weight loss.

Background 
The prevalence of obesity in the US continues to be 
high, exceeding 30% in most sex and age groups [1]. 
Obesity is a risk factor for various chronic conditions 
including diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, 
stroke, heart disease, and certain cancers [2]. Preventing 
and treating obesity is a multifaceted dilemma that will 
likely need to be addressed on multiple levels ranging 
from policies to individual interventions. 
Clinical and commercial weight loss interventions can 
produce short-term weight loss, but a majority of people 
regain about 40% of their lost weight in the first year 
and continue to regain over time [3]. Examining effec- 
tive approaches to weight loss may be helpful for deter- 
mining the behavioral skills needed to produce weight 
loss and weight maintenance. Self-monitoring has 
emerged as a key skill for weight management, because 
those who weigh daily or weekly have greater success 
attaining weight loss goals [4]. Self-monitoring increases 
awareness of energy intake and expenditure, enhances 
self-efficacy, and allows for individuals to monitor pro- 
gress and change over time [5]. It might also facilitate 
regular goal setting. However, barriers such as stress, 
lack of social support, and lack of time can potentially 
affect adherence to self-monitoring [5]. 
The SenseWear Armband (SWA) (BodyMedia, Inc. 
Pittsburgh, PA) is a physical activity monitor that is worn 
on the upper arm and works with an online website for 
self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy 
intake. The SWA also works with a watch-like display 
device that gives the user real-time feedback on calories 
burned, steps taken, and minutes of physical activity. 
These data are collected by the SWA and can improve 
individual self-monitoring and, therefore, enhance weight 
loss outcomes. The SWA device is a commercially-avail- 
able self-monitor (http://www.bodymedia.com) that is 
priced comparably to other activity monitors. The primary 
form of treatment for obesity is behavioral therapy, an 
approach that combines education about diet and exercise 
with behavioral strategies that support behavior change 
[6,7]. The SWA could increase individuals’ adherence to 
healthy lifestyle goals by promoting more continuous self- 
monitoring to improve weight loss, due to the automated 
nature and real-time feedback of the device. 
The aim of this study was to determine the effective- 
ness of continuous self-monitoring and feedback from 
technology (achieved through the automation of the 
SWA) alone and in combination with GWL (group 
weight loss) to enhance weight loss and waist circumfer- 
ence reduction over a 9-month period in sedentary 
overweight or obese adults. We hypothesized that an 
intervention that incorporated group weight loss ses- 
sions with continuous self-monitoring, a SenseWear 
Armband, interactive weight loss software, and a weight 
loss manual would produce greater weight loss and 
waist circumference reduction than a similar interven- 
tion that did not include the SenseWear Armband and 
continuous self-monitoring. 
Methods 
Study design 
A complete description of the Lifestyle Education for 
Activity and Nutrition (LEAN) study design and meth- 
ods is presented elsewhere [8]. In brief, the study was a 
randomized controlled trial with a Standard Care con- 
trol group and 3 intervention groups. The research pro- 
tocol was reviewed and approved annually by the 
University of South Carolina’s institutional review board, 
and written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants prior to joining the study. Pre-post outcome 
data were collected from participants at baseline, month 
4 and month 9. Participants were recruited in 3 waves. 
Study participants 
We conducted a total of 787 telephone screening inter- 
views from the greater Columbia, South Carolina area 
between February 2008 and February 2009 (Figure 1). 
197 men and women aged 18 to 64 years who were 
underactive (not accumulating 150 minutes of moder- 
ate-to-vigorous physical activity throughout the week in 
bouts ≥ 10 minutes), overweight or obese (body mass 
index ( BMI) = 25 - 45 kg/m2), and had access to the 
internet were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 groups. 
Exclusion criteria included significant weight loss (>20 
lbs) in the last 6 months, elevated blood pressure (160/ 
95 mm Hg), ailments that limited physical activity, or 
serious medical conditions or other issues (e.g., preg- 
nancy or depression) that contraindicated or con- 
founded the weight loss intervention. Participants were 
recruited using a wide variety of techniques, including 
newspaper, mailers, community events, and worksite 
and other e-mail distributions. 
Standard Care (control group) 
Standard Care participants received a self-directed 
weight loss manual based on two evidence-based pro- 
grams, Active Living Every Day (ALED) and Healthy 
Eating Every Day (HEED) [9,10]. The manual’s focus 
was to help individuals adopt a healthful eating pattern 
and increase their physical activity levels through the 
use of cognitive and behavioral strategies consistent 
with the Transtheoretical Model [11] and Social Cogni- 
tive Theory [12]. 
Intervention groups 
All study participants in the intervention groups also 
received the evidence-based weight loss manual that was 
given to the Standard Care group. The weight loss

http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/41 


manual included two parts: a weight loss workbook 
included 14 chapters about healthy eating and active liv- 
ing and a set of forms for participants to use to record 
their daily meal and lifestyle activity, emotion or mood. 
Therefore, all the participants (including Standard Care) 
were instructed to self-monitor their dietary intake and 
physical activity. 
Group-based behavioral weight loss education group (GWL) 
During the first 4 months of the intervention, partici- 
pants in this group received 14 GWL sessions from a 
facilitator based on ALED and HEED. Each session fol- 
lowed the ALED and HEED curriculum format, with the 
addition of a weekly weigh-in and greater emphasis on 
weight loss than in the original programs. During the 
final 5 months participants received 6 one-on-one tele- 
phone counseling sessions to provide continued support 
and enhance weight loss maintenance. 
Armband alone group (SWA-alone) 
The SWA-alone group received the SenseWear™ plat- 
form consisting of the armband, a real-time wrist watch 
display, and access to a personalized Weight Manage- 
ment Solutions web account. While wearing the arm- 
band, participants received real-time feedback from the 
wrist watch on several outcomes (i.e. energy expendi- 
ture, minutes spent in moderate and vigorous physical 
activity, and steps per day). Feedback regarding energy

http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/41 

balance was received as participants regularly uploaded 
their armband to the website and recorded daily energy 
intake and body weight to the Weight Management 
Solutions web account. Participants were asked to wear 
the armband 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Combined GWL and SWA group (GWL+SWA) 
These participants received all components of the GWL, 
including the 6 one-on-one telephone counseling ses- 
sions, as well as the SenseWear™ platform. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcomes were body weight (kg) and waist 
circumference (cm). Secondary outcomes were BMI (kg/ 
m2) and percent body fat. Body weight was assessed 
using a calibrated balance-beam scale. Heights were 
assessed using the same wall-mounted stadiometer. 
Waist circumference was measured using a standard 
protocol. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared. Body fat measures 
were assessed using standardized gender-specific 3-site 
skin fold measures. The male and female skin fold sites 
were the chest, abdomen, and thigh and the triceps, 
suprailiac, and thigh, respectively. Body density and per- 
cent body fat were estimated using the American Col- 
lege of Sports Medicine’s gender-specific equations [13], 
followed by the Siri equation [14]. 
Other measures 
Physical activity assessments were taken at baseline and 
at month 9 (Table 1). During these assessments all par- 
ticipants wore the SenseWear™ Armband for 7 days 
without physical activity feedback. The SenseWear™ 
Armband is a lightweight physical activity monitor worn 
halfway between the acromion and olecranon processes 
on the upper left arm. This device uses four sensors to 
assess energy expenditure, sleep duration and efficiency, 
physical activity levels (sedentary, moderate, vigorous) 
and duration, steps, and on/off body wear time. The 
SWA includes a tri-axial accelerometer, a thermistor- 
based skin sensor, a proprietary heat flux sensor and a 
galvanic skin response sensor. This device has been 
shown to be valid in resting, exercise (i.e., treadmill and 
cycle ergometry), and free-living conditions (i.e., physical 
activity and exercise) [15-20]. Age, gender, race, and 
education were self-reported. 
Participant retention and adherence 
To reduce participant dropout and maintain adherence, 
several strategies were used, including a 2-week pre-ran- 
domization run-in period, behavioral contracts, and con- 
sistent support from staff members. Participants were 
reimbursed $10 for completion of baseline and month 4 
follow-up assessments. Participants were reimbursed 
another $15 in incentives for completion of month 9 
follow-up assessments. 
Randomization 
Eligible participants were randomly assigned after com- 
pleting run-in and baseline assessments. The randomi- 
zation sequence was computer generated. The 
sequence was determined from randomly permuted 
blocks of equal length with fixed numbers of treatment 
allotments each, to balance treatment enrollments over 
time.

Statistical Analysis 
Given the target enrollment of 50 participants per treat- 
ment condition, the study design had 80% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.62 (assuming a = 0.025) for 
weight loss and waist circumference reduction. Under 
40% attrition the study design had 80% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.81 (assuming a = 0.025) for weight 
loss and waist circumference reduction. If we assume a 
standard deviation of approximately 7.0 for the baseline 
follow-up differences for two outcome measures of 
interest, we had 80% power to detect a .434 kilogram 
difference in weight-loss and a .567 cm difference in 
waist size reduction. 
Descriptive baseline characteristics of groups were 
tabulated as means and SDs or as percentages. Linear 
mixed models (SAS PROC MIXED) were conducted 
that controlled for age, race, gender, education, energy 
expenditure, and recruitment wave. A linear function 
for time was tested. All reported P values are 2-sided. 
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 
Results 
Of the 197 randomized participants, 70% (58% of con- 
trol and 72% of intervention) and 62% (52% control and 
70% intervention) of the participants completed the 
month 4 and month 9 assessments, respectively (Figure 
1). 
As summarized in Table 1, the mean (SD) age of the 
study population was 46.9 (10.8) years; the mean (SD) 
BMI was 33.3 (5.2), and the mean (SD) waist circumfer- 
ence was 99.7 (13.9) cm. About 32% were nonwhite, and 
82% were female. A majority of the participants (77%) 
had earned at least a college degree. As shown in Table 
2, significant weight reductions were found in all 3 
intervention groups at month 9 (all P ≤ 0.05). The 
SWA-alone (P = 0.003) and GWL+SWA (P < 0.0001) 
groups achieved significant weight loss at month 4. The 
Standard Care group did not show significant weight 
loss at either time point (i.e., month 4 or month 9). At 
month 4, there were no significant differences in weight 
among any of the three intervention groups compared 
with the Standard Care group (All p > 0.05). However, 
at month 9, the GWL+SWA group showed significant 
weight reduction when compared to the Standard Care 
group (P = 0.04). 
The initial waist circumference results were compar- 
able to the weight loss results in that all 3 intervention 
groups had significant reductions in waist circumference 
at month 9 (Table 2). The major difference was that the 
Standard Care group also had a significant waist circum- 
ference reduction at month 9 (P = 0.0004). Two

participants in this group, compared to baseline mea- 
surements, lost more than 12 cm during the 9 month 
study. After reviewing the feedback survey that the par- 
ticipants completed during the month 9 visit, we found 
that these two participants were strongly motivated to 
lose weight when they joined the study. Even though 
they were assigned to the Standard Care group, they 
tracked their daily diet and activity and weighed them- 
selves daily. After removing these two participants from 
the analysis, the observed waist circumference reduction 
at month 9 for the Standard Care group was no longer 
significant. Therefore, we believe the large waist circum- 
ference reduction observed in these two participants is 
the main reason for the significant difference found in 
the Standard Care group at month 9. When compared 
to the Standard Care group, no significant waist circum- 
ference differences were found at month 9. No group 
differences in BMI were observed among intervention 
and Standard Care groups at month 9. 
There were significant percent body fat reductions in 
all 4 study groups at month 9 (Table 2). However, no 
group differences in percent body fat were observed 
between the intervention and Standard Care groups. 
Finally, we compared participants who received a 
SWA (GWL + SWA and SWA alone) with those who 
did not receive a SWA and found that, at month 9, 
those with an Armband showed significant weight and 
waist circumference reductions compared to those with- 
out an Armband. 
Discussion 
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate how con- 
tinuous self-monitoring using the SWA affected weight 
loss and waist circumference reduction both alone and 
in combination with GWL in sedentary overweight or 
obese adults. We demonstrated that a 9-month lifestyle 
intervention with the SWA produced significant weight 
loss and reduction in waist circumference. Thus, the 
SWA approaches, including real-time feedback and self- 
monitoring of energy balance, appeared to be beneficial 
tools in weight loss intervention. To our knowledge, 
only one other study [21] has evaluated weight loss in 
overweight and obese adults using a lifestyle interven- 
tion based on self-monitoring through the SWA. 
The goal behind the design and development of the 
SWA was to create a wearable device that could quanti- 
tatively assess energy balance, sleep, and physical activity 
in free-living environments more efficiently and effec- 
tively than current alternatives. With regard to weight 
loss programs, SWA offers valuable assistance with the 
goal to simply self-monitor the physical activity and 
caloric intake during an intervention. In fact, the adher- 
ence to armband wear was excellent. Among the 76 par- 
ticipants assigned to an Armband group (SWA-alone 
and GWL+SWA) and who completed month 4 assess- 
ments, 75% wore the armband more than 75% of days. 
Those who wore the armband more than 75% of days 
experienced significant weight loss compared with those 
who wore it less than 75% of days [22]. Self-monitoring, 
a “cornerstone” of behavioral treatment, has been found 
to be correlated significantly with weekly weight loss 
[23]. However, due to the variability in adherence mea- 
surement methods, it is difficult to compare adherence 
across studies [23]. Burke and colleagues reported a 
median 55% adherence to standard self-monitoring with 
a paper diary [24,25]. In our study, adherence to arm- 
band wear was higher than 55%, suggesting that weight 
loss participants may better adhere to self-monitoring 
protocols that use technology, compared to standard 
protocols. 
Our finding that self-monitoring of diet and physical 
activity with the SWA was related to successful weight 
loss supports previous studies that have identified the 
value of self-monitoring in weight loss [23,26]. A recent 
paper [23] presents a systematic review of the literature 
on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral 
weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. The 
use of technology, which included the internet, personal 
digital assistants, and electronic digital scales, was 
reported in five of the 22 identified studies. A significant 
association between self-monitoring and weight loss was 
consistently identified. One unique aspect of our study 
was that the self-monitoring was continuous and in 
“real-time”. Recent systematic reviews of randomized 
controlled trials of weight loss [27,28] have concluded 
that weight loss interventions can be effectively deliv- 
ered over the Internet. Successful online obesity treat- 
ment programs have targeted reduced energy intake, 
increased physical activity, and cognitive-behavioral stra- 
tegies including personalized feedback, self-monitoring, 
and social support. However, limitations of previous stu- 
dies include no intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, no 
assessor blinding, follow-up measures based only on 
participants’ self-report, moderate retention rates, and 
insufficient follow-up. 
In a recent study the armband was used as a real-time 
self-monitoring device in conjunction with a GWL [21]. 
This small study (n = 57) reported improved weight loss 
over 3 months when the armband was worn in conjunc- 
tion with a GWL beyond that which was accomplished 
with a GWL alone [21]. Polzien and colleagues’ focus 
was to evaluate the efficacy of providing real-time feed- 
back on energy balance as part of a weight reduction 
program, and to evaluate whether this approach 
enhances standard weight loss methods. Research sug- 
gests that individuals who use self-monitoring strategies 
(i.e., frequent weight checks, monitoring physical activ- 
ity, monitoring caloric intake) experience improved

weight loss [4,29]. Our study also showed a significant 
weight loss at month 9 for participants who wore a 
SWA compared with those who did not. These findings 
further confirm the importance of self-monitoring, 
which is indeed a consistent predictor of successful 
weight loss in technology-assisted weight management 
programs [29,30]. 
Due to the public health importance of overweight 
and obesity, weight loss interventions must be effective, 
available and accessible to the public. The Internet and 
technology devices provide unique opportunities for 
developing and implementing of lifestyle interventions 
that promote self-monitoring [31-33]. One study 
reported that overweight participants who had access to 
an Internet behavioral weight loss program for 6 months 
showed greater weight loss and reductions in waist cir- 
cumference than participants given access to a weight 
loss education material only [34]. 
Our study had several strengths: a randomized design, 
primary and secondary outcomes assessed, including 
objective measures of adiposity, outcomes assessed by 
researchers blinded to group assignment, a participant 
population comparable to South Carolina’s racial profile 
(67% white) and follow-up assessments at months 4 and 
9. The significant weight loss results from SWA-alone 
group are likely to be applicable outside the research 
setting because participants in this group received mini- 
mal face-to-face intervention, prepared all their own 
meals, and established their own physical activity 
regimens. 
There were also several limitations in the present 
study. First, there was a large attrition rate, particularly 
from the Standard Care group, where only 52% of the 
initial sample had complete data at month 9. Although 
the attrition rate is disappointing, it does not diminish 
our findings. Those lost to follow-up were similar to 
those who completed the study with the exception of a 
difference in education levels. Moreover, since we 
assumed no weight loss occurred in individuals lost to 
follow-up (initial weights carried forward), attrition 
biases our results toward finding no effect rather than 
overstating the effects of our interventions. Future stu- 
dies are warranted to confirm or reject the findings 
reported here. Second, the participant sample was 
mostly female (82%) and highly educated (77%) and 
therefore may not be generalizable to the general popu- 
lations, but is representative of individuals typically 
seeking weight loss treatment[35-37]. Third, this was a 
short intervention with significant weight loss, and 
therefore, it is unknown whether the weight loss would 
be maintained or continued over long term. Lastly, the 
GWL did not perform well compared with the published 
studies. One possibility is that participants were disap- 
pointed with group assignment. Another possible cause 
is the different characteristics of participants recruited 
during different waves. The first wave of recruitment 
was mainly from the University employees and students. 
We later found out that students were the most unreli- 
able group in this study, and their adherence was espe- 
cially poor for homework assignments and other 
assignments. 
Conclusions 
Finding new and innovative ways to use technology to 
reach individuals who are seeking weight loss via life- 
style interventions is vital. Long-term studies should be 
carried out to see if the SWA device can produce long- 
lasting effects or if combining the SWA and GWL 
(monitoring, feedback, and support) enhances weight 
loss compared to either intervention modality alone. 
Therefore, future studies should continue to refine 
applications technology and its ability to further 
enhance healthy lifestyle change for weight loss. This 
may provide an opportunity to objectively and accu- 
rately assess free-living energy balance, and therefore 
enhance the understanding of the contribution of energy 
expenditure/intake to weight loss.
