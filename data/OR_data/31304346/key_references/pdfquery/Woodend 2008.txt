Patients with chronic conditions are heavy users of the health care system. There are opportunities for 
significant savings and improvements to patient care if patients can be maintained in their homes. A 
randomized control trial tested the impact of 3 months of telehome monitoring on hospital readmission, 
quality of life, and functional status in patients with heart failure or angina. The intervention consisted 
of video conferencing and phone line transmission of weight, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms. 
Telehome monitoring significantly reduced the number of hospital readmissions and days spent in the 
hospital for patients with angina and improved quality of life and functional status in patients with heart 
failure or angina. Patients found the technology easy to use and expressed high levels of satisfaction. 
Telehealth technologies are a viable means of providing home monitoring to patients with heart disease 
at high risk of hospital readmission to improve their self-care abilities. (Heart Lung® 2008;37:36 – 45.) 

be the biggest operational and financial chal- 
lenge facing the health care delivery system 
in the next decade. Approximately 1 in 100 of the 
general population and 1 in 10 of the elderly have 
heart failure (HF), and repeat admissions for HF are 
common.1 Studies of HF report readmission rates as 
high as 47% within 3 months2 and 54% within 6 
months.3,4 This 
represents a significant use of 
health care resources. The literature on hospital 
readmission rates for patients with angina is sparse 
compared with the HF literature. At the University of 
Ottawa Heart Institute, 6% of patients with a most 
responsible diagnosis of angina are readmitted 
within 30 days of hospital discharge. Patients with 
unstable angina are more likely than patients with a 
myocardial infarction to experience an unplanned 
readmission to a coronary care unit.5 
Reductions in readmission rates among patients 
with HF have been demonstrated with both home-

based programs and telehome monitoring.6-10 The 
effects of multidisciplinary home-based interven- 
tions in the population with HF have also been 
shown to be sustained for periods of at least 18 
months, resulting in both reduced hospital-based 
costs and mortality.11 Although it is clear that 
multidisciplinary, home-based, non-telehealth in- 
terventions are effective in reducing readmissions 
and overall hospital costs in patients with heart 
disease and especially HF, these interventions can 
themselves be costly and are not accessible by all 
patients. Allen et al12 determined that as many as 
46% of home visits could be replaced by telenursing. 
Patients with heart diseases (HF, hypertension, and 
other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease) were 
among those for whom telenursing was considered 
most appropriate. 
Telehome monitoring has been demonstrated to 
improve quality of care in patients with cardiac 
disease. Patients with coronary heart disease who 
participated in a 3-month transtelephonically mon- 
itored rehabilitation program had exercise and 
quality of life improvements comparable with pa- 
tients who participated in on-site rehabilitation pro- 
grams. Shah et al13 demonstrated a reduction in 
both the number of hospitalizations and the length 
of hospitalization in 27 patients with HF who par- 
ticipated in a home-monitoring program. High lev- 
els of patient satisfaction with this approach to care 
have also been demonstrated.14-16 


Early reports from studies in the United King- 
dom,17 Australia,18 Canada (Edmonds et al, 1998),19 
and the United States20,21 support the use of home 
monitoring as a means to improve triage and access 
to appropriate health care facilities. There are op- 
portunities for significant savings to the health care 
system and improvements to patient care if patients 
can be carefully maintained in their homes through 
triage and home-monitoring programs.13,14 
The objective of this study was to determine 
whether telehome monitoring of patients with car- 
diac disease at high risk of readmission would re- 
duce hospital readmissions, improve functional sta- 
tus, and improve quality of life over usual care. 

This was a randomized controlled trial in which 
patients were randomly allocated to the study inter- 
vention (telehome monitoring) or usual care. Ran- 
domization was stratified by primary discharge di- 
agnosis; an equal number of patients with HF and 
patients with angina were randomly allocated to 
receive home monitoring, and equal numbers were 
allocated to usual care. Patients were identified in 
the hospital and approached during their hospital 
admission for consent to participate in this study. 
Detailed information, including demographic data, 
medical history, results of laboratory and cardiac 
tests, and hospital course, was collected before dis- 
charge. The research was approved by the Human 
Research Ethics Board of the University of Ottawa 
Heart Institute. 

Patients were considered for admission to the 
study if they had symptomatic HF (New York Heart 
Association [NYHA] Class II or greater) or angina 
(Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] Class I or 
greater scheduled to return for revascularization, or 
CCS Class II or greater angina being discharged on 
medical treatment). 
In addition, they had to be 
capable of reading and writing either English or 
French, live within 100 km (by road) of the University 
of Ottawa Heart Institute, and provide informed 
consent. Patients were excluded if they were being 
discharged from the hospital to another institution 
or long-term care facility. 

The intervention consisted of 3 months of video 
conferencing with a nurse, daily transmission of 
weight and blood pressure, and periodic transmis- 
sion of 12-lead electrocardiogram. A technician vis- 
ited the patient’s home within 48 hours of discharge 
to set up the home-monitoring equipment and train 
the patient in its use. Video conferences were held 
at least weekly with each patient and included an 
assessment of the patient’s progress and self-care 
education by the telehome-care nurse. Electronic 
records, including nurses’ notes, were maintained 
for each patient. Conferences were more frequent in 
the first few weeks after discharge and tapered over 
the 3-month period. Video conferencing was done 
by standard telephone 
lines. Weigh scales and 
blood pressure and electrocardiogram machines 
were all electronic, and data were transmitted by 
telephone lines to a central station that held the 
electronic patient record at the Heart Institute. 
Protocols were developed to guide both the fre- 
quency and the content of each patient contact. The 
educational content and timing of teaching for pa- 
tients with HF and patients with angina were struc- 
tured so that the content was covered within the 
first 8 weeks of monitoring. Patient knowledge and 
understanding were then reassessed, permitting a 
further 4 weeks to revisit content areas that were 
less well understood. Triage protocols were also 
developed to ensure that responses to clinical is- 
sues (eg, shortness of breath, chest pain) were con- 
sistent across the two study groups. 
Patients in the control group received the usual 
care provided to patients with angina or HF dis- 
charged from the hospital. Per the intervention 
group, they were discharged to the care of their 
community physician or cardiologist. Some of these 
patients were referred to home care, as were eligible 
patients in the intervention group. All patients were 
given a 24-7 telephone number to access an ad- 
vanced practice nurse with questions related to 
their care. 

Outcome measures used to evaluate the effec- 
tiveness of the home monitoring included readmis- 
sion, health care resource use, morbidity, and qual- 
ity of life. These measures were selected because 
the typical concerns about these patient popula- 
tions are the “revolving door” problem of readmis- 
sions and frequent visits to the emergency depart- 
ment and the impact of coping with a chronic illness 
on the quality of daily living. Data were collected at 
1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postdischarge. Mon- 
itored patients were also asked how easy or difficult 
the equipment was to use and how satisfied they 
were with their care. 




Readmissions and health care resource use. Health 
care resource use, in addition to readmissions, in- 
cluded days in hospital (broken down into intensive 
care and ward care days), emergency department 
visits without admission, physician (specialist and 
generalist) visits, and home care services. Data were 
based on patient self-report at 1, 3, and 12 months. 
Symptoms and functional status. Morbidity was 
assessed using disease specific measures of func- 
tional status. The Minnesota Living with Heart Fail- 
ure (LiHFe) questionnaire (Rector et al, 1987)22 was 
used for patients with HF, and the Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire (SAQ) (Spertus et al23) was used for 
patients with angina. Both of these measures were 
available in English and French. 
The Minnesota LiHFe questionnaire is a self- 
administered, 21-item scale with a 6-point response 
format ranging from 0 to 5. It consists of a total 
score and scores for physical and emotional dimen- 
sions; higher scores indicate poorer levels of func- 
tioning. The LiHFe has been validated in a num- 
ber of populations with HF (Rector et al, 1992) 24 
and has been shown to be valid, reliable, and 
responsive (Rector et al, 1993). 25 The LiHFe also 
has high internal consistency when used in 638 
patients with HF; Cronbach’s alphas for the total, 
physical, and emotional subscales are 
.91, 
and .85 respectively.26 

The SAQ is a disease-specific, self-administered 
functional status measure composed of 19 ques- 
tions that take less than 5 minutes to complete. 
Higher scores on the SAQ indicate better levels of 
functioning. It quantifies five domains related to cor- 
onary artery disease: physical limitations, anginal sta- 
bility, anginal frequency, treatment satisfaction, and 
disease perception. All of the scales of the SAQ are 
significantly correlated with the CCS classification of 
angina.27 Each of these five domains has been vali- 
dated independently28 and shown to be both reliable 
and responsive to clinical changes.23,27 The internal 
consistency reliability of the SAQ ranges from moder- 
ate to good (.66 for treatment satisfaction to .89 for 
physical limitations).27 
Quality of life. The Medical Outcomes Study Short 
Form 36 (SF-36)29 was used to assess quality of life at 
baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months. The SF-36 is a 
36-item, self-administered generic measure of quality 
of life with eight subscales: physical functioning, role- 
physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social 
functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 
subscales are not combined to form a global measure 
of quality of life. This measure has been extensively 
used and validated in both well and chronically ill 
populations, including patients with HF.30,31 The in- 
ternal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of 
the eight subscales ranges from .73 to .95, with most 
greater than .80. Test–retest reliabilities for 2-week 
to 6-month intervals for the subscales range from 
.60 to .90. 

The number of patients we planned to enroll in 
this study was fixed by the number of systems avail- 
able (n (cid:1) 20). Assuming that each patient would 
use the equipment for 3 months, we planned to 
enroll 160 patients (80 with chronic heart failure, 80 
with angina) in the intervention arm of the trial. 
Assuming the analysis is done within each diagnos- 
tic group (results are not pooled), and assuming 
that the family-wise alpha is maintained at .05, this 
would have yielded 80% power to detect a clinically 
significant decrease in admissions. 
All analyses were conducted on an intention-to- 
treat basis. The demographic and health character- 
istics of 
the home-monitoring and usual-care 
groups were compared, within diagnostic catego- 
ries, using chi-square and t tests. All analyses com- 
paring the outcomes of the home-monitoring and 
usual-care groups were done within the diagnostic 
categories (HF and angina). Repeated-measures 
analyses of variance (between and within) were con- 
ducted to assess differences between treatment 
groups, over time, and in functional status and 
quality of life. 

A total of 249 patients (121 with HF and 128 
with angina) were enrolled and randomized to 
receive 3 months of telehome care after discharge 
or usual postdischarge care. The mean age of 
patients with HF and patients with angina was 66 
years, and approximately three-quarters of the 
patients were male (Table I). Patients with HF who 
were randomized to receive telehome care were 
significantly less likely to have Class 3 or higher 
angina than those randomized to usual care. Pa- 
tients with angina randomized to receive tele- 
home care were significantly more likely to have 
HF than those randomized to usual care. Other- 
wise, the intervention and control groups were 
similar. Nine patients with HF and three patients 
with angina died during the study period; nine 
patients in the telehome care arm of the study 
and six patients in the usual care arm (not signif- 
icant) were lost to follow-up at 1 year.

*Statistically significant differences between telehome and usual care groups. 

Three months. For the patients with angina there 
was a 51% reduction in the number of admissions 
per patient with angina receiving telehome moni- 
toring compared with those receiving usual care 
(P (cid:1) .02). There was also a 61% reduction in the 
number of days spent in the hospital (P (cid:1) 
.04) 
(Table II). There was no significant difference be- 
tween patients with HF receiving telehome monitor- 
ing or usual care in the number of readmissions to 
hospital. Telehome-monitored patients with HF 
spent 28% fewer days in the hospital than usual care 
patients with HF within the first 3 months of dis- 
charge, but this difference was not statistically 
significant. 
One year. Telehome-monitored patients with an- 
gina had significantly fewer hospital admissions at 1 
year than patients receiving usual care (P (cid:1) .02); 
hospital admission rates were reduced by 45%. The 
number of days spent in the hospital during that 
first year did not differ significantly between the two 
groups of patients with angina. Telehome-moni- 
tored patients with angina spent 62% fewer days in 
hospital in the first postdischarge year, but one 
patient spent 228 days in hospital after surgery, 
skewing the results. When this outlier was removed, 
telehome-monitored patients with angina spent 
in the hospital than usual care 
21% 
patients, and this difference remained nonsignifi- 
cant. There were no differences between the propor- 
tions of patients with HF in the telehome group and 

the usual care group who were readmitted to the 
hospital within the first year of discharge or in the 
number of days they spent in the hospital in the first 
year postdischarge. 

Within the first year, 56% of all the patients with 
HF had made at least one visit to the emergency 
department compared with 35% of patients with 
angina. Patients with angina who received telehome 
.15 trips to the 
monitoring made an average of 
emergency department in the first 3 months com- 
pared with .35 trips for patients receiving usual care 
(t (cid:1) 2.012, P (cid:1) .037). Telehome-monitored patients 
with angina also made fewer visits during the first 
year (.31/patient) compared with usual care patients 
(.83/patient) (t (cid:1) 2.63, P (cid:1) .012). There were no 
significant differences between randomized groups 
in the number of emergency department visits made 
in the first month, 3 months, or 1 year after hospital 
discharge (study enrollment) for all patients com- 
bined or for patients with HF. 

There were no differences between the interven- 
tion and usual care groups in the numbers of visits 
made to cardiologists in each time period, nor were 
there any differences between the groups in the 
number of visits made to general practitioners.

all specialists) were combined, there were no sig- 
nificant differences between 
invention and 
usual care groups in the total number of visits made 
to any physician during any of the follow-up peri- 
ods. Patients with HF made significantly more visits 
to their family physicians within the first month, 
first 3 months, and first year than patients with 
angina. Patients with HF made more visits to their 
cardiologist than patients in the angina group. 

There were no differences between the interven- 
tion and usual care groups in the numbers of home 
visits or homemaking services provided for either 
patients with HF or patients with angina. More pa- 
tients with HF than patients with angina received 
home visits in each follow-up period. At 12 months, 
22% of patients with HF compared with 7% of pa- 
tients with angina had received home visits (P (cid:1) 
.003). Home visits included visits for either nursing 
or home-making. When home-making is looked at 
separately, there is no difference in services re- 
ceived between patients with angina and HF pa- 
tients at one month, but HF patients were more 
likely than angina patients to receive home-making 
services at 3 months (12% vs. 3%, P (cid:1) .008) and at 
12 months (13% vs. 4%, P (cid:1) .02) postdischarge.

between the intervention and control groups at 1 
month postdischarge in overall LiHFe score (P (cid:1) 
.18) or in the physical (P (cid:1) .063) or emotional 
subscales (P (cid:1) .60) of the LiHFe when controlling 
for LiHFe scores at baseline. Patients randomized to 
receive telehome care had significantly better func- 




of the subscales at 1 month and in only one sub- 
scale at 1 year after discharge. The magnitude of the 
absolute differences in quality of life between the 
intervention and control groups ranged from 4% to 
15%. The only subscale on which telehome-moni- 
tored patients had significantly better quality of life 
at all three points in time was the vitality subscale, 
which reflects the subject’s energy level and fatigue. 
Patients with HF in both randomized groups dem- 
onstrated significant improvements in quality of life 
over time in all of the SF-36 subscales. 
Patients with angina in both intervention and 
control groups demonstrated significant improve- 
ments in quality of life over time in all of the 
SF-36 subscales. General health was better 
in 
telehome than usual care patients at 1 and 3 
months postdischarge. At 1 year, the following sub- 
scales demonstrated higher quality of life in telehome 
than usual care patients: (1) physical functioning (P (cid:1) 
.04), (2) bodily pain (P (cid:1) .03), and social functioning 
(P (cid:1) .04). 
When data for both patients with HF and patients 
with angina were combined, patients receiving tele- 
home care had significantly better quality of life 
than usual care patients on most of the SF-36 sub- 
scales at all three follow-up periods (Table V). Qual- 
ity of life scores improved over time in both inter- 
vention and usual care patients. 

Overall, patients found the equipment was easy 
to use; the most difficult was the 12-lead electro- 
cardiogram. This latter required that the patient 
attach three electrodes to specific areas on his/her 
torso, attach wire leads from the electrode to a 
small box ((cid:6)3 (cid:7) 3 (cid:7) 5 inches), and hold this over 
three areas on their chest while pressing a button 
for a specific amount of time. Patients with arthritic 
hands found that pressing the button while holding 
the equipment, especially in the position under the 
left arm, was difficult. Patients also reported some 
difficulty with the c-phone (video-conferencing 
equipment), although this was most often related to 
difficulties in obtaining good signals over the tele- 
phone lines. There was a slight trend for older pa- 
tients than younger patients to report more diffi- 
culty using the equipment. 
Satisfaction was calculated as a sum of scores on 
10 questions related to satisfaction with various 
aspects of telehome monitoring, and scores could 
range from 0 (very low satisfaction) to 100 (very high 
satisfaction). The mean scores for all patients com- 
bined at 1, 2, and 3 months of monitoring were 92, 

tional status on both the overall score (P (cid:1) .003) 
and the physical subscale (P (cid:1) .001) of the LiHFe at 
3 months than patients receiving usual care. There 
was no significant difference between randomized 
groups in the emotional subscale at 3 months. At 1 
year postdischarge, the differences between ran- 
domized groups on the LiHFe and on its two sub- 
scales were not significant after controlling for base- 
line differences. 
Seattle angina questionnaire. Patients with an- 
gina receiving telehome care did not differ from 
usual care patients in anginal stability, anginal fre- 
quency, or disease perception at any time during 
study follow-up. Patients receiving telehome care 
consistently reported higher levels of treatment sat- 
isfaction than those receiving usual care and had a 
better exertional capacity at 1 year (Table III). Base- 
line differences in scores were controlled for in all 
analyses. 
Patients with angina experienced significant im- 
provements over the first year after discharge in all 
five subscales of the SAQ. The change in exertional 
capacity was greatest between the 3-month and 
1-year follow-up periods (effect size [ES] (cid:1) .41). The 
greatest improvement in anginal stability occurred 
between discharge and 1 month (ES (cid:1) .40), and the 
greatest improvements in anginal frequency (ES (cid:1) 
.40) and disease perception (ES (cid:1) 
.33) occurred 
between 1 and 3 months postdischarge (Table III). 

Quality of life was better in telehome-monitored 
patients with HF than in usual care patients on five 
of the eight SF-36 subscales at 3 months. This is the 
time period at which most significant differences in 
quality of life between the two groups were detected 
(Table IV). There were significant differences in three

tients with angina did not differ in their overall 
ratings of ease of use or satisfaction with telehome 
care. 
Monitored patients were also given the opportu- 
nity to complete open-ended questions about what 
they liked and disliked about telehome care. When 
asked what they liked, a random selection of pa- 
tients made the following comments: “It took away a 
lot of my worries and gave me confidence that I 
would have answers to my questions.” “The clarifi- 
cation of the medication prescribed by doctors. Dis- 
cussing my personal medical problems with the 
nurses and receiving their advice for my situation 
gave me assurances for improving my health in the 
future.” “It helped me to feel more at ease after leaving 
the hospital; it also eased my husband. There is some- 
one close at hand to answer any questions and offer 
advice.” “I understand better how to take care of my 
health.” When asked what, 
if anything, bothered 
them about being monitored at home, most pa- 
tients said “nothing.” The few other comments made 
included the following: “I initially wondered if there 
would be a cost. Also, I wasn’t sure as to whether it 
would tie me down.” “The commitment to schedul- 
ing certain times and dates for the video confer- 
ence.” “At first I was a little concerned about remem- 
bering the procedure, especially the ECG.” “Only 
poor quality of video. . . regular phone would have 
been fine.” 





Telehealth technologies are a viable means of 
providing home monitoring to patients with heart 
disease at high risk of hospital readmission, improv- 
ing quality of life and functional status, and reduc- 
ing hospital readmission in this population. 

Telehome monitoring significantly reduced the 
number of hospital readmissions, visits to the emer- 
gency department, and days spent in hospital for 
patients with angina. Contrary to expectations, a 
similar 
for pa- 
impact on hospital readmissions 
tients with HF was not detected. Although this find- 
ing is similar to DeBusk et al’s,32 it differs from the 
findings of a number of studies in this population, 
many of which included smaller numbers of pa- 
tients.13,20,33-35 A couple of these studies included 
only patients with “severe heart failure”35 or NYHA 
Class III/IV HF.33 In the study by Benatar et al,33 in 
which telehome care was compared with standard 
home visiting, telehome care significantly reduced 
hospital readmissions and lengths of stay in 216 
patients with NYHA Class III/IV HF. Cordisco et al,35 
in a nonrandomized study, found decreased emer- 
gency department visits and hospitalizations in 50 
telehome-monitored patients compared with con- 
trols. A large randomized controlled trial (n (cid:1) 1518) 
of a telephone-based intervention for patients with 
HF detected a significant 25% difference between 
intervention and control patients 
in HF admis- 
sions;36 we looked at all-cause admissions in the 
present study and were not able to distinguish 
between admission related to HF and admission 
related to other causes. When our study data were 
analyzed, including only patients with Class III/IV 
HF, there were still no differences between the in- 
tervention and the usual care groups in either the 
numbers of hospital admissions or days spent in 
the hospital at 3 months or 1 year. We might expect 
that patients with more severe HF would spend 
more time in the hospital, but NYHA classification 
was not associated with either the number of read- 
missions or days in the hospital at any time period. 
The differences in hospital readmission rates be- 
tween the HF intervention and control groups were 
small (5%); the number of patients with HF in the 
study yielded 80% power to find a 60% difference in 
admission rates. 
Similar studies have not been undertaken in pa- 
tients with angina, although Noel et al37 trialed 
telehome monitoring in elderly patients with vari- 
ous chronic diseases, including heart disease, and 
they found a significant decrease at 6 months in the 
numbers of bed-days of care and the number of 
urgent visits to clinics or emergency departments. 

Although the quality of life and functional status 
of all study participants improved over time, pa- 
tients who were telehome monitored for 3 months 
after discharge experienced greater improvements 
in both functional status and quality of life that 
those who were not. Telehome-monitored patients 
with angina had greater improvements in exertional 
capacity at 1 year and greater improvements in 
physical functioning, bodily pain, and social func- 
tioning. Because there are no published studies of 
the impact of telehome monitoring in patients with 
angina, comparisons cannot be made. Although 
both Noel et al37 and Chumbler et al38 studied 
mixed groups of patients, including those with heart 
disease, neither measured quality of life. Both did 
include measures of functional status; there were no 
differences between randomized groups in Noel and 
colleagues’37 study, and intervention patients had 
better functional status than control patients in the 
latter study.38 
Five studies of telehome monitoring in patients 
with HF have included measure of quality of life and 
or functional status.33,39-42 Two were small pilot stud- 
ies with insufficient power to detect differences,41,42 
and one study included 90 patients with no differ- 
ences between telehome-monitored and usual care 
patients in functional status, depression, or health- 
related quality of life.39 Barnason et al40 found dif- 
ferences, using the same equipment as in the 
LaFramboise study39 (Health Buddy), in the SF-36 
subscales for physical, general health, mental, 
and vitality at 3 months. Although Benatar et al33 
found no difference between telehome-monitored 
and standard home care patients in Minnesota Li- 
HFe scores after 12 months of follow-up, they did 
detect significant improvements in hospital anxiety 
and depression scale scores. 
Telehome-monitored patients with HF had greater 
improvements in functional status than usual care 
patients at 3 months, but differences were not sus- 
tained at 1 year. The greatest differences between the 
two groups in quality of life improvements also oc- 
curred at 3 months, although the difference in the 
vitality subscale was sustained at 1 year. This finding is 
contrary t o that of Stewart et al,11 who suggested 
that the effects of multidisciplinary home-based in- 
terventions could be sustained for periods up to 18 
months. Naylor et al43 followed patients with HF 




receiving transitional care and found differences in 
quality of life between intervention and usual care 
patients at 3 months; as in our study, these differ- 
ences were not sustained at 1 year. 
Although the intent of the study under discus- 
sion was to study the effect of telehome monitoring 
on outcomes, a great deal of the teaching that was 
done by the telehome care nurse focused on im- 
proving the patients’ self-care abilities. Unfortu- 
nately, no measures of self-care ability or self-effi- 
cacy were included in the study. A number of the 
studies of telehome monitoring have also included 
measures of self efficacy,33 confidence in ability to 
manage care,39,41 and treatment adherence 16,40-42 
with variable findings. 

Patients found the technology easy to use and 
expressed high levels of satisfaction with this ap- 
proach to care. Only patients in the telehome-mon- 
itored group were asked to complete patient satis- 
faction measures, so comparisons between 
the 
groups cannot be made. The SAQ does include a 
patient treatment satisfaction subscale. Patients 
with angina who received telehome care were sig- 
nificantly more satisfied with the treatment of their 
angina at all three 
follow-up periods than were 
those receiving usual care. 
Despite concerns that this older patient popula- 
tion would find the telehome equipment difficult to 
use and learn, the majority reported little trouble. 
These findings are similar to those of Finkelstein 
et al44 and somewhat better than in other studies of 
telehome-care. Agrell et al45 studied patients’ per- 
ceptions of home care using structured interviews. 
All patients were either very satisfied (67%) or 
somewhat satisfied (33%) with services they had 
received, with 93% saying they were willing to re- 
ceive home telecare services in the future. Patients 
perceived th at the presence of telehome-care equip- 
ment in the home implied 24-hour-a-day access to a 
nurse. Chae et al46 found that 72% of elderly pa- 
tients receiving telehome care were satisfied, with 
patients in their own homes (82%) being more sat- 
isfied than patients in nursing homes (50%). 

The major limitation to this study was that health 
care resource use data (readmission, days in hospital, 
physician visits) were based on patient recall. Patients 
in this study could reside within 100 road-kilometers 
and were admitted to many different hospitals. It was 
not feasible to contact each of these hospitals. Read- 
mission data can be obtained at the provincial level, 
but we did not have the patients’ prior consent, as 
would be required, nor did the study budget permit 
this. Finally, the study was not designed to determine 
what aspect(s) of the telehome monitoring influenced 
outcomes. Jerant et al,34 for instance, concluded that 
having access to video conferencing was not better 
than using the telephone, although both of these were 
better than usual care. Problems were frequently en- 
countered in videoconferencing, and study nurses had 
to use telephone interviews instead on many occa- 
sions. Use of telephones only would save money and 
time, but the study design did not permit us to inves- 
tigate this. 
Telehealth technologies are a viable means of 
providing home monitoring to patients with heart 
disease at high risk of hospital readmission to im- 
prove their functional status and quality of life, and 
to reduce hospital readmissions and emergency de- 
partment visits. Although the impact on quality of 
life in all patients and readmissions of patients with 
angina has been demonstrated, it is also important 
to demonstrate that use of this technology is cost- 
effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis of telehome 
monitoring using data collected in this study is 
presently in progress.
