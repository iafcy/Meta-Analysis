Editor's Comment: Smartphones have become ubiquitous in modern society and can be both an incredible convenience and an irritating
intrusion. In this fascinating report, Ginis and colleagues provide us a potential use for smartphone technology that may favorably impact
our ability to treat patients with Parkinson's disease. They describe the feasibility and effectiveness of a smartphone application, the CuPiD
system, in a controlled clinical trial comparing the use of the CuPiD system with personalized gait advice, carried out in a home environment. The results of their study are both interesting and encouraging. Further study of this unique technology is clearly indicated and
will be stimulated by this important report.

Background: Inertial measurement units combined with a smartphone application (CuPiD-system) were
developed to provide people with Parkinson's disease (PD) real-time feedback on gait performance. This
study investigated the CuPiD-system's feasibility and effectiveness compared with conventional gait
training when applied in the home environment.
Methods: Forty persons with PD undertook gait training for 30 min, three times per week for six weeks.
Participants were randomly assigned to i) CuPiD, in which a smartphone application offered positive and
corrective feedback on gait, or ii) an active control, in which personalized gait advice was provided. Gait,
balance, endurance and quality of life were assessed before and after training and at four weeks followup using standardized tests.
Results: Both groups improved significantly on the primary outcomes (single and dual task gait speed) at
post-test and follow-up. The CuPiD group improved significantly more on balance (MiniBESTest) at posttest (from 24.8 to 26.1, SD~5) and maintained quality of life (SF-36 physical health) at follow-up whereas
the control group deteriorated (from 50.4 to 48.3, SD~16). No other statistically significant differences
were found between the two groups. The CuPiD system was well-tolerated and participants found the
tool user-friendly.
Conclusion: CuPiD was feasible, well-accepted and seemed to be an effective approach to promote gait
training, as participants improved equally to controls. This benefit may be ascribed to the real-time

Further optimization of the system and adequately-powered studies are warranted to corroborate these
findings and determine cost-effectiveness.

2. Methods


In Parkinson's disease (PD), gait and balance deficits, and more
specifically freezing of gait (FOG), result in reduced quality of life

[1]. Exercise has been shown to improve PD motor impairments in
the short term [2,3]. Also, it has been suggested that exercise effects
can be enhanced by increasing subjects' cognitive engagement with
practice through the provision of cueing or biofeedback in PD [4,5].
Cueing is defined as temporal or spatial stimuli, which regulate and
facilitate repetitive movements by providing an explicit motor
target. Several systematic reviews indicate that different cueing
modalities have an immediate effect on gait and health related
quality of life (HR-QoL) [6e8], and increase retention of learning in
PD [9,10]. In addition, cueing reduces the severity of Freezing of Gait
(FOG) [9,11,12]. Biofeedback refers to the provision of external information during or immediately after movement, which supplements sensory (proprioceptive) pathways to guide motor
performance. Although augmented feedback has been shown to be
effective for improving balance [13e15] and gait [16], it usually
requires cumbersome laboratory setups and specialized healthcare
professionals to administer. Combined with the increasing prevalence of PD and the predicted shortage of physiotherapists [17],
new ways to deliver cueing and biofeedback seem therefore
warranted.
Current wearable technology in PD is mainly directed towards
long-term, home assessment of disease symptoms [18], rather than
therapy [19]. To our knowledge, only Espay et al. investigated athome training with wearable biofeedback technology and
showed it was effective to improve gait in PD, although a control
group was lacking [20]. In addition, FOG can now be detected
reliably in real-time using inertial measurement units (IMUs) in a
standardized setting, but home detection has not been investigated
yet [21,22]. A six week training period using a FOG specific
instrumented cueing method in the laboratory, found a reduction
of FOG episodes but no carry-over to daily life [23]. These results
highlight the challenge of designing appropriate technology, which
aims to address the needs of people with PD in the home environment [19].
[The current study is part of the EU-funded CuPiD-project (www.](http://www.cupid-project.eu)
[cupid-project.eu). Innovatively, and in line with recent evolutions](http://www.cupid-project.eu)

[24,25], we designed a gait training application not only with a
team of engineers and physiotherapists, but also with the active
participation of persons with PD. The technology integrates 3 main
functions: 1) measurement of gait in real-time; 2) auditory
biofeedback (ABF) on one or more spatiotemporal gait parameters

[26]; and 3) rhythmical auditory cueing to prevent or overcome
FOG episodes [22]. The aims of the present study were to test the
feasibility of training with the CuPiD system in the home environment, and to discover the differential effects of CuPiD training
versus conventional home-based gait intervention on gait, balance
and HR-QoL in PD. We hypothesized that both interventions would
improve gait and balance outcomes, as participants would be
stimulated to increase walking, but that the effects would be
amplified in the CuPiD group because of the cognitive engagement
by the wearable biofeedback.


2.1. Participants

Forty PD persons were recruited by telephone from databases of
the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven (Belgium)
and the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Israel) (Fig. 1). Participants were included if they were able to walk for 10 min continuously; had a score of 24 or higher on the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA); were in Hoehn & Yahr Stage II to III in ONstate and were on stable PD medication. People were excluded if
they had severe medical conditions affecting gait other than PD,
had hearing or visual problems precluding benefiting from auditory
feedback and were likely to change medication regimen during the
course of the study. Participants were allowed to continue with
their usual care including their regular physiotherapy. After baseline screening, participants were randomly allocated to the CuPiD
or control group per center by the researcher, who was not blind to
group allocation. A stratified blocked randomization procedure was
used (Hoehn & Yahr stage, having FOG or not). The study was
approved by the local ethics committee of the University Hospitals
Leuven and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. All participants gave
written consent according to the declaration of Helsinki.

2.2. CuPiD system

The CuPiD system consisted of a smartphone (Galaxy S3-mini,
Samsung, South Korea), a docking station and two IMUs (EXLs3,
EXEL srl., Italy) with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz (Fig. 2A in
Supplementary Materials). Technical features and algorithms
were first validated for the detection of gait abnormalities against
standard gait registration systems [26], and for FOG detection in a
laboratory environment [22]. Ten people with PD (5 from each
country) extensively tested the system prior to trial commencement. Battery life ensured a user-duration of up to 4 h.
Two applications were used in this study: the audiobiofeedback (ABF-gait app) and the instrumented cueing for FOGtraining (FOG-cue app). Feedback and cues were provided via
earphones or the smartphone's speaker. The ABF-gait app
contained:

1) A large touch-screen ”Start” button, establishing the connection
with the IMUs (see Fig. 2A in Supplementary Materials);
2) A menu of four training targets: cadence, stride length, symmetry and gait speed;
3) A ‘therapeutic window’ allowing calibration of feedback according to the individual's optimal gait performance [26], and
set per gait parameter as a percentage above and below the
median of every 5 steps (see Fig. 2B in Supplementary
Materials). Positive verbal feedback (in Dutch or Hebrew) was
given when gait remained within the therapeutic window,
diminishing with an exponential trend to prevent feedback
overload and maximize motor learning. Corrective verbal feedback was given when gait parameters fell outside the

therapeutic window. Fig. 3 shows training examples of 2 PD
persons (see supplementary materials).

The FOG-cue app contained:

1) A FOG detection sensitivity option, adjusted by the physiotherapist to low or high to accommodate excessive false positive or
false negative detections.
2) An exercise menu, including walking in a figure of 8, maneuvering through cluttered spaces and making turns with and
without responding to a visual GOeNOeGO signal provided by
the smartphone.
3) Intelligent cueing options, providing continuous cueing during
walking which faded when FOG occurred or was initiated when
FOG was detected (based on the participant's preference).

2.3. Intervention

2.3.1. CuPiD training
CuPiD group participants received weekly home visits from the
researcher during the six week of intervention. Participants were
instructed to walk at least 3 times per week for 30 min, according to
ACSM's exercise guidelines for health benefits [27]. They were
instructed to use the ABF-gait app, which provided feedback on


selected gait parameters during their walks. Participants with FOG
received instruction on how to avoid FOG and practiced for an
additional 30 min three times a week using the FOG-cue app,
similar to previous work [23].
The smartphone was carried in a pocket of the participant's
clothing, except for during FOG-training when the phone was
handheld (to see the visual signals). Participants were taught how
to apply the IMUs to their shoes (when using the ABF-gait app) and
above their ankles when using the FOG-cue app. A booklet with
pictures and personalized instructions was left in the home and
consultation by telephone was offered in case of difficulties using
the system. An optimal performance walk was performed during
the initial visit and repeated twice over the 6-week study period to
calibrate the ABF-gait app. Spatiotemporal parameters and FOGcue settings were on average 4 times adjusted by the researcher
during weekly visits.
Participants were asked to record the frequency and duration of
their training sessions in a diary. The CuPiD system also recorded
the duration of walks with the system. Training data were provided
in summary statistics, consisting of simple displays of positive and
corrective feedback received and number of steps performed.

2.3.2. Control training
The control group also received weekly visits by the same
researcher for six weeks and was provided with the same practice


-----

schedule, personalized approach and recommendations for
training, except for the CuPiD system. Control participants also
recorded the frequency and duration of their training sessions in a
diary. People allocated to this group were informed about the
documented effectiveness of the intervention.

2.4. Assessment procedure and outcomes

During the first session (pre-test), in- and exclusion criteria
were checked and baseline values of the primary and secondary
outcomes collected. The same outcomes were assessed after the 6
weeks intervention (post-test) and after a 4 week (follow-up)
period by the same assessor at each clinical center. Testers were not
blinded to group allocation. Measurements' order was standardized
within the test procedure and conducted when participants were
optimally medicated, about 1 h after PD medication intake.
Primary outcomes were gait speed under usual and dual task
(DT) conditions. We were particularly interested in detecting
changes in DT gait speed, as it may better represent improved gait
automaticity than single task outcomes. Participants were asked to
walk for one minute over an instrumented walkway (PKMAS,
Protokinetics, USA): (1) at comfortable speed and (2) while reciting
as many words as possible starting with a pre-specified letter.
Secondary gait, balance and HR-QoL outcomes included the 2

Minute Walk Test (2MWT) [28], the mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (MiniBESTest) [29], the Four Square Step Test (FSST) [30],
the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) [31] and the Physical
Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) [32]. FOG severity was determined by the New-FOG questionnaire (NFOG-Q) [33] and the Ziegler protocol [34]. Disease severity was quantified using the
Movement Disorders Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale e
motor examination (UPDRS III) [35]. Cognitive assessments
included Color Trail Test (CTT) A and B [36] and verbal fluency (VF)
scores in sitting and walking. Quality of life was determined by the
Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) [37]. At post-test, a 5-item
Likert scale investigated whether participants found the CuPiD
system user-friendly or not (1 ¼ no agreement and 5 ¼ total
agreement).

2.5. Statistical analysis

KolmogoroveSmirnov analysis and Levene's test evaluated the
data distribution. In case of abnormal distributions, non-parametric
analyses were performed. As this did not lead to different results,
only parametric test results are reported.
To compare baseline characteristics and adherence outcomes
between both groups, an independent samples T-test was used for
continuous and a chi-square for categorical variables. A 2 (group) by

3 (time: pre-test/post-test/follow-up) repeated measures ANOVA
evaluated differences for the dependent variables on the primary
and secondary outcomes, being the independent variables. Because
of the exploratory nature of this trial, Fisher's LSD post-hoc analyses were applied. Effect sizes expressed as partial eta squared (ɳ[2])
are reported for the most important findings. The level of statistical
significance was set at a ¼ 0.05.
We report the data from all participants who completed the 6
weeks of training (per protocol analysis) and also conducted an
intention-to-treat analysis with a last observation carried forward
method to impute missing values. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM, USA).

3. Results

Twenty-two participants were allocated to CuPiD, of which 20
completed training. Eighteen participants were allocated to the
control arm, all of whom completed training (Fig. 1). Reasons for
dropout (N ¼ 2) were unrelated to CuPiD in one person. However,
the second person was unable to cope with the CuPiD system
without supervision at home. Both training groups were similar at
baseline (see supplementary materials: Table S1). Fourteen CuPiD
participants and 10 control participants experienced FOG. Only 11
participants (29%) had used a smartphone before entering the
study.

3.1. Gait

There were no interaction effects for the primary outcomes
(Table 1), gait speed under single tasking (F(2,108) ¼ 1.11, p ¼ 0.34,
ɳ[2] ¼ 0.03) and gait speed under dual tasking (F(2,108) ¼ 1.14,
p ¼ 0.33, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.03). Also the group differences for the primary
outcomes, were not significantly different (Single tasking:
F(1,108) ¼ 0.15, p ¼ 0.70, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.01; Dual tasking: F(1,108) ¼ 0.19,
p ¼ 0.66, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.01). However, there was a main effect of time
(Single tasking: F(2,108) ¼ 14.31, p < 0.001, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.29; Dual tasking:
F(2,108) ¼ 9.57, p < 0.001, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.23). These results indicate that both
groups improved gait speed during single and dual tasking from
pre-test to post-test, whereby the CuPiD group improved their gait
speed with 9.0% and 13.5% and the control group with 5.2% and 5.8%
for single and dual tasking, respectively. Other gait outcomes
showed a similar pattern of results and most gait benefits were
maintained at follow-up in both groups.

3.2. Balance

A significant time by group interaction was found for the

miniBESTest (F(2,108) ¼ 3.73, p ¼ 0.04, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.11), indicating that the
improvement in balance for the CuPiD group was significantly
greater than the control group at post-test (Table 1). However, this
effect was not maintained at follow-up. This result was also reflected with a trend towards a significant interaction effect of time
by group for the FSST (F(2,108) ¼ 3.38, p ¼ 0.09, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.10).

3.3. Endurance

The aforementioned gait improvements were also reflected in
the 2MWT which showed a significant main effect of time
(F(2,108) ¼ 4.32, p < 0.005, ɳ[2] ¼ 0.11) as shown in Table 1.

A significant time by group interaction was found for the
physical health score of the SF-36 (F(2,108) ¼ 1.85, p < 0.05,
ɳ[2] ¼ 0.06), indicating that the control group experienced a decrease
in self-reported physical health at follow-up, while the CuPiD group
did not.
There were no significant between-group or within-group differences for FOG outcomes and cognitive measures. Intention-totreat analysis yielded similar results with the exception that the
time by group interactions for the MiniBESTest and SF-36 (physical
health) were no longer significant (both p ¼ 0.07).

3.5. Feasibility

Adherence data (Table 2) showed that the CuPiD group spent
less time training compared to the control group, while the number
of training sessions was identical (CuPiD: 28 ± 9 sessions; control:
28 ± 10 sessions; p ¼ 0.91). Training duration was based on the
CuPiD system logs for the CuPiD group, and diary data for the
control group. When checking for differences between diaries and
CuPiD logs in 13 CuPiD participants, diary notations
(701 ± 304 min) were not significantly different from CuPiD logs
(646 ± 254 min; p ¼ 0.25). Participants with incomplete diary data,
were excluded from this analysis.
In general, participants were very positive about the CuPiD
system, as scores on user-friendliness were on average above 4 on a
5-point scale. However, attaching and removing the IMUs and using
the CuPiD system without technical support resulted in more variable answers (Table 1). It was observed that participants with
previous smartphone experience had the least problems using the
CuPiD system. Some participants were so enthusiastic about the
system that they expressed disappointment after its withdrawal.

4. Discussion

This phase II RCT investigated the feasibility of the CuPiD system
and its effectiveness on gait and balance, compared to conventional
gait training in people with PD. The system was well-accepted and
showed to be useful for providing minimally supervised at-home
gait training. Both study arms improved on the primary outcomes
of gait speed under comfortable and DT conditions at post-test and
at follow-up. The CuPiD approach demonstrated to be better at
improving balance than conventional gait training in people with
PD.
Despite the non-superior findings of the CuPiD system for gait,
the results revealed a larger improvement in gait speed during both
comfortable (9.0%) and DT conditions (13.5%), whereas controls
improved gait speed by only 5.2% and 5.8%. According to the recommendations by Hass et al., the control group's effect sizes can be
interpreted as small [38], whereas those of the CuPiD group can be
considered as clinically moderate and as comparable to other

cueing and treadmill studies [9,16,39]. These results are the more
notable, considering that total training time was lower in the CuPiD
group, suggesting that the CuPiD system may have improved
training efficiency.
In contrast to gait, we found an interaction effect for the MiniBESTest balance outcome favoring the CuPiD group. However, it
should be noted that the between-group mean difference for the
MiniBESTest of 1.7 points is below the smallest real difference of 3.4
points [40]. CuPiD participants also tended to improve more than
controls on the FSST, another test of dynamic stability, requiring
fast steps in different directions over a small obstacle. Together,
these findings suggest that CuPiD induced benefits of dynamic
stability, which may be ascribed to the fact that CuPiD targeted
larger step sizes and greater gait stability.
There were no between- or within-group effects on FOG,
although pre-to post-test differences of 1.5 points in NFOG-Q scores
were found in favor of the CuPiD group. Since both groups devoted
less time to training FOG, it is possible that the dose was insufficient
to be effective. In addition, FOG training was only undertaken by 17
participants. Therefore, the study was not powered to detect significant differences.
This study showed that the CuPiD group trained as much as the
control group in terms of training sessions, but had a lower training
duration. Possible explanations could be related to the selfreporting of adherence, overestimating actual compliance for reasons of social desirability. However, when training diaries and
CuPiD logs were compared, no significant differences were detected, albeit in participants with complete diaries only. The fact that
CuPiD participants were aware that their training was logged, may
also have contributed to this finding. The number of training sessions was similar in both groups, indicating that the intention to
train was equal in both groups. Also, the reported training duration
is in line with earlier reported adherence of approximately 80% in
home-based PD interventions [41,42]. The CuPiD system was used
with minimal supervision, while most participants were unfamiliar
with a smartphone. Except for difficulties with the correct placement of the IMUs and the touchscreen the system was very welltolerated as indicated by the positive scores on the userfriendliness scale.
Lack of statistical confirmation of the CuPiD system's benefits
may indicate that it does not offer an added clinical value. Alternatively, the study may have been underpowered to show a surplus
effect. Post-hoc power calculations based on the DT gait speed results showed that 164 (82 per group) persons would be required to
achieve the desired power of 0.80 assuming effect sizes of 13.5% for
the CuPiD group and 5.8% for controls. However, when compared
against a passive control group, a total of 54 (27 per group) participants would suffice. Other limitations which may have influenced the trial outcomes, were the lack of assessor blinding for
group allocation and uncorrected post-hoc analyses for multiple
comparisons. Also, the placebo effect resulting from increased
attention during therapy was not controlled for and we did not take
usual care characteristics into consideration. Despite these drawbacks, we conclude that the CuPiD system was feasible for unsupervised home-use and was an effective approach for gait and
balance training in PD. Given the shorter training duration with the
CuPiD systems, these benefits may possibly be associated with the
online biofeedback model, enhancing training efficiency. Large
scale clinical trials to investigate its long-term use and costeffectiveness are indicated before future implementation can be
considered.
