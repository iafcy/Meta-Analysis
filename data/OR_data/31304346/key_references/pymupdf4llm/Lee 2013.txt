**INTRODUCTION**


Recent studies have suggested a favorable effect of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on patients
with cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of home-based
exercise training with wireless monitoring on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 55 ACS patients
undergoing PCI were randomly divided into home based exercise training with wireless
monitoring cardiac rehabilitation (CR, n = 26) and usual care (UC, n = 29). Exercise
capacity and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks. Change of
metabolic equivalent of the tasks, maximal exercise time and QOL were significantly
increased (+2.47 vs +1.43, P = 0.021; +169.68 vs +88.31 sec, P = 0.012; and +4.81 vs
+0.89, P = 0.022, respectively), and the change of submaximal rate pressure product, and
of submaximal rate of perceived exertion were significantly decreased (-28.24 vs -16.21,
_P = 0.013; and -1.92 vs -1.62, P = 0.018, respectively) in the CR group compared to the_
UC group after 12 weeks. CR using home-based exercise training with wireless monitoring
led to improvement of exercise capacity and QOL relative to conventional care in ACS
patients undergoing PCI. Our findings suggest that early scheduled CR may be considered
in ACS patients undergoing PCI.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**


The importance of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) recently has been
stressed among the approaches for proper cardiac disease management including diet control, medications, percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (1,
2). Although home-based, as is the case for in-hospital, CR has
been shown to improve exercise capacity and quality of life
(QOL) of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), those participating in CR programs have difficulties with compliance (36). Also, objective monitoring and exercise standardization is
difficult for home-based training because of individual exercise
prescription, self measurement of heart rates, heterogeneity
among patients, and lack of previous research on effects of
home-based exercise training for acute coronary syndrome
(ACS) patients.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects on exercise capacity and QOL of home-based exercise
training with wireless monitoring for exercise standardization
in ACS patients undergoing PCI.


**Study population**
The study participants comprised 60 ACS patients who underwent successful PCI at our hospital from October 2010 to May
2011. Patients were randomly allocated to either the CR group
or the usual care (UC) group. Twenty six patients in the CR
group and 29 patients in the UC group completed follow-up
and were available for endpoint analysis (Table 1). The reasons
for drop out of patients in the CR group were: inability to exercise due to general weakness (n = 2), dizziness (n = 1) and patient refusal (n = 1); one patient in the UC group was not able to
exercise due to general weakness. Patients between 18 and 80
years old with a diagnosis of ACS and having undergone PCI
were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: chronic stable angina pectoris or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
III-IV; left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%; chronic
renal failure; and inability to exercise.

**Intervention protocol**
The CR group received standard medical therapy and a CR pro

gram, which consisted of educational rehabilitation and exercise training. For educational rehabilitation, the researcher educated the subjects in person prior to their hospital discharge
on risk factors for heart disease, diet control, and how to institute exercise training.
From the second to the twelfth weeks after hospital discharge,
exercise training consisted of scheduled gait exercise at home
four to five times weekly 50 min each including flexibility exercise for 20 min (warm-up exercise for 10 min and cool-down
exercise for 10 min) and main exercise of gait for 30 min. Study
participants also conducted treadmill exercise once to twice
while in hospital during the study period. They were instructed
to perform for 2 weeks after hospital discharge the main exercise at home while wearing the wireless monitoring equipment
provided (HeartCall[TM], U-HEART, Korea) to check their heart
rates through electrocardiography. A phone call was made to
them once weekly for counseling, and to minimize risk factors
and establish exercise intensity in stages (Fig. 1).
Exercise intensity was increased in stages from 40% to 80%
based on heart rate reserve calculated by the difference between
maximum heart rate and resting heart rate, which was measured by a gradual symptom-limited exercise stress test. Target
heart rate was derived from the Karvonen formula: Target heart
rate = (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate) × percentage +
resting heart rate. Exercise intensity was 40% weeks 2 to 4, 50%
weeks 5 to 6, 60% weeks 7 to 8, 70% weeks 9 to 10, and 80% weeks
11 to 12. The UC group received ordinary medical therapy, diet
control, and conducted exercise at home on their own and without participating in a CR program.

chest, and the ECG data was sent to the server via mobile phone.

**Gradual symptom-limited exercise stress test**
Both groups twice underwent gradual symptom-limited exercise stress testing, at baseline and after week 12. The gradual
symptom-limited exercise stress test was conducted using the
modified Bruce protocol with a treadmill to examine exercise
load (Marquette, GE, Fairfield, CT, USA). Heart rate and blood
pressure were measured for two minutes during each exercise
stage using a 12-channel real-time electrocardiogram monitoring system and an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM,
GE), respectively. Exercise capacity was assessed by submaximal rate pressure product (RPPsubmax), submaximal rate of
perceived exertion (RPEsubmax), metabolic equivalent of the
tasks (METs), and maximal exercise time (ETmax). RPPsubmax
and RPEsubmax were measured at stage 3, and the 6-20 Borg
scale was used for the measurement of RPEsubmax.

**Quality of life questionnaire**
QOL of both groups was measured at baseline and after week
12 using a 20-item questionnaire by adding the scores corresponding to each answer. The QOL questionnaire, which was
independently filled out by all patients based on a previous
study (7) and with a Cronbach’s alpha reliability of 0.766, included: sleep, fatigue, anxiety, chest pain, nutrition, and social
psychological status.

**Statistical analysis**
All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 15.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL, USA). The sample size was determined using a statistical power of 80% and a type 1 error of 0.05. The Levene-test
for equal variances was used to verify homogeneity between
the two groups in terms of gender, age, height, weight, medications and risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.


-----

Paired t-tests were used to compare the changes in exercise
capacity, and QOL between baseline and after week 12 in each
group. Independent t-test was used to test the significance of
the difference between groups. The statistical significance level,
P, was set at 0.05.

**Ethics statement**
The study protocol was approved by the institutional medical
review board of Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center
(IRB approval No. 10-1019), and written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

**RESULTS**

The median age of the CR group was 54 yr with 85% male, while
the median age of the UC group was 57 yr with 76% male. There
were no significant differences between the two groups in hei­
ght, weight, and in distribution of medications and risk factors
such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia (P = NS). Baseline exercise capacity assessed by RPP­
submax, RPEsubmax, METs, and ETmax, and QOL were not
significantly different between groups (P = NS).

**Exercise capacity and quality of life**
The CR group showed significantly decreased RPPsubmax and
RPEsubmax (159.72 ± 41.11 vs 131.48 ± 22.06 bpm[․]mmHg,
_P = 0.002, and 10.56 ± 1.98 vs 8.64 ± 1.75, P < 0.001, respective-_
ly) and significantly increased METs, ETmax and QOL score
(7.14 ± 1.86 vs 9.61 ± 1.80, P < 0.001, 670.16 ± 153.42 vs 839.84 ±
106.65 sec, P < 0.001, and 56.31 ± 5.67 vs 61.12 ± 5.91, P < 0.001,
respectively) between baseline and after 12 weeks. The UC group
showed significantly decreased RPEsubmax (11.38 ± 2.32 vs
9.76 ± 2.01, P < 0.001) and significantly increased METs and
ETmax (7.07 ± 2.07 vs 8.50 ± 2.05, P = 0.001, and 676.66 ± 145.87
vs 764.97 ± 125.95 sec, P = 0.001, respectively) between baseline and after 12 weeks.

Furthermore, the CR group showed significant improvements
in the change of RPPsubmax (-28.24 vs -16.21 bpm[․]mmHg,
_P = 0.013), RPEsubmax (-1.92 vs -1.62, P = 0.018), METs (+2.47_
vs +1.43, P = 0.021), ETmax (+169.68 vs +88.31 sec, P = 0.012),
and QOL (+4.81 vs +0.89, P = 0.022) compared to the UC group
(Table 2).

**DISCUSSION**

Intervention programs including exercise and medical therapy
may prevent coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death.
Regular exercise training is in most individually recommended
to patients as intervention for coronary artery disease (8) aiming to induce various physiological adaptations, increase oxygen levels in the arteries (9), and decrease rate of perceived exertion during physical activities or exercise, thereby improving
cardiac exercise capacity. In the present study, the CR group
showed significantly decreased RPPsubmax and RPEsubmax
(-18.7% and -18.2%, respectively) and significantly increased
METs and ETmax (+34.6% and +25.3%, respectively).
In line with the present study, in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation for IHD patients had been associated with significantly improved exercise capacity (10-12). Previous studies, however,
were based on heterogeneous populations including ACS and
stable angina patients (6, 13), while the present study included
ACS patients only. In addition, in previous studies home-based
exercise training was performed through individual exercise
prescription, and heart rates were measured by the patients
themselves, whereas in the present study they were instructed
to use wireless monitoring equipment. Therefore, patients in
the CR group were able to reduce the anxiety they felt over exercise during the early period after discharge, and their heart
rates measured through monitoring verified whether their exercise intensity was adequate, which in turn enabled prescription of exercise intensity in stages.
Recent studies showed that QOL of IHD patients is improved

by a CR program even in patients with acute myocardial infarction (4, 14, 15). Similarly, in the present study, the CR group
showed a significant increase in QOL score (+8.5%). In most
IHD patients, anxiety over exercise, social participation, and return to their job during an early period after hospital discharge
may play a major factor that reduced their QOL. Possible explanations of improvement of QOL in the CR program are that the
invention program may ameliorate participant’s risk factors by
education and increase exercise capacity by gradual exercise
loading, resulting in improvement of their job performance and
a better QOL.
The timing and safety of exercise performance are an important aspect in ACS patients after hospital discharge. Previous
investigations have reported that the exercise program was laun­
ched at least 4 to 6 weeks after discharge (14, 15), whereas the
present study started the CR program in all patients 1 week after discharge without any cardiac complications. Furthermore,
most patients in the present study safely completed our CR
program without cardiac symptoms and only two patients in
the CR group complained of atypical chest discomfort. These
observations suggest that an individually tailored CR program
can safely be used in the acute phase (1 week later) after hospital discharge in ACS patients who underwent PCI.
Similar to the current study, Ades et al. (16) demonstrated
the favorable effect of cardiac rehabilitation exercise at home
on QOL using transtelephonic monitoring. The possible benefits of wireless monitoring include the ability to reduce the anxiety felt by patients over exercise during an early period after
discharge, to verify the adequacy of exercise intensity by measuring their heart rates through wireless monitoring, and to
prescribe exercise intensity in stages. These findings encourage
further research on wireless monitoring to allow safer physical
activity and exercise and popularization of wireless monitoring.
The present study has several limitations. First, due to the
short study period, comparison with previous studies on a
long-term basis was difficult. Second, because the subjects
were ACS patients, who are relatively poorly represented in
numbers among heart disease patients, the number of study
participants was too small to generalize its results. Third, although the patients performed exercise on wireless monitoring
equipment and were counseled and managed through phone
calls, quantification of exercise was difficult. Fourth, because of
the diverse patient job characteristics, standardization of individual job load was difficult. Fifth, although used in a previous
study (7), the QOL questionnaire used in the present study may
need further validation.
The present study assessed the effects of home-based exercise training by scheduled walking started at an early period after hospital discharge in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Compared to the UC control group, CR using home-based exercise
training with wireless monitoring can improve not only exer

cise capacity but also QOL in this patient subset. Therefore, our
findings suggest that scheduled early CR may be considered in
ACS patients undergoing PCI. In particular, the finding that patients were able to reduce their anxiety by using the wireless
monitoring equipment during exercise at home is considered
clinically meaningful and more studies on its clinical application are warranted to complement the present study.
