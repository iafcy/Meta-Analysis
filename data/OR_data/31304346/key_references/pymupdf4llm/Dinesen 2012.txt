Summary
We studied whether preventive home monitoring of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could
reduce the frequency of hospital admissions and lower the cost of hospitalization. Patients were recruited from a health
centre, general practitioner (GP) or the pulmonary hospital ward. They were randomized to usual care or
tele-rehabilitation with a telehealth monitoring device installed in their home for four months. A total of 111 patients
were suitable for inclusion and consented to be randomized: 60 patients were allocated to intervention and three were
lost to follow-up. In the control group 51 patients were allocated to usual care and three patients were lost to follow-up.
In the tele-rehabilitation group, the mean hospital admission rate was 0.49 per patient per 10 months compared to
the control group rate of 1.17; this difference was significant (P ¼ 0.041). The mean cost of admissions was E3461 per
patient in the intervention group and E4576 in the control group; this difference was not significant. The
Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to hospital admission were longer for the intervention group than the controls, but
the difference was not significant. Future work requires large-scale studies of prolonged home monitoring with more
extended follow-up.


##### Introduction

###### ..............................................................

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of
the most common chronic diseases worldwide and a
common cause of hospitalization.[1] It is estimated that 210
million people have COPD worldwide. In 2005, over three
million people died of COPD, equal to 5% of all deaths
globally.[2] In Denmark (population 5.2 million),
approximately 400,000 people suffer from COPD,
accounting for 20% of acute admissions to medical wards.
The admission rate for COPD patients within the first
month is 24%.[3]

improved health-related quality of life, improved exercise
capacity and reduced hospitals admissions.[4,5,6] A systematic
review of home telehealth for COPD patients concluded that
clinical heterogeneity was present in outcome measures.
Home telehealth was found to reduce rates of
hospitalization, emergency department visits and number of
hospital bed days, but there was considerable variation in
results among the studies.[7] Another systematic review of two
randomized trials and four evaluations of telemonitoring
concluded that studies are limited, that the benefits of
telemonitoring for COPD have not yet been confirmed and
cited the need for large-scale implementation studies.[8] A
small randomized clinical trial conducted on COPD patients
receiving tele-assistance in Italy has shown that the
intervention group experienced fewer hospitalizations
compared to a control group who did not receive
tele-assistance.[9] There are no randomized studies of COPD
patients participating in preventive home monitoring across
sectors in order to avoid admission to hospital.
The aim of the present study was to test whether

admission rate to hospital and the cost of hospitalization.
The study was conducted as part of the Danish TELEKAT
project (Telehomecare, Chronic Patients and the
[Integrated Healthcare System, see http://www.telekat.eu).](http://www.telekat.eu)
The TELEKAT project seeks to develop a preventive
home monitoring concept for COPD patients. Patients
perform self-monitoring and rehabilitation activities
in their homes so that they can avoid admission to
hospital.

##### Methods

###### ..............................................................

A randomized controlled trial of the tele-rehabilitation
programme was conducted. Approval was obtained from the
appropriate ethics committee. The patients participating in
the study were selected according to the following inclusion
criteria:

(1) Over 18 years;
(2) Can understand oral and written trial information;
(3) Diagnosed COPD[10] in stage III or IV (severe or very
severe COPD);
(4) COPD as primary cause of reduction in function.

Exclusion criteria were as follows:

(1) Living outside Aalborg Municipality;
(2) Heart disease that could limit physical function;
(3) Mental illness;
(4) Terminal malignant disease;
(5) Severe rheumatoid arthritis;
(6) Pregnancy.

###### Randomization

For power calculations, our goal was to detect a 10% change
in the patients’ quality of life with 90% power for exposing
differences with a P value of 5%. When using health-related
quality of life (Short Form Health Survey - SF36), a typical
drop-out rate of 10% was expected, which is why it was
planned to include 66 patients in the tele-rehabilitation and
control group. The results on health-related quality of life
will be reported in a future paper.
The COPD patients were recruited to the study from
a health centre, general practitioner (GP) or the
pulmonary hospital ward. After confirming eligibility and
obtaining written informed consent, the patients drew
envelopes to see which group they would attend. The
envelopes were sealed and therefore the allocation was
blinded for health-care professionals, patients and
researchers.
COPD patients in the tele-rehabilitation group were
offered the possibility of carrying out preventive
self-monitoring using a telehealth monitor. The control

###### Procedure

After the patients were enrolled in the study, the doctor
collected baseline clinical data. The tele-rehabilitation
group had a telehealth monitoring device installed in their
home for four months, and a doctor prescribed how often
the individual patient had to measure values during a week.
Patients were instructed to monitor their symptoms so that
they could contact their GP or health-care professionals at
hospitals at an earlier stage than usual, in order to start
treatment and avoid hospitalization. On installing the
telehealth equipment in the home, the patient was taught
how to measure the clinical values, how to use a step
counter and was advised on how to exercise. In order to
provide the patients with standardized information on
exercises, they were given a set of instructional guidelines
from the Danish Lung Association. The exercises included
sitting exercises on a chair, stretching of neck muscles,
exercises for the legs, standing exercises for arms and chest
cavity, and walking exercises. A calibration exercise was
conducted with the patients and their relatives in order to
avoid information bias.
Using wireless technology, the telehealth monitor can
collect and transmit data via a secure line. The data,
including the patient’s blood pressure, pulse, weight,
oxygen level and lung function (spirometry) were sent to a
web-based portal or to the patient’s electronic health care
record. Health-care professionals such as GP, district nurses,
nurses and doctors at the health-care centre or hospital
could assess the patient’s data, monitor the patient’s
disease and training inputs, and provide advice to the
patient. The patients and relatives could also view the data
on the web portal and decide with whom they want to share
their data, but this was based on the patient’s written
consent.
Once per month, a tele-rehabilitation team consisting
of health-care professionals from primary and secondary
care held a video meeting in order to coordinate and
discuss the COPD patients’ individual rehabilitation
programme. The video meetings operated with a
standardized agenda.
The control group, after inclusion in the study, was
instructed on performing home exercises. Each patient was
then made responsible for performing the activities by
themselves, and they had no planned contact with healthcare professionals regarding their home exercises. Both the
intervention and control groups were informed that if they
needed urgent treatment, they should contact their GP or
an emergency doctor.

###### Admission rates and costs

Data on admission were collected over a 10-month period,
beginning from the time when the patients were included
in the study. The admission rate was defined as the number
of participants admitted to hospital during a 10-month
follow-up period. The cost of hospitalization was estimated
i l i ifi i b d (D i h

DRG codes). The data were accessed via a database in the
regional office responsible for collecting and storing the
patients’ personal data on hospital admissions and bed days
of care. The mean cost of hospitalization for each group was
calculated for the 10-month follow-up period by dividing
the total costs by the number of hospitalized patients.

###### Statistical analysis

The intention to treatment approach was also used in order
to compare patients according to the group to which they
were randomly allocated, regardless of patients’ compliance,
withdrawal from the study or crossover to other treatments.
The intention to treatment emphasizes greater
accountability for all patients entered into the study and
minimizes the influence of drop-outs and patients lost to
follow up.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the
probabilities of admission over time. A log-rank test was
applied to compare Kaplan-Meier estimates for the two groups.
Statistical analyses were carried out using a standard package
(Stata version 11, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

##### Results

###### ..............................................................

Due to lack of time we did not succeed in recruiting 132
patients as planned. A total of 111 patients were suitable for
inclusion and consented to be randomized. 60 patients were
allocated to intervention and three were lost to follow up
due to worsening in their disease. Thus the intervention
group consisted of 57 patients. In the control group 51
patients were allocated and three patients were lost to follow
up due to personal reasons. Thus the control group
consisted of 48 patients. In Table 1 the baseline
characteristic of the COPD patients can be seen. Figure 1
illustrates the patient flow chart for the randomizing
process. Table 2 provides an overview of the patients
recruited to each arm in the study.

###### Outcomes

The admission rates and costs of hospitalization for the two
groups are shown in Table 3. There was a significant
difference (P ¼ 0.041) between the groups for the rate of
admissions.


The Kaplan-Meier estimates for the tele-rehabilitation and
the control groups are summarized in Figure 2. The
tele-rehabilitation group showed better progress than the
control group over a longer time period. However, there was
no significant difference between the groups (P ¼ 0.09).

##### Discussion

###### ..............................................................

Reviews[7,8,9,11] of home telehealth for COPD patients
indicate a lower level of hospital admissions compared to
patients who do not receive telehealth monitors, but these
studies are not similar to the present study. In the TELEKAT
project, a preventive approach was used in the
tele-rehabilitation programme, and the study was
conducted across sectors. We have found no studies where
tele-rehabilitation was conducted across sectors with
representatives from the health-care centre, GP, hospital and
district nurses, and where the health-care professionals were
able to share data and meet virtually. The small sample size
in our study precluded us from conducting a subgroup
analysis on disease severity and health sector.
Overall, the tele-rehabilitation group had an admission
rate of 0.48 per 10 months compared to 1.17 for the control
group. There was also a trend towards the tele-rehabilitation
group having a longer time to first admission to hospital
than the control group (see Figure 2) with a lower proportion
of telerehabilitation patients admitted to hospital.
There was a drop out of three patients in both the trial
groups. The patients gave reasons such as worsening in their
disease and personal reasons for dropping out. Although
relatively few patients dropped-out of the study, the matter
requires consideration. Is preventive home monitoring for
everybody? If they have worsening symptoms, do patients
have the psychological capacity to monitor themselves and
accept the associated responsibility? This raises the question
of whether we need to screen patients more intensively
before offering them home monitoring. We have not been
able to find studies that focus on this question.
The long-term effect of tele-rehabilitation needs to be
addressed in studies, using a longer duration of home
monitoring and a more extended period of follow-up. There
is a need for large scale randomized studies in multicentre
settings in order to obtain solid evidence for implementing
tele-rehabilitation. Polisena et al.[12], in an economic review,

found that most studies of home telehealth resulted in
savings when seen from a health-care system and provider
perspective. They thus concluded that home telehealth has
the potential to reduce health-care costs.
Our own qualitative analysis of COPD patients in the
TELEKAT project[13] found that preventive home monitoring
taught many patients to identify symptoms at an earlier
stage so that they contacted a doctor. The patients reported
that the technology helped them to visualize the data and
obtain an overview of the development of symptoms. Most
of the patients reported feeling empowered to handle their
illness in their everyday lives, and better equipped to avoid
re-hospitalization. They also reported that their interaction
with the health-care professionals[14] became a mutual
learning process and that their relationship moved from
subservience to a medical authority to a more reciprocal
dialogue with nurses, doctors and health-care providers.
This helped them to better manage their illness in everyday
life. The fact that most of the COPD patients felt empowered
to deal with their illness in their everyday lives may help to
explain why patients’ admission rates decreased. However,
the question is how long will this period of empowerment
last? It is necessary to study the effects of the intervention
over a longer time period in order to be able to assess the
long-term effect of preventive home monitoring.
Learning from the TELEKAT study[14] shows that telehealth
technologies promote patient engagement in handling
their own disease and taking more responsibility. However
our study also shows that the technology cannot stand
alone as it has to be combined with a programme for
rehabilitation activities, continuous dialogues and contact
with health-care professionals.

###### Conclusion

The tele-rehabilitation group had significantly fewer
admissions during the 10-month follow-up period. The
tele-rehabilitation group also improved more than the
control group for a longer period, with a lower proportion
of them in need of hospitalization. Future work requires
large-scale studies of prolonged home monitoring and more
extended follow-up.
