**Abstract**
**Background: Online social networks (OSNs) are a new, promising approach for catalyzing health-related behavior change.**
To date, the empirical evidence on their impact has been limited. Purpose: Using a randomized trial, we assessed the impact
of a health-oriented OSN with accelerometer and scales on participant’s physical activity, weight, and clinical indicators.
**Methods: A sample of 349 PeaceHealth Oregon employees and family members were randomized to the iWell OSN or a**
control group and followed for 6 months in 2010-2011. The iWell OSN enabled participants to connect with “friends,” make
public postings, view contacts’ postings, set goals, download the number of their steps from an accelerometer and their
weight from a scale, view trends in physical activity and weight, and compete against others in physical activity. Both control
and intervention participants received traditional education material on diet and physical activity. Laboratory data on weight
and clinical indicators (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, or low-density lipoprotein), and self-reported data on physical
activity, were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: At 6 months, the intervention group increased leisure
walking minutes by 164% compared with 47% in the control group. The intervention group also lost more weight than the
controls (5.2 pounds compared with 1.5 pounds). There were no observed significant differences in vigorous exercise or
clinical indicators between the 2 groups. Among intervention participants, greater OSN use, as measured by number of
private messages sent, was associated with a greater increase in leisure walking and greater weight reduction over the study
period. Conclusions: The study provides evidence that interventions using OSNs can successfully promote increases in
physical activity and weight loss.

Since the mid-1980s, the prevalence of obesity among
adults in the United States has more than doubled.[1,2] Obesity is now implicated in approximately 15% of deaths,
making it the second leading actual cause of mortality in the
United States after tobacco.[3]

A landmark 2007 study found that social networks may
play an important role in obesity.[4] Using 31 years of data
from the Framingham Heart Study, Christakis and Fowler[4]
found that an individual’s likelihood of becoming obese
was highly influenced by whether or not someone in their
social network became obese. The impact was stronger
when a closer friend or a friend of the same sex became
obese. The authors argue that if social networks could contribute to the obesity epidemic, networks should also be
able to be used to spread positive health behaviors and curb
the obesity epidemic.
Research on the health and behavioral impacts of social
networks was published just as online social networks
(OSNs) exploded in popularity. OSNs allow people


to construct an online profile within a bounded system,
connect with or “friend” other users, communicate via the
website with other members, post announcements to one’s
network or all viewers, and view information about their
network.[5] The technology also enables uploads of data
from devices such as accelerometers and scales. In 2011, a
Pew Internet survey reported that 65% of US adults who
are online (78% of all adults are online) use OSNs like
Facebook or Twitter, up from 16% in 2006.[6,7] There have

been calls for public health interventions to take advantage
of OSNs to influence behavior through support, information transfer, social influence, modeling, and transmission
of social norms.[8,9]

Research into the public health uses of OSNs is just
starting to be published and is still primarily descriptive.
Studies have demonstrated that an existing smoking cessation OSN has the characteristics required for sustainability
of social support and social influence, and that using
Facebook for a wellness intervention is possible but
requires allowing users to limit which members of their
network can view their participation.[10-12] Studies are only
beginning to examine the impacts of social networks and
few have yet taken advantage of the abundance of data collected by OSNs. A recent study by Graham et al[13] found no
additional benefit of OSN compared to an online smoking
cessation program.
This study is a randomized trial of a health-oriented
OSN, iWell.[14] The iWell OSN combined an online platform
for social networking with an accelerometer and a weight
scale that both wirelessly uploaded data for tracking over
time. The goal of this study was to examine whether the
intervention group had greater increases in physical activity, weight loss, and improvements in clinical indicators
over 6 months compared with those in the control group,
who did not use the iWell OSN. Furthermore, the study
examined the extent to which use of the social network was
associated with weight loss and physical activity among
those in the intervention group.

## Methods

This 6-month randomized trial of the iWell OSN was conducted in 2010-2011. Following enrollment, participants
were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group
and followed over 6 months. Participation included providing laboratory samples at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months
(at no cost to the participant). The study was approved by
the Human Subjects’ Committees of PeaceHealth and the
University of Oregon and was registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov in October 2010.
All participants received printed lifestyle guidelines on
diet and exercise during their first study visit. These materials included a sample daily meal plan with recommended
serving sizes, a handout about recommended daily levels of
exercise, and a number of articles about the benefits of exercise and healthy eating.[15-17]

Intervention participants were provided access to the
iWell OSN and were given an accelerometer that allowed
them to capture their physical activity or “steps” for upload
to the iWell OSN and a wireless weight scale for uploading
weight data. With the iWell OSN, participants could connect (“friend”) others in the network, send individual messages to their friends, make public postings, view their


_J_ _f_ _y_ _y_ _( )_

contact’s postings, view their physical activity or “steps,”
view their weight, and compete against others in the network on the number of “steps” walked or run. The iWell
OSN also allowed participants to set individual healthrelated goals and to receive motivational messages.

## Study Sample

Participants were recruited from PeaceHealth Oregon
employees and their family. Participants were between 18
and 79 years old, had stable medication for 3 months, and
had expressed concern about their weight or health in an
online screener survey. People with prior bariatric surgery,
20 or more pounds of weight loss in the prior 3 months, or
serious health issues (eg, recent cardiovascular event, cancer, or bipolar disorder) were excluded. All participants
were compensated with a cookbook at their 3-month follow-up and a $25 Amazon.com gift card at the 6-month
follow-up.
At baseline, 513 people enrolled in the study. A total of
349 people, or 68%, participated for the full 6 months and
are included in the analysis. Equal percentages of intervention and control group participants dropped out of the
study (32%). Those who stopped participating were not
significantly different from those who continued in terms
of baseline physical activity levels, clinical indicators, or
gender. They did, on average, have higher baseline body
mass index than those who participated for the full 6
months (33 vs 31 kg/m[2]) and they were younger.

## Independent Variables

The main independent variable was whether or not the participant was randomized to the intervention or control
group. For the supplementary analyses among the intervention group—which examined how use of the iWell OSN
was related with weight loss and physical activity—the
number of number of messages participants sent to individuals in the iWell OSN and the number of uploads of
accelerometer data were examined.

## Dependent Variables

Dependent measures included study participants’ physical
activity, weight, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Weight, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured by staff at the
PeaceHealth Laboratory.
A comprehensive, validated self-report measure called
the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing
Physical Activity (SQUASH) was used to measure physical activity.[18] Respondents completed the SQUASH online,
separate from the laboratory data collection, and unfortunately 25% of participants failed to complete the SQUASH
surveys.

aNo differences between intervention and control groups were statistically significant.


## Analytic Approach

Initially, the intervention and control groups’ demographic
characteristics and baseline dependent variables were compared to assess the similarity of the 2 groups.
To test the impact of the intervention, the dependent
variables were examined at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6
months. Independent sample _t tests were used to assess_
whether there was greater change for the intervention
group compared with the control group. The principal analysis included the sample of 349 study participants, who
participated in the study for the full 6 months. Supplementary
intention-to-treat analyses were consistent with what is
presented in the primary analyses and are available on
request from the authors.
Regression models were developed to examine the relationship between use of the iWell OSN and accelerometer,
and increases in leisure time walking and weight loss over
the study period among the intervention participants. Two
independent variables were used. One measure of OSN use
was selected because of the high correlation between
potential measures, which would result in problems
with multicollinearity. The number of private messages
participants sent to others in the iWell OSN (as recorded by
the OSN) was selected because it exhibited a strong relationship with change in physical activity and weight change
in bivariate analyses. The second measure was the number


of uploads of accelerometer data. Control variables in the
regression models included gender, age-group, and whether
or not the participant had a body mass index ≥30 kg/m[2] at
baseline.

## Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study sample, who
were overwhelmingly female (79%), non-Hispanic white
(93%), and 50 years or older (60%). There were no statistically significant baseline differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of demographics or
physical activity, weight, or clinical indicators.
Table 2 shows that the intervention group significantly
increased weekly leisure walking from 129 to 341 minutes,
on average, a 164% increase over the 6-month study period,
compared with a 47% increase for the control group. The
intervention group had larger increases in 9 other areas of
physical activity compared to the control group; however,
none of those differences were statistically significant (see
the appendix).
The intervention group also lost more weight over the
6-month study period than did the control group (mean 5.2
vs 1.6 pounds). There were, however, no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in terms
of change in low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein values. Although the intervention group had a

significant reduction in triglycerides at 3 months compared
with the control group, it was not sustained at 6 months.
In multivariate regressions, the number of messages sent
by participants was positively related to increases in leisure
time walking minutes and it was negatively related to
weight change (Table 3). In other words, the more messages
a participant sent on the iWell OSN, the more likely he or
she increased the number of minutes walked, and reduced
his or her weight. None of the factors—the number of accelerometer uploads, obesity, age, or gender—was related to
change in leisure time walking or weight.

## Discussion

This study found that people randomized to a health-oriented online social network with an accelerometer and
wireless scale increased the amount of leisure-time walking
from approximately 6.5 miles a week to 17.1 miles a week
over 6 months. This was a significantly greater increase
than that observed within the control group, which increased
walking from approximately 7.1 miles weekly to 10.4
miles. Furthermore, those randomized to the iWell OSN
shed 3 times as many pounds as the control group (5.2 vs
1.6). The intervention, however, neither significantly
improved vigorous physical activity, such as running or
high-intensity housework, nor did it improve their triglycerides or cholesterol levels relative to the control group.
Intervention participants who used the iWell OSN more,
specifically sending more private messages, increased the
amount of time spent walking and lost more weight than


participants who used the OSN less. These findings suggest
a dose–response relationship, in which greater use of the
iWell OSN was associated with more minutes walking and
greater weight loss. OSNs may be an important way to support people in following through on their desires to increase
physical activity and become healthier.
Given the study design, the findings are generalizable
only to those who want to improve their health, which was
a requirement for study participation. The findings are also
generalizable only to similar OSNs with wireless devices
that enable uploading of physical activity and weight data.
Future studies may want to examine the impact of the OSN
separately from the wireless devices. Additionally, future
work should include more diverse study participants.
Other study limitations include the use of a self-report
measure of physical activity, which was used because the
control group did not have accelerometers and also because
accelerometers might have affected measurement of baseline physical activity. The SQUASH, however, is a reliable
measure, and in this sample, increases in reported walking
were positively correlated with weight loss. Another limitation was the relatively high attrition rate, though our intention-to-treat analysis resulted in substantively similar
findings. Future work should examine the extent to which
OSNs can promote long-term behavior change and sustained weight loss. Research is also needed to examine
whether OSNs can promote diet change in addition to
increased physical activity. This may result in more evident
changes in cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which may
be observed relatively quickly in dietary interventions.[19]

In summary, this study provides promising evidence that
OSN participation when paired with monitoring tools can
promote greater levels of physical activity and weight loss.
The development of strong, OSNs may be a relatively lowcost and scalable way to positively influence health-related
behavior.
