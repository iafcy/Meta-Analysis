**Study Objectives: First-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway pressure (PAP). Al-**
though PAP is a highly efficacious treatment, adherence to PAP is still a substantial clinical problem. The objective of this study was to determine
whether PAP adherence can be improved with a telemedicine monitoring system.
**Design: A nonblinded, single-center, randomized controlled trial that compared standard PAP treatment versus PAP treatment and a telemedicine**
monitoring system
**Setting: University sleep disorders program in British Columbia, Canada**
**Patients: Adult patients (≥ 19 yr of age) with moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 events/hr determined by polysomnog-**
raphy) prescribed PAP
**Interventions: Patients were randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating PAP machine or an autotitrating PAP machine that trans-**
mitted physiologic information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that could be reviewed. If problems were identified from
information from the website, the patient was contacted by telephone as necessary.
**Measurements: PAP adherence after 3 mo, subjective sleep quality, and side effects**
**Results: Seventy-five patients were enrolled; 39 were randomized to telemedicine and 36 to standard care. The mean age ± standard deviation**
(SD) was 53.5 ± 11.2 yr, mean AHI was 41.6 ± 22.1 events/hr, and 80% of patients were male. After 3 mo, mean PAP adherence was significantly
greater in the telemedicine arm (191 min per day) versus the standard arm (105 min per day; mean difference = 87 min, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 25-148 min, P = 0.006, unpaired t test). On days when PAP was used, mean adherence was 321 min in the telemedicine arm and 207 min in
the standard arm (difference = 113 min, 95% CI: 62-164 min, P < 0.0001). Significant independent predictors of adherence included age, baseline
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and use of telemedicine. On average, an additional 67 min of technician time was spent on patients in the telemedicine arm compared with the standard arm (P = 0.0001).
**Conclusions: PAP adherence can be improved with the use of a web-based telemedicine system at the initiation of treatment.**

**INTRODUCTION**
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease characterized by recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep,
leading to nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep fragmentation, and daytime hypersomnolence. Moreover, untreated OSA is associated
with numerous adverse health and safety consequences including stroke, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and motor vehicle crashes.[1]

First-line therapy for moderate to severe OSA is a positive airway pressure (PAP) machine, a portable device attached to the
patient with a mask and plastic tubing that establishes positive
pressure in the upper airway during sleep.[2] Although PAP is highly
effective in resolving upper airway collapse, a major clinical chal

lenge is maximizing adherence with therapy. Many patients discontinue or do not use the device substantially. This is of clinical
importance as increased adherence is associated with a reduced
risk of motor vehicle crashes, improved cardiovascular outcomes,
increased alertness, and improved quality of life.[3-5] Optimizing
adherence is thus an important aspect of patient management.
Adherence to PAP therapy is influenced by many factors,
including severity of the disorder, side effects, therapeutic response, claustrophobia, patient’s perception of disease seriousness, family support, and cost. Increased air leak with auto-PAP
therapy is associated with reduced adherence,[6] and general
management with interventions such as heated humidification,
mask optimization, and topical nasal therapy improves adherence.[7] Adherence can also be significantly improved by a comprehensive support program and timely interventions by health
professionals. This suggests that technical innovations that permit close monitoring of physiologic variables (such as air leak)
during therapy and rapid troubleshooting of potential problems
may improve adherence to PAP therapy.[8]

Telemedicine can be defined as “the use of information and

cultural barriers.”[9] Current technology enables PAP machines
to monitor applied pressures, air leaks, apnea hypopnea index
(AHI), and objective adherence, and to send this information by
modem to the patient’s healthcare provider on a daily basis. This
system should allow early detection of problems with appropriate
interventions thereby improving early experience with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and potentially improving
adherence. The primary purpose of this study was to determine
whether such a telemedicine monitoring system could improve
3-mo PAP adherence in patients with moderate to severe OSA.

**METHODS**
We performed a single-center, randomized controlled trial of
a telemedicine system versus standard care in patients with moderate to severe OSA. Patients were randomized to either standard care or telemedicine (1:1 ratio) using sequential numbered
envelopes prepared by one of the authors (JW). The study was
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia. The study was registered prior to patient
enrolment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00561860).

**Patients**
Patients were recruited from adult (≥ 19 yr of age) patients
with moderate to severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/hr by polysomnography (PSG) using the Chicago scoring criteria for the
determination of apneas and hypopneas, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine)[10] diagnosed at the Sleep Disorders Program who were seen by one of three respirologists
(JF, CFR, NTA) at the University of British Columbia (UBC)
between April 8, 2008 to June 1, 2010. Patients with OSA who
were prescribed PAP therapy by their regular sleep physician
and who were willing to accept a trial of therapy were potentially eligible for the trial.
Patients were excluded from participating if they were unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, had active
cardiopulmonary or psychiatric disease, had been previously
treated for OSA, did not have a telephone line in their bedroom
(necessary to transmit information by the modem), or could not
return for follow-up visits.

**Protocol**
All patients were oriented to PAP during a 20-min session
and fitted with a nasal or oronasal mask by the PAP coordinator from our clinic, who is a trained respiratory therapist with
many years of experience with patients with sleep apnea. All
patients were provided with a REMstar® Pro nasal CPAP
device (Phillips Respironics Inc., Murrysville, PA). These
types of machines are commonly used to treat patients with
OSA. The autotitrating machine monitors patient airflow
and adjusts pressure automatically to eliminate sleep apnea.
Specifically, the machines were set to autotitrate at pressures
between 6 and 16 cm H2O; this setting reflects our current
clinical practice to allow for an adequate range of pressures.
Patients were also provided with the telephone number of the
PAP coordinator who could be contacted if any problems or
questions arose.
Patients were then randomized to either standard care or tele

Patients were contacted after 2 days to ask about progress and
adherence, and to troubleshoot any problems with the machine.
After 4-6 wk of therapy, patients returned to the clinic to see the
PAP coordinator and their doctor, and information was downloaded from their machines. This information included a variety of physiologic variables, including PAP adherence, applied
PAP pressure, mask leak, and residual respiratory events. Any
problems with treatment were addressed at this time. After 8
wk, patients came to the research coordinator who downloaded
the machine information. After 3 mo of treatment, information
was downloaded from the machine and patients saw their sleep
specialist. An Epworth Sleepiness Scale score and a variety of
survey questions concerning side effects and sleep quality were
completed (see next paragraphs).

**_Telemedicine_**
Identical to the standard pathway, all patients were oriented
to CPAP, fitted with a mask, and given an autotitrating machine.
A modem was attached to the PAP device (EncoreAnywhere®,
Philips Respironics Inc.), and patients were instructed in its use
by the research coordinator. The modem was programmed to
send physiologic information directly to a web-based database
across the telephone line each morning (PAP adherence, applied PAP pressure, mask leak, and residual respiratory events).
Patients were contacted by the research coordinator after 2
days to ask about progress and compliance, and to troubleshoot
any problems with the machine. The research coordinator at UBC
reviewed the downloaded information every weekday morning
except holidays and contacted the patient if any of the following
were present: mask leak > 40 L/min for greater than 30% of the
night, < 4 hr of use for two consecutive nights, machine measured AHI > 10 events/hr, and 90th percentile of pressure > 16
cm H2O. The research coordinator called the patient and inquired
about symptoms such as dry mouth, mask issues, discomfort
with the device, or any other problems. If the only issue was low
adherence due to lack of motivation, the research coordinator encouraged the patient to use PAP. Otherwise, the research coordinator would discuss the case with the PAP coordinator (the same
person who helped care for the patient in the standard arm) and
arrange for the patient to talk with or visit the PAP coordinator,
depending on the responses from the patient and the physiologic
data. Specific interventions to improve compliance that would be
standard in our clinic (e.g., a different mask, chin strap, modifications of pressure settings, modifications of humidifier settings,
saline nasal sprays) would then be prescribed.
After 4-6 wk of therapy, patients returned to the clinic to
see their regular doctor and information was reviewed (including CPAP pressure, mask leak, residual respiratory events, and
compliance). Any problems with treatment were also addressed
at this time.
After 3 mo of treatment patients came to see their sleep specialist, who reviewed the data received via the modem. Surveys
and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (ESS) were completed
(same as the standard group).

**_Surveys_**
At the end of 3 mo, patients were administered the ESS. This

subjective daytime sleepiness. Scores range from 0 to 24, with
a higher score indicating greater sleepiness. Patients were also
asked to complete a variety of questions according to a visual
analog scale. There was one question that assessed subjective
sleep quality: “Overall, how satisfied were you with your quality of sleep on CPAP over the past mo? Place a mark on the
line”. Patients were asked to mark a point on the line ranging
from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). Seven additional questions elicited information about side effects
including frequency of awakenings, discomfort with the device,
difficulty exhaling, mask leaks, dry mouth, nasal congestion,
and difficulty falling asleep. These questions had a visual analog scale for every question, in which patients were asked to
assess a score between 0 to 10, with a higher score representing
a more favorable response.

**_Time spent with patients_**
We also recorded the amount of time our research coordinator or PAP coordinator spent with patients. Amount of time
spent was written in a daily log sheet. This included time spent
fitting masks, problem solving, talking with patients on the
phone, meeting with patients, and reviewing downloaded or
transmitted information.

effects, and adherence on days PAP was used. A multivariate
linear regression analysis was also done to assess independent
predictors of PAP adherence. SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC) was used for
the analyses.

**RESULTS**
Over this time period, 1,521 patients were seen by these physicians. A flow chart of patient recruitment is shown in Figure 1.
A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study. Their mean
age (± SD) was 53.5 ± 11.2 yr, and mean AHI was 41.6 ± 22.1
events/hr. Most of the patients were males. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. There was no significant difference in
age, BMI, AHI, or ESS in the groups.
Overall, adherence to PAP was significantly greater in
the telemedicine arm than in the standard arm (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Specifically, patients in the telemedicine arm used
PAP a mean of 191 min/day versus 105 min/day in the standard arm (mean difference = 87 min, 95% CI: 25-148 min,
P = 0.006). Furthermore, on nights PAP was used, time used
was much greater in the telemedicine arm (321 min/day) than
in the standard arm (207 min/day) with a mean difference of
113 min/day (95% CI: 62-164 min, P < 0.0001). There was
no significant difference in the percentage of nights PAP was
used (46% versus 56% in the standard versus telemedicine
arm). Mean AHI on treatment and change in ESS was similar
in both groups.
Patients with a greater ESS had improved CPAP compliance;
however, significant differences still persisted between the stan

a multivariate model using baseline ESS, age, and telemedicine use. All three variables were independently associated with
daily adherence (Table 4).
More time was spent with patients in the telemedicine arm.
Over 3 mo, an average of 210 ± 42 min was spent with each
patient in the telemedicine arm compared with 143 ± 48 min
spent with patients in the standard arm (P < 0.0001) (Table 2).
In other words, on average, an additional hour was spent with
these patients over the 3-mo trial.
Results of the sleep quality and side effects surveys are
shown in Table 3. Although side effects in general appeared to
be less severe in patients in the telemedicine arm, none other
than mouth dryness was statistically significant. Similarly, there
was no significant difference in sleep quality.

**DISCUSSION**
In our single-center, randomized controlled trial, telemedicine monitoring improved PAP adherence at 3 mo in patients
with moderate to severe OSA.
Telemedicine has been used in previous studies to promote
and reinforce CPAP therapy; the results have been mixed. Taylor and colleagues randomized 114 patients to either a telehealth
(intervention) arm or traditional care.[11] In the intervention arm,
a cognitive behavioral intervention was applied. Questions related to CPAP use and quality of sleep were sent to patients
electronically. The patients’ responses were monitored by a
sleep medicine practitioner, and the patient telephoned if necessary. Adherence was not significantly different between the traditional and intervention groups (4.22 versus 4.29 hr per night;
P = 0.87). Failure to show benefit may have been due to difficulties in contacting patients (sometimes delayed several days).
Furthermore, the intervention only provided self-reported data
to the healthcare provider; objective compliance and detailed
physiologic information (as was used in our study) may have
been more effective.
In a relatively small study, Smith and colleagues randomized 19 patients who were nonadherent with CPAP for 3 mo
to either a telemedicine intervention or placebo.[12] Both groups
were scheduled for telehealth sessions with a nurse (14 30-min
sessions over 12 wk) using a video teleconferencing system in
the patient’s home. The intervention group received specific
advice about CPAP, whereas the placebo group had advice focused on a neutral health topic (i.e., vitamins). Although the
numbers of patients were small, by the end of the study there
was a significantly greater rate of adherence (90% versus 44%,
P = 0.033) in the intervention group compared with the placebo
group. In a small study by DeMolles et al., a computer telephone system in addition to usual care was used in 15 patients
and compared to usual care only in another 15 patients.[13] The
group using the telehealth system had better CPAP adherence
by the end of the study that trended to significance (4.4 versus
2.9 hr/night, P = 0.08).
Sparrow and colleagues report on the use of a telehealth
intervention to improve CPAP adherence in a relatively large
randomized controlled study (250 patients with sleep apnea).[14]

ery wk for the first month and every month thereafter, patients
would telephone the system and report perceptions and experiences with OSA and CPAP (including compliance) over the previous week. Tailored feedback and counselling were provided
by telephone to motivate patients to use CPAP. The control arm
received general health information through the TLC system.
At 12 months, median CPAP use was significantly greater in the
intervention arm (2.98 hr/night versus 0.99 hr/night).
The potential mechanisms by which telemedicine improved
adherence in our study is open to speculation. One possibility
is that prompt attention to problems might have resulted in improved side effects. Consistent with this concept is the reduction in side effect complaints shown in the visual analog scales.
However, the overall effect was fairly modest suggesting that
other factors may also have been important. Another possibility is that the patients in the telemedicine arm, due to the daily
monitoring, might have had a greater sense of accountability
and were more motivated to not disappoint their healthcare
providers (an extension of the Hawthorne effect). Future studies designed to ascertain how much of the effect is contributed
from the monitoring of the physiologic variables, and how
much from the prompt interventions (such as mask change, intranasal saline, steroid spray etc.) would be useful.
Although adherence was improved, on average more time was
required to manage patients in the telemedicine arm. However,
the overall magnitude of this was fairly minor (1 hr per patient),
and we believe would be justified by the improved adherence.

**Limitations**
We acknowledge that there are many limitations to our study.
First, only patients with moderate to severe disease were included in our study and our results cannot be extrapolated to
patients with less severe disease. Second, this is a single-center
study with a relatively modest number of patients. Reproducing
these findings in other centers and patient populations would be
important to demonstrate generalizability. Third, adherence in
the standard care arm was relatively low (1.75 hr/night). However, this is similar to the adherence reported by the study by
Sparrow et al.[11] and other studies in the literature. Our low adherence might also have been explained by our low baseline
ESS scores, suggesting that our patients were not particularly
sleepy. In support of this concept, adherence was much greater in both treatment arms when only patients with a baseline
ESS of 11 or greater were included. Fourth, we did not have
a sham telemedicine control group (i.e., patients with the telemedicine device that was not being monitored by the investigators). Inclusion of such a control arm might have allowed
us to determine whether the increased adherence might have
been due to the perception of monitoring by the patients, or
the more prompt institution of clinical interventions. A future
study should also take into consideration both the monitoring

respective intervention (such as mask change, intranasal saline,
steroid spray, etc.), to determine whether it was the monitoring
alone or the interventions which may have contributed to the
positive findings.

**CONCLUSIONS**
In our single-center study, adherence with PAP was improved
with a web-based telemedicine monitoring system. Although
these findings must be verified in other centers, adoption of this
type of system could result in substantially improved care of
patients with OSA.
