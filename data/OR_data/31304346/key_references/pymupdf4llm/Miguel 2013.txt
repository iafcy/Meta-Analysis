#### Abstract
Objective: To determine if self-monitoring via home-based telehealth
equipment could, when combined with ongoing remote monitoring by
a nurse, reduce the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency
department (ED) presentations for people with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Subjects and Methods: A randomized
controlled trial was used to compare the outcomes for participants
receiving the telehealth equipment and monitoring with those for
participants in an information-only control group, over a period of
6 months. Participants receiving the telehealth intervention were
taught to measure and record their vital signs (blood pressure,
weight, temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) on a daily
basis. These were then transmitted automatically via telephone to a
secure Web site where they were monitored each day by the telehealth nurse. Results: The telehealth group had fewer ED presentations and hospital admissions and a reduced length of stay in
comparison with the control group. These results were not statistically significant. However, the reduction in health service use was
large enough to result in significant cost savings, with the annual
cost savings of the telehealth group compared with the control group
being $2,931 per person. Conclusions: Telehealth monitoring of
patient vital signs reduced health service utilization for individuals
with COPD and resulted in significant cost savings. In terms of
individual health benefits, improvements in participants’ selfmanagement behaviors and control over their condition was evident.

Key words: telehealth, remote monitoring, respiratory disease

#### Introduction

elehomecare is fast becoming a viable solution to the
problems faced by many community care agencies as the
population ages and we consider how we can assist people
living with chronic illness to manage their disease more

# Teffectively to improve their quality of life and reduce the demand on

health services. One of the growing areas of telehomecare is the remote monitoring of patients’ vital signs by a clinician using equipment installed in the patient’s own home. Remote monitoring has


gained momentum in recent years because it is seen not only as a way
of providing prompt medical intervention before deterioration in the
patient’s condition that can prevent unnecessary hospital admissions,[1] but also as a way of managing staffing shortages, reducing
costs,[2] and improving patients’ knowledge and self-efficacy.[3]

One particular chronic condition that requires ongoing selfmanagement to minimize morbidity and has begun to show positive
outcomes using remote monitoring is chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD).[4] COPD is a progressive and disabling disease that
causes restrictions in lung airflow. People with COPD can often suffer
from acute exacerbations, which are characterized by severe shortness of breath, coughing fits, and sputum production.[4] Not only are
these exacerbations costly in terms of increased healthcare utilization and hospitalizations, but they can also significantly reduce the
quality of life for the person living with COPD.[5]

Although there is a growing body of research on the benefits of
telehomecare for chronic conditions such as heart failure,[6] diabetes,[7]

and wounds,[8] there is still limited methodologically sound evidence
in relation to the benefits and financial viability of telehealth monitoring for people with COPD.[1] A recent systematic review of the
literature available on home telemonitoring for pulmonary conditions found only two studies that conducted a detailed cost analysis
of this approach.[9] They concluded that more evaluative research,
using larger samples sizes and more robust study designs, particularly randomized controlled trials, was required in order to confirm
the economic viability of this kind of telehomecare program.[9] Another review by Polisena et al.[10] also reported that although home
telehealth was generally clinically effective, the current evidence
regarding the effect on health service utilization was limited and that
once again more robust research was required.
This study therefore aimed to address this gap in current knowledge on health service utilization, cost-effectiveness, and any associated benefits of telehealth monitoring for people living with COPD.

#### Subjects and Methods
##### STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION
A randomized controlled trial was used to compare the outcomes
for participants receiving the telehealth monitoring with participants
receiving information only. The study was conducted by Silver
Chain, a large health and community care organization based in
Western Australia. The study population consisted of Silver Chain
clients who had a diagnosis of COPD, were receiving domiciliary
oxygen, spoke English, and lived in the metropolitan area. Clients
were excluded if they had dementia, were receiving palliative care,
did not have a telephone landline, or were unable to use the telehealth

equipment because of cognitive or physical impairment. Ethics approval for this project was granted by the Silver Chain Human Research Ethics Committee.

##### SAMPLE SIZE
Earlier analysis of Silver Chain client hospital admission data had
found an annual admission rate of 1.7 times for clients with COPD.
Previous research examining the impact of telehealth monitoring on
individuals with chronic disease has found a reduction in hospital
admissions of up to 68% can be achieved.[11] Anticipating a 45%
reduction in hospital admissions, it was calculated that 40 participants in each group were required in order to detect this difference
with 80% power and alpha = 0.05.

##### RECRUITMENT
Clients meeting the selection criteria were identified using Silver
Chain’s client information management system (ComCare) and were
then invited to participate by letter. The letter included an information statement and explained that a research assistant would telephone them in the next few days to discuss the research trial. If during
this phone call clients expressed an interest in participating, a time
was arranged to visit them at home. During this visit the research
assistant obtained informed consent (which included permission to
contact their general practitioner [GP]/specialist), collected baseline
data, and randomly assigned the participant to the intervention or
control group.
Prior to recruitment, the random number generator in STATA
version 9 (StataCorp., College Station, TX) was used to randomly
allocate 80 study numbers to the intervention or control group (40 in
each). Envelopes were then made up with the study number written
on the outside and the group assignment inside.
After a participant had been recruited, their GP/specialist was sent
a fax that included an information statement and a consent form. The
fax explained that their patient had consented to take part and requested that they accept clinical governance for the participant
during the research. If their patient was allocated to the telehealth
group, the fax also included a threshold document for the doctor to
define the normal parameters for their patient in terms of blood
pressure, temperature, pulse, oxygen flow rate, and oxygen saturation levels.

##### INTERVENTION
This study used the HealthHUB� (Docobo Ltd., Bookham, Surrey,
United Kingdom), a small portable unit that has an integrated display
and large functional keys. Participants were visited at home by the
telehealth nurse, who installed the telehealth equipment and trained
participants in its use. Participants were also provided with an educational book about COPD and a telehealth instruction manual.
Participants measured their vital signs (blood pressure, weight,
temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) and answered
questions relating to their general state of health, on a daily basis.
These were transmitted automatically via telephone to a secure Web
site where they were monitored daily by the telehealth nurse. Any


deviations outside the participant’s normal parameters, specified by
their GP or specialist, triggered an alert. The telehealth nurse would
then phone the participant to discuss his or her measurements and
provide advice/support or recommend he or she make an appointment to visit the GP. The outcome of the phone call and any recommendations/actions taken were then recorded on the telehealth
Web site. The participants’ GPs/specialists were also provided with a
secure log-in so they could access the telehealth Web site and view
their patient’s readings.
The control group were also visited by the telehealth nurse, who
provided them with the same COPD book. There was no other contact
with this group apart from data collection.

##### DATA COLLECTION
Participants were provided with a calendar to record every time
they used any health service. This information was then collected by
phone each month, for the 6-month study period. Participant demographics and the number and duration of telehealth nurse visits,
telephone calls, and monitoring were extracted from Silver Chain’s
ComCare. Quality of life was measured during the initial interview
and again at 6 months using the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
Self-Administered Standardized Version (CRQ-SAS).[12] Client satisfaction was evaluated via face-to-face interviews at the completion
of the trial.

##### DATA ANALYSIS
Paired and independent-samples t tests and chi-squared tests were
used to compare the demographics, quality of life, and health service
use of the two groups. STATA version 11 was used for all analyses.
The cost evaluation examined the extra costs of providing the
telehealth intervention and determined whether there was a net
benefit in health system usage and any annualized cost savings for
those in the telehealth group compared with the control group. Two
types of costs were included: actual equipment costs and labor costs,
which included telehealth nurse visits, daily monitoring calls, and
any associated travel expenses to participants’ homes, calculated as a
weekly cost. Net benefits were derived by comparing the health
system usage of both groups. Unit costs for GP, specialist, and
emergency department (ED) visits were taken from the 2005/06 unit
costs in Table 7.2 of Flatau et al.,[13] adjusted by 6.51% per annum
increase[14] in the Australian Bureau of Statistics health services price
index. Hospital visit costs were based on length of stay rather than
number of hospitalizations. Length of stay cost was calculated using
the average cost per bed-day in public hospitals[15] adjusted by a
6.51% per annum increase.[14]

#### Results
Eighty clients (40 telehealth and 40 control) were recruited into the
study, with 71 clients (36 telehealth and 35 control) completing the
trial. Nine participants were lost to follow-up (seven died, two
withdrew). Of the two participants who withdrew, one was unable to
manage the equipment, and one was no longer interested in taking
part.

##### DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
Table 1 shows the gender, age, living arrangement, and carer
availability for both groups; none of these differences was statistically significant.

##### HEALTH SERVICE USAGE
Table 2 shows the number of GP and specialist visits, ED presentations, number of hospital admissions, and length of stay in hospital
for each group. These health contacts are shown for COPD-related
contacts, non–COPD-related contacts, and the combined totals.
There are substantial differences between the two groups in their
health service usage. The telehealth group were hospitalized less than
half as many times as the control group and spent a total of 77 fewer
days in the hospital over the 6-month period. The telehealth group
had nearly 25% more GP visits than the control group, but the majority of these visits were non–COPD-related. None of these differences reached statistical significance.

##### ANNUAL COST SAVINGS
Costs and net benefits of the telehealth group compared with the
control group were calculated for the 6-month period and then annualized. Two types of costs were included: equipment costs and
labor costs. Equipment costs are shown in Table 3. They include the
cost of the equipment depreciated over 3 years using the straight line
method plus the weekly cost of monitoring. Table 4 applies unit costs
to the difference in all health system contacts.
As can be seen in Table 5, the annualized net savings in the telehealth group was $2,931 per person.

##### QUALITY OF LIFE
The questions in the CRQ-SAS are divided into four domains:
dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery (ability in selfmanaging their disease). Each is scored separately. There were no
statistically significant differences between the telehealth and control group for any of the domains at baseline or at 6 months. There
was, however, a clinically significant change found within the telehealth group for the mastery domain between baseline and 6 months.
The minimum amount of change that has been found to be clinically
significant or important in a respondent’s day-to-day life is an

improvement of 0.5 per question per dimension.[12] There are four
questions in mastery domain, and therefore to achieve clinical significance a change of 2 is required. The telehealth group improved by
2.3, achieving clinical significance, whereas the information group
changed by only 1.3.

##### PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION
Overall, participants found the equipment easy to use, and entering their daily measurements took an average of 5 min. Approximately half felt that the telehealth intervention had reduced the
number of times they had been to the hospital. Participants commented that in the past they may have gone to the hospital because
they were worried or anxious about breathing difficulties, but being
able to take their own measurements reassured them that their
measures were within normal limits:

There is no doubt that it has probably saved a couple of trips to
hospital or has made me go to the doctor where previously I would
have hung on and ended up going to hospital by ambulance.


Participants also described the telehealth monitoring as beneficial
because it helped them to identify if they were getting sick earlier,
which ultimately impacted on them seeking treatment before their
condition deteriorated and required hospitalization:

I know if my blood pressure was up the day before they will ring
me.so then I’d go to the doctors and if there was a problem, he
would find it before it blew into something huge.

Those who felt that the service had not had an impact on their
hospitalization rate generally described this as due to the fact that
they had been living with their condition for several years so had
already learned to recognize the early signs of an acute exacerbation.
This group commented that they thought this type of service would
be extremely beneficial for people who had been newly diagnosed
with COPD:

I can see it being absolutely marvellous for people who are just
starting to be crook because they don’t know what the heck is
going on, they don’t know what the body can handle so it is all a
bit scary.panic is a hard thing to control, it happens, you know
it’s happening and try as you might you can’t stop it, and if you
can’t control the panic you’ll end up in hospital whether you want
to or not.

Participants generally agreed that receiving telehealth monitoring
had provided reassurance and peace of mind knowing that a nurse
was monitoring their results daily. Participants described having
more control over their condition and being more confident in selfmanaging their condition as they were now more conscious of what
their body was doing.
Some participants also recorded their readings to take to their GP.
This prompted more communication with their GP, and in 2 cases
participants used their monitoring results to justify/open discussion
with their GP about reviewing their medications.

#### Discussion
The results of this research demonstrate that self-monitoring via
home-based telehealth equipment can, when combined with remote
monitoring of patients’ results by a nurse, provide measurable health
benefits for people living with COPD. These benefits were found to
include a reduction in ED presentations, hospital admissions, and
days in the hospital.
Much of the research investigating the use of telehealth technology has reported good outcomes in terms of reduced hospitalizations
and ED presentations.[16,17] However, there has been no consistent or
definitive evidence in relation to how much this type of technology
reduces health service utilization.[9] This research shows that although
there was not a statistically significant difference between the groups
in terms of health service utilization, the intervention resulted in the
telehealth group having almost half the number of COPD-related ED
presentations, hospitalizations, and days spent in the hospital compared with the control group.


-----

Prior to this study there was limited evidence as to the economic
benefits of telehealth monitoring, particularly in relation to people
with COPD.[1] A recent systematic review of the literature available on
home telemonitoring for pulmonary conditions[9] found only two
studies that conducted a detailed cost analysis of this approach, and
only one of these reported actual dollar savings. This study, by Pare
et al.,[1] showed a $355 saving per person in the intervention group
over 6 months. Although these previous results are consistent with
ours insofar as there were savings for those receiving a telehealth
intervention, the $2,931 savings per annum found in our study were
somewhat more substantial. This research therefore makes an important contribution to building the evidence base regarding the
economic viability of such services within the wider health community.
This research has also shown that telehealth monitoring can provide users of the service with more than just reduced health service
contacts. Participants reported benefits relating to increased selfconfidence, control, and awareness in managing their condition, as
well as an improved sense of security and reduced anxiety. Participants’ self-reports of improvement in self-management were supported by the increase in a sense of mastery of their disease, as found
by the CRQ-SAS quality of life tool over time. These results are
similar to previous studies that also found that telemonitoring enhanced confidence in self-management,[18] improved individuals’
sense of security,[19] and increased their personal awareness of their
health status.[20] As with previous work exploring the acceptability of
telehealth technology for older adults,[18] participants in this study
reported a high level of satisfaction with the user-friendliness of the
equipment.
Daily monitoring was also found for some participants to have
prompted more communication about their condition with their GP,
and in some cases the monitoring results were used to open discussion with their GP about reviewing their medications, demonstrating
that participants were taking a more proactive role in managing their
condition.
If telehealth remote monitoring is to become a widely adopted and
viable service for homecare agencies in the future, it is important to
understand to whom best to target this kind of service. Although our
initial findings from participant interviews suggest that there are more
benefits for those who have been newly diagnosed with their disease,
this is something that needs further exploration. It is also essential that
we understand how long the telehealth monitoring service needs to be
provided to be most cost-effective. What is the optimal time for people
to learn to self-manage more effectively and be able to recognize their
own symptoms of exacerbation without relying on the telehealth
monitoring or equipment? These are important questions to consider
in future research for telehomecare models.

##### LIMITATIONS
Information about participants’ pretrial hospitalizations was
not collected, so the research was unable to explore any differences
for individual health service use over time, only between-group
differences.


#### TELEHEALTH REMOTE MONITORING FOR COPD

In addition, this research relied on retrospective self-report of
health system contacts. To assist in participant recall, calendars were
given to all participants and were referred to at the monthly data
collection phone calls.
A further limitation was the timing of the study. Because of
funding constraints, the research was conducted over summer when
participants with COPD are least likely to be hospitalized owing to
respiratory infections.[21] As a consequence the hospital admission
rate was markedly lower than expected, and the study was insufficiently powered for the difference between the two groups in hospital
utilization to achieve statistical significance even though the telehealth group’s hospital utilization was virtually half that of the
control group. Future research needs to be conducted over a longer
period that includes all seasons.

#### Conclusions
This research has shown that remote monitoring of patient vital
signs using telehealth equipment resulted in a smaller number of
health service contacts for individuals with COPD and resulted in
significant cost savings. In terms of individual health benefits, improvements in participants’ self-management and control over their
condition were evident, and it is importantl that older people were
receptive to using this type of technology and enjoyed using it as a
tool in managing their COPD.
