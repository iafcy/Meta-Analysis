OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an innovative
model integrating telemonitoring of vital parameters and
telephone support on 6-month survival and hospital admissions of elderly adults with heart failure (HF).
DESIGN: Parallel-arm, randomized trial.
SETTING: Geriatric acute care ward and outpatient clinic
at Policlinico Campus Biomedico (Rome, Italy).
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with HF aged 65 and older
(mean age 80) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 50)
or control (n = 46). Participants had an average ejection
fraction of 46%.
INTERVENTION: Telemonitoring system (receives and
communicates oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood
pressure readings) and office-hours telephonic support provided by a geriatrician.
MEASUREMENTS: Combination of all-cause death and
hospital admissions.
RESULTS: The two groups were similar with the exception of the prevalence of women and of disability (both
more common in the control group). Three patients for
each group were lost to follow-up (final analyzed sample
size: 90). Incidence of the main outcome was 42% in the
control group and 21% in the intervention group (relative
risk = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26–0.98).
The results were unchanged after taking into account the
setting of enrollment, sex, and disability (hazard
ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19–0.94).
CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring of elderly people with HF
is feasible and reduces the risk of death and hospitalization.
Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the cost-efficacy of the service. J Am Geriatr Soc

#### Key words: aged; heart failure; long-term care; preven- tion; telemedicine

everal strategies have been tested to prevent rehospitalization of individuals with heart failure (HF),[1,2] includ# S
ing telemedicine and telemonitoring. According to a
Cochrane revision, telemedicine has the potential for
improving health care and reducing healthcare expenditures for individuals with HF,[3] but results of more-recent
trials have been disappointing. In the Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure (TIM-HF) trial, mortality did not change despite monitoring of blood pressure,
electrocardiogram, and body weight.[4] In the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes trial, an automatic
telephone-based daily collection of information about
symptoms and body weight did not improve the outcomes,[5] whereas the CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows
Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA
Class III Patients trial, using an implantable hemodynamic
telemonitoring system, demonstrated a significant decrease
of the rate of rehospitalization.[6] Other trials using
implantable devices or noninvasive telemonitoring[7][–][9]

yielded inconclusive results.
A comparative analysis of randomized clinical trials
shows that they differ in the number and type of biological
signals monitored, in the timing of recording, and in the
organization of the medical support.[10] Furthermore, in
these trials, the attending physicians did not directly monitor the participants. The current study was planned to
evaluate whether a telemonitoring system providing information directly to the physician in charge of individuals’
care and including telephone support could prevent hospital readmissions and death in elderly adults with HF. It
was hypothesized that a system directly supervised by the
attending physician would make therapeutic interventions
more timely and effective.

#### METHODS

 Study Design

This was a single-center, unmasked, randomized trial with
6 months of follow-up comparing multiparametric
telemonitoring plus telephonic support with standard care.
Individuals with a first diagnosis of HF were recruited
from the geriatric acute care ward of a teaching hospital,
and those with a principal diagnosis of HF were recruited
from the outpatient clinic of the same hospital.
HF was diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, objective
evidence (including echocardiography when available), laboratory data (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic
peptide (NT-proBNP) when available), and response to
specific therapy.[11] The only inclusion parameter other than
diagnosis of HF was age of 65 and older. The exclusion
criterion was severe cognitive impairment. The ethical
committee of the Campus Biomedico University in Rome
approved the study protocol (#09/2012), which is regis[tered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0191458).](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)

#### Intervention

The intervention included a telemonitoring system and
office-hours telephonic support provided by a geriatrician
who had access to the telemonitoring system. The telephonic
contacts were not scheduled; participants were instructed to
use this channel of communication to report new symptoms
or problems with the telemonitoring system.
The telemonitoring system consists of commercial
measurement devices equipped with a transmitter and a
commercial android-based smartphone that receives from
the transmitter the readings from the measurement instruments, communicates the readings to the central component of the system in real time, and issues reminders to the
patient when measurement is scheduled. The measurement
instruments provided to participants were a sphygmomanometer (A & D Engineering, San Jose, CA), a scale (A &
D Engineering), and a pulse oximeter (Nonin Medical Inc.,
Plymouth, MN).
To avoid heterogeneity, the same baseline scheduling
was used for all participants throughout the study: weight
once a day; blood pressure and heart rate twice a day, and
peripheral oxygen saturation three times a day. Participants could perform additional measurements in case of
symptoms, and the schedule of measurements could be
remotely altered to adapt it to the changing needs of the
participants. A monitoring system software allowed realtime access to the information that the devices listed above
gathered. The monitoring system was web-based and
accessed through a secure connection using a standard Internet browser.
A geriatrician evaluated the data received every day.
The monitor system displayed an alert when a measurement was outside a predefined range, which could be customized for each participant, but the system was intended
for monitoring only, and participants were instructed to
contact their usual healthcare provider in case of emergency.
In case of abnormal readings, the physician contacted


ened or new symptoms had arisen. In this event, the participant’s adherence to therapy was checked, and if it was
unsatisfactory, interventions promoting adherence were
administered. Based on the participant’s symptoms and
signs, an office appointment was scheduled or the participant was referred to the staff of the acute care ward, who
made the final decision on the admission and was blinded
to participant allocation.
All participants in the intervention group also received
standard care (see below).

#### Standard Care

Individuals discharged from the acute care ward received
detailed instructions about medical therapy and lifestyle
counseling, and a follow-up visit was scheduled for
1 month after discharge. A geriatrician was available on
week days for 2 hours per day for telephonic support, and
participants recruited from the acute care ward and the
outpatient clinic were followed up in visits based on their
clinical conditions and were seen by geriatricians from the
same unit as the study researchers, who were blinded to
their study allocation.

#### Multidimensional Assessment

Activities of daily living (ADLs, range 0–6 lost functions),
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, range 0–8
lost functions), and New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class were rated. Comorbidity burden was expressed using
the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS),[12] which has
two scales: a comorbidity scale indicating the number of
systems with a clinically relevant disease (range 0–13), and
a severity scale (range 1–5, with higher values indicating
more-severe conditions). Serum concentration of NT-proBNP was measured on admission, and the use of cardiovascular drugs (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARB), beta-blockers, statins, nitrates) was recorded.

#### Outcome

Outcome measures were hospital admissions for any reason or death 180 days from enrollment. All information
was gathered from clinical records, when available, or
from in-person or telephone interviews.

#### Sample Size

An outcome incidence of 50% was anticipated.[5] Because
this was an exploratory study, it was decided to allow for
a type I error rate of 10%. On these assumptions, it was
calculated that a sample size of 50 participants per group
would provide 80% power to detect a 25% absolute risk
reduction. As shown in Figure 1, 186 individuals meeting
inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified; 90 of these
refused to participate. Of the remaining 96, 50 were randomized to the intervention group and 46 to the control
group using a computer-generated random number list.
Three participants in each group were lost to follow-up,
and four participants dropped out of the intervention

#### Analytical Approach

Descriptive statistics and t-tests or chi-square tests were used
to compare groups. The risk of the composite outcome was
calculated using the product-limit method complemented
with the log-rank test. The adjusted relative hazard for the
outcome was estimated using a proportional hazards
model including site of enrollment (hospital ward or
ambulatory setting) as a random effect term. In this model,
the number of ADLs was dichotomized using the median
(3) as a cutoff variable to avoid the assumption of a linear
relationship with the outcome risk. All analyses were performed using an intention-to-treat approach. The analyses
were performed using R Statistical Software version 2.14
for Linux.

#### RESULTS

The mean age of the sample (80 7, range 60–94) was
�
similar in the two groups, whereas the proportion of men
was higher in the telemonitoring group (47%, vs 30% in
the control group). Independence in ADLs was better preserved in the telemonitoring group, but there were no differences in the distribution of NYHA class, comorbidity


taken, or number of admissions in the preceding year.
Ninety-one percent of participants were taking loop diuretics, and approximately half were taking ACE-Is, ARBs, or
beta-blockers, without significant differences between the
two groups (Table 1).
On average, 62% of scheduled measurements were
completed; adherence was best for pulse oximeter (70%)
and worst for the scale (56%). Sixty-four percent of participants completed at least half of the scheduled measurements.
There were 28 hospital admissions during the
6 months of follow-up (incidence rate 77.9/100 personyears, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54–112.6), 20 in
the control group (incidence rate 129/100 person-years,
95% CI = 84–200) and eight (incidence rate 39/100 person-years, 95% CI = 20–77) in the intervention group
(incidence rate ratio = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12–0.67). Half
of the admissions were due to heart failure or related
heart diseases (e.g., arrhythmias). More admissions were
due to cardiac events in the telemonitoring group (62.5%)
than in the control group (45%), although the incidence
rate ratio for heart failure hospitalizations was 0.48
(0.14–1.45). The number of observed deaths was 10,
seven in the control group (incidence rate 37/100 person

group (incidence rate 13/100 person-years, 95% CI = 5–
39). The incidence rate for the composite outcome was
112/100 person-years (95% CI = 82–154) in the overall
population, 190/100 person-years in the control group,
and 56/100 person-years in the intervention group; the
corresponding incidence rate ratio was 0.30 (95% CI =
0.14–0.59).
The overall proportion of people experiencing the
composite outcome was 42% in the control group and
21% in the telemonitoring group (relative risk = 0.51,
95% CI = 0.26–0.98). Figure 2 shows the event-free survival of the two groups. The relative hazard for the composite outcome estimated using an unadjusted Cox
regression model was 0.43 (95% CI = 0.20–0.93). The
hazard ratio adjusted for sex, disability, and enrollment
setting was 0.42 (95% CI = 0.19–0.94). Of the 10 outcome events recorded in the intervention group, two
occurred in people who dropped out of the study and two
in participants with poor adherence who had not used the
telemonitoring system in the days before the event. For the
other outcomes, a decline or instability of oxygen saturation preceded three; alteration in heart rate preceded two;
and oxygen desaturation, decline in blood pressure, and
weight gain preceded one.

#### DISCUSSION

These data suggest that a physician-led multiparametric
telemonitoring system integrated with telephone support
can reduce the risk of all-cause death and hospitalization
in elderly adults with HF. The data are in contrast to
those from two recent trials,[4,5] but there are important
differences between these trials. One intervention[5] was


was therefore hardly comparable with the current intervention. The TIM-HF trial[4] tested a system that was
similar to that used in the current study, but peripheral
oxygen saturation was not included in the monitored
parameters, and the parameters were collected only once
a day. Furthermore, the telemedical center provided
telephone support once a month, and participants could
contact the telemedical centers only in case of emergency. In addition, the population in the TIM-HF trial
was on average 13 years younger than in the current
study.
A peculiarity of the current trial is that a geriatrician
led the intervention. HF prevalence increases with age,[13]

with individuals with HF being on average 73 years old[14]

and having multiple comorbid diseases;[15] the geriatrician
typically provides comprehensive care customized to the
complexity of these individuals.[16] Another important feature of the model is that it included “fast track” access
to ambulatory visits that was activated in case of abnormalities in the telemonitored data or when new symptoms ensued. Thus, a model of care was tested rather
than a simple telemonitoring system. This is an important
factor to be taken into account when evaluating telehealth interventions. The results of Whole Systems Demonstrator,[17] a large, community-based trial of telehealth,
indicate that the simple implementation of technologies in
the context of usual care is not enough to obtain sizable
benefits.[18]

A formal cost-effectiveness analysis was not performed. The use of a physician rather than a nurse has an
obvious effect on costs, although this should be compared
with the cost of hospitalization; data from the current
study indicate that, for every 100 people with HF, the

pared with standard care. In addition, the telemonitoring
hardware is inexpensive thanks to the use of commercial
devices, and on a large scale, this may in part offset the
costs of the service. Nonetheless, a direct evaluation is
needed before any conclusions can be drawn.
This study has several strengths. First, the very old
individuals with HF studied are representative of the realworld target population. Second, the core of the technological intervention does not lie in its hardware, which is
made up of existing, low-cost devices, but in its software
and monitoring system, with obvious implications for costs
on a large scale. The use of commercial devices also affects
the acceptability of the system, because participants used
medical devices to which they were well accustomed.
Third, the availability of telephone contact on demand
could reassure people that telemonitoring is an add-on to,
not a substitute for, physician-patient contact. Finally, the
monitoring schedule could be adapted to changing clinical
conditions.
Some limitations should also be taken into account.
First, the sample was small, with some imbalance in the
characteristics of the two groups. This may affect the
internal validity of the study, although statistical correction for this imbalance has been performed. Moreover, the
prevalence of physical impairment in the sample was high,
which makes generalization of the results to the gen

indicate that telemonitoring could be more effective in the
population for which it is intended, that is, individuals
with difficulties attending frequent ambulatory visits. Second, results pertaining to medical outcomes were shown,
but an evaluation of economic and societal implications is
needed before the effectiveness of the model of telehealth
is established. Finally, the estimated risk reduction is larger
than found in previously published trials. Probably because
of publication bias, small trials such as this one tend to
overestimate the treatment effect.[19] Furthermore, the
favorable results might depend partly on the experience in
HF management of the geriatrician in charge of telemonitored individuals, although the control group also received
care from a geriatrician skilled in HF treatment.
In conclusion, physician-led telemonitoring of elderly
adults with HF is feasible and reduces the risk of death
and hospitalization. Further studies are needed to test this
model in a larger series and to assess its cost efficacy.
