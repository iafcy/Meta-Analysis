The effectiveness of remote patient monitoring and physician care for the treatment of hypertension has not been demonstrated
in a randomized clinical trial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of remote patient monitoring with or
without remote physician care in reducing office blood pressure in patients with hypertension. A total of 374 hypertensive
patients over 20 years of age were randomized into the following three groups: group (1) control, the patients received usual
clinical care with home BP monitoring; group (2) the patients were remotely monitored and received office follow-up; and group
(3) the patients received remote monitoring without physician office care using the remote monitoring device. For each group, inoffice follow-up care was scheduled every 8 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in sitting SBP at the
24-week follow-up. No difference between the three groups was observed in the primary end point (adjusted mean sitting SBP
was as follows: group 1: − 8.9 ± 15.5 mm Hg, group 2: − 11.3 ± 15.9 mm Hg, group 3: − 11.6 ± 19.8 mm Hg, (NS). Significant
differences in achieving the target BP at the 24th week of follow-up were observed between groups 1 and 2. The subjects over
55-years old had a significant decrease in the adjusted mean sitting SBP in groups 2 and 3 compared with that of the control
group. Remote monitoring alone or remote monitoring coupled with remote physician care was as efficacious as the usual office
care for reducing blood pressure with comparable safety and efficacy in hypertensive patients.

INTRODUCTION
Although achieving the target blood pressure (BP) is the most
important prognostic factor for the treatment of hypertension, the
latest NHANES 2007–2008 survey showed that only 50.1% of all
hypertensive patients met this objective.[1] Numerous factors have been
shown to be associated with improved BP control. Critical among
these factors is the degree of patient awareness and adherence to the
treatment. A previous study demonstrated that self measurement of
home BP is associated with improved treatment compliance, indicating that self measurement might help increase treatment adherence.[2]

Recent studies have shown that telemonitoring of home BP might be
more effective than conventional treatment in achieving target BP.[3,4]

To date, no randomized clinical trial has compared the efficacy of
conventional home BP monitoring to a web-based remote patient
monitoring device. The clinical trial presented here had two major
objectives. First, to determine whether remote monitoring homebased BP monitoring is more efficacious in reducing office BP
compared with conventional treatment with home BP measurement.


Second, to determine whether there is a difference in blood pressure
lowering according to web-based remote patient monitoring with or
without remote physician care (LG Smart Care system, LG Electronics,
Seoul, Korea).

METHODS
Study design
This study was a multi-center, randomized, parallel, interventional, open-label
trial involving the following clinical centers in South Korea: Yonsei University,
Yeungnam University and Keimyung University (Clinical Trials GOV NCT
01335984). The clinical trial was performed between 20 December 2010 and 3
April 2013. The remote monitoring system used in this study was the LG Smart
Care system.
The eligible participants were assigned to the three groups with equal
probability according to the randomization code. Because this study is an openlabeled trial, blinding was not performed. The group 1 (control) patients
(n = 124) received typical clinical care using home BP monitoring validated
with the BHS protocol (UA 767PBT, A&D medical, Tokyo, Japan) with no
remote monitoring and office follow-up (FU) visits at 8-week intervals for

24 weeks.[5] The subjects were instructed to measure and record their home
BP measurement in their diary and bring the data to each office visit. The
subjects were instructed on the proper intake of their medications, as well as
maintenance of their usual healthy lifestyle modifications of their dietary and
exercise habits. The group 2 (n = 124) patients received remote monitoring of
home BP through the LG Smart Care system; however, they did not receive
remote physician care. These patients receive in-office physician care at FU
appointments every 8 weeks for 24 weeks. The group 3 (n = 126) patients
received remote monitoring of home BP and remote physician care without inoffice physician care. Remote physician care was provided every 8 weeks for
24 weeks by the attending physician of the subject. For the remote monitoring,
routine contact was made with the patient every week from the 1st to 9th week
and once every 4 weeks from the 10th to the 24th week. In addition, the patient
was contacted in the following cases: (i) when the 1-week average home BP was
⩾ 160/100 mm Hg; (ii) when the measured BP was ⩾ 180/120 mm Hg; and (iii)
if the patient did not measure the BP at home for 3 consecutive days. The
patients were instructed to measure the BP at home in the dominant arm, once
in the morning and once in the evening. The patients enrolled in the remote
monitoring arm (group 2, group 3) were educated regarding the use of the
supplied netbook computer and the LG Smart Care system. All the data were
uploaded onto the server by Bluetooth and constantly monitored by healthcare
professionals (physicians, nurses, a nutritionist, an exercise trainer) involved in
the study. In addition to the BP data that was obtained, the patients were
instructed to upload the records of their daily dietary intake, as well as the types
and duration of the exercise programs, which were monitored by the
nutritionist and the exercise trainer. The adherence to anti-hypertensive
medications was assessed by records in a medication diary provided to the
patients at the time of enrollment. The adherence was calculated by the number
of days anti-hypertensive medications were taken, divided by the study
duration.
Ambulatory BP was measured in the non-dominant arm using a validated
ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device (A&D TM-2430, A&D
Medical, San Jose, CA, USA). The daytime average BP was defined as
the average of the BP measurements obtained from 0700 hours to 2259 hours.
The night time average BP was defined as the average of the BP measurements
obtained from 2300 hours to 0659 hours. The white-coat effect was defined as a
baseline daytime average systolic/diastolic ABPM o135/85 mm Hg (130/80 for
DM and/or CKD), respectively. For the patients enrolled in the web-based
monitoring-only arm (group 2), an in-person office visit to the attending
physician was required every 8 weeks. The attending physicians cared for the
patient based upon the data obtained through the remote patient monitoring,
as well as the data obtained in the office. For the patients enrolled in the remote
monitoring/remote treatment arm (group 3), the attending physician assessed
the status of the patient by remote monitoring. Anti-hypertensive medications
were adjusted and prescribed by the attending physicians according to the
patient’s data. The hypertension treatment regimen, based on the major clinical
guidelines, was left to the discretion of the attending physician.[6][–][8] For the
remote physician monitoring arm, the necessary medications were delivered to
the patient.
The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Shinchon
Severance Hospital, Yeungnam University Hospital and Keimyung University
Hospital. All the procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines. All the patients provided informed consent prior to being
enrolled.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria

1. Hypertensive patients over 20 years of age whose office BP was uncontrolled
with one or more anti-hypertensive medications (systolic BP (SBP) ⩾ 140
mm Hg; for diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD),
SBP ⩾ 130 mm Hg).


Exclusion criteria

1. The patients with an average sitting SBP of 4200 mm Hg at the
screening visit.
2. Secondary hypertension.
3. HbA1c4 11%.
4. Hypertensive patients requiring admission care.
5. CKD with a serum creatinine level of 41.5 times the upper limit of
normal.
6. Chronic liver disease with aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase over three times the upper limit of normal.
7. History of acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure and/or valvular heart disease within the last 6 months.
8. Chronic debilitating illness.
9. Autoimmune disease.
10. Patients taking medications that might influence BP (sedatives, hypnotics,
lithium, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, alpha agonists,
steroids).
11. Patients with known allergies to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors
or angiotensin receptor blockers.
12. Patients with a history of alcoholism.

Statistical analysis
The study was initially designed to enroll 564 patients (under the assumption of
a 25% dropout rate), which was later revised to enroll 495 patients equally to
each of the three intervention groups, under the assumption of a 20% dropout
rate because the dropout rate was lower than expected (Figure 1). With a
sample size of 165 patients per group, the trial had 80% power to detect
(α = 0.05; two-sided test) a between-treatment difference between the group 1
and groups 2 and 3 of 3.8 mm Hg in the SBP change from baseline with a s.d.
for the SBP of 11.43 mm Hg, with a 20% dropout rate. The between-treatment
difference of 3.8 mm Hg and an s.d. of 11.43 mm Hg were estimated from
similar hypertension trials.[9][–][11]

The primary end point was the difference in the sitting SBP at the 24th week
of FU by the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis compared with the baseline
measurement. The secondary end points were as follows: (i) the difference in
the sitting diastolic BP (DBP) at the 24th week of FU by the ITT analysis
compared with the initial measurement; (ii) the percentage of patients
achieving the target BP (o140/90 mm Hg and o130/80 for patients with
DM and/or CKD); (iii) the difference in the 24 h ambulatory BP at the 24th
week of FU by the ITT analysis compared with the initial measurement; (iv) the
percentage of patients achieving the target daytime ambulatory BP (o135/85mm Hg, o130/80 for DM and/or CKD); (v) the difference in the average
home SBP/DBP at the 24th week of FU by the ITT analysis compared with the
initial measurement; and (vi) drug adherence ((the number of days taking antihypertensive medications/the number of days enrolled in the clinical trial) ×
100). A subgroup analysis according to age (55 years), gender and the presence
of DM/CKD was performed.
For the statistical analysis, the baseline characteristics were analyzed using
analysis of variance for the continuous variables and the χ[2] method for the
discrete variables. The difference in the adjusted mean BP reduction was
assessed using the analysis of covariance. The statistical analysis was performed
using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

RESULTS
A total of 440 patients were screened for the study. Among the 440
subjects (66 failed to meet the inclusion criteria), 374 patients were
randomized into three groups and analyzed by an ITT analysis (group
1: 124, group 2: 124, group 3: 126). Among the 374 patients initially
randomized, 331 patients were available for the per-protocol analysis
(group 1: 115, group 2: 111, group 3: 105, Figure 1). There were no
significant differences between the three groups in terms of age,
gender, the body mass index, smoking or alcohol intake (Table 1).

No significant differences were observed among the three groups in
terms of the baseline SBP (Table 2, P = non significant). There were
no significant differences in the 24 h ambulatory BP, daytime
ambulatory BP or night time ambulatory BP (Supplementary Table
1). Among the subjects who underwent measurement of the baseline
ABPM data, no signi − ficant differences in the proportion of subjects −
with the white-coat effect were observed (Supplementary Table 1). The −
analysis of the primary end point revealed that there were no
significant differences between the three groups in terms of the
decrease in the adjusted mean sitting SBP at the 24th week in the
FU (group 1: 8.9 ± 15.5 mm Hg, group 2: 11.3 ± 15.9 mm Hg,
group 3: 11.6 ± 19.8 mm Hg, P-value = non significant, Table 2).
There was a significant difference between the groups 1 and 2 in terms
of achieving the target BP (SBP and DBP) at the 24th week of FU
(Table 3). The subgroup analysis revealed that in the subjects over the
age of 55, there was a significant decrease in the adjusted mean sitting
SBP in the groups 2 and 3 compared with that in the control group
(Table 2). Among the subjects over the age of 55, the patients in the
group 2 and 3 achieved the target BP by the 24th week of FU at a
significantly higher rate than the patients in group 1 (Table 3).
Baseline and FU ABPM was performed in 96/124 subjects in group 1
(77.4%), 89/124 (71.8%) in group 2 and 87/126 (69.1%) in group 3.
The analysis of the ABPM data in the subjects with true uncontrolled
hypertension showed a significant difference in terms of the changes in
the ABPM SBP compared with the baseline within all three groups at
FU (Table 4). There were no significant differences in the change in
the ABPM SBP among the groups (Table 4). When the average 1-week
home BP measurements (excluding the 1st day of measurement) were
compared, the patients in the group 3 demonstrated a significant

were taking by the FU. This finding is in agreement with that of a
previous study, which showed that home BP monitoring reduces the
number of medications taken by the patients compared to the number
of medications taken by the patients in the control group.[17] This study
is the first to show that BP medication use could be reduced by remote
monitoring.
The third important finding results from our use of home BP
monitoring in the control arm. Home BP monitoring is gaining wide
acceptance for the treatment of arterial hypertension, with studies
showing that up to 70% of hypertensive patients regularly check their
BP using an office BP measuring device.[3,18,19][–][21] Home BP monitoring
has been demonstrated to improve HTN control, as well as have a
strong predictive value for future cardiovascular events.[20][–][22] We used
the home BP monitoring arm as the control group to more accurately
reflect real-world clinical practice, as well as to determine whether


remote monitoring with or without remote physician monitoring has
additional benefits in treating hypertension.
There are several limitations to this study. First, the study was
initially designed to enroll 495 patients and equally randomize this
sample into the three intervention groups. With a sample size of 165
patients per group, the trial was designed to have an 80% power to
detect (α = 0.05; two-sided test), with an assumption of a 20%
dropout rate. The study as designed needed at least 396 study subjects.
The final actual enrollment of 374 subjects results in this study being
marginally underpowered. The second limitation is that we have no
plausible explanation for the efficacy of remote monitoring/remote
physician care in reducing office SBP and average home BP in subjects
over the age of 55. Although, in theory, remote monitoring should
have improved the drug adherence of the study population, there was
no significant difference between the three study groups in terms of

anti-hypertensive drug adherence (Table 3). We postulate that remote
monitoring of and feedback regarding the data on the patient BP, diet
and exercise patterns might have a beneficial effect in reducing BP.
In conclusion, this clinical trial assessed the effectiveness of web-based
remote patient monitoring with or without remote physician care (LG
Smart Care) in reducing office BP in patients with hypertension. We
found no significant differences in terms of the change in the mean
SBP in the 24-week FU (primary outcome). The subgroup analysis
revealed that patients over the age of 55, who received remote patient
monitoring, with or without remote physician care, had a significant
decrease in their SBP at the 24-week FU. The web-based remote
monitoring and remote physician care of hypertension was safe, with
no significant increases in adverse events compared with those in the
control group.
