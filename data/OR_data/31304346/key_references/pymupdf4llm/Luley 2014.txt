**Key words: metabolic syndrome, weight loss, telemonitoring**

**Objective: Mobile technology can improve lifestyle programs, but the monitoring techniques and carer**
feedback need to be optimized. To this end, we investigated the efficacy of telemonitoring physical activity and
nutrition over 12 months in patients with metabolic syndrome in a randomized, parallel-group, open trial.
**Methods: Screening all over Germany yielded 184 patients with metabolic syndrome. All patients attended**
a single 2-hour instruction meeting in their region concerning a combination diet and the importance of physical
activity. Thereafter they were randomized into a control group (controls, n = 62) or one of 2 different intervention
groups. Both intervention groups were issued accelerometers, which measured physical activity, recorded daily
weight and calorie intake, and transmitted these data to a central server for use by patient carers. In the Active Body
Control Program of University of Magdeburg (ABC) intervention group (n = 60), information and motivation
was ensured by weekly letters. In the 4sigma telephone coaching (4S) intervention group (n = 58), this was
accomplished by monthly telephone calls from the carers. Clinical and biochemical data for all patients were
collected at 0, 4, 8, and 12 months without any regular face-to-face meetings between patients and carers. The
primary endpoint was weight loss and the secondary endpoint was the presence of metabolic syndrome.
**Results: After 12 months the dropout rates in the control, 4S, and ABC groups were respectively 35%, 17%,**
and 18%. The adjusted relative weight losses after 12 months were respectively 3.7%, 8.6%, and 11.4% (all
_p < 0.000 versus baseline). ABC was more effective than 4S (p = 0.041); 43% of the patients completing the_
study in the ABC group lost more than 15% of their baseline weight. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was
no longer applicable in 58% of the cases in the ABC group, in 41% of the 4S group, and in 33% of the controls.
**Conclusions: Telemonitoring of physical activity and nutrition markedly improves weight loss and markers**
of metabolic syndrome.


## INTRODUCTION

A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made when abdominal overweight occurs together with at least 2 additional risk
factors such as elevated triglycerides, blood glucose, blood pressure, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [1]. Although
the exact criteria for the presence or absence of these risk factors are still the subject of discussion, there is broad agreement
that metabolic syndrome carries an increased risk of developing obesity-associated disorders, in particular type 2 diabetes
mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.


The central cause of metabolic syndrome is obesity, which
has evolved into a worldwide epidemic [2]. The steady increase
in its prevalence indicates that the measures used at present are
unable to curb this development and that new and more effective
alternatives are urgently needed.
Obesity has 2 basic causes: an excessive calorie intake and
insufficient calorie expenditure by physical activity. Though
there are numerous programs aimed at modification and control of calorie intake, the number of measures for increasing
calorie consumption by increasing physical activity is limited.
One major reason for this is that activity programs require a

considerable time input from both patients and coaches. Therefore, approaches that use mobile technology and the Internet for
lifestyle improvements are being developed and tested. Three
recent reviews [3–5] agree that in the short-term weight loss can
be improved by these programs. They also agree, however, that
the published data differ markedly with respect to technologies
used, patient groups studied, and study durations and that further research is needed in order to optimize telemonitoring as an
effective tool for the management of obesity.
The Active Body Control (ABC) program is a lifestyle program that combines such telemonitoring with a combination
diet, the Magdeburg Dual Diet. This program was first shown
to be effective in obese adults [6] and subsequently in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus [7]. In the present work we investigated the effects of telemonitoring over a period of 12 months
in patients with metabolic syndrome in an open, randomized
trial with parallel groups. We also compared 2 different ways of
communicating with the patients: by weekly letters, as routinely
done in the ABC program, and by monthly telephone calls from
a specialized enterprise, 4sigma (4S), as an alternative communication pathway.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Patients and Interventions


The patients were recruited by advertising in several major
companies in southern and western Germany and by a newspaper
advertisement in the region of Magdeburg in northeast Germany.
Interested persons visited either their company doctors or the
lipid clinic of Magdeburg University Hospital. None of these
patients had participated in an earlier study carried out by the
authors. Five hundred sixty-four individuals were screened and
received condensed information about the trial, and fasting blood
samples were then collected to test for inclusion or exclusion
criteria concerning the metabolic syndrome (see the flowchart
in Fig. 1).
The criteria for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to the International Diabetes Federation recommendations

[8] were as follows: waist circumference > 80 cm in females
and > 94 cm in males plus any 2 of the following 4 factors:
triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 50 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/L) in females and
_< 40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/L) in males, systolic blood pressure_
(BP) ≥ 130 or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg or treatment of any
of the above conditions, and fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl
(5.6 mmol/L). A telephone and access to the Internet via a personal computer were required. The exclusion criteria were age
less than 30 or over 60 years and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,
coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, or cerebrovascular
disorders, as well as other conditions possibly co-influencing
physical activity or body weight, such as psychiatric disorders,

use of antidepressants, neuroleptic or cortisol therapy, thyroid
dysfunction, active cancer or other severe and life-threatening
diseases, disabling disorders of the motor system, pregnancy,
or changes in oral contraception. One hundred eighty-four persons met these criteria and were invited to a 2-hour instruction
meeting. These meetings were held only once in each of the
participating 8 regions. The instruction consisted of 2 parts. All
individuals participated in the first part, which included an explanation of the Magdeburg Dual Diet and the importance of
physical activity (details of both are given below). After this
basic instruction the subjects were randomized by lot to one of
3 groups: controls (n = 62), ABC (n = 60), or 4S (n = 62).
The different final group sizes after the 8 meetings are a consequence of the fact that the cohorts in each of the 8 participating
regions were not necessarily a multiple of 3. The patients in
the control group then left, and the remaining subjects received
their accelerometers and instructions on their operation and data
transmission. Because the intervention investigated in this trial
was purely telemedical, there were no additional appointments
with the patients except for determination of their biochemical and clinical parameters after 4, 8, and 12 months. It should
be emphasized that all 3 groups received identical instructions
about the Magdeburg Dual Diet and identical recommendations
concerning physical activity. The difference between the 2 intervention groups and the control group was merely the telemonitoring of physical activity and nutrition by means of the
Aipermotion instruments and the regular feedback from carers,

either by weekly letters (ABC group) or by monthly telephone
calls (4S group).
The Magdeburg Dual Diet is a combination of 2 diets.
The first consists of conventional calorie restriction, lowering
the calorie intake by 500 kcal per day. The second is a lowcarbohydrate diet, developed originally by Ludwig [9] and modified by Worm [10]. Emphasis was placed on preference for carbohydrates with low glycemic index (GI) but not on avoidance
of carbohydrates as in the Atkins diet [11]. Many practical examples were presented, and a booklet was distributed containing
an overview of the aims and background of the study, a table of
calorie contents, and a table of GI values for a broad range of
carbohydrates.
As far as exercise was concerned, the subjects were advised
to increase their usual daily physical activity, like walking or cycling, rather than to engage in particular sports. The recommendation was to perform these activities moderately but steadily,
slowly enough to be able to talk at the same time [12], and to
keep the pulse below 120/min.
The accelerometer used was an Aipermotion 440 model from
Aipermon GmbH (Munich, Germany). The accelerometers were
programmed individually for each patient, with an allowance
for age, sex, weight, and individual step lengths for 3 walking
speeds: normal, fast, and jogging. The instruments calculate the
current and daily distances at the 3 walking speeds and the current and daily exercise-related energy expenditure in kilocalories
and displays the results on a screen. Movements that are only
inadequately recorded by the instrument, such as swimming or
cycling, are manually keyed in according to their duration and
intensity. The validity of these measurements has been satisfactorily demonstrated by comparison with spiroergometry in
different patient groups with heart failure [13] and by comparison with the 6-minute-walk test [14]. The patients were required
to carry the matchbox-sized instrument in a little holster tied
to the belt from the time they dressed in the morning until they
undressed in the evening. The instrument measured the daily duration of active usage and transmitted it to the carer, expressed
as percentage of 24 hours. An additional feature of the instrument is the recording of meal calories in a simplified form.
The registration of nutritional calories occurs first by selection
of the meal; for example, “breakfast,” “snack,” “main meal,” or
“drink” followed by choice of “mini,” “normal,” or “maxi.” How
to determine mini, normal, or maxi was covered in the 2-hour
training. Although the actual calorie intake can only be roughly
assessed by this approach, there is a satisfactory psychological
effect because the patients are continuously aware of their nutritional behavior. Finally, the patients can read on the display the
actual balance between the total calorie intake and the calories
used up by the basal metabolic rate plus their physical activity.
These data and the daily body weights from the subjects’
personal scales were transmitted once a week to a server in
Magdeburg University Hospital by means of a USB connection to a home computer with automatic extraction of new data.


### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

Using the ABC platform on this server, the ABC carer generated weekly individual report letters, which were sent out to all
ABC patients by mail. Each letter showed the patient’s weight
loss curve from the beginning of the intervention (a red line)
together with weight loss curves of the other participants in this
group (black lines). A second graph showed, for each day of the
preceding week, the duration of sensor use as a percentage of
24 hours, the kilocalories used up by exercise with 4 coloured
bars reflecting the 4 activity intensities from “passive” to “jogging,” and the distance covered in kilometers. A third graph
showed the cumulative number of kilocalories from nutrition.
Finally, the letter also contained comments assessing progress
over the past week aiming to motivate the patients.
Patients in the 4S group received a monthly telephone call
from specialist doctors and nurses from the 4sigma company
in Munich, Germany. This company specializes in telephonebased health coaching including the use of telemonitoring. The
calls took on average 20 minutes each, and the carers used the
same ABC platform described above but communicated and
commented on the data verbally.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
School of Medicine and all subjects provided written informed
consent.


### Statistical Analysis

The primary aim of the analyses was to compare the results
between the different treatment arms. The primary endpoint was
the weight loss from baseline to month 12 as a percentage from
baseline. The main secondary endpoint was the presence of
metabolic syndrome. Further secondary endpoints were absolute weight loss and changes in body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, and laboratory parameters.
The study was designed to detect differences in weight loss
at the 12-month visit between the 3 treatment arms with a power
of at least 80% if the difference amounted to 5 kg or more.


### Blood Sampling and Laboratory Measurements

Blood samples were taken from the antecubital vein after
a 12-hour overnight fast and sent by mail to the central laboratory at Magdeburg University Hospital. All laboratory tests were
done by commercial enzymatic methods in a random-access analyzer (Modular, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in
serum for all parameters except glucose, which was determined
in sodium fluoride plasma. HbA1c was determined in EDTA
tubes by high-performance liquid chromatography (Variant II,
Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA) index was calculated according to Haffner et al.

[15]. Body weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured by the investigating doctors at baseline and
then at 4, 8, and 12 months. Blood pressure was determined
using manual sphygmomanometers.

### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

As a simplified scenario for the sample size calculation we
used Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t tests at the 2-sided level
0.05/3 = 0.0167 and assumed a common standard deviation of
7 kg in all treatments. This would require about 45 persons per
treatment arm; with a supposed dropout rate of 25% this meant
that 60 patients had to be recruited for each treatment arm.
We begin with a description of demographic and baseline parameters stratified by treatment arm, completed by a comparison
of these parameters between the treatment arms in Bonferronicorrected chi-squared tests for gender and Tukey tests for all
continuous parameters.
The main analysis for the primary endpoint, the percentage weight loss, is the comparison between the 3 treatment
arms. Patients were allocated to the 3 groups according to the
intention-to-treat principle. Weight loss at the 4-month, 8-month,
and 12-month visits were modeled in a mixed linear model with
a random patient effect (intercept) and fixed effects for treatment arm, visit, baseline value (covariable), and interactions
between treatment arm and visit as well as between visit and
baseline value. Although values from all visits were included
in the analyses, the main focus was on the results at the 12month visit. A Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the 3
pairwise comparisons between the treatment arms at 12 months
and also for corresponding confidence intervals for the pairwise
differences. In addition, estimates of the groupwise means with
unadjusted confidence intervals and unadjusted p values for the
tests versus 0 (i.e., no weight loss) were taken from the mixed
model for all visits. In a secondary consideration, in each group


the weight loss was compared between the 3 visits based on
the same mixed model (also with Bonferroni adjustment for 3
pairwise visit comparisons).
Because dropout is an essential issue in this study (as in
nearly all diet studies), several missing value strategies were
considered simultaneously. The primary analysis (“original” estimates in the results tables) used all available measurements at
corresponding visits (note that the mixed model approach does
not require complete data from all visits). In sensitivity analyses, we substituted missing values from dropouts by multiple
imputation and by the last observation carried forward strategy (LOCF) as well as by baseline observation carried forward
(BOCF). For multiple imputations we used 5 replications, where
missing values were substituted in a Markov chain Monte Carlo
method based on the available measurements for the patient at
other visits and a random disturbance.
Analogous analyses were carried out with the continuous
secondary endpoints but with absolute differences from baseline. For variables with skewed distributions (triglycerides, apo
B, ALT, AST, C-reactive protein [CRP], glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA), the test results (p values) were taken from
analyses with log-transformed data, but the estimates and confidence intervals were derived from additional analyses with the
original data for more convenient presentation uniform over all
variables.
The main secondary outcome variable, metabolic syndrome,
was considered in pairwise Bonferroni-corrected chi-squared
tests. Missing values were treated by the LOCF protocol.

## RESULTS


### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

**Table 2b. Reasons for Dropout**


A flowchart of the study is presented in Fig. 1. Six of the
randomized patients were excluded from the final evaluation.
Documentation of the baseline data was lost in 2 cases (both
in the control group). Four more patients were found during
the first 4 months to suffer from severe preexisting conditions
having an effect on body weight at the baseline visit: 2 severe
depressions, 1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 1 cancer of the
colon (all 4S group).
Table 1 gives the baseline data for the remaining patients
for the 3 groups. A statistically significant difference between
the groups was observed for the baseline weight, which was
higher in the ABC group than in the controls. The difference
is due to an incidental higher proportion of men in the ABC
group: (70%) vs 53% in both the 4S group and the controls.
To compensate for this imbalance, we analyzed the different
primary and secondary metrical endpoints not only as the change
from the baseline but additionally included the baseline value as
a covariable. In addition, the relative weight loss and the decrease
in BMI are reported, both of which are less influenced by the
absolute baseline weight. Table 2a gives the dropout rates in the
3 groups. These increased in the course of the study and after 12
months became almost equal at 18% and 17% in the ABC and
4S group but at 35% were twice as high in the control group.
Table 2b shows the reasons for dropout. Loss of sensor was the
prevailing technical reason with a consecutive unwillingness to
pay a second security deposit for a replacement instrument.
Fig. 2 shows the unadjusted individual weight loss curves in
kilograms in the 2 intervention groups over the year; the mean
is shown in red. Weight loss did not differ between men and
women in any of the groups, either in absolute (kg) or in relative
(%) terms. The adjusted relative weight losses according to the
mixed model evaluation are given in Fig. 3 at months 0, 4, 8, and
12. It is apparent that weight loss was greatest in the ABC group

and decreased in the control group between 8 and 12 months,
whereas in the 2 intervention groups they increased further.
The data collected from the accelerometers were generally in
line with the greater weight loss in the ABC group. This group
had longer walking distances (ABC: 6.5 km/day, 4S: 5.9 km/day)
and a lower nutritional energy input (ABC: 1487 kcal/day, 4S:
1510 kcal/day). None of these differences reached statistical significance; however, the minor daily difference in calorie intake
and exercise-induced calorie burn added up over one year to approximately an average of additional negative balance of 24,000
kcal and is, therefore, in line with the additional weight loss in
the ABC group.
Table 3 shows the proportion of completing patients whose
relative weight loss exceeded 5%, 10%, or 15%. Highest values
were again observed in the ABC group, in which almost every
other patient lost more than 15% of their baseline weight.
Table 4 shows the changes in various clinical and biochemical parameters after 12 months. Four patients developed diabetes
mellitus (3 controls, 1 4S). They remained in the evaluation with
their original data until the beginning of therapy with metformin,
which is known to influence body weight and associated parameters. Thereafter they were treated as dropouts. The changes from
baseline in Table 4 are given as adjusted means after different
approaches to account for the dropouts. The original estimates
from the mixed model approach used all available measurements
at corresponding visits. MI shows values after multiple imputation, and LOCF and BOCF give values after the last observation
carried forward and baseline observation carried forward procedure. In all 3 groups body weight, blood pressure, and most of
the obesity-related biochemical parameters improved relative to
baseline (first 3 columns). Compared with the controls (columns
4 and 5), the groups with telemonitoring showed statistically

### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

most cases thereafter. (Color figure available online.)


greater effects on relative and absolute weight, BMI, and waist
circumference and, in the ABC group only, on triglycerides,
CRP, HbA1c, and the parameters of insulin resistance. The magnitude of the effects was greatest for the high-sensitivity CRP
(−48% and −28%) and for the HOMA index (−38% and −36%)
in the ABC and 4S groups, respectively. If we compare ABC
with 4S, the former was more effective with respect to the absolute and the relative weight, BMI, as well as apolipoprotein B.
Quality of life was assessed by means of the WHO-5 questionnaire [16]. The return rates after 12 months were 62%, 57%,
and 45% in groups ABC, 4S, and controls, respectively, and
the well-being indices increased by 44% (p < 0.001), 33%
(p < 0.001), and 20% (nonsignificant).
Fig. 4 shows the proportion of patients for whom a diagnosis
of metabolic syndrome was no longer applicable after 12 months
because one or more of the International Diabetes Federation
criteria had disappeared. This rate was 33% in the control group,
as opposed to 41% in the 4S group and 58% in the ABC group.


## DISCUSSION

The major finding of this study is that telemonitoring of
both physical activity and food intake considerably improves
weight reduction and corrects metabolic syndrome in a majority
of patients. With regard to communication with the patients, the
weekly letters of the ABC program were more effective than the
monthly telephone calls in the 4S group.
The magnitude of the observed weight loss can be regarded as quite satisfactory, in particular in the ABC group,
with a reduction of adjusted body weight by 12.2 kg (11.4%).
A weight reduction program is regarded as medically relevant when an individual loses more than 5% of the baseline
weight [17–21]. This aim was achieved in 82% of the subjects completing the study in the ABC group and in 68%
in the 4S group. The substantial > 15% weight loss was
achieved by a remarkable 43% of the subjects in the ABC
group.

### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

Mobile technology has been used repeatedly in weight loss
studies, but the technical approaches differed considerably. Several studies used PDAs, mobile phones, and the Internet to exchange written information concerning meals, activities, and
respective recommendations. Intervention studies of this kind
during 1 year [22–27] report weight losses of between 1.3 kg

[25] and 7.6 kg [24]. Studies using pedometers or accelerometers to measure physical activity are less frequent [28–31]. All
included regular face-to-face counseling and were carried out
for periods shorter than in the present study. Richardson et al.

[29] achieved a weight loss of 4.1 lbs after 3 weeks in 12 participants (BMI 37), and Polzien et al. [28] reported a weight loss of
6.2 kg in 19 patients (BMI 32.6) after 12 weeks. Andersen et al.

[31] reported data that can be compared with our results. They
advised 20 women (BMI 32.4) to observe a 1200 kcal/d diet and
to increase their moderate physical activity by 30 minutes per
day over 16 weeks. In addition, the patients wore accelerometers
whose readings were evaluated at each of 16 weekly counseling meetings. This group lost 8.7% (7.9 kg), which compares
well with our 4-month weight reductions of 9.2% in the ABC
group and of 7.5% in the 4S group. Our effects are, therefore,
in line with satisfactory results obtained by other investigators.
However, our study extends the knowledge taken from earlier
studies in 2 respects: in the first place, higher weight losses can
be achieved by longer interventions (Figs. 2 and 3). Secondly,
this weight loss can be achieved by telemonitoring without faceto-face counseling, which is time-consuming for both patients
and carers.
What are the major elements contributing to these favorable
results? In her review of technology-based weight loss interventions Anna Khaylis [3] concluded that 5 key components are required for effective weight loss: self-monitoring, counselor feedback and communication, social support, a structured program,
and the use of an individually tailored program. These 5 components are indeed elements of the intervention used in our study, in
particular in the ABC group. Self-monitoring is carried out using
the screen of the Aipermotion instrument. Counselor feedback
was provided by mail (ABC) or by telephone (4S). A kind of


social support was ensured by the ABC letters showing the
weight loss curves of the other patients, thus introducing group
dynamics. The program was structured in terms of goals for diet
and activity, with regular feedback. Finally, individual tailoring
was ensured by specific reactions of the carers to the nutritional
and physical data transmitted to them via the Internet.
The weight reductions were associated with relevant benefits in blood pressure and in biochemical parameters. The most
pronounced effect was the improvement in parameters known
to be associated with insulin resistance. This finding strengthens our belief that the 2 combined intervention measures used in
this study, namely, a low-calorie diet replacing high-GI carbohydrates with low-GI carbohydrates plus an increase in moderate
physical activity, reinforce each other in reducing insulin resistance. The number of patients with a baseline pathological
HOMA index decreased from 18 to 4 after 12 months in the
ABC group (−78%) and from 13 to 5 in the 4S group (−61%).
The overall improvements are also reflected in the satisfying proportion of patients in whom a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
was no longer applicable (Fig. 4).
The finding that even the control group lost 3.7 kg (“original”
in Table 4) warrants discussion, in particular because this was
accompanied by a 33% reduction in the occurrence of metabolic
syndrome in this group (Fig. 4). Three points may be considered.
The first is that we believe that the instruction given to all 3
intervention groups, namely, the recommendations concerning
the Magdeburg Dual Diet and optimized physical exercise, was
quite effective. Secondly, this instruction was given at a time
at which the participants became concerned about health risks
detected in their initial physical and blood examinations. The
third point concerns a potential selection bias. The control group
had the highest rate of dropouts (36%) as opposed to 16% and
18% in the other 2 groups. It is probable that the lost cases
were those with the smallest weight losses. This assumption is
supported by the intention-to-treat assessment using the LOCF
and BOCF protocols (Table 4), which yielded weight losses of
3.0 and 2.5 kg instead of 3.7 kg from the “original” evaluation for
the control group. It may be therefore concluded that the results
for the control subjects who completed the study overestimate
the true effects.
This study also compared 2 methods of communication between the carers and the patients. The results show clearly that
weekly information letters are better than monthly telephone
calls. This was not expected at the outset, because communication by mail occurred entirely without personal contact for a
whole year, whereas the monthly telephone calls allowed about
20 minutes of personal attention each time. We believe that 3
aspects contribute to the better effect in the ABC group. First,
the feedback was more frequent: weekly instead of monthly.
Second, a letter provides written documentation of the patient’s
data, in particular of his or her progress and of the carers’ motivating responses. Finally, an element of group dynamics was


-----

introduced by displaying the weight loss curves of other patients
in the given group.
One important question in all weight reduction programs is
the dropout rate. In this study the rates after 1 year were 18%
in the ABC group and 17% in the 4S group. A recent study of
772 participants using a conventional weight reduction program
known worldwide [32] reported a 12-month dropout rate of 39%,
which is more than twice as high. This satisfactory adherence
to the program most probably reflects an important advantage
of telemonitoring, namely, that the patients do not lose time by
visiting their carers.
A second major question relating to weight reduction concerns rebound weight gain. In many studies weight loss reaches a
maximum after about 6 months and is then followed by a steady
weight gain [33,34]. Such weight gain was observed in our
study only in the control group after 8 months (Fig. 3). Groups
ABC and 4S showed additional—although small—increases in
weight loss (Figs. 2 and 3). One major reason for the frequent
failure to maintain an achieved weight loss is that intake and
storage of nutritional energy is one of the most important selfpreservation instincts. Continuous suppression of this instinct,
particularly when one is confronted with a wealth of calorie-rich
food and powerful advertisements for its consumption, requires
more willpower than many individuals can exert. In contrast,
increasing and maintaining physical activity may in the long run
be easier, especially when one is rewarded by daily readings
of personal achievement in combination with regular positive
feedback from a respected carer.

## STRENGTHS, LIMITATIONS, AND CONCLUSION


### Weight Loss in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome

## FUNDING


This study was embedded within the “lifescience.biz” project
kindly cofunded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
and Research (BMBF), reference number 01FC08063.

## REFERENCES


The strengths of this study are sufficiently large group sizes,
duration of the intervention, and an elaborate intent-to-treat evaluation of the data. A limitation is that the data for dropouts can
only be estimated, as in many other weight loss studies. Overestimation (e.g., in the LOCF procedure) is probable, as is underestimation (e.g., in BOCF). In addition, there was a certain
imbalance in baseline weight caused by a higher proportion of
men in the ABC group. This may have only partly been balanced
by reporting parameters that are less dependent of the baseline
weight such as relative weight loss and lowering of BMI. A
further limitation of this study is that it does not allow one to
decide which of the telemonitoring components is more effective: physical activity or nutrition. Finally, more work is needed
to test the long-term effects of this new treatment strategy.
Taken together, the results show that telemonitoring of nutrition and physical activity without intermittent face-to-face
counseling can yield satisfactory weight loss, in particular when
communication with the patients is by weekly letters as in the
ABC group. In association with weight loss, there were relevant
improvements in symptoms of metabolic syndrome.
