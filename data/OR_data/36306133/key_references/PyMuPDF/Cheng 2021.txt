Background: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused on the general
population and pregnant women, while little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2
on retardation during and after pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
potential inﬂuence of SARS-CoV-2 on infant neurobehavioral development.
Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Maternal and Child Health Hospital
of Hubei Province. Nine pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 9 controls
matched by maternal age, parity, and status of chronic disease were included.
Infantile neurobehavioral development was assessed through the Ages and Stages
Questionnaires Edition 3 (ASQ-3).
Results:
The majority of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 experienced cesarean
section (7 of 9), which was higher than the control group (5 of 9). The throat swabs
of all newborn were negative. We found that compared with the control group,
neonates of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy had lower scores in
communication, gross movement, ﬁne movement, problem solving, and personal-social
domains; but only ﬁne movement domain yielded statistical signiﬁcance (P = 0.031).
Conclusion: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy may have a certain impact
on infant neurobehavioral development. Further studies with larger sample size are
warranted for validation.

INTRODUCTION
The current pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly infectious disease.
Importantly, on March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing
outbreak of COVID-19 virus had become a global pandemic (1, 2). However, nobody can reliably
predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last.
Pregnant women are a special group and are at higher risk for acquiring infection and dying
compared with nonpregnant women (3, 4). Because of the immune and physiological changes that
accompany pregnancy, pregnant women are more likely to encounter a series of negative emotions

COVID-19 and Infant Neurobehavioral Development
during the pandemic (5). In addition, the measures to deal
with COVID-19 (such as isolation, physical distance, home
isolation, and remote consultation with health professionals,
etc.) may result in the inability to obtain the expected level
of support and care before delivery, which may increase the
psychological pressure of pregnant women (6, 7). Furthermore,
studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 has direct neuroinvasion
ability (8), which may attack the human central nervous system
and have a potential impact on the survivors’ cognitive and
neuropsychological functions (9, 10). Mother and baby are
closely linked during pregnancy, it is widely believed that the
maternal psychological stress, as a teratogen, will continuously
transmit painful signals to the unborn child, which may cause
adverse eﬀects on the fetus (11). Moreover, early mother-
infant separation due to mandatory or voluntary isolation
after childbirth may also have a negative impact on infant
feeding and thereby early development (12–14). At present,
there is little research evidence showing the long-term eﬀects
of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their babies.
Research is needed to evaluate the burden of SARS-CoV-2
infection during pregnancy in children’s personality formation
and neurobehavioral development.
Above all, this study aims to evaluate the eﬀect of maternal
SARS-CoV-2 infection on the neurobehavioral development of
their babies, so as to improve the preventive behavior and health
care strategies for pregnant women, new mothers and babies
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS
Study Population
A total of 60 patients delivered at the Maternal and Child Health
Hospital of Hubei province from January 24 to March 14, 2020,
and were conﬁrmed to have COVID-19 by laboratory and clinical
diagnosis. The maternal and fetal characteristics of the 60 patients
in this study were shown in Supplementary Table 1. Later, 51
patients who refused to ﬁnish the Ages and Stages Questionnaires
Edition 3 (ASQ-3) questionnaire were excluded. Finally, a total
of 9 patients were included in the present analysis. Subsequently,
we matched 9 pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2 infection
and delivered at the same period at a ratio of 1:1 according
to maternal age (within 3 years), parity, and status of chronic
disease (including diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and
hepatic disease). All research subjects were recruited in the third
trimester. Sociodemographic information and blood samples
were collected upon admission. The ﬂowchart of the exclusion
and inclusion process of our study population is presented in
Figure 1. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics
Committee of Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei
Province (No. 2021IECLW013).
Neurobehavioral Assessment in Neonates
ASQ-3 is a parent-rated screening tool for the delay of child
early development at diﬀerent ages and stages. ASQ-3 contains
21 questionnaire series, covering all children from 1 month to
5 and a half years old. The children in our study were between 8
and 10 months old when they were surveyed. The ASQ-3 subscale
FIGURE 1 | Flowchart of the case-control samples in this study.
contains 30 items divided into ﬁve developmental domains
(six items per domain): communication, gross movement, ﬁne
movement, problem solving, and personal-social. Each item is
rated to a score of 0, 5, and 10, with a total score for each
domain of ASQ-3 ranging from 0 to 60 scores (15). There is also a
comprehensive question section, which is about the concerns that
parents may have about their children. A higher score indicates
a higher developmental level for children at each month, and
“developmental delay” is deﬁned as a child whose ASQ-3 score
is lower than the critical point of their age in any of the ﬁve ASQ-
3 areas (16). We contacted the parents of the children by phone,
and explained the contents of the ASQ-3 questionnaire and the
matters needing attention to ﬁll in. An online questionnaire was
completed by the child’s guardian to obtain an ASQ-3 score.
Data Collection
The clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory ﬁndings and
radiologic assessments were extracted from electronic medical
records. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the
data. Maternal respiratory swabs were collected and tested for
SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay (17). Positive conﬁrmatory cases of SARS-COV-
2 infection were deﬁned as a case where any laboratory test results
were positive.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous and categorical variables were presented as mean
± standard deviation (SD), median [interquartile range (IQR)]
and frequency (percentage) when suitable. Continuous variables
were compared between two groups by using 2-tail Student’s t-
test or Mann-Whitney’s U-test when appropriate, and categorical
variables were compared by using chi-square test. All statistical

analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. A two-tailed
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Maternal Characteristics and Outcomes
The maternal characteristics of cases are shown in Table 1.
COVID-19 pregnancies were 31.8 ± 4.6 years old (vs. 31.0 ±
4.9 years old in the control group), and their gestational age
at delivery was 38.0 ± 1.1 weeks (vs. 38.9 ± 1.1 weeks in the
control group). Besides, the median number of gravidity was
3 in pregnancies with COVID-19, signiﬁcantly higher than the
control group (P = 0.003).
All COVID-19 patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2
infection in the third trimester and presented with mild infection.
None of the patients had suﬀered diabetes, chronic hypertension,
or cardiovascular disease before pregnancy. Seven of the nine
patients had cesarean section, more than the control group
(ﬁve of nine). As shown in Table 2, all COVID-19 patients
were in stable condition throughout the pregnancy, with body
temperature ﬂuctuating within a range of 37.0–38.6◦C.
Infant’s Characteristics and
Neurobehavioral Development
As shown in Table 1, all live birth newborn throat swabs in
our study were negative. The proportion of premature birth
and low birth weight among the newborns of pregnant women
with COVID-19 were slightly higher than the control group.
Meanwhile, the 1-min Apgar score of the aﬀected group was
9.8 ± 0.4, which was lower than that of the control group
(10.0 ± 0.0, P < 0.001).
We found that compared with normal pregnant women,
neonates of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 had lower
scores in communication, gross movement, ﬁne movement,
problem solving, and personal-social domains. However, only
the diﬀerence of the ﬁne movement domain reached statistically
signiﬁcant (P = 0.031, Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This is a case-control study comparing the neurobehavioral
development of neonates in pregnant women with and without
COVID-19. It is worth noting that, compared with the control
group, the newborns of COVID-19 patients have lower scores in
the ﬁve developmental areas of ASQ-3, and the diﬀerence in ﬁne
movement domain is statistically signiﬁcant.
Pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to have
babies delivered preterm or with low birth weight, which
were strongly associated with delayed cognitive and motor
development in infants (18). Motor skills in early infancy can
predict the development of infants’ subsequent communication
ability, and also reﬂect the strength of learning ability to
a certain extent (19). Considering the plasticity of young
brain, early detection and early intervention is more eﬀective
than post-remedies (20). Therefore, it is especially important
to take eﬀective early intervention to prevent and improve
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.

Pregnant women’s mental health needs more attention
during the pandemic. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is a
neuroinvasive virus that may have direct and indirect eﬀects on
the central nervous system (9), and may have long-term adverse
consequences for the patients’ cognitive and neuropsychological
function (9, 21). On the other hand, fear and uncertainty about
the short and long-term eﬀects on themselves and their children
may deteriorate mothers’ depressive and anxiety symptoms (22).
Ultimately, the mental health of pregnant women may adversely
aﬀect the neurobehavioral development of newborns (23).
Breast feeding is now recommended in asymptomatic or mild
symptomatic women. Nevertheless, in the ﬁrst line reaction to
pandemic, breast-feeding rates are very low in the ﬁrst few
months of the fetus, due to fear of maternal-fetal transmission
(24). This may have negative eﬀects on infant brain development
and mother-infant relationship (25). Studies have found that
early childhood experiences and environmental inﬂuences leave
a lasting mark on brain structure and long-term health (26–28).
Furthermore, early childhood adversity is related to impairment
of learning, behavior, and physical and mental health in the
future (27). Therefore, we advocate active health education
and guidance on breastfeeding and parenting behavior for
aﬀected pregnant women and their families during the pandemic
for possible mother-to-child separation and early cessation of

breastfeeding on infants. Also, timely monitoring of pregnant
women’s mental health, so as to eﬀectively prevent and early
detect psychological trauma.
At present, there is much controversy relating to the
possibility of vertical mother-to-baby transmission of SARS-
CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has been conﬁrmed to have the ability of
passing through placental barrier (29). In addition, severe SARS-
CoV-2 placenta infection may trigger fetal inﬂammatory
response,
leading
to
organ
damage
and
developmental
deﬁciencies (30). However, vertical transmission seems to
occur in a minority of cases of maternal COVID-19 infection
in the third trimester (31, 32). Consistent with several studies
(33–36), we found no evidence of vertical transmission. Thus,
we believe that there is still no deﬁnite evidence of vertical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Our study has drawn a link between maternal COVID-19
and early infantile developmental delay in many domains,
such as communication, gross movement, problem solving,
personal-social, and social-emotional. Nevertheless, there are
some limitations to our study that should be considered. First,
the results of this study were limited by the small sample
size, which may lead to unstable results. As the ﬁrst batch of
aﬀected pregnancies in Wuhan, the mothers and their newborns
underwent many examinations for both clinic and research
purpose, therefore the participants’ participation and compliance
were less optimistic than expected. However, the maternal and
fetal characteristics were comparable between included and
overall aﬀected population in the current study. Second, the
ASQ-3 questionnaire survey in this study is conducted by phone
and the Internet. Third, whether SARS-COV-2 can be propagated
through vertical mother-to-baby transmission requires further
research. In the future, it is necessary to carry out follow-up
studies on COVID-19 pregnant women and their newborns
to address these problems in order to make up for these
shortcomings and gaps.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy may have
an adverse eﬀect on infant neurobehavioral development. We
call for more research to estimate the burden of SARS-COV-2
infection in the formation of personality and neurobehavioral
development of the children conceived in the era of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
