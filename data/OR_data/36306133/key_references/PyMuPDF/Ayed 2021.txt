Abstract 
41 
Background 
42 
An increasing proportion of women are being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
43 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy. Intrauterine viral infections induce an increase 
44 
in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which inhibit the proliferation of neuronal precursor 
45 
cells and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. Whether 
46 
a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the 
47 
present study is to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS-
48 
CoV-2 infections during pregnancy.  
49 
Methods 
50 
 In this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopment status of infants (N=298) born to women 
51 
with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10-12 months post discharge 
52 
using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were 
53 
classified into developmental delays (cutoff score: ≤2 standard deviations (SDs) below the 
54 
population mean) and no delay (score >2 SDs above the population mean). 
55 
 Results 
56 
 Approximately 10% of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy 
57 
showed developmental delays. Two of 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both 
58 
had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infection 
59 
during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those 
60 
whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P=0.039) and second trimesters 
61 
(P=0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester.

Infants born at <31 weeks gestation were more prone to developmental delays than those born at 
63 
>31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002).

 Conclusion 
65 
 The findings of the study highlight the need for long term neurodevelopmental assessment of 
66 
infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background 
71 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus 
72 
disease-19 (COVID-19), has been spreading rapidly worldwide, increasingly affecting even 
73 
pregnant females. Pregnancy-associated physiological changes, as well as altered cell-mediated 
74 
immunity, enhance the susceptibility of pregnant women to infections by intracellular organisms 
75 
such as viruses. Based on a living systematic review and meta-analysis, overall, 10% (95% 
76 
confidence interval (CI): 7-12%; 73 studies involving 67271 women) of pregnant and recently 
77 
pregnant women attending or admitted to the hospital for any reason were diagnosed as having 
78 
suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [1]. Hence, a growing proportion of pregnant 
79 
women become infected with SARS-CoV-2 during various trimesters of pregnancy, with 
80 
variable effects on the fetus [1,2]. 
81 
 
82 
Furthermore, the underdeveloped innate and adaptive immune systems of fetuses and neonates 
83 
also make them more susceptible to infections [3, 4]. Maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-
84 
2 has not been widely established to date, and findings vary. A meta-analysis revealed that

vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible and showed that only 3.2% (27 of 936; 95% 
86 
CI: 2.2-4.3) of neonates from mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a positive result based on 
87 
viral RNA testing of nasopharyngeal swabs [5]. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA testing was positive in 
88 
neonatal cord blood (2.9% samples), placental swabs (7.7%), and fecal or rectal swabs, whereas 
89 
it was negative in urine and amniotic fluid samples. In contrast, a more recent systematic review 
90 
article (2021), which covered the database up to September 2020, reported that newborn rates of 
91 
the infection vary between 0% and 11.5% [6]. Nevertheless, due to the availability of only a few 
92 
patients and studies, the exact rates of vertical transmission and fetal or neonatal morbidity and 
93 
mortality cannot be ascertained. 
94 
 
95 
Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory distress, it is also known to have 
96 
extrapulmonary manifestations, including hematological, cardiovascular, endocrinological, and 
97 
neurological complications, in the adult population [7-9]. Of these, neurological manifestations 
98 
in pregnant women and their probable effect on fetuses and neonates are of primary concern. 
99 
SARS-CoV-2 may gain entry into the central nervous system through the nasal mucosa, lamina 
100 
cribrosa, and olfactory bulb or through retrograde axonal transport. SARS-CoV-2 also exhibits 
101 
neurovirulence, triggering proinflammatory and prothrombotic cascades in the wake of cytokine 
102 
storms, affecting brain vasculature, as well as the blood-brain barrier, mainly in the setting of the 
103 
toxic-metabolic sequelae of multiorgan dysfunction frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2-
104 
positive patients [10,11]. Proinflammatory cytokines inhibit the proliferation of neuronal 
105 
precursor cells, activate astrogliosis, and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to 
106 
abnormal neurodevelopment [3, 4]. Moreover, the elevated levels of maternal inflammatory 
107 
cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) as a consequence of infection during pregnancy can

disturb several characteristics of fetal brain development [12]. Notably, these pathological 
109 
changes, which include deteriorated neuronal functions and atypical behavioral changes, can 
110 
subsequently be seen in postnatal life and may increase the risk of schizophrenia, autism, and 
111 
mental disorders [12, 13]. 
112 
 
113 
Additionally, animal studies have shown that offspring from maternal immune activation animal 
114 
models have schizophrenia and autism-related behaviors, including decreased sensorimotor 
115 
gating, deficits in working memory and cognitive flexibility, increased anxiety, and enhanced 
116 
sensitivity to amphetamines [14-16]. 
117 
 
118 
Because of the plausible effects on neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections 
119 
during pregnancy, this study assessed the developmental attainment at 10-12 months of neonates 
120 
born to a cohort of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy in Kuwait using the 
121 
Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3).

2.1Participants 
125 
In this prospective cohort study, infants born between April 1 and August 30, 2020, to mothers 
126 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection during various trimesters of pregnancy were evaluated. Pregnant 
127 
women who tested positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 
128 
SARS-CoV-2 (Cobas 6800 Systems, Roche, Switzerland)/(TaqPath, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, 
129 
USA) were identified from the Kuwait National COVID-19 registry. Mothers with equivocal 
130 
RT-PCR test results and those with missing data were not included in the study. Verbal informed

consent was obtained from all the parents who participated in the study. Ethics approval was 
132 
granted by the Ministry of Health, (2021-1638), Government of Kuwait. 
133 
Demographic details were collected for all infants enrolled in the follow-up study. Maternal 
134 
clinical and neonatal data from acute hospital admissions were collected by retrospective chart 
135 
review of the included participants and have been previously published [17]. 
136 
2.2 Instrument 
137 
The ASQ-3 (http://agesandstages.com/) is a widely used screening tool for assessing 
138 
development in children aged 1–66 months at a low cost, with cutoff scores identifying 
139 
developmental delays. The screening tool has strong validity, and its use has been widespread in 
140 
assessing development in children [18]. The ASQ-3 has five domains: communication, gross 
141 
motor skills, fine motor skills, problem-solving capacity, and personal-social development. 
142 
In the current study, we used the ASQ-3 to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes at 10-12 
143 
months postdischarge. Parents of infants completed the ASQ-3, which has a series of 21 
144 
developmental screening questions. Three study investigators (MAL, MK, and AE) scored the 
145 
questionnaire results using the ASQ-3 age-specific scoring sheet. In each domain, six items were 
146 
scored as present in the infant, sometimes present or not yet shown by the infant, with 10, 5, and 
147 
0 points, respectively. If an item was not filled in, a score of 0 was assigned based on the lowest 
148 
possible result. Responses were summed to give a score of 0 to 60 for each domain and an 
149 
overall maximum ASQ-3 score of 300 points. ASQ-3 results were categorized according to 
150 
questionnaire-defined subscale cutoff scores into 1) developmental delays, with an ASQ-3 cutoff 
151 
score of ≤2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean on 1 or more domains, and 2) 
152 
no delay, with a cutoff score >2 SDs above the population mean [18].

The questionnaire was sent in two languages: the Arabic version for Arabic-speaking parents and 
154 
the English version for non-Arabic-speaking parents. The questionnaire was completed by 
155 
parents and reviewed in a telephone interview with one investigator. Parents were encouraged to 
156 
provide their responses with their interpretation without prompting.

2.3 Statistical analysis 
159 
All data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database. Categorical variables were summarized as 
160 
counts (n) and percentages (%), and continuous variables were summarized as the median and 
161 
interquartile range (IQR). Statistical comparisons between the groups were performed using the 
162 
chi-squared test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous 
163 
variables. 
164 
We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis for each potential predictor of 
165 
developmental delays. Variables with a P value of <0.1 on the univariate analysis were included 
166 
in the model (maternal age and trimester at SARS-CoV-2 infection) and adjusted for gestational 
167 
age, birth weight, sex, parental education and type of feeding in the first 6 months of age. The 
168 
results of the regression analysis are presented as an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% CI. 
169 
Statistical significance was taken at P<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA 14 
170 
software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

study period (Figure 1). One infant died on the first day of life due to severe birth asphyxia; 298 
176 
(67%) had complete follow-up at 10-12 months corrected age, and 146 (32.8%) infants were lost 
177 
to follow-up. The main reason for the loss to follow-up was the inability to contact the parents 
178 
due to either invalid contact information or parents having left the country. To determine 
179 
whether the infants we lost to follow-up were representative of the complete study and to avoid 
180 
attrition bias, we compared the baseline features of those infants with follow-up data with the 
181 
baseline features of infants who were lost to follow-up. We did not find any statistically 
182 
significant differences between these two groups. 
183 
The maternal and neonatal characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1.  
184 
Among the infants with completed ASQ-3, 5 (1.7%) were born to mothers diagnosed with 
185 
SARS-CoV-2 during the first trimester, 20 (6.7%) during the second trimester, and 273 (91.6%) 
186 
during the third trimester. Only 2 (0.7%) neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
187 
Twenty-eight infants needed hospitalization beyond the first 8-10 months of age. 
188 
Parental questionnaires were collected at a median of 10.3 months corrected age (IQR 10 to 
189 
12.7). Developmental delays were identified in 30 (10.1%) of the infants. Of those with 
190 
developmental delays, 3.3% (1/30) had delays in the communication domains, 27% (8/30) in the 
191 
gross motor domain, 40% (12/30) in the fine motor domain, 10% (3/30) in the problem-solving 
192 
domain, and 30% (9/30) in the personal-social domain (Figure 2).  
193 
In the infants with developmental delays, 4 had concerns in two or more domains, and none had 
194 
concerns in all domains. 
195 
Infants with developmental delays did not differ in terms of maternal age, maternal 
196 
comorbidities, parental education level, severe maternal COVID-19, or the mode of delivery

compared to those with no delay (Table 2). However, the occurrence of developmental delays 
198 
differed significantly on the basis of the trimester at SARS-CoV-2 infection. Developmental 
199 
delays were more common in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during the first and 
200 
second trimesters than in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during the third trimester 
201 
(P<0.001). Among infants with developmental delays, 4 (13.3%) were born to mothers with 
202 
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester, 6 (20%) were born to mothers with SARS-
203 
CoV-2 infection during the second trimester, and 20 (66.7%) were born to mothers with SARS-
204 
CoV-2 infection in the third trimester. One (0.4%) of the infants without delay was born to a 
205 
mother with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester, 14 (5.2%) were born to mothers with 
206 
SARS-CoV-2 infections in the second trimester, and 253 (94.4%) were born to mothers with 
207 
SARS-CoV-2 infections in the third trimester. Moreover, infants born at less than 31 weeks 
208 
gestation were more likely to have developmental delays than infants born at more than 31 
209 
weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002). Neonatal characteristics were similar between the 
210 
groups. 
211 
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for maternal age, parental educational level, 
212 
gestational age, birth weight, and the type of feeding in the first six months of age, the risk of 
213 
developmental delays was higher with first-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 8.2, 
214 
95% CI: 1.1-55.9; P=0.039) and second-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 8.1, 
215 
95% CI: 2.4-27.7; P=0.001) than with third-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3).

weight, fetal distress, and neonatal asphyxia [19-21]. This is perhaps the first study reporting 
221 
neurological assessments of neonates born to mothers from West Asia with SARS-CoV-2-
222 
positive RT-PCR test results during pregnancy using the ASQ-3. The findings of this study 
223 
indicate that infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during 
224 
pregnancy need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental delays. 
225 
 
226 
To assess the developmental attainment of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2-positive 
227 
test results during pregnancy, this study employed the ASQ-3, a screening tool used for assessing 
228 
the developmental attainment of infants and young children [18]. This screening tool is used 
229 
widely in assessing development in children aged 1–66 months at a low cost, with cutoff scores 
230 
identifying developmental delays. In the current study, an Arabic version of the ASQ-3 was used 
231 
for mothers who were well versed in Arabic. Since the study cohort included diverse as well as 
232 
immigrant mothers, questionnaires were sent to mothers, and fortunately, the majority of them 
233 
consented to respond. 
234 
 
235 
The study data revealed that the majority (91.6%) of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 
236 
infection during their third trimester, whereas 6.7% had SARS-CoV-2 infection in their second 
237 
trimester. This finding is in agreement with those of other studies that have also reported that 
238 
most SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnant women occur in their third trimester [22, 23]. In the 
239 
current study, only a relatively small number of women were infected during the first trimester. 
240 
However, first-trimester infections are important as the principal stages of brain development, 
241 
such as primary neurulation (weeks 3–4), prosencephalic development (months 2–3), and 
242 
neuronal proliferation (months 3–4), occur during the early stages of pregnancy [24]. In fact,

neurological manifestations [25]. Owing to the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19, 
247 
information related to pregnancy outcomes among women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the 
248 
consequences of infant exposure to the virus is very scarce. As more women become infected 
249 
during their first and second trimesters progress in their pregnancy and as newborns with SARS-
250 
CoV-2 infection develop, a better understanding of the neurological effects of this novel virus 
251 
will emerge. In brief, various types of evidence support the theory that maternal infection and/or 
252 
inflammation occurring during critical periods of fetal development could alter brain structure 
253 
and function in a time-sensitive manner. 
254 
Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the chances of fetal distress, leading to high 
255 
incidences of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [23]. Similar to other reported 
256 
studies, in the current study, 76 out of 298 (25.5%) neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2-
257 
infection during pregnancy required NICU admission [26-29]. On the other hand, a systematic 
258 
review reported that approximately 95% of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 
259 
infection during pregnancy were born in good condition [1]. 
260 
 
261 
Recent evidence suggests that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 either antenatally or 
262 
intrapartum can occur, but it is uncommon. In this study, only 2 (0.7%) neonates tested positive 
263 
for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and notwithstanding some seemingly perinatal complications, the 
264 
majority of neonates (296 out 298) born were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our 
265 
observation is in agreement with those of other studies [30-32], which implies that the

consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neurodevelopment were largely due to in utero 
267 
effects rather than direct effects on the fetus. The reason for the low vertical transmission rate is 
268 
that the placenta has low expression of the canonical receptors necessary for viral entry, which 
269 
may explain the rarity of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [32]. Importantly, teratogenic 
270 
effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the fetus were not observed, which is in contrast to other viral 
271 
infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, CMV, herpes virus, Zika 
272 
virus, and Rubella virus infections [33-37]. 
273 
 
274 
In this study, we evaluated the infant’s neurobehavioral development 10-12 months post 
275 
discharge, perhaps the adequate duration for effects to appear. In this study, overall, 69.1% of 
276 
neonates at the end of 10-12 months showed normal developmental attainment, and only 10.1% 
277 
(n=30) showed developmental delays. The PregCOV-19 living systematic review [1] found that 
278 
approximately 95% of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were reported to be born 
279 
in good condition. However, it is not clear whether this systematic review included evaluations 
280 
of neurodevelopmental delays in neonates. A study from the UK, in which information about 
281 
educational and behavioral problems was collected from 177 children, found that 25% required 
282 
support from a nonteaching assistant, 4% required a statement of special educational needs, and 
283 
3% were in a special school [38]. Many investigators have studied the effects of various viral 
284 
infections, albeit not SARS-CoV-2, on pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes and have reported 
285 
that maternal influenza, hepatitis C, varicella-zoster, and other viruses produce distinct fetal 
286 
brain structure and anatomy clinical pathology of varying severity [39-42].

Of note, the role of cytokine storms, particularly the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of 
289 
neurodevelopmental disorders, is not fully elucidated; however, in a longitudinal study, 
290 
alterations in brain architecture, executive function, and working memory abilities were reported 
291 
in 2-year-old neonates exposed to increased IL-6 levels during pregnancy [43]. An analysis of 
292 
214 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that 36% had neurological symptoms [44]. 
293 
Many case-control studies have demonstrated that elevated maternal cytokine levels affect the 
294 
fetal brain, causing neurological disease [45-47]. The FIRS, due to increased IL-6 following 
295 
maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection [13], may induce a wide range of adverse neurodevelopmental 
296 
sequelae, such as autism, psychosis, and neurosensory deficits, later in life [48], similar to certain 
297 
bacterial infections [49]. However, long-term longitudinal studies are required to validate these 
298 
associations. 
299 
 
300 
Moreover, the risk of neurological effects on neonates differs by the trimester when SARS-CoV-
301 
2 infection occurred [50]. In this study, developmental delays were relatively more prevalent 
302 
when infection occurred in the first and second trimesters than when infection occurred in the 
303 
third trimester (P<0.001). Neonatal characteristics were similar between the groups. Moreover, 
304 
infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation were more likely to have developmental delays than 
305 
those born at more than 31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002). 
306 
The findings of the study may be considered reliable, as the cohort of parents who participated in 
307 
the study was well educated, and women were young (median age: 31 years). Three-fourths of 
308 
women were devoid of pregnancy-induced hypertension or gestational diabetes.

 This is perhaps the first study reporting neurological assessments of neonates born to mothers 
311 
with SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR test results during pregnancy using the ASQ-3. The 
312 
participating mothers were from the local area, which enabled good tracking for follow-ups. 
313 
Participants were educated and responded to ASQ-3 questions appropriately. Thus, these points 
314 
may be regarded as strength of the study. 
315 
 
316 
This study also has a few limitations, the most important aspects of which are related to the 
317 
sample size and methodology. For stronger conclusions, a larger and statistically valid sample 
318 
size is required. Furthermore, the ASQ-3 were completed by the parents of the neonates; hence, 
319 
biases in reporting cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, this initial study may help healthcare 
320 
authorities understand the need to assess the developmental attainment of infants born to mothers 
321 
with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results during pregnancy. The ASQ-3, although a good 
322 
screening tool, has limitations, and its results may not be strongly comparable to those of other 
323 
tools, such as the Bayley III test; therefore, further larger studies with formal assessments of 
324 
neurodevelopment are warranted. 
325 
 
326 
6 Conclusions  
327 
This study was a hypothesis-generating study, and the findings based on a screening tool raise 
328 
some concerns regarding neurodevelopmental effects on fetuses born to mothers with SARS-
329 
CoV-2-positive test results during pregnancy. A majority of the pregnant women had SARS-
330 
CoV-2 infections during their third trimester. Developmental delays were more prevalent when 
331 
SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the first and second trimesters than when it occurred in the 
332 
third trimester. Infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation were more likely to have

developmental delays than those born at more than 31 weeks gestation. Further larger studies

with formal developmental assessments are warranted to study the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the
