Developmental delay among babies during the pandemic - 3 
 
Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial and widespread changes to many prenatal 
(e.g., maternal stress) and postnatal (e.g., socialization) factors contributing to early child 
development. This has led to concerns about potential increases in developmental delays among 
infants born during the pandemic.1 In particular, decreased opportunities for social interaction are 
of concern because they are associated with decreased language and socioemotional 
milestones.2,3 We compared developmental screening of 1-year old infants born between April 
17, 2020-November 11, 2020 to data from infants born pre-pandemic with similar 
sociodemographic characteristics. We aimed to determine whether risk for developmental delay 
was elevated among infants born during the pandemic compared to infants born prior to the 
pandemic. 
 
Methods 
The University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada) Research Ethics Board approved the study and 
informed consent was obtained prior to data collection. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 
Pandemic (PdP) study recruited pregnant individuals ≥17 years and ≤35 weeks gestation at 
enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French.4 At infant 1-year 
of age (adjusted for prematurity), mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-
3),5 a widely used parent-reported, norm-referenced tool recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics to screen for delayed developmental milestones.6 Infants who were 
multiples (n = 38) or had confirmed COVID-19 infection (n = 18) were excluded from analysis. 
Mean scores and odds ratios for scoring 1 or 2 SD below the normative sample mean (indicating 
moderate or high risk for developmental delay, respectively) were compared to infants born pre-

pandemic (see supplemental material for details) from the All Our Families (AOF)7 study (n = 
1275, 1y data collected 2011-12) and the Impact of Maternal and Paternal Postpartum 
Depression: Assessing Concurrent Depression in the Family (IMPACT) study (n = 3902, 1y data 
collected 2016-19). Sociodemographic characteristics were similar between cohorts 
(Supplemental Table 1), with the exception that PdP participants had higher household income, 
and more were of European descent (i.e., White).  
 
Results  
Data were available from 1623 PdP participants. PdP infants had lower mean scores relative to 
pooled pre-pandemic data on all domains except Problem Solving (Supplemental Table 1). PdP 
infants also had significantly higher risk for developmental delay (Table 1) in the 
Communication and Personal-Social domains, where the odds ratios for scoring 2 SD below the 
mean were 2.5 and 1.5, respectively, relative to pre-pandemic data. When stratified by sex, the 
odds ratios for risk of developmental delay were generally higher among female infants (Table 
2).  
Discussion  
Risks for developmental delay in the Communication and Personal-Social domains were 
elevated in infants born during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic infants, 
especially among girls. These differences may reflect reduced opportunities for social 
interactions among pandemic-born infants resulting from COVID-19 restrictions.8 The findings 
suggest that a larger portion of infants born during the pandemic will screen at risk of delay and 
require referral for time consuming and costly developmental assessments, forecasting an 
additional burden to healthcare and early learning services. Furthermore, if delays are present,

children may require more resources and support in childcare and educational settings. Risk for 
delay was relatively higher among females compared to males, perhaps reflecting greater 
susceptibility to the impoverished social environment during the pandemic.9 However, the 
percentage of infants below the cut-offs remained relatively small, suggesting that most infants 
born during the pandemic continue to develop typically without risks for developmental delay. 
 
Compared to the pre-pandemic cohorts, mothers in the PdP cohort had higher education and 
more were White, both of which reduce risk for developmental delay.10 The current findings are 
therefore remarkable because we observed developmental delay despite sociodemographic 
advantage in the pandemic sample. Consequently, the results may be a conservative estimate of 
risk for developmental delay in the population of pandemic-born infants. In conclusion, risk for 
developmental delay is increased among pandemic-born infants, especially among females and 
within the Communication and Personal-Social domains. Healthcare and education systems will 
need to be prepared to provide additional resources to support these infants as they develop.

Maternal and Paternal Postpartum Depression: Assessing Concurrent Depression in the Family 
(IMPACT) study  
IMPACT is a prospective cohort study of postpartum women and their male partners in Canada. 
Women and their partners were recruited in the immediate postpartum period in three hospital childbirth 
units in Toronto, using postpartum outreach, and via self-referral from social media advertisements (e.g., 
Twitter, Facebook) between 2015 and 2018. Participants were from Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince 
Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Yukon. Hospital recruitment occurred through trained 
research assistants who assessed parents for eligibility and obtained informed consent. Participants 
recruited through postpartum outreach and self-referral were telephoned by a trained research assistant 
who obtained informed consent and administered the baseline questionnaire. Women up to 3 weeks 
postpartum were eligible to participate if: (1) they had a singleton live birth at >33 weeks gestational age; 
(2) their partner was a male who was also willing to participate; (3) both parents could read and 
understand English; and (4) both parents had access to a telephone or the internet. Women and their 
partners were excluded if they had: (1) schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or active psychosis based on a 
self-reported clinical diagnosis or (2) active thoughts of self-harm or suicide based on a positive response 
to item 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and confirmed through additional questions. 
Ethics approval for the study was granted by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board and the 
participating hospitals. 
 
All Our Families (AOF) study 

Supplemental Material - 13 
 
The AOF study (originally referred to as All Our Babies) is a prospective cohort study of 
approximately 3200 women and their children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. A complete description of the 
AOF study has been previously published.1 AOF was designed to examine maternal and infant outcomes 
during the perinatal period and to identify current barriers and facilitators to accessing health care 
services. Pregnant individuals were recruited between 2008 and 2010 via a community-based recruitment 
strategy, involving primary health care offices, community posters, and the public health laboratory 
service (Calgary Laboratory Service CLS). All women who attended CLS for a pregnancy confirmation 
lab test were eligible to participate (~ 97% of the population). Research staff were onsite in the primary 
health care office waiting rooms to provide women with information about the study, assess eligibility, 
and obtain informed consent. Community posters also enabled women to self-identify by emailing or 
calling the research team. Through telephone calls, research staff provided these women with information 
about the study, assessed eligibility, and obtained consent to participate. Women were eligible to 
participate in the AOF study if they were less than 24 weeks and six days gestation at the time of 
enrolment, they were 18 years of age or older, they lived in the greater Calgary area, and they were able 
to complete the written questionnaires in English. Women were excluded from the AOB study if they 
planned to move outside the greater Calgary area during their pregnancy. Women who agreed to 
participate were asked to complete questionnaires and biological samples during pregnancy, and at 12 
months postpartum, women who agreed to be contacted for future research and whose child was less than 
13 months of age were invited to participate in the AOF 12-month follow-up study. Ethics approval for 
the study was granted by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board. 
 
Comparison of the PdP study to AOF and IMPACT. 
All three cohorts are community-based longitudinal prospective studies with the objective of 
generalizing to the population of pregnant individuals and their children in North America. Analysis of 
sociodemographic characteristics of the AOF sample suggest that participants are generally representative

of the pregnancy and parenting population at the local (city) and provincial levels.2 There are some 
methodological differences between the cohorts that may contribute to differences in sociodemographic 
characteristics of the samples. Most of these differences are unimportant, for example differences in 
maternal age, are trivial but statistically different. There are more substantial differences in ethnicity and 
income, where more PdP participants were White and had higher income relative to the pre-pandemic 
cohorts. These differences would be expected to reduce the occurrence of developmental delay among 
PdP infants because infants living in lower income and/or minority homes tend to have greater risk for 
developmental delay. The fact that the risk for developmental delay was increased in PdP infants relative 
to their pre-pandemic counterparts, despite the sociodemographic advantages of the PdP cohort, suggest 
that any sociodemographic advantage represented by the PdP cohort is insufficient to protect against 
increased risk for developmental delay associated with the experiences of living through the pandemic.
