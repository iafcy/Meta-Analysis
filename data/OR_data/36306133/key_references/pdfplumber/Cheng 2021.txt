during the pandemic (5). In addition, the measures to deal
with COVID-19 (such as isolation, physical distance, home
isolation, and remote consultation with health professionals,
etc.) may result in the inability to obtain the expected level
of support and care before delivery, which may increase the
psychologicalpressureofpregnantwomen(6,7).Furthermore,
studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 has direct neuroinvasion
ability(8),whichmayattackthehumancentralnervoussystem
and have a potential impact on the survivors’ cognitive and
neuropsychological functions (9, 10). Mother and baby are
closely linked during pregnancy, it is widely believed that the
maternal psychological stress, as a teratogen, will continuously
transmit painful signals to the unborn child, which may cause
adverse effects on the fetus (11). Moreover, early mother-
infant separation due to mandatory or voluntary isolation
after childbirth may also have a negative impact on infant
feeding and thereby early development (12–14). At present,
there is little research evidence showing the long-term effects
ofSARS-CoV-2infectiononpregnantwomenandtheirbabies.
Research is needed to evaluate the burden of SARS-CoV-2
infection during pregnancy in children’s personality formation
andneurobehavioraldevelopment.
