41 **Abstract**

42 Background

43 An increasing proportion of women are being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome

44 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy. Intrauterine viral infections induce an increase

45 in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which inhibit the proliferation of neuronal precursor

46 cells and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. Whether

47 a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the

48 present study is to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS
49 CoV-2 infections during pregnancy.

50 Methods

51 In this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopment status of infants (N=298) born to women

52 with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10-12 months post discharge

53 using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were

54 classified into developmental delays (cutoff score: ≤2 standard deviations (SDs) below the

55 population mean) and no delay (score >2 SDs above the population mean).

56 Results

57 Approximately 10% of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy

58 showed developmental delays. Two of 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both

59 had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infection

60 during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those

61 whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P=0.039) and second trimesters

62 (P=0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester.

63 Infants born at <31 weeks gestation were more prone to developmental delays than those born at

64 >31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002).

65 Conclusion

66 The findings of the study highlight the need for long term neurodevelopmental assessment of

67 infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

71 **Background**

72 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus

73 disease-19 (COVID-19), has been spreading rapidly worldwide, increasingly affecting even

74 pregnant females. Pregnancy-associated physiological changes, as well as altered cell-mediated

75 immunity, enhance the susceptibility of pregnant women to infections by intracellular organisms

76 such as viruses. Based on a living systematic review and meta-analysis, overall, 10% (95%

77 confidence interval (CI): 7-12%; 73 studies involving 67271 women) of pregnant and recently

78 pregnant women attending or admitted to the hospital for any reason were diagnosed as having

79 suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [1]. Hence, a growing proportion of pregnant

80 women become infected with SARS-CoV-2 during various trimesters of pregnancy, with

81 variable effects on the fetus [1,2].

82

83 Furthermore, the underdeveloped innate and adaptive immune systems of fetuses and neonates

84 also make them more susceptible to infections [3, 4]. Maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV
85 2 has not been widely established to date, and findings vary. A meta-analysis revealed that

4


-----

86 vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible and showed that only 3.2% (27 of 936; 95%

87 CI: 2.2-4.3) of neonates from mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a positive result based on

88 viral RNA testing of nasopharyngeal swabs [5]. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA testing was positive in

89 neonatal cord blood (2.9% samples), placental swabs (7.7%), and fecal or rectal swabs, whereas

90 it was negative in urine and amniotic fluid samples. In contrast, a more recent systematic review

91 article (2021), which covered the database up to September 2020, reported that newborn rates of

92 the infection vary between 0% and 11.5% [6]. Nevertheless, due to the availability of only a few

93 patients and studies, the exact rates of vertical transmission and fetal or neonatal morbidity and

94 mortality cannot be ascertained.

95

96 Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory distress, it is also known to have

97 extrapulmonary manifestations, including hematological, cardiovascular, endocrinological, and

98 neurological complications, in the adult population [7-9]. Of these, neurological manifestations

99 in pregnant women and their probable effect on fetuses and neonates are of primary concern.

100 SARS-CoV-2 may gain entry into the central nervous system through the nasal mucosa, lamina

101 cribrosa, and olfactory bulb or through retrograde axonal transport. SARS-CoV-2 also exhibits

102 neurovirulence, triggering proinflammatory and prothrombotic cascades in the wake of cytokine

103 storms, affecting brain vasculature, as well as the blood-brain barrier, mainly in the setting of the

104 toxic-metabolic sequelae of multiorgan dysfunction frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2
105 positive patients **[10,11]. Proinflammatory cytokines inhibit the proliferation of neuronal**

106 precursor cells, activate astrogliosis, and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to

107 abnormal neurodevelopment **[3, 4]. Moreover, the elevated levels of maternal inflammatory**

108 cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) as a consequence of infection during pregnancy can

5


-----

109 disturb several characteristics of fetal brain development [12]. Notably, these pathological

110 changes, which include deteriorated neuronal functions and atypical behavioral changes, can

111 subsequently be seen in postnatal life and may increase the risk of schizophrenia, autism, and

112 mental disorders [12, 13].

113

114 Additionally, animal studies have shown that offspring from maternal immune activation animal

115 models have schizophrenia and autism-related behaviors, including decreased sensorimotor

116 gating, deficits in working memory and cognitive flexibility, increased anxiety, and enhanced

117 sensitivity to amphetamines [14-16].

118

119 Because of the plausible effects on neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections

120 during pregnancy, this study assessed the developmental attainment at 10-12 months of neonates

121 born to a cohort of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy in Kuwait using the

122 Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3).

123

124 **2 Methods**

125 **2.1Participants**

126 In this prospective cohort study, infants born between April 1 and August 30, 2020, to mothers

127 with SARS-CoV-2 infection during various trimesters of pregnancy were evaluated. Pregnant

128 women who tested positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for

129 SARS-CoV-2 (Cobas 6800 Systems, Roche, Switzerland)/(TaqPath, Thermo-Fisher Scientific,

130 USA) were identified from the Kuwait National COVID-19 registry. Mothers with equivocal

131 RT-PCR test results and those with missing data were not included in the study. Verbal informed

6


-----

132 consent was obtained from all the parents who participated in the study. Ethics approval was

133 granted by the Ministry of Health, (2021-1638), Government of Kuwait.

134 Demographic details were collected for all infants enrolled in the follow-up study. Maternal

135 clinical and neonatal data from acute hospital admissions were collected by retrospective chart

136 review of the included participants and have been previously published [17].

137 **2.2 Instrument**

138 The ASQ-3 (http://agesandstages.com/) is a widely used screening tool for assessing

139 development in children aged 1–66 months at a low cost, with cutoff scores identifying

140 developmental delays. The screening tool has strong validity, and its use has been widespread in

141 assessing development in children **[18]. The ASQ-3 has five domains: communication, gross**

142 motor skills, fine motor skills, problem-solving capacity, and personal-social development.

143 In the current study, we used the ASQ-3 to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes at 10-12

144 months postdischarge. Parents of infants completed the ASQ-3, which has a series of 21

145 developmental screening questions. Three study investigators (MAL, MK, and AE) scored the

146 questionnaire results using the ASQ-3 age-specific scoring sheet. In each domain, six items were

147 scored as present in the infant, sometimes present or not yet shown by the infant, with 10, 5, and

148 0 points, respectively. If an item was not filled in, a score of 0 was assigned based on the lowest

149 possible result. Responses were summed to give a score of 0 to 60 for each domain and an

150 overall maximum ASQ-3 score of 300 points. ASQ-3 results were categorized according to

151 questionnaire-defined subscale cutoff scores into 1) developmental delays, with an ASQ-3 cutoff

152 score of ≤2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean on 1 or more domains, and 2)

153 no delay, with a cutoff score >2 SDs above the population mean [18].

154 The questionnaire was sent in two languages: the Arabic version for Arabic-speaking parents and

155 the English version for non-Arabic-speaking parents. The questionnaire was completed by

156 parents and reviewed in a telephone interview with one investigator. Parents were encouraged to

157 provide their responses with their interpretation without prompting.

158

159 **2.3 Statistical analysis**

160 All data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database. Categorical variables were summarized as

161 counts (n) and percentages (%), and continuous variables were summarized as the median and

162 interquartile range (IQR). Statistical comparisons between the groups were performed using the

163 chi-squared test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous

164 variables.

165 We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis for each potential predictor of

166 developmental delays. Variables with a P value of <0.1 on the univariate analysis were included

167 in the model (maternal age and trimester at SARS-CoV-2 infection) and adjusted for gestational

168 age, birth weight, sex, parental education and type of feeding in the first 6 months of age. The

169 results of the regression analysis are presented as an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% CI.

170 Statistical significance was taken at P<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA 14

171 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

172

173 **3 Results**

174 Eight hundred forty pregnant women were identified from the national COVID-19 registry

175 between April 1 and August 30, 2020. Four hundred forty-five women gave birth during the

8


-----

176 study period (Figure 1). One infant died on the first day of life due to severe birth asphyxia; 298

177 (67%) had complete follow-up at 10-12 months corrected age, and 146 (32.8%) infants were lost

178 to follow-up. The main reason for the loss to follow-up was the inability to contact the parents

179 due to either invalid contact information or parents having left the country. To determine

180 whether the infants we lost to follow-up were representative of the complete study and to avoid

181 attrition bias, we compared the baseline features of those infants with follow-up data with the

182 baseline features of infants who were lost to follow-up. We did not find any statistically

183 significant differences between these two groups.

184 The maternal and neonatal characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1.

185 Among the infants with completed ASQ-3, 5 (1.7%) were born to mothers diagnosed with

186 SARS-CoV-2 during the first trimester, 20 (6.7%) during the second trimester, and 273 (91.6%)

187 during the third trimester. Only 2 (0.7%) neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

188 Twenty-eight infants needed hospitalization beyond the first 8-10 months of age.

189 Parental questionnaires were collected at a median of 10.3 months corrected age (IQR 10 to

190 12.7). Developmental delays were identified in 30 (10.1%) of the infants. Of those with

191 developmental delays, 3.3% (1/30) had delays in the communication domains, 27% (8/30) in the

192 gross motor domain, 40% (12/30) in the fine motor domain, 10% (3/30) in the problem-solving

193 domain, and 30% (9/30) in the personal-social domain (Figure 2).

194 In the infants with developmental delays, 4 had concerns in two or more domains, and none had

195 concerns in all domains.

196 Infants with developmental delays did not differ in terms of maternal age, maternal

197 comorbidities, parental education level, severe maternal COVID-19, or the mode of delivery

9


-----

198 compared to those with no delay (Table 2). However, the occurrence of developmental delays

199 differed significantly on the basis of the trimester at SARS-CoV-2 infection. Developmental

200 delays were more common in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during the first and

201 second trimesters than in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during the third trimester

202 (P<0.001). Among infants with developmental delays, 4 (13.3%) were born to mothers with

203 SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester, 6 (20%) were born to mothers with SARS
204 CoV-2 infection during the second trimester, and 20 (66.7%) were born to mothers with SARS
205 CoV-2 infection in the third trimester. One (0.4%) of the infants without delay was born to a

206 mother with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester, 14 (5.2%) were born to mothers with

207 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the second trimester, and 253 (94.4%) were born to mothers with

208 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the third trimester. Moreover, infants born at less than 31 weeks

209 gestation were more likely to have developmental delays than infants born at more than 31

210 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002). Neonatal characteristics were similar between the

211 groups.

212 In multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for maternal age, parental educational level,

213 gestational age, birth weight, and the type of feeding in the first six months of age, the risk of

214 developmental delays was higher with first-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 8.2,

215 95% CI: 1.1-55.9; P=0.039) and second-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 8.1,

216 95% CI: 2.4-27.7; P=0.001) than with third-trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3).

217 **4 Discussions**

218

219 The fetal inflammatory response (FIRS) due to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection can contribute

220 to severe neonatal morbidity, which includes stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, low birth

10


-----

221 weight, fetal distress, and neonatal asphyxia [19-21]. This is perhaps the first study reporting

222 neurological assessments of neonates born to mothers from West Asia with SARS-CoV-2
223 positive RT-PCR test results during pregnancy using the ASQ-3. The findings of this study

224 indicate that infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during

225 pregnancy need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental delays.

226

227 To assess the developmental attainment of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2-positive

228 test results during pregnancy, this study employed the ASQ-3, a screening tool used for assessing

229 the developmental attainment of infants and young children **[18]. This screening tool is used**

230 widely in assessing development in children aged 1–66 months at a low cost, with cutoff scores

231 identifying developmental delays. In the current study, an Arabic version of the ASQ-3 was used

232 for mothers who were well versed in Arabic. Since the study cohort included diverse as well as

233 immigrant mothers, questionnaires were sent to mothers, and fortunately, the majority of them

234 consented to respond.

235

236 The study data revealed that the majority (91.6%) of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2

237 infection during their third trimester, whereas 6.7% had SARS-CoV-2 infection in their second

238 trimester. This finding is in agreement with those of other studies that have also reported that

239 most SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnant women occur in their third trimester [22, 23]. In the

240 current study, only a relatively small number of women were infected during the first trimester.

241 However, first-trimester infections are important as the principal stages of brain development,

242 such as primary neurulation (weeks 3–4), prosencephalic development (months 2–3), and

243 neuronal proliferation (months 3–4), occur during the early stages of pregnancy [24]. In fact,

11


-----

244 infections with some common pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Zika virus, Rubella

245 virus, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and_ _Toxoplasma gondii, during the first and early_

246 second trimesters increase the risk of symptomatic infants, with up to 32% being associated with

247 neurological manifestations [25]. Owing to the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19,

248 information related to pregnancy outcomes among women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the

249 consequences of infant exposure to the virus is very scarce. As more women become infected

250 during their first and second trimesters progress in their pregnancy and as newborns with SARS
251 CoV-2 infection develop, a better understanding of the neurological effects of this novel virus

252 will emerge. In brief, various types of evidence support the theory that maternal infection and/or

253 inflammation occurring during critical periods of fetal development could alter brain structure

254 and function in a time-sensitive manner.

255 Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the chances of fetal distress, leading to high

256 incidences of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [23]. Similar to other reported

257 studies, in the current study, 76 out of 298 (25.5%) neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2
258 infection during pregnancy required NICU admission [26-29]. On the other hand, a systematic

259 review reported that approximately 95% of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2

260 infection during pregnancy were born in good condition [1].

261

262 Recent evidence suggests that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 either antenatally or

263 intrapartum can occur, but it is uncommon. In this study, only 2 (0.7%) neonates tested positive

264 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and notwithstanding some seemingly perinatal complications, the

265 majority of neonates (296 out 298) born were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our

266 observation is in agreement with those of other studies [30-32], which implies that the

12


-----

267 consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neurodevelopment were largely due to in utero

268 effects rather than direct effects on the fetus. The reason for the low vertical transmission rate is

269 that the placenta has low expression of the canonical receptors necessary for viral entry, which

270 may explain the rarity of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [32]. Importantly, teratogenic

271 effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the fetus were not observed, which is in contrast to other viral

272 infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, CMV, herpes virus, Zika

273 virus, and Rubella virus infections [33-37].

274

275 In this study, we evaluated the infant’s neurobehavioral development 10-12 months post

276 discharge, perhaps the adequate duration for effects to appear. In this study, overall, 69.1% of

277 neonates at the end of 10-12 months showed normal developmental attainment, and only 10.1%

278 (n=30) showed developmental delays. The PregCOV-19 living systematic review [1] found that

279 approximately 95% of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were reported to be born

280 in good condition. However, it is not clear whether this systematic review included evaluations

281 of neurodevelopmental delays in neonates. A study from the UK, in which information about

282 educational and behavioral problems was collected from 177 children, found that 25% required

283 support from a nonteaching assistant, 4% required a statement of special educational needs, and

284 3% were in a special school [38]. Many investigators have studied the effects of various viral

285 infections, albeit not SARS-CoV-2, on pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes and have reported

286 that maternal influenza, hepatitis C, varicella-zoster, and other viruses produce distinct fetal

287 brain structure and anatomy clinical pathology of varying severity [39-42].

288

13

289 Of note, the role of cytokine storms, particularly the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of

290 neurodevelopmental disorders, is not fully elucidated; however, in a longitudinal study,

291 alterations in brain architecture, executive function, and working memory abilities were reported

292 in 2-year-old neonates exposed to increased IL-6 levels during pregnancy [43]. An analysis of

293 214 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that 36% had neurological symptoms **[44].**

294 Many case-control studies have demonstrated that elevated maternal cytokine levels affect the

295 fetal brain, causing neurological disease **[45-47]. The FIRS, due to increased IL-6 following**

296 maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection [13], may induce a wide range of adverse neurodevelopmental

297 sequelae, such as autism, psychosis, and neurosensory deficits, later in life [48], similar to certain

298 bacterial infections [49]. However, long-term longitudinal studies are required to validate these

299 associations.

300

301 Moreover, the risk of neurological effects on neonates differs by the trimester when SARS-CoV
302 2 infection occurred [50]. In this study, developmental delays were relatively more prevalent

303 when infection occurred in the first and second trimesters than when infection occurred in the

304 third trimester (P<0.001). Neonatal characteristics were similar between the groups. Moreover,

305 infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation were more likely to have developmental delays than

306 those born at more than 31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002).

307 The findings of the study may be considered reliable, as the cohort of parents who participated in

308 the study was well educated, and women were young (median age: 31 years). Three-fourths of

309 women were devoid of pregnancy-induced hypertension or gestational diabetes.

310 **5 Strength and Limitations**

14


-----

311 This is perhaps the first study reporting neurological assessments of neonates born to mothers

312 with SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR test results during pregnancy using the ASQ-3. The

313 participating mothers were from the local area, which enabled good tracking for follow-ups.

314 Participants were educated and responded to ASQ-3 questions appropriately. Thus, these points

315 may be regarded as strength of the study.

316

317 This study also has a few limitations, the most important aspects of which are related to the

318 sample size and methodology. For stronger conclusions, a larger and statistically valid sample

319 size is required. Furthermore, the ASQ-3 were completed by the parents of the neonates; hence,

320 biases in reporting cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, this initial study may help healthcare

321 authorities understand the need to assess the developmental attainment of infants born to mothers

322 with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results during pregnancy. The ASQ-3, although a good

323 screening tool, has limitations, and its results may not be strongly comparable to those of other

324 tools, such as the Bayley III test; therefore, further larger studies with formal assessments of

325 neurodevelopment are warranted.

326

327 **6 Conclusions**

328 This study was a hypothesis-generating study, and the findings based on a screening tool raise

329 some concerns regarding neurodevelopmental effects on fetuses born to mothers with SARS
330 CoV-2-positive test results during pregnancy. A majority of the pregnant women had SARS
331 CoV-2 infections during their third trimester. Developmental delays were more prevalent when

332 SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the first and second trimesters than when it occurred in the

333 third trimester. Infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation were more likely to have

15


-----

334 developmental delays than those born at more than 31 weeks gestation. Further larger studies

335 with formal developmental assessments are warranted to study the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the

336 developing brain.
