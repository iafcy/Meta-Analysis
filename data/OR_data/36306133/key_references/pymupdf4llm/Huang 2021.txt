### Aim: To investigate the association between the experience of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and neurodevelopment of 6-month-old and 1-year-old children and explore the differences in the association by birth order.

 Methods: This comparison study was embedded in the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study in China. The exposed group included 546 6-month-old and 285 1-year-old children who attended neurodevelopment assessments between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and the non-exposed group included 3,009 6-month-old and 2,214 1-year-old children during the same months from 2015 to 2019. Neurodevelopment at age 6 months and 1 year was assessed by trained clinical staff using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, third edition (ASQ-3) and the Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS).

 Results: The experience of the pandemic in 2020 was associated with a higher risk of delay in the fine motor (adjusted OR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.25, 4.99; estimated by logistic regression) and communication (adjusted RR [aRR]: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.25; estimated by log-binomial regression) domains at age 1 year. The association between the experience of the pandemic and communication delay at age 1 year only existed in first-born children (aRR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.30) but not in later-born children (aRR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.25). No associations were observed in any domain among 6-month-olds.

 Conclusion: Experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health strategies might be associated with a higher risk of delay in the development of fine motor and communication in 1-year-old children; the association observed in the communication domain only existed in first-born children.

## INTRODUCTION

The pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the
pathogen called SARS-CoV-2, formerly 2019-nCoV) emerged in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1, 2). As of May 25, 2020, there
had been 5,304,772 confirmed cases and 342,029 deaths globally,
including 84,536 confirmed cases and 4,645 deaths in China (3).
A series of non-pharmaceutical intervention-based public health
strategies have been applied in China to control the spread of
COVID-19, including isolating confirmed cases, contact tracing,
quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and
workplace closures, cancellation of mass gatherings, etc. (4).
While such strategies have effectively controlled COVID-19
transmission across China and substantially reduced the number
of cases (4), it has been suggested that these strategies may
be associated with poorer mental health and development of
school-aged children and adolescents (5–7). However, whether
this association exists among children at a younger age (e.g.,
infants) has not been investigated.
A range of biological and psychosocial factors, such
as maternal physical and mental health, physical activity,
socioeconomic status, and family context, are associated with
child neurodevelopment (8, 9). During the COVID-19 pandemic,
the implementation of containment strategies reduces children’s
outdoor activities and their opportunities to contact people other
than their family members. Staying indoor may also increase
the screen time of the children and their family members
(10). Moreover, the pandemic has led to increased anxiety and
depression in the population (11), and mental health issues
of parents and caregivers may have negative impacts on child
development (12).
It is also suggested that neurodevelopment between
first-born and later-born children may be different (13).
First-born and later-born children may react differently
during the COVID-19 pandemic. As two-child families
have become increasingly common in China due to the
relaxation of the one-child policy, it is worth studying
the association between the experience of the COVID-19
pandemic and the neurodevelopment in first-born and
second-born children.
As a megacity with a population of over 15,000,000
(14), Guangzhou has also been influenced by the COVID-19
pandemic. Following the lockdown of Wuhan and other cities
in Hubei province from January 23, residents in Guangzhou
had been encouraged to reduce outdoor activities and maintain
social distancing. As mentioned above, the experience of public
health strategies in response to COVID-19 might potentially
influence child neurodevelopment in several ways. Investigating
the association of this experience with infant neurodevelopment
can help comprehensively evaluate the influence of COVID19 and the associated strategies on the population and inform
public health policies for both infectious disease control and
child health in the future. The aim of the present study was
to investigate the association between the experience of the
COVID-19 pandemic and neurodevelopment of children aged 6
months and 1 year and explore the differences in the association
by birth order.


## METHODS

 Study Population
This comparison analysis was part of the Born in Guangzhou
Cohort Study (BIGCS), an ongoing prospective birth cohort
conducted in the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical
Center (GWCMC), China. Details of the BIGCS have been
described elsewhere (15). In brief, women were recruited during
their first routine antenatal examinations in early pregnancy
(<20 weeks of gestation, normally at around 16 weeks) at two
campuses of the GWCMC, and followed up in mid- (at 24–28
weeks) and late pregnancy (at 35–38 weeks). After delivery, the
women and their children were followed up at 6 weeks, 6, 12,
24, and 36 months postpartum. The protocol of the BIGCS was
approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the GWCMC.
All participants provided written informed consent at the time
of recruitment.
The routine follow-up of the BIGCS had been suspended since
the outbreak of COVID-19 in late January and was resumed on
March 1, 2020. The present study included the children who
attended the neurodevelopmental assessment at the 6-month or
1-year follow-up during March 1–May 15, 2020, as the exposed
group, and those during the same months from 2015 to 2019 as
the non-exposed group. Children were excluded if they withdrew
before the present study, had multiple births, were preterm
births (defined as gestational weeks at birth <37), had birth
hypoxia (defined as Apgar score ≤7 at either 1 or 5 min), or
had birth defects that might affect neurodevelopmental outcomes
(including major birth defects and anomalies that affect language
and motor functions). The flowchart for the selection process of
the present study is shown in Figure 1.

## Assessment of Neurodevelopment
Children’s neurodevelopment at the 6-month and 1-year
follow-up was assessed by clinical staff using the Ages and
Stages Questionnaires, third edition (ASQ-3) and the Gesell
Developmental Schedules (GDS), respectively. Before the field
work, all clinical evaluators had attended training courses
accredited by the official providers of these assessment tools.
All assessments were conducted strictly following the instruction
manuals. Regular training and quality control sessions were
held by the BIGCS team to perform live examinations for each
evaluator, monitor any potential assessment errors, and review
all the assessment results to ensure internal consistency and
data quality.

## GDS
The GDS was used to evaluate the developmental quotient (DQ)
in children’s adaptive (i.e., cognitive), gross motor, fine motor,
language (i.e., communication), and personal-social domains at
the 1-year follow-up (16). The Chinese version of the GDS has
been validated and adopted by the Chinese Pediatric Association
(17, 18). The sum of adaptive, language and personal-social DQ
was significantly correlated to the mental development index
of Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID, r = 0.75, P <
0.0001), and the sum of gross motor and fine motor DQ was
significantly correlated to the psychomotor development index


-----

-----

of BSID (r = 0.55, P < 0.05) (19, 20). Higher DQ reflects
better neurodevelopmental performance. As with other child
development studies using the Chinese version of GDS, we
defined developmental delay in each domain as DQ < 86 (21–
23). To use a composite indicator to reflect the severity of
adverse developmental outcomes across all five domains in the
present study, we defined “poor neurodevelopmental outcome”
as developmental delay in more than two domains on the GDS.

## ASQ-3
The ASQ-3 is a comprehensive standardized developmental
monitoring tool for children from 1 to 66 months of age.
At the 6-month follow-up, the ASQ-3 was administered by
trained psychological evaluators at the GWCMC’s child health
care clinics. Similar to the GDS, it also assesses the following
five developmental domains: communication, gross motor, fine
motor, problem-solving (i.e., cognitive), and personal-social, with
the cutoffs for developmental delay varying across different
domains and ages (24, 25). The ASQ-3 has generally high internal
consistency, test-rest reliability, and acceptable sensitivity in the
Chinese population (26). To be consistent with the results from
the GDS, “poor neurodevelopmental outcome” on the ASQ-3 was
also defined as developmental delay in more than two domains.

## Other Variables
Information on a range of maternal and child characteristics
was collected from questionnaires or medical records from
early pregnancy to age 1 year of the children. Maternal
characteristics included age at conception (in years), monthly
income (<1,500, 1,500–4,500, 4,501–9,000, or ≥9,001 yuan,
based on the individual income tax brackets implemented
since January 1, 2012), education level (high school or below,
college, undergraduate, or postgraduate), tobacco exposure in
early pregnancy (yes/no), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI,
calculated as pre-pregnancy weight in kilogram divided by
squared height in meter), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM,
yes/no), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP, yes/no),
depressive symptoms in early pregnancy (Self-rating Depression
Scale score ≥53) (27, 28), anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy
(Self-rating Anxiety Scale score ≥50) (29, 30), and depressive
symptoms at 6 months or 1 year postpartum (Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale score ≥13) (31). Child characteristics
at birth included gestational age at birth (in weeks), child
sex (male/female), birth order (1 or >1), birth weight zscore (calculated based on the INTERGROWTH-21st standards)
(32), delivery mode (vaginal birth or cesarean section). Child
characteristics at age 6 months or 1 year included child age (in
months), duration of breastfeeding (in days), number of other
children living together (0 or >0), and anthropometric indicators
including BMI (calculated as children’s weight in kilogram
divided by squared height in meter) and head circumference,
both calculated as z-scores based on the standards from the
World Health Organization (33).

## Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics, i.e., mean (standard deviation) and
frequencies (percentages), were reported for all maternal and


child characteristics. For both ages, the prevalence of delay
in each domain and “poor neurodevelopmental outcome” was
presented by year. χ [2]-test was used to compare the prevalence
of developmental delay in different years.
The associations between the experience of the COVID-19
pandemic (i.e., the year 2020 vs. 2015–2019) and the risk of
neurodevelopmental delay at age 6 months and 1 year were
examined using log-binomial regression (for the outcomes with
a prevalence ≥15%, e.g., developmental delay in the gross
motor and the communication domains at age 1 year, shown
as relative risk [RR]) and logistic regression (for all other
outcomes, shown as odds ratio [OR]), respectively. The models
were adjusted for maternal age, education level, monthly income,
delivery mode, child sex, birth order, birth weight z-score,
breastfeeding duration, BMI z-score, head circumference z-score,
and maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. Selection of the
covariates is based on the following considerations: firstly, we
took into account maternal demographic and socioeconomic
factors (represented by maternal age, education level, and
monthly income), which have been shown to be associated with
child development; (34, 35) secondly, children’s developmental
outcomes might also differ by some factors at delivery, such
as delivery mode, child sex, and birth order; (13, 36, 37)
thirdly, birth weight z-score, breastfeeding duration, BMI zscore, and head circumference z-score generally reflect the
child’s intrauterine and postnatal growth and nutritional status,
which are important factors related to neurodevelopment; (38)
lastly, maternal postpartum mental illness (e.g., postpartum
depression) was also considered, as evidence has suggested that it
might have negative impacts on infants’ developmental outcomes
(39). Moreover, stratification analyses by birth order were also
performed to explore the association between the experience of
the COVID-19 pandemic and neurodevelopmental outcomes in
first-born and later-born children.
Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).

## RESULTS

The flowchart for selecting the study population is shown in
**Supplementary Figure 1. Between March 1 and May 15 from**
2015 to 2020, a total of 3,937 children in the BIGCS attended
neurodevelopment assessments at around 6 months of age. After
excluding those who withdrew before the present study (N = 10),
were multiple births (N = 147), were preterm births (N = 182),
had hypoxia at birth (N = 18), had neurodevelopment-related
birth defects (N = 25), there were 3,555 children included in the
analysis for the 6-month follow-up. During the same period, a
total of 2,777 children in the BIGCS attended neurodevelopment
assessments at around 1 year of age. We excluded those who
withdrew before the present study (N = 5), were multiple births
(N = 105), were preterm births (N = 121), had hypoxia at birth
(N = 15), had neurodevelopment-related birth defects (N =
32), resulting in 2,499 children included in the analysis for the
1-year follow-up. Among those who remained in the analysis,

546 6-month-old and 285 1-year-old children who attended the
neurodevelopment assessment between March 1 and May 15,
2020, were included as the exposed group, while 3,009 6-monthold and 2,214 1-year-old children during the same months from
2015 to 2019 were included as the non-exposed group.
Maternal and child characteristics are shown in Table 1,
with data presented separately between the follow-ups
at 6 months and 1 year, and between 2015–2019 and
2020. Maternal age at conception was around 30 years.
As for child characteristics, gestational age at birth was
around 39 weeks, and the proportion of boys was 52–
54%. In 2020, the proportion of children born via cesarean
section was lower than that in 201–2019. At the time of
neurodevelopment assessment, the mean age of children
included in the 6-month and 1-year follow-up was 6.24 and
12.31 months, respectively.
**Figure 1 shows the age- and domain-specific trend of**
neurodevelopmental delay from 2015 to 2020 (see detailed data in
**Supplementary Table 1), whereas Figure 2 shows the proportion**
of child sex, birth order, and neurodevelopmental delay in
each domain by age in 2015–2019 and 2020, respectively. In
6-month-old children, the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
delay assessed by the ASQ-3 fluctuated over the 6 years
across all domains; and there were no differences in these


proportions between 2015–2019 and 2020. At 1 year of age,
while fluctuations in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
delay assessed by the GDS were also observed, the children
in 2020 had a higher proportion of delay in the fine motor
and the communication domains (both P < 0.05) than
those in the previous years. Differences in the prevalence of
neurodevelopmental delay were also observed between first-born
and later-born children (Figure 1).
The association between the experience of COVID-19 and
the risk of neurodevelopmental delay are shown in Table 2.
No associations were observed in any domain at 6 months
of age. Experiencing COVID-19 was associated with a higher
risk of delay in the fine motor (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.50,
95% CI: 1.25, 4.99) and communication (adjusted RR [aRR]:
1.13, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.25) domains at 1 year of age. Table 3
shows the associations between the experience of COVID-19
and the risk of neurodevelopmental delay, stratified by birth
order. At age 1 year, experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020 was associated with a higher risk of communication
delay (aRR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.30) in first-born children,
while this association was not observed in those who were laterborn (aRR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.25). Notably, no associations
with “poor neurodevelopmental outcome” were found in all
analyses above.

## DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the risk
of neurodevelopmental delay in infants during the COVID19 pandemic. In this comparison study with information
on infant neurodevelopment from 2015 to 2020, we found
that experiencing COVID-19 in 2020 was associated with a
higher risk of neurodevelopmental delay in the fine motor and
the communication domains in 1-year-old children, while no
associations are observed for those at 6 months of age. The
delay in the communication domain at age 1 year is mainly
attributable to first-born children. Experiencing the pandemic
was not associated with “poor neurodevelopmental outcome” at
either age.
Although there are currently no other studies specifically
investigating the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic
and related prevention and control strategies on infant
neurodevelopment, previous studies have shown that the
COVID-19 pandemic and associated strategies (e.g., social
isolation) may have a negative impact on the development and


mental health of preschool-age and school-age children and
adolescents. For example, a systematic review shows that children
and adolescents are more likely to experience depression and
anxiety during and after enforced social isolation (6). Similarly,
other studies also reveal the reduction of life satisfaction and the
exacerbation of psychiatric disorders in adolescents during the
pandemic (5, 7). Our study adds new evidence to the literature
regarding the association between the experience of the COVID19 pandemic and neurodevelopment of infants. For the first time,
our findings suggest that experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic
may be associated with compromised neurodevelopment at 1
year of age, a critical window for the development of specific
domain functions (40).
We observed that 1-year-old children experiencing
the pandemic were at an increased risk of delay in the
communication (language) and the fine motor domains than
those not. Evidence shows that the protective factors of 1-yearold children who are in “at-risk” environments for language
development include parental self-efficacy, relationship wellbeing, high social support, community participation, and daily


-----

parent-child interaction (41). The COVID-19 pandemic might
have negatively affected the mental health of the children’s
parents and reduced the contact with other family members,
friends, and community members due to the containment
strategies, thus potentially exerting a negative impact on
children’s language development. Fine motor skills are hand
and finger skills such as picking up pellets with their thumb
and forefinger. When staying indoors during the pandemic,
some parents and caregivers (e.g., grandparents) might entertain
their children with digital devices, thus increasing their screen
time. Evidence (although from children of preschool age) has
suggested that those who extensively use touch screen tablets
might have poorer fine motor development than those who do
not (42).
Our study also found that the association between the
experience of COVID-19 and the risk of neurodevelopmental
delay in specific domains among 1-year-olds only existed in firstborn children, which seems inconsistent with previous evidence.
It has been shown that first-born children tend to be more
intelligent and receive more language interactions from their
parents than later-born children (43, 44). There might be two
reasons for this. First, during the pandemic, the children stayed
at home all day with their elder brothers or sisters, and the
extensive interactions with their elder siblings might alleviate
the potentially negative impact of social distancing and home
confinement measures. Second, as the pandemic has universally
caused anxiety and depression in the general population (45),
new parents may be less experienced in coping with these
emotions, and the infants born to them might be more vulnerable
to developmental issues. However, these findings still need to be
replicated and confirmed by other studies in the future.
The different findings between 6-month-olds and 1-year-olds
in our study are also noteworthy, which might be attributed to
the differences in the sensitive periods for neurodevelopment and
the assessment tools used in the two groups. For the children
included in the present study, most of them experienced the
COVID-19 pandemic at age 4–6 or 10–12 months. Evidence
has shown that children reared institutionally at 4–6 months
of age did not have a significantly increased risk of adverse
developmental outcomes across most domains compared with
their non-institutionalized counterparts, (46) suggesting that this
period might be less sensitive to negative impacts, which is in
line with our findings for 6-month-olds. On the other hand,
infants start to discriminate native and non-native phonemes at
age 6–12 months (47), rendering this period a likely sensitive
time window for language/communication development, which
is also supported by our findings for 1-year-olds. Although there
is a lack of evidence on the sensitive periods for fine motor
development, especially within infancy, a study of preschoolaged children has found some sensitive periods for fine motor
development during 2.8–6.5 years of age (48). Our findings also
suggest the possible existence of sensitive periods for fine motor
development within infancy, which is worth further exploration.
In addition, the different assessment scales used in these two
groups could be an alternate explanation. Unlike the GDS,
which is a diagnostic tool and often used as a reference in
validation studies, the ASQ is a concise screening tool suitable


for use in large-scale epidemiologic studies. As the GDS contains
more items and has a more detailed assessment and scoring
process than the ASQ, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the ASQ might have failed to identify any subtle differences in
the development of 6-month-olds. Therefore, the results of these
two groups might not be directly comparable with each other and
should be interpreted independently.
The present study has several strengths. Firstly, this is the
first study to examine the relationship between the experience
of the COVID-19 pandemic and infant neurodevelopment.
Secondly, information on the variables used in this study was
prospectively collected, and the analyses were adjusted for a range
of potential confounders. Thirdly, children’s neurodevelopment
at 6 months and 1 year old was examined by trained
clinical staff.
Our study also has some limitations. Firstly, we could
not obtain the information on the degree to which the
children’s families complied with the social distancing and home
confinement strategies. It is likely that not all families kept
social distancing and stayed at home during the pandemic,
and those who less cared about the strategies seemed more
likely to attend the 6-month or 1-year follow-ups in the
hospital. Secondly, although we stratified the children by birth
order, the number of family members living together with
the children is unknown, which might also influence child
neurodevelopment. Thirdly, due to the different assessment
tools used in the 6-months and 1-year children, the results
might not be directly comparable between these two age groups.
Fourthly, we could not rule out the possible bias caused by
the fluctuation of outcome prevalence over time. To alleviate
this issue, we combined the data from 2015 to 2019 in the
analysis to obtain a relatively stable outcome prevalence for
the reference group. In addition, this study only included
neurodevelopment within infancy, and longer follow-ups are
thus needed to explore the potential influence of this experience
on long-term developmental outcomes of children. Moreover,
this study was based on the Chinese population, which limits
the generalizability of our findings. Replication by future studies
from other regions and populations is needed. Lastly, residue
confounding might exist due to the observational nature of the
present study.
Several implications can be drawn from this study. First,
our findings suggest that the experience of the COVID-19
pandemic might potentially have a negative impact on child
neurodevelopment in specific domains at specific ages, which
raise concerns about the development of young children under
the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents need to pay more attention to
their children’s development and adjust their rearing patterns at
this special time (44). Second, given the absence of an association
with “poor neurodevelopmental outcome,” this potential negative
impact seemed to affect only a limited number of domains and
have minor influences on the overall developmental outcome of
the children. Third, for families with two or more children, the
key to minimize the impact of the pandemic on the children’s
development might be to increase the interaction of children
with their siblings and other family members. Fourth, for child
healthcare practitioners, it is necessary to consider using the


-----

internet, such as social media and other communication software,
to practice health education and provide online assessment
and intervention instructions for parents during the pandemic
(49, 50). Moreover, studies are needed to further explore
the impact of COVID-19 on child health and its underlying
mechanisms. Evidence has suggested that pregnant women
tend to report adverse lifestyle changes during the COVID19 pandemic (e.g., having poorer diet quality and less sleep,
and being less physically active); (51) some of these changes
might, in turn, influence offspring’s physical and mental health,
such as neurodevelopment (52, 53). Thus, future research is
warranted to investigate the potential influence of COVID-19 on
offspring health mediated by the changes in women’s behaviors
and lifestyles during pregnancy.
In conclusion, this study found an association between
the experience of COVID-19 and a higher risk of
neurodevelopmental delay in the fine motor and the
communication domains in 1-year-old children; the association
observed in the communication domain only existed in firstborn children. No associations were found in 6-month-old
children. These findings underline the need to concern about
the neurodevelopment of infants who are experiencing the
COVID-19 pandemic and call for more training in specific
domains at home, which requires the joint efforts of both parents
and child healthcare practitioners.
