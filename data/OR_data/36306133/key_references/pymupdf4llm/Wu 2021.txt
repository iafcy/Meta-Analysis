### Background: There is little direct or indirect evidence of the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy on early childhood development.

 Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study in China from May 1 to October 31, 2020, that enrolled 135 mother-infant dyads: 57 dyads in the infection cohort and 78 in the non-infection cohort. Among all infants, 14.0% were preterm birth in the infection cohort and 6.4% in the non-infection cohort. Participants were followed by telephone interviews to collect demographic characteristics, medical records of coronavirus disease 2019, breastfeeding data, and early childhood development was assessed by the Age and Stage Questionnaire (ASQ-3) and Age and Stage Questionnaire Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE-2) Chinese versions at 3 months after childbirth. We used multivariable Poisson regression models to estimate the relative risk (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable linear regression models and a mediation model were used to test the direct and indirect associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ASQ-3 score. This study was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Medical Science Research Ethics Committee (No. IRB00006761-M2020127).

 Results: In the infection cohort, 13.6% of the children showed social–emotional developmental delay, and 13.5% showed overall developmental delay. The corresponding rates in the non-infection cohort were 23.4 and 8.1%. Compared with the non-infection cohort, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy did not increase the risk of social-emotional (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.51–1.49) or overall (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.60–1.73) developmental delay. The mediation model showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection indirectly affected the ASQ-3 score by increasing the length of mother–infant separation.


-----

### Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 during late pregnancy did not increase the risk of developmental delay of the offspring 3 months after delivery. However, SARS-CoV- 2 may have indirect effects on early childhood development by increasing mother- infant separation.

## INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most
serious global public health crisis of the 21st century. As of July
29, 2021, more than 190 million people worldwide have been
infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Coronavirus infection affects pregnant
women more than the general population, and infected pregnant
women are more likely to need intensive care treatment than
non-pregnant women (2, 3). The most common reported adverse
perinatal outcomes related to COVID-19 are preterm birth and
cesarean delivery (3–5).
Another concern with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy
is that of the potential effects on early childhood development
(6), which might occur via two possible pathways. The first is the
pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although,
there is insufficient evidence of vertical SARS-CoV-2 infection
transmission (7), mothers infected during pregnancy have higher
interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels than non-pregnant women (8). IL-6 is
an indicator of maternal systemic inflammation that is potentially
related to infant brain development (9) and inversely associated
with offspring cognition at 12 months of age (10). The second
pathway is mother–infant separation caused by hospitalization.
In the early phase of the pandemic, due to insufficient
understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19,
and to treat infected pregnant women promptly and protect
their newborns, mothers were separated from their infants for
long periods (11). Mother–infant separation in early childhood
has adverse effects on child development (12). Unfortunately,
there is no evidence of whether SARS-CoV-2 infection during
pregnancy increases the risk of neurodevelopmental delay in
early childhood.
Our team has reported the clinical characteristics of pregnant
women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (in the third trimester, mainly
in the late trimester) and assessed the early development of their
children (4, 13) using the National Epidemic Reporting System
(NERS) of the National Health Commission of China. In this
study, we used the previous data as an infection cohort, and
established a non-infection cohort in Wuhan, China, recruiting
pregnant women and their infants who had never been infected

with SARS-CoV-2, to compare the early childhood development
of the two cohorts and explore the potential secondary effects of
COVID-19 pandemic on early childhood development.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Study Design and Participants
This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted from
May 1 to October 31, 2020. It established an infection cohort
who were followed from May 1 to July 1, 2020, and a noninfected cohort who were followed from July 7 to October 31,
2020. The infection cohort were retrieved from the NERS until
April 30, 2020. The inclusion criteria of the infection cohort
were (1) a confirmed case of COVID-19 defined as a suspected
case (a person who had both the epidemiological history and
clinical manifestations) with a positive result on high-throughput
sequencing or real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens
(14), (2) a pregnant woman diagnosed with COVID-19, (3) the
onset of COVID-19 was at any week of pregnancy, and (4)
informed consent was obtained. Of the 138 cases retrieved from
the NERS, 81 met the inclusion criteria, including 65 deliveries
and 16 abortions. We included only the 65 deliveries of whom 57
(87.7%) of the women completed all follow-up procedures (13)
(Figure 1).
The non-infection cohort were recruited through an online
assistance and consultation platform for pregnant women in
Wuhan initiated by doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The inclusion criteria of the non-infection cohort were (1) a
pregnant woman not diagnosed with COVID-19, (2) not a close
contact or suspected case, or not quarantined, (3) a live birth
without neonatal death, and (4) informed consent was obtained.
Ninety-five cases met the inclusion criteria and 78 (82.1%)
completed all of the follow-up procedures (Figure 1). In the
recruitment of participants, we did not limit the gestational age
at delivery in both infection cohort and non-infection cohort.
This study was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital
Medical Science Research Ethics Committee (No. IRB00006761M2020127).

## Follow-Up Procedures
For all participants in both cohorts, we conducted a followup at four time points. (1) The first was to obtain informed
consent when the participant was recruited, and we collected
the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 from
medical records. (2) One week (7[+][0][∼][2] days) after delivery,
we collected data on hospitalized delivery, screening results of


-----

SARS-CoV-2 for maternal and neonatal specimens (RT-PCR
assay of neonatal throat swab, cord blood, amniotic fluid, breast
milk, meconium, or placenta, and IgG and IgM in neonatal
serum), postpartum care from medical records; the duration
of quarantine, mother–infant separation, and neonatal feeding
were collected by telephone interviews. (3) At 1 month (28[+][0][∼][6]

days), the durations of quarantine and mother–infant separation,
and neonatal feeding were obtained by telephone interviews. (4)
At 3 months (90[+][0][∼][20] days), the durations of quarantine and
mother–infant separation, and neonatal feeding were obtained
by telephone interviews, and early childhood development was
assessed by sending an online questionnaire to the mobile
phones of the mothers. The breastfeeding data collected in our
study referred to both exclusively and partial breastfeeding; we
did not distinguish them. Mother–infant separation included
two scenarios, the first followed national policy (11) requiring
neonates delivered by infected pregnant women to be observed in
an isolated observation ward for at least 14 days. The second was
that after the termination of medical quarantine, some mothers
chose to continue home quarantine, which extended the mother–
infant separation time.


## Early Childhood Development Assessment
Early childhood development was assessed using the Chinese
versions of the Age and Stage Questionnaire (ASQ-3) and
Age and Stage Questionnaire Social–Emotional (ASQ:SE-2). All
infants were assessed at 3 months after childbirth. ASQ-3 consists
of five domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor,
problem solving, and personal–social. ASQ:SE-2 was used to
assess social–emotional development. In this study, the mothers
of the infants completed both ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2. A child
whose ASQ-3 score was lower than the Chinese norm indicated
developmental delay in that domain, and developmental delay in
any ASQ-3 domain indicated overall developmental delay (15).
A total ASQ:SE-2 score higher than the Chinese norm indicated
social–emotional developmental delay (16).

## Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were described as the median and
interquartile range (IQR); the two cohorts were compared
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Categorical variables were
described as the frequency and percent, and the two cohorts
were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact

test. We estimated the adjusted relative risk (RR) of SARSCoV-2 infection on developmental delay using multivariable
Poisson regression models. The associations between SARS-CoV2 infection and the ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 scores were tested
using multivariable linear regression models. We adjusted for the
length of mother–infant separation, low birthweight (yes vs. no),
infant gender (boy vs. girl), preterm (yes vs. no), admitted to
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; yes vs. no), and breastfeeding
at 3 months after delivery (yes vs. no) in the multivariable Poisson
and linear regression models.
Based on the preliminary analysis, we hypothesized that the
effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on early childhood development
may be mediated by mother–infant separation. Therefore, we
fitted a mediation model to test the indirect effect. This mediation


model included five paths: Path a represented the effect of SARSCoV-2 infection on the length of mother–infant separation; Path
b represented the effect of length of mother–infant separation on
gross motor development; Path a×b (indirect effect) represented
the mediating effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on gross motor
development mediated by length of mother–infant separation;
Path c[′] (direct effect) represented the remaining effect of SARSCoV-2 infection on gross motor development that could not be
explained by the mediating effect in this model; and Path c (total
effect) represented the total effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
gross motor development.
Descriptive analyses and multivariable analyses were
implemented using SAS ver. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
The mediation model was implemented using the mediation

## RESULTS

 Demographic Characteristics and Main Outcomes
**Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics, perinatal**
conditions, and early childhood development. The median age
of the mothers was significantly higher in the infection cohort.
A significantly lower proportion of mothers in the infection
cohort had a bachelor’s degree or above. The proportions of
low birthweight, congenital malformation, fetal distress, neonatal
asphyxia, admitted to NICU, and preterm birth did not differ
significantly between the two cohorts.
In the infection cohort, four pregnant women (7.0%) were
infected in the second trimester (19.5, IQR = 15.8–23.1 weeks)
and the other 53 (93.0%) in the third trimester (37.4, IQR
= 35.1–38.8 weeks). Clinically, 49 (86.0%) pregnant women
were diagnosed as mild cases and eight (14.0%) as severe cases.
Furthermore, we collected screening results of RT-PCR assay of
neonatal throat swab (51 cases), cord blood (3 cases), amniotic
fluid (2 cases), breast milk (12 cases), meconium (3 cases), and
placenta (2 cases). A single neonate had a positive RT-PCR throat


swab 36 h after delivery, but was negative in subsequent tests, as
previously reported (13, 18). There were 17 cases having a testing
of IgG and IgM in neonatal serum: eight cases (47.1%) with IgG
(+), including three cases (17.6%) with IgM (+) (13).
From the date of birth, the separation time of mothers and
infants in the infection cohort was significantly longer than that
in the non-infection cohort. In the non-infection cohort, eight
mothers were separated from their infants for a median of 19
(IQR = 7.0–36.0) days because their infants were admitted to
the NICU. The proportions of breastfeeding (did not distinguish
exclusively and partial breastfeeding) in the infection cohort
at 1 week (8.8 vs. 96.2%), 1 month (19.3 vs. 100.0%), and
3 months (36.8 vs. 100.0%) were significantly lower than in
the non-infection cohort. Social–emotional developmental delay
was seen in 13.6% of the children in the infection cohort and
23.4% of those in the non-infection cohort (p > 0.05). Similarly,
overall developmental delay was detected in 13.5% of the children
in the infection cohort and 8.1% in the non-infection cohort;
the difference was also not significant. The proportions with
developmental delay in communication, fine motor, problem
solving, and personal–social did not differ significantly between
the two cohorts. No children were assessed as having gross motor
developmental delay in either cohort. However, the gross motor,
fine motor, problem solving, and personal–social ASQ-3 scores
were significantly lower in the infection cohort.

## Association Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Early Childhood Development
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that SARSCoV-2 infection during pregnancy did not increase the risks of
social–emotional (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.51–1.49) and overall (RR
= 1.02, 95% CI: 0.60–1.73, Table 2) developmental delay. SARSCoV-2 infection was also not significantly associated with the
ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE-2 scores. Although we found that mother–
infant separation did not increase the risks of social–emotional
(RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99–1.01) and overall (RR = 1.00, 95%
CI: 0.99–1.01, Table 2) developmental delay, multivariable linear
regression models indicated that the length of mother–infant
separation was significantly negatively correlated with the gross
motor score (β = −0.09, 95% CI: −0.16 to −0.02).

## Mediation Effect Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Early Childhood Development
**Table 3 and Figure 2 show the components of the mediation**
model. SARS-CoV-2 infection had significant total (Path c, p
= 0.009) and indirect (Path a×b) effects on the gross motor
development scores; the indirect effect and 84.73% of the total
effect were mediated by the length of mother–infant separation.
SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the length of
mother–infant separation (Path a, p < 0.001), which significantly
affected the gross motor development score (Path b, p = 0.012).
The remaining direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gross
motor development score was not significant (Path c[′], p = 0.759).

## DISCUSSION

This is the first cohort study to evaluate the potential direct
and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy
(mainly in the third trimester) on early childhood development.
We followed 57 mother–infant dyads in an infection cohort
and 78 dyads in a non-infection cohort until 3 months after
delivery. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during
pregnancy did not increase the risks of social–emotional (RR =
0.87, 95% CI: 0.51–1.49) and overall (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.60–
1.73) developmental delay. However, the length of mother–infant
separation was significantly negatively correlated with the gross
motor score (β = −0.09, 95% CI: −0.16 to −0.02). Furthermore,
using a mediation model, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection
had a significant indirect effect on the gross motor score by
increasing the length of mother–infant separation.
Betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2, have caused severe global pandemics. A study
after the 2003 SARS epidemic showed that SARS-CoV infection
during pregnancy did not increase the risk of developmental
delay in children compared with children of mothers who were
not infected with SARS-CoV during pregnancy (19). There was
no evidence that MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy affected
early offspring development. Current evidence suggests that
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 affect fewer children,
cause fewer symptoms, and less severe disease, and are associated

with much lower case-fatality rates, compared with adults (20,
21). Studies have proposed a potential mechanism of SARS-CoV2 infection during pregnancy on early offspring development,
including maternal–fetal interface destruction, maternal systemic
immune response, and direct brain infection interfering with
brain development (22); however, these hypotheses have not
been verified. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy does not increase the
risk of early developmental delay in offspring, compared with
non-infected infants. In addition, it should be noted that the
mothers in the infection cohort in the present study were mainly
infected in the third trimester (accounting for 93.0%). Our results
cannot explain the impact on the neurodevelopment of offspring
when the infection occurs in the early pregnancy, especially in
the first trimester, which needs to be explained by more studies in
the future.
In the further mediation model, we found that SARSCoV-2 infection during pregnancy had significant indirect
effects on the ASQ-3 gross motor domain score by increasing
the length of mother–infant separation. After separating the
indirect effects, the remaining direct effect was not significant,
which was consistent with the results of the multivariable
linear regression models. To prevent neonatal infection (11),
infants in the infection cohort experienced longer separation
from their mothers than the non-infection cohort, which
means that the infants in the infected group did not receive
enough support and response from their mothers to meet their
developmental needs (12). Early separation interrupted skinto-skin contact, breastfeeding, and mother–infant interactions,

which had adverse effects on the physiological development
(23), innate and specific immunity (24), and neurodevelopment
(including language, cognition, motor, and social development)
of the children (25). In particular, we observed that the
breastfeeding rate of the non-infected cohort at 1 and 3 months
was 100%, which was significantly higher than that of the
infection cohort. Better breastfeeding would be more conducive
to early childhood development. Although this study did not
find its significant effect, it still deserves continuous attention.
Thus, we confirmed the hypothesis of the mediation model that
mother–infant separation may have a potential impact on early
childhood development. Furthermore, our results also indicated
that although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during
late pregnancy on early childhood development is limited, the
secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (such as mother–
infant separation) may still affect early childhood development.
It is also worth noting that a published study showed that
when adequate protective measures are taken, the risk of
infant infection caused by rooming-in practice is limited (26).
Combined with our results, it is necessary to focus on the benefit
of protected rooming-in, on the premise that the risk of infant
infection can be effectively controlled.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused both a health crisis
and economic and social crises (27–29), which have profoundly
affected sustainable development goals (30). The mother–infant
separation discussed here is only the tip of the iceberg of this
global crisis. The World Bank Group estimates that the global
economy contracted 4.3% in 2020; the pandemic raised poverty
rates to between 9.1 and 9.4%, back to levels last seen in
2017 (31). Poverty is the source of many risk factors for early
childhood development, including malnutrition, caregiver stress


and depressive symptoms, low caregiver responsiveness, lowquality nurturing care, and community environment, causing
them to miss early education (32). The COVID-19 pandemic
is accelerating the deterioration of these external factors,
pushing the poorest and most vulnerable people and their
children into worse situations. We call for global attention
to the plight of these families and their children in the
current pandemic.
Our study had some limitations. First, the study population
was small, since NERS reported only 138 pregnant women
confirmed with COVID-19 as of April 30, 2020, which might
affect the power of our study. Second, we found that only the
length of mother–infant separation was negatively associated
with the ASQ-3 gross motor domain score. Therefore, we
used the gross motor domain score in the mediation model
instead of the classification result. Therefore, we found only
that SARS-CoV-2 infection had a potential indirect negative
effect on the development of the children, which did not
mean that this indirect effect would increase the risk of
developmental delay in the offspring. In addition, the recruitment
and follow-up were conducted through the internet and by
telephone, and participant compliance was not as satisfactory
as with face-to-face follow-up. Since our follow-up lasted only
3 months, our results cannot represent longer-term effects.
Finally, we used screening scales instead of diagnostic scales
to access early childhood development, which might cause
evaluation bias.
In conclusion, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection
during late pregnancy did not increase the risk of offspring
developmental delay at 3 months. However, we found that the
length of mother–infant separation was significantly negatively


-----

correlated with the ASQ-3 gross motor domain score. We found
that SARS-CoV-2 infection indirectly affected the gross motor
score by increasing the length of mother–infant separation,
mediating 84.73% of the total effect. Future researchers
should conduct longer follow-up studies of children whose
mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy,
to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on early
childhood development. Future researchers also need to pay
more attention to potential mediators and indirect effects
between COVID-19 and early childhood development as
the pandemic is now changing the external environment of
child development.
