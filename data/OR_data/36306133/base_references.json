            "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a wide range of outcomes characterized by a high heterogeneity in both symptomatology and susceptibility to the disease. In such a perspective, COVID-19 may be considered as a multifactorial disease featured by the interaction between the environment, which is the virus itself, and the genetic profile of the host. Our analysis aimed at investigating the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within families whose members responded in different ways to the infection, although the exposure was common to the entire group and occurred before the availability of any vaccine. The goal was to understand how the genetic background of each subject can influence the viral infection outcome and hence the above-mentioned clinical variability. We performed a segregation analysis in 19 Italian families with a designed custom panel of 42 genes involved in immunity and virus entry and which have also been shown to be related to SARS-CoV-2 host response. We carried out both a familial segregation analysis and a global statistical analysis. In the former we identified eighteen risk variants co-segregating with a COVID-positive status and six variants with a possible protective effect. In addition, sixteen variants showed a trend of association to a severe phenotype. Together with common SNPs, we detected private rare variants that may also provide insight into the observed clinical COVID-19 heterogeneity. The global statistical analysis confirmed statistically significant positive associations between SARS-CoV-2 individual response and some specific gene variants identified in familial analysis. In conclusion our data confirm that the clinical expression of COVID-19 is markedly influenced by the host genetic profile both with a mendelian transmission pattern and a polygenic architecture."

            "abstract": "Mandatory attendance, particularly in didactic settings, is a highly debated topic in higher education, including dental education. Within dental education, a large portion of education occurs in preclinical laboratories and clinical environments. There is little to no research on attendance in these settings in dental schools. This point/counterpoint paper examines the pros and cons of mandatory attendance in these highly specialized educational settings. With the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 and continues to impact dental education at the time of publication, this topic has become even more relevant. Viewpoint 1 claims that attendance should be mandatory because a greater exposure to preclinical and clinical environments helps foster better clinical hand skills, critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving skills, and an overall sense of professional identity. It goes on further to suggest that there may be a link between attendance and performance in exams and that attendance is part of the dental school's responsibility. Viewpoint 2 argues that the rationale for attendance is complex, and that creating learning environments that are psychologically safe will incentivize students to attend, even without mandatory attendance policies. Furthermore, it explains that technological advances have allowed dental schools to think creatively about asynchronous learning, which by its very nature does not require attendance at a given time. The authors of both viewpoints conclude that the preclinical and clinical education and experience are critical dental education and that dental school leaders should focus on improving the quality of these experiences."

            "abstract": "Donor milk (DM) is of increasing interest as primary nutritional source for preterm infants. Safe access requires special infrastructure, trained staff, sophisticated algorithms, and standard operating procedures as well as quality control measures. DM has limitations like low protein content and unpredictable composition of the other macronutrients, despite fortification frequently not meeting recommendations - both of them compromising growth. The first paragraph is devoted to COVID-19 and how it impacts processes of DM banking. The following paragraphs review aspects of \"pasteurization,\" \"safety audits/donor screening,\" and \"DM nutrient variability.\" In summary, (i) Holder pasteurization still is the most suitable procedure for milk banks, but high-pressure pasteurization or ultraviolet C irradiation conserve the unique properties of DM better and deserve more research to make it suitable for clinical routine. (ii) In regard to safety/screening, guidelines are valuable for safe DM bank operation, but they differ between legislations. There is a surprisingly high rate of non-disclosed donor smoking (0.3%, p > 0.05) and of adulteration of delivered DM (up to 2%, p < 0.05) not detected by standard donor screening procedures. Frequencies differ between remunerated and non-remunerated programs. (iii) Neonatal caregivers should be aware of unpredictable composition of DM. They should be trained on how these can be overcome to avoid negative impact on growth and long-term outcomes like (a) measuring and disclosing nutrient contents of delivered DM batches to customers, (b) implementing certain types of donor pooling to reduce the risk of macronutrient depleted DM, (c) additional supplementation using 0.3-0.5 g protein/100 mL seems to be reasonable, (d) adjusted fortification may help to improve growth, but is not efficient in all preterm infants, (e) target fortification seems to improve growth (and probably also neurodevelopmental index) compared to standard fortification, (f) more research and clinical studies are needed."

Relative to other medical fields, the interdisciplinary fields of speech-language pathology (SLP), phoniatrics, and otolaryngology have been slower to take up digital tools for therapeutic, teaching, and learning purposes-a process that was recently expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many current teaching and learning tools have restricted or institution-only access, there are many openly accessible tools that have gone largely unexplored. To find, use, and evaluate such resources, it is important to be familiar with the structures, concepts, and formats of existing digital tools.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This descriptive study aims to investigate digital learning tools and resources in SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology.

In terms of content, the largest proportion of tools for academic-level learners pertained to anatomy and physiology (60/214, 28%), and that for clinical-professional learners pertained to diagnostic evaluation (47/185, 25.4%). Between groups, the largest differences were observed for anatomy and physiology (academic-level learners: 60/86, 70%; clinical-professional learners: 26/86, 30%) and professional issues (8/28, 29% vs 20/28, 71%). With regard to learning goals, most tools for academic-level learners targeted the performance of procedural skills (50/98, 51%), and those for clinical-professional learners targeted receptive information acquisition (44/62, 71%). Academic-level learners had more tools for supporting higher-level learning goals than clinical-professional learners, specifically tools for performing procedural skills (50/66, 76% vs 16/66, 24%) and strategic skills (8/10, 80% vs 2/10, 20%).

            "abstract": "A prominent health issue nowadays is the COVID-19 pandemic, which poses acute risks to human health. However, the long-term health consequences are largely unknown and cannot be neglected. An especially vulnerable period for infection is pregnancy, when infections could have long-term health effect on the child. Evidence suggests that maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by either bacteria or viruses presents various effects on the offspring, leading to adverse phenotypes in many organ systems. This review compares the mechanisms of bacterial and viral MIA and the possible long-term outcomes for the offspring by summarizing the outcome in animal LPS and Poly I:C models. Both models are activated immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors. The outcomes for MIA offspring include neurodevelopment, immune response, circulation, metabolism, and reproduction. Some of these changes continue to exist until later life. Besides different doses and batches of LPS and Poly I:C, the injection day, administration route, and also different animal species influence the outcomes. Here, we specifically aim to support colleagues when choosing their animal models for future studies."

Four adults with NDD were taught to use their cameras and microphones appropriately and to make encouraging statements to one another while discussing current events and social skills-based lessons via Zoom™. Two of the three skills increased and maintained for all participants even after the experimenter faded the contingencies for appropriate responding. The third skill maintained after the experimenter arranged for the response to produce natural consequences. Tests for generalization across group leads and activities yielded promising results. Findings suggest that adults with NDD benefit from group-based telehealth services to improve skills needed to interact successfully with others in a virtual format."

The present study surveyed 230 educators (teachers, staff, and administrators) to assess their wellbeing, concerns during the pandemic, and perceived importance of various COVID-19 school mitigation strategies. Data were gathered May/June of 2021 from two separate school districts, one in the Midwest and the other in the Mid-Atlantic, serving children with IDD. Nearly half of all survey respondents reported poor wellbeing. Almost all educators reported health of themselves, students, and family members was their greatest concern when compared to pandemic-related disruption of their duties or benefits (e.g., not having enough sick time). Most educators felt disinfecting routines, vaccinations, and daily health checks were the most helpful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in schools, while in-school mask mandates and weekly testing of students and staff were perceived as less helpful. Our findings suggest that efforts are needed to support the wellbeing of educators during these challenging times. When pandemic-related policies and procedures are decided by administrators, our data suggest educators will review decisions within the framework of health and safety of themselves, their students, and families. Understanding this framework may be particularly valuable when considering implementation of COVID-19 policies, like masking and COVID-19 testing, that are less preferred."

Vaccine acceptance could be a critical factor influencing vaccine uptake. Health information has been associated with vaccine acceptance. For college students who are embracing a digital era and being exposed to multimedia, the sources of COVID-19 vaccine information and their trust in these sources may play an important role in shaping their acceptance of vaccine uptake.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In September 2020, we conducted an online survey among 1062 college students in South Carolina to understand their perceptions and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination.

About 83.1% of the participants largely or always trusted scientists, 73.9% trusted healthcare providers, and 70.2% trusted health agencies. After controlling for key demographics, vaccine acceptance was positively associated with scientists as information sources but negatively associated with pharmaceutical companies as sources. Higher trust levels in mass media, health agencies, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. However, trust in social media was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      College students use multiple sources to learn about upcoming COVID-19 vaccines including health agencies, personal networks, and social media.

Trust in health authorities and scientists rather than social media is related to higher level vaccine acceptance. Our findings echo the call for restoring trust in government, healthcare system, scientists, and pharmaceutical industries in the COVID-19 era and highlight the urgency to dispel misinformation in social media. Effective strategies are needed to disseminate accurate information about COVID-19 vaccine from health authorities and scientific research to improve vaccine communication to the public and promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake."

Children with pre-existing socio-demographic or developmental risk factors may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic and associated public health preventive measures. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children aged 5-13 years-old, while highlighting the specific difficulties experienced by children with neurodevelopmental issues or chronic health conditions. Methods: A systematic search of the published literature was conducted in Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, followed by a quantitative meta-analysis of the eligible studies. Results: Out of the 985 articles identified, 28 empirical studies with prospective or retrospective longitudinal data were included in the quantitative synthesis. COVID-19 lockdown measures were associated with negative general mental health outcomes among children (g = 0.28, p < 0.001, and k = 21), but of small magnitude. Sleep habits were also changed during the pandemic, as sleep duration significantly increased in children (g = 0.32; p = 0.004, and k = 9). Moreover, results did not differ between children from the general population and those from clinical populations such as children with epilepsy, oncology, neurodevelopmental disorders, or obesity. Effect sizes were larger in European vs. Asian countries. Conclusions: Studies included in this review suggest that children's mental health was generally negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health and the influence of specific risks factors as they evolve over time."

These services are designed to maintain people's quality of life while living at home. The ASCOT measure of social care-related quality of life (SCRQoL), designed to evaluate quality and effectiveness of social care, has been adapted for proxy-report when someone is unable to self-report. The ASCOT-Carer has been developed to measure carer's own SCRQoL. This study sought to establish the factors related to SCRQoL of people living with dementia (PLWD, proxy-reported by carers) and their carers. Data were collected via a self-administered postal or online survey of 313 carers in England, from January 2020 to April 2021. Carers were eligible if they supported someone living with dementia at home, who was unable to self-complete questionnaires. The person living with dementia or their carer had to use at least one social care service, e.g. home care. We recruited participants via an online volunteer panel and NHS sites. Multiple regression was applied to explore the factors significantly related to ASCOT SCRQoL by self- and proxy-report. Key influences on carers' own SCRQoL were their health, financial difficulties associated with caring, and satisfaction with social care support. Inadequate home design was significantly negatively associated with SCRQoL for PLWD. The latter stages of the pandemic-related restrictions (the tier system from 2nd December 2020 to study end, April 2021) were associated with significantly worse SCRQoL for PLWD, but not for carers. The study offers insight into the factors associated with SCRQoL. In particular, the findings highlight the importance of adequate home design for people with dementia; satisfactory social care support and limiting any adverse financial impact of caring are important for carers. The findings indicate a negative effect of COVID restrictions on SCRQoL of people with dementia."

Chemokines are groups of small proteins that regulate cell migration and mediate inflammation responses via binding to chemokine receptors. Thus, chemokines/chemokine receptors may be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders and associated with ASD. In this review, we summarize the research progress of chemokine aberrations in ASD and also review the recent progress of clinical treatment of ASD and pharmacological research related to chemokines/chemokine receptors. This review highlights the possible connection between chemokines/chemokine receptors and ASD, and provides novel potential targets for drug discovery of ASD."

            "abstract": "The ongoing worldwide pandemic of the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing disease, COVID-19, has presented enormous and unprecedented challenges for all medical specialists. However, to date, children, especially neonates, have been relatively spared from the devastating consequences of this infection. Neurologic involvement is being increasingly recognized among adults with COVID-19, who can develop sensory deficits in smell and taste, delirium, encephalopathy, headaches, strokes, and peripheral nervous system disorders. Among neonates and children, COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations have been relatively rare, yet reports involving neurologic dysfunction in this age range are increasing. As discussed in this review, pediatric neurologists and other pediatric specialists should be alert to potential neurological involvement by this virus, which might have neuroinvasive capability and carry long-term neuropsychiatric and medical consequences."

The objective of this study was to examine the risk of ID-related emergency department (ED) visits, subsequent hospitalizations, and hospital-based mortality during ID-related visits among adults with IDD compared to those without IDD. The authors conducted a retrospective study using data from the 2016 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. The sample included 94,928 adults with IDD identified using ICD-10-CM codes, and age- and sex-matched 284,763 non-IDD adults in a 1:3 case-control ratio. A Poisson regression model was used to compare the risk of ID-related ED visits, subsequent hospitalizations, and hospital-based mortality during ID-related visits between adults with and without IDD. Covariates included sociodemographic and hospital characteristics. Results showed that adults with IDD are at a higher risk for ID-related ED visits, subsequent hospitalization, and mortality during ID-related ED visits compared to non-IDD adults. Adults with IDD continued to experience higher risks even after accounting for sociodemographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics. Septicemia and respiratory tract infections are the leading causes of ED visits, hospitalization, and mortality. This study found substantial disparities in ID-related ED visits, subsequent hospitalization, and mortality among the burdens for adults with IDD. These observations underscore the importance of integrated strategies to reduce ID-related morbidity among adults with IDD."

We enrolled 136 school-aged children (intellectual quotient ≥ 50) and their parents and administered QOL questionnaires to assess the maladaptive behavior of the children; depression, anxiety, and stress of the parents; and activities of their daily lives. The relationship between their QOL and clinical features was examined. The decrease in QOL of children and parents was associated with the mother's limited job flexibility. Decreased QOL was also associated with changes in the sleep rhythms of the children. Maladaptive behaviors in children were associated with parental stress. However, maintained QOL of some families who faced these same conditions of job stress and sleep disorders was associated with less parental stress, less parental depression and anxiety, and milder maladaptive behavior in children. Both mothers with limited job flexibility and changes in the sleep rhythm of children were associated with reduced QOL of children and their parents. Low parental stress was associated with decreased maladaptive behavior in children and with maintained QOL of the family."

Study design: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted from May 10 to May 31, 2020. Two online anonymous surveys were developed: population-based and clinical-based (children with neuropsychiatric disorders). Outcomes included emotional and behavioral symptoms, as assessed by psychometric scales (BPSC, PPSC, PSC, CES-DC and SCARED, respectively), and lifestyle changes during home confinement (i.e., physical activity, screen time, home schooling, reading). Results: The sample included 9,688 pediatric subjects, and 289 children and adolescents with a neuropsychiatric disorder. The presence of siblings was a protective factor in all ages. In pre- and school children: male sex, a diagnosis of autism, residency in highly affected areas, high parental educational level or job loss, and screen time (>2 h/day) were risk factors. Physical activity, home-schooling, reading, talking with other people were protective factors. Residency in highly affected areas, a diagnosis of mood disorder, parental job loss, and screen time, were associated with a worsening of the depressive symptoms, whereas physical activity, talking with other people, playing with parents were protective activities. Screen time was also a risk factor for anxiety symptoms, while physical activity, reading and talking with other people were protective factors. Conclusions: This study identified risk and protective factors for mental health symptoms associated with lifestyle changes caused by COVID-19 home confinement to promote mental well-being in pediatrics during pandemic times."

These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19).\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, ≥80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this cohort study indicate a clear association of COVID-19 lockdowns with a reduction in children's access to spoken communication."

            "abstract": "Over the past years, brain development has been investigated in rodent models, which were particularly relevant to establish the role of specific genes in this process. However, the cytoarchitectonic features, which determine neuronal network formation complexity, are unique to humans. This implies that the developmental program of the human brain and neurological disorders can only partly be reproduced in rodents. Advancement in the study of the human brain surged with cultures of human brain tissue in the lab, generated from induced pluripotent cells reprogrammed from human somatic tissue. These cultures, termed brain organoids, offer an invaluable model for the study of the human brain. Brain organoids reproduce the cytoarchitecture of the cortex and can develop multiple brain regions and cell types. Integration of functional activity of neural cells within brain organoids with genetic, cellular, and morphological data in a comprehensive model for human development and disease is key to advance in the field. Because the functional activity of neural cells within brain organoids relies on cell repertoire and time in culture, here, we review data supporting the gradual formation of complex neural networks in light of cell maturity within brain organoids. In this context, we discuss how the technology behind brain organoids brought advances in understanding neurodevelopmental, pathogen-induced, and neurodegenerative diseases."

All but two studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes. Most interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. The subset of studies examining intervention feasibility concluded that telemental health interventions were appropriate, acceptable, and satisfactory to patients and their parents. Technology did not create barriers in access to care. For the subset of efficacy studies, evidence in support of the efficacy of telemental health was mixed. Significant heterogeneity in treatment type, medical diagnoses, and outcomes precluded a meta-analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The state of the science for telemental health interventions designed for youth with chronic illnesses is in a nascent stage.

Respiratory cilia are also one of the first contact points between host and inhaled pathogens. Impaired ciliary function is a common pathological feature in patients with chronic airway diseases, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections. Common respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been shown to target cilia and/or ciliated airway epithelial cells, resulting in a disruption of mucociliary clearance that may facilitate host infection. Despite being an integral component of airway innate immunity, the role of respiratory cilia and their clinical significance during airway infections are still poorly understood. This review examines the expression, structure, and function of respiratory cilia during pathogenic infection of the airways. This review also discusses specific known points of interaction of bacteria, fungi, and viruses with respiratory cilia function.

Because of the role of social and environmental factors in COVID-19 transmission and burden of disease, it is essential to ensure that there is adequate coordination of population-based health services and public health interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the primary and community healthcare (P&CHC) system's weaknesses worldwide. In many instances, P&CHC played only a minor role, the emphasis being on hospital and intensive care beds. This was compounded by political failures, in supporting local community resilience. Placing community building, social cohesion and resilience at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis can help align solutions that provide a vision of 'planetary health'. This can be achieved by involving local well-being and participation in the face of any pervasive health and environmental crisis, including other epidemics and large-scale ecological crises. This paper proposes that P&CHC should take on two critical roles: first, to support local problem-solving efforts and to serve as a partner in innovative approaches to safeguarding community well-being; and second, to understand the local environment and health risks in the context of the global health perspective. We see this as an opportunity of immediate value and broad consequence beyond the control of the COVID-19 pandemic."

By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine. We propose a clinical service decision tree with specific criteria to help guide providers on how to triage cases in order to increase access to specialized healthcare.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The success of implementing a TeleNP consultation service hinges upon ongoing care coordination between providers, clerical staff, patients, and families with clear goals and expectations, maintenance of legal and ethical standards, and development of specific administrative and clinical processes supporting the use of TeleNP."

The purpose of the current study was to describe the attitudes of workers towards COVID-19 vaccination prior to vaccination rollout, with a view to informing strategies to promote vaccine uptake within this high-risk sector.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An online survey was sent via email to workers supporting adults with ID in Ontario, Canada, between January 21 and February 3, 2021 by agency leadership and union representatives.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three thousand and three hundred and seventy-one workers, representing approximately 11.2% of Ontario workers supporting adults with ID completed an online survey. Most reported that they were very likely (62%) or likely (20%) to get a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination intent) although 18% reported they were less likely to do so (vaccination nonintent). Workers with vaccination nonintent were younger and were more likely to endorse the beliefs that (1) it will not benefit them or those around them, (2) it was not part of their job, (3) rapid development confers uncertainties and risks, and (4) they were scared of potential vaccine side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is need to address common misconceptions among workers supporting adults with ID to help activate them as vaccine advocates in the communities they serve.

Stigma is also a major barrier to accessing specialist services and consequently many people with ID continue to suffer in silence. A confidential inquiry into the premature deaths of people with ID in England and Wales revealed the median age at death of individuals with this condition was 13 years (for males) to 20 years (for females) younger than the median age at death of the general population. It has been posited that stigma is a factor that contributes to the mortality gap between those with ID and those who don't have this condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for people with ID and has further fortified the barriers to specialist services. To reduce stigma, improve the quality of healthcare that is provided to people with this condition and to break down the barriers to specialist services, we must pioneer innovative interventions that leverage the power of technology and 'virtual' contact with people who live with these conditions."

We extended this literature by characterizing a child psychiatric outpatient sample in the United States during the middle of the 2020-2021 school year. We also used a computational strategy to identify distinct patterns of psychopathology symptom change and examined correlates and predictors of such change. Among potential predictors were cognition and clinical diagnoses, which have not been studied in this context previously.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were 171 youth (aged 10.6 ± 3.1) referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation who enrolled in research and whose parents filled out a survey on COVID-19. The questionnaire included eight psychiatric and six psychosocial domains rated retrospectively prior to the pandemic and currently at the time of evaluation. We examined change in severity of individual domains with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We used a latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify groups with distinct symptom change profiles. Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined potential predictors and correlates of LPA-derived groups. Models controlled for age, sex, and assessment date and corrected for multiple testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Although the majority of individual psychopathology domains were worse on average during the 2020-2021 school year, youth showed distincive patterns of symptom change. In addition to a large group (72.2%) with relatively stable symptoms and a small group (6.4%) that improved on most symptoms, there were two groups with different constellations of worsening symptoms. These latter groups both showed increased sadness, anxiety and oppositionality; however, one had increased hyperactivity/impulsivity and no change in hopelessness while the other showed greater hopelessness and no change in hyperactivity. Symptoms related to the distinguishable domains of these groups predicted group membership, and changes in screen time, conflict with parents and social isolation were correlates of worsening.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 2036 dentists and dental students (1433 women). For the main outcome, the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) was used. The survey also questioned sociodemographic aspects, questions on the COVID-19 pandemic, health variables, and habits. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses (linear regression) were applied to observe the factors associated with perceived stress. The PSS-14 mean score was 24.76 (±11.76). Hierarchical regression models showed significant variables associated with the PSS-14 scores: income level during mandatory social isolation, having older adults under care during mandatory social isolation, self-perceived level of concern regarding COVID-19, self-perceived health, Coffee consumption during mandatory social isolation. In general terms, the pandemic has influenced the personal, social, labor, and everyday life of dental staff and affected the mental health of this population specifically when perceived stress is considered.

Probabilistic theories often treat it as axiomatic, whereas it follows from the meanings of conditionals in the theory of mental models. In this theory, intuitive models (system 1) do not represent what is false, and so produce errors in estimates of p(if A then C), yielding instead p(A & C). Deliberative models (system 2) are normative, and yield the proportion of cases of A in which C holds, i.e., the Equation. Intuitive estimates of the probability of a conditional about unique events: If covid-19 disappears in the USA, then Biden will run for a second term, together with those of each of its clauses, are liable to yield joint probability distributions that sum to over 100%. The error, which is inconsistent with the probability calculus, is massive when participants estimate the joint probabilities of conditionals with each of the different possibilities to which they refer.

The completion rate of the CFS was assessed. The presence of major comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease was noted. Results: A total of 1277 older patients with COVID-19, aged ≥ 65 (79.9 ± 8.1) years were included in the study, with 98.5% having fully completed CFS. The total prevalence of frailty (CFS ≥ 5) was 66.9%, being higher in women than men (75.2% vs. 59.4%, p < 0.001). Frailty was found in 161 (44%) patients aged 65-74 years, 352 (69%) in 75-84 years, and 341 (85%) in ≥85 years groups, and increased across the age groups (<0.0001, test for trend). Conclusion: Frailty was prevalent in our cohort of older people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. This indicates that older people who are also frail, who go on to contract COVID-19 may have disease severity significant enough to warrant hospitalization. These data may help inform health care planners and targeted interventions and appropriate management for the frail older person."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased depression rates, particularly in emerging adults. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal changes in depression risk before and during COVID-19 in a cohort of emerging adults in the U.S. and to determine whether prior drinking or sleep habits could predict the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were 525 emerging adults from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a five-site community sample including moderate-to-heavy drinkers. Poisson mixed-effect models evaluated changes in the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) from before to during COVID-19, also testing for sex and age interactions. Additional analyses examined whether alcohol use frequency or sleep duration measured in the last pre-COVID assessment predicted pandemic-related increase in depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of risk for clinical depression tripled due to a substantial and sustained increase in depressive symptoms during COVID-19 relative to pre-COVID years. Effects were strongest for younger women. Frequent alcohol use and short sleep duration during the closest pre-COVID visit predicted a greater increase in COVID-19 depressive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The sharp increase in depression risk among emerging adults heralds a public health crisis with alarming implications for their social and emotional functioning as this generation matures. In addition to the heightened risk for younger women, the role of alcohol use and sleep behavior should be tracked through preventive care aiming to mitigate this looming mental health crisis."

Measures used to protect residents include social distancing and isolation, although implementation is challenging. This review aimed to assess the social distancing and isolation strategies used by care homes to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Seven electronic databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, Social Care Online, and Web of Science Core Collection. Grey literature was searched using MedRxiv, PDQ-Evidence, NICE Evidence Search, LTCCovid19.org and TRIP. Extracted data were synthesised using narrative synthesis and tabulation. 103 papers were included (10 empirical studies, seven literature reviews, and 86 policy documents). Strategies used to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases included social distancing and isolation of residents and staff, zoning and cohorting of residents, restriction of resident movement/activities, restriction of visitors and restriction of staff working patterns. This review demonstrates a lack of empirical evidence and the limited nature of policy documentation around social distancing and isolation measures in care homes. Evaluative research on these interventions is needed urgently, focusing on the well-being of all residents, particularly those with hearing, vision or cognitive impairments."

This study evaluates whether preclinical medical students demonstrate bias towards people with disabilities during an educational ventilator-allocation exercise. Written student responses to a triage simulation activity were analyzed to describe ventilator priority rankings and to identify themes regarding disability. Disability status was not cited as a reason to withhold a ventilator. Key themes observed in ventilator triage decisions included life expectancy, comorbidities, and social worth. Although disability discrimination has historically been perpetuated by health care professionals, it is encouraging that preclinical medical students did not demonstrate explicit bias against people with disabilities in ventilator triage scenarios."

Method : In this cross sectional study, using a convenient and snowball sampling method, we distributed an online questionnaire to participants and collected data on their demographic variables, mental health status, the consumption of and level of trust to various media, the level of public trust, and perceived risk and safety behaviors regards COVID-19. Our final sample consisted of 1881 Iranian residents. We used descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation, univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis for data analysis. Results: The mental health problems have increased in comparison to past national survey; 24.1% vs 10.39% for depression, 37.93% vs 16.7% for social dysfunction, and 41.33% vs 29.5% for anxiety, and 31.12% vs 29.08% for somatization. We also found high percent of acute stress 52.71% (95% CI: 50.45-54.96). Being female, married, and having a higher educational level increased the odds of safety behaviors. Public trust and national media can regulate the negative effect of the pandemic, while increasing perceived risk and appropriate safety behaviors can decrease psychological problems and disorders. However, social media increases perceived risk, safety behaviors, and psychological problems, especially severe acute stress. Conclusion: We are in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects will increase. Many people have lost their relatives, their jobs, their social contacts, and are faced with a surge of negative news. Authorities should consider these critical issues and adopt appropriate communicative and supportive approaches to prevent their negative effects at both individual and societal levels."

            "abstract": "Providing treatment to children with autism is a global health priority, and research demonstrates that caregivers can be trained in techniques to promote their child's social interaction, communication, play, positive behavior and skills. These caregiver-mediated interventions have been shown to promote a number of positive outcomes in children with autism, as well as their caregivers. When provided by telehealth, data indicate that caregiver training is acceptable and feasible, and associated with similar positive outcomes as live face-to-face training. Telehealth innovations, which have accelerated during the COVID-19 era, have demonstrated advantages over in-person delivery of services in terms of cost effectiveness and increased accessibility, however, more research is needed on feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness for different populations in different contexts. This brief review will highlight recent caregiver skills training interventions for autism that have been successfully adapted or designed for telehealth delivery. Telehealth interventions that are scalable, adaptable, caregiver-mediated, open-access, and delivered as part of a stepped care model, have the potential to address the global treatment gap for families of children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Considerations relevant to the global scale-up of caregiver-mediated interventions will also be discussed."

In this tool, spoken sentences, which are composed of emotional content (anger, happiness, sadness, and neutral) in both semantics and prosody in different combinations, are rated by listeners. To date, English, German, and Hebrew versions have been developed, as well as online versions, iT-RES, to adapt to COVID-19 social restrictions. Since the perception of spoken emotions may be affected by linguistic (and cultural) variables, it is important to compare the acoustic characteristics of the stimuli within and between languages.

A recent study, however, reported changes in otoacoustic emission (OAE) signals measured in SARS-COV-2 positive patients. We sought to assess the effect of COVID-19 infection on auditory performance in a cohort of recovered SARS-COV-2 patients and controls. To avoid a potential bias of previous audiological dysfunction not related to SARS-COV-2 infection, the study encompasses patients with normal auditory history.

We propose that speech-language pathologists can use the widespread experience of social isolation as a learning catalyst in the effort to shift the LTC culture to one that more highly values a communicative environment that is accessible to all, thereby reducing risk of social isolation for those with communication disorders. Conclusions Many training paradigms for promoting an accessible communicative environment are available in the speech-language pathology literature, yet institutional barriers exist for their widespread implementation. Overcoming these barriers is a challenge that requires awareness and learning on the part of staff and administration regarding the impact of an unfriendly communicative environment on social isolation, and the resulting psychosocial consequences. Learning theory indicates that new learning in adults is motivated by connections between personal experiences and the material to be learned. Explicitly infusing established training programs with the experience of social isolation brought on by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic may be the key needed for changing the communicative environment in LTC."

This condition, whereby motor control of the hand during previously highly trained movements on the instrument is lost, is termed focal hand dystonia. It is widely considered to be a consequence of prolonged repetitive daily practice, often in combination with exposure to a range of other risk factors. Current literature recommends retraining as a promising treatment intervention, although only scant scientific evidence exists on which components should be included in a retraining program, and how these may be best administered.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A progressive muscle activation and movement exercise program was devised by one of the authors applying a series of anatomy-based off-instrument movement tasks. This series of fine motor control exercises, was used to both assess and retrain focal hand dystonia in a population of musicians. The standardized approach aimed to provide a systematic method of retraining musically relevant muscular synergies that could later be applied to the instrument, while still allowing individual modifications. Retraining sessions were mostly run online as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, although some early sessions were also able to be undertaken face to face. Both qualitative and quantitative measures were used in this case series to evaluate program efficacy, due to the typical heterogeneity of the focal hand dystonia participants. This included: blinded external neurological evaluation of video footage using the Tubiana grading system, written subjective feedback, exercise progressions, and performance outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pilot testing of 4 patients indicated the utility of the program over approximately a 12- month time period. All subjects improved, 2 of whom have returned to pre-dystonia performance levels. These patients reported the importance of patience and persistence with daily exercise sessions in their recovery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Using off-instrument playing-relevant exercises to enhance fine motor control and muscle activation can be effective in retraining focal hand dystonia, regardless of additional treatments or level of performance. They should be regularly practiced and progressed in order for effects to be best progressed to instrumental applications.

We designed and delivered \"4Ds for Dealing with Distress\" during the crisis to address this need. 4Ds unifies a spectrum of familiar emotion regulation strategies, resilience exercises, and problem-solving approaches using perceptual control theory and distils them into a simple four-component rubric (Distract-Dilute-Develop-Discover). In essence, the aim is to reduce distress and restore wellbeing, both in the present moment through current actions (distract or dilute), and through expressing longer-term goal conflicts (e.g., through talking, writing, and drawing) to discover new perspectives that arise spontaneously after sufficient time and consideration. The intervention is user-led in that it draws on users' own idiosyncratic and pre-existing experiences, knowledge, skills and resources to help them apply an approach, or combination of approaches, that are proportionate and timed to the nature and context of the stress they are experiencing. In this article we review the empirical basis of the approach within experimental, social, biological and clinical psychology, illustrate the novel and time-efficient delivery format, describe its relevance to sports and exercise, summarise feedback from the recipients of the intervention to date, and describe the directions for future evaluation."

In this study, we examined the relationship between mental health and addictive behaviors, such as excessive exercise and the use of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) across 12 sport disciplines. Materials and methods: A large cross-sectional sample of the adult population (N = 2,295) was surveyed. The mean age was 33.09 (SD = 11.40). The number of male participants was 668 (30.0%). The use of IPEDs was assessed in conjunction with psychometric measures such as the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI). The participants were grouped into activity group (AG) and non-activity group (NAG) according to the presence or absence of their exercise habits. The results were compared between these groups, as well as across sport disciplines, while taking into account the relationship between different psychological measures and IPEDs consumption. Results: The frequency of IPEDs use was higher among AG (34.6%) than NAG (14.6%), although AG participants reported less history of addictions (7.1%) than NAG (11.8%). The logistic regression analysis revealed that scores equal to or above cutoff points, in both the EAI and AAI, predicted the IPEDs use. Regarding the differences across the various sport disciplines, those who were involved in practicing Weight Lifting and Cross Fit were found to be more at risk of excessive exercising and more inclined to use a wide range of IPEDs. Conclusions: Although exercise could help to increase well-being and prevent addictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, our results show that those in the AG are particularly vulnerable to excessive IPEDs use. Sport disciplines associated with higher EAI and AAI scores have also shown a higher tendency to excessive IPEDs use. Furthermore, the factor of having above the cutoff scores in EAI or AAI in each sport could indicate larger IPEDs consumption regardless of the discipline. In light of the current findings, it is necessary to better define the \"non-excessive\" levels of exercise in various sport disciplines and an adequate intake of IPEDs to ensure the safety and well-being of people during a pandemic."

In adopting a meso-perspective, we examine a potentially vital relationship between corporate conduct and pro-social behavior demanding sacrifice from individuals. Drawing on Weber (Economy and society: an outline of interpretive sociology. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1978 (Translation of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, Grundriss der verstehenden Soziologie, 1922)), we theorize that organizations in a community legitimize personal social conduct in three ways-by serving as role models, imparting norms and values, and routinizing forms of interaction. We study the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) behavior by local firms and the social distancing (SD) of citizens in US counties during the Covid-19 pandemic, a core ethical outcome. We argue and find that the residents of communities in which firms exhibit higher levels of CSR engaged in more SD during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was true when firms were (a) long-established, (b) isomorphic in their CSR, and (c) major employers and vendors. Moreover, CSR relating to the treatment of employees as well as positive and negative extremes in CSR bore especially strong relationships with SD. Implications are drawn for the study of business ethics, as modeled by CSR, as a force for ethical personal behavior and public health in communities."

Using a morbidity-based classification system, prevalence and risks for COVID-19-related hospitalisations, ventilations and deaths are estimated. Trisomies, behavioural and developmental disorders (relative risk: 2.09), dementia and organic psychoorganic syndromes (POS) (2.23) and (metastasised) malignant neoplasms (1.99) were identified as the most important conditions for escalations of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, optimal vaccination priority schedules for participants are established on the basis of individual cumulative escalation risk and are compared to the prioritisation scheme chosen by the German Government. We estimate how many people would have already received a vaccination prior to escalation. Vaccination schedules based on individual cumulative risk are shown to be 85% faster than random schedules in preventing deaths, and as much as 57% faster than the German approach, which was based primarily on age and specific diseases. In terms of hospitalisation avoidance, the individual cumulative risk approach was 51% and 28% faster. On this basis, it is concluded that using individual cumulative risk-based vaccination schedules, healthcare systems can be relieved and escalations more optimally avoided."

Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that matter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system."

            "title": "ATP7A-Related Copper Transport Disorders.",
            "abstract": "Clinical description:\n        \n      \n      Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy (DMN) are disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP7A, the X-linked gene that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. Classic Menkes disease typically presents after a six- to 12-week period of good health following a normal pregnancy and birth. Feeding difficulties and/or a seizure event are the usual initial presenting features. In the absence of a known or suspected positive family history, these issues prompt a diagnostic evaluation that may consume months, by which time hypotonia and significant neurodevelopmental delays are evident. OHS is milder neurologically and is not recognized until late childhood or adolescence. Both phenotypes involve subnormal serum copper levels and other manifestations of perturbed copper metabolism, including connective tissue weakness. In contrast, ATP7A-related DMN typically presents in early adulthood with isolated muscle weakness and atrophy, in the absence of overt copper metabolism abnormalities.\n    \n\nWhile nonspecific temperature instability and hypoglycemia in the neonatal period may be noted retrospectively, infants with classic Menkes disease appear healthy until age 1.5 to three months, when loss of developmental milestones, hypotonia, seizures, and failure to thrive occur. The diagnosis is usually suspected when infants exhibit neurologic findings and concomitant characteristic changes of the hair (short, sparse, coarse, twisted, and often lightly pigmented). Without treatment, premature death is typical, often by age three years.OHS is characterized by \"occipital horns,\" distinctive wedge-shaped calcifications at the sites of attachment of the trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the occipital bone. Occipital horns may be clinically palpable or observed on skull radiographs. Individuals with OHS also have lax skin and joints, bladder diverticula, inguinal hernias, and vascular tortuosity. Intellect is normal or slightly reduced.ATP7A-related DMN, an adult-onset disorder resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, shares none of the clinical or biochemical abnormalities characteristic of Menkes disease or OHS.\n\n\n\n          Diagnosis/testing:\n        \n      \n      Menkes disease and OHS are characterized by low concentrations of copper in some tissues as a result of impaired intestinal copper absorption, accumulation of copper in other tissues, and reduced activity of copper-dependent enzymes such as dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and lysyl oxidase. While serum copper concentration and serum ceruloplasmin concentration are low in Menkes disease and OHS, they are normal in ATP7A-related DMN. Notably, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels are low in healthy newborns for the first several months of life; thus, these are not reliable diagnostic biomarkers in infants younger than age two months.\n    \n\n      \n      The diagnosis of ATP7A-related copper transport disorders is most often confirmed in a proband by detection of either a hemizygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a male or a heterozygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a female with skewed X inactivation, or with a X-autosome translocation; the latter scenarios are quite rare.\n    \n\n\n          Management:\n        \nPrevention of primary manifestations (and treatment): Subcutaneous injections of copper histidinate beginning by age 28 days (corrected for prematurity/gestational age) enhances survival and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n    \n\nTreatment of manifestations:\n\n\nClassic Menkes disease. Seizure management per neurologist; early intervention and individualized education plan per developmental pediatrician, feeding therapy and gastrostomy tube placement to enhance caloric intake; antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bladder infection and surgery for bladder diverticula; RSV, influenza and COVID vaccinations due to risk of recurrent pneumonia; social work support.Occipital horn syndrome. Possible droxidopa treatment for dysautonomia; early academic support and individualized education plan as indicated per developmental pediatrician; surgical treatment of bladder diverticula and antibiotic prophylaxis as necessary; physical therapy; joint splints per orthopedist or rheumatologist for joint laxity.ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Special shoes with good ankle support; ankle-foot orthoses; physical therapy; occupational therapy; orthopedic surgery for severe pes cavus deformity; mobility devices; and exercise as tolerated.\n\n\nSurveillance:\n\n\nMenkes disease. At each visit assess seizures, developmental progress, educational needs, growth and nutrition, therapy needs, mobility, self-help skills, frequency of pulmonary infections, and family needs.Occipital horn syndrome. At each visit assess orthostatic blood pressures, development, and educational needs. Annual pelvic ultrasound for bladder diverticula.ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Annual neurologic exam, electroneurography of peripheral nerves, electromyography/electroneurography, physical therapy assessment, occupational therapy assessment, foot examination for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear.\n\n\n\n          Genetic counseling:\n        \n      \n      The ATP7A-related copper transport disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately one third of affected males have no family history of Menkes disease/OHS/DMN. If the mother is a heterozygote, the risk of transmitting the ATP7A pathogenic variant is 50% in each pregnancy: a male who inherits the pathogenic variant will be affected with the disorder present in his brother; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and generally will not be affected. Male Menkes disease survivors and males with OHS or ATP7A-related DMN theoretically could pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. When a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Self-directed learning (SDL) and problem-solving (PS) are essential skills in the development of the nursing profession. During the coronavirus pandemic, virtual learning was indispensable. However, little is known about how students develop SDL and PS abilities through online learning through group work.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effects of the online intervention on SDL and PS abilities through interactive group work.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A randomised waitlist-control trial was carried out. A structured intervention using problem-based learning (PBL) as a guideline was used to direct student learning in small group work.

Students in the intervention group reported greater improvement in the SDLRS and PSI at the 8th week, whereas those in the waitlist control group reported greater improvement in the SDLRS and PSI at the 16th week. Sustained effects in the SDLRS and PSI were observed in both the intervention and waitlist control groups at the 16th and 28th weeks, respectively. A repeated-measure analysis was performed to compare the SDLRS and PSI in different periods and revealed statistically significant results (p < 0.001) in all subscales of SDLRS and PSI in the four study periods.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The guidelines appear to be an effective treatment for SDL and PS ability enhancement with sustainable effects through interactive group work. The guidelines with explicit instructions and learning objectives provide directions and guidance to students to learn more effectively.

            "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) accelerates the discovery of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs for persons infected with the virus. Drug repurposing for the COVID-19 pandemic has received particular attention. Increasing clinical data suggest that antidepressant use in early-stage subjects with COVID-19 might be associated with a reduced risk of intubation or death. Among the antidepressants, fluvoxamine is the most attractive drug for mild to moderate subjects with COVID-19. In this article, we review the mechanisms of action (i.e., serotonin transporter, sigma-1 receptor, and acid sphingomyelinase) of fluvoxamine for COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss a possible link between maternal COVID-19 infection and a risk for neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia) in offspring."

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are heterogeneous and common in individuals with ADRD and are associated with more severe illness. However, unlike the cognitive symptoms of ADRD that are usually progressive, BPSD may be treatable. Individuals with BPSD are facing unique challenges during the pandemic due to the inherent nature of the illness and the biological and psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. These challenges include a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection in individuals with BPSD due to their frailty and medical vulnerability, difficulty participating in screening or testing, and adhering to infection control measures such as physical distancing. Further, biological effects of COVID-19 on the brain and its psychosocial impact such as isolation and disruption in mental health care are likely to worsen BPSD. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and strategies to manage the impact of COVID-19 and to effectively care for individuals with BPSD in community, long-term care, or hospital settings during the pandemic. Despite the ongoing uncertainty associated with this pandemic, we can reduce its impact on individuals with BPSD with a proactive approach."

This prospective longitudinal study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health and substance use, and by assessing specific positive coping strategies among adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using multi-group autoregressive cross-lagged path models, the present study explored the reciprocal influence of positive coping behaviors on multiple adjustment outcomes including mental health symptoms, substance use, stress, and worry. Participants included 238 adolescents (132 male participants; ages 15-17; 118 with ADHD). Parents provided ratings of adolescent routines, and adolescents provided ratings of coping behaviors and psychological adjustment in spring (May/June), summer (July/August), and fall (October/November) 2020. All models included the effects of adjustment at the prior timepoint as well as relevant covariates including adolescent race, ethnicity, sex, medication status, and family income. Adolescents with ADHD were at greater risk for experiencing increases in mental health symptoms and substance use throughout the pandemic, relative to adolescents without ADHD. The use of positive coping strategies and adolescent routines buffered against increases in substance use and mental health problems for adolescents with ADHD. These findings have important clinical and public policy relevance for parents, schools, and employers who may aim to prioritize keeping schedules as consistent as possible to promote healthy adjustment."

            "abstract": "In this study, we propose a broad conceptual model that incorporates social capital dimensions and problem-solving routines to understand the determinants behind hotel managements' perception of and ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic-and thus, to innovate their service offering. We provide empirical support for the notion that, due to uncertainty about reopening after lockdown, the hospitality sector has found existing problem-solving routines to be of little use. Although the local community has been unable to form a shared vision around the pandemic, hoteliers have nevertheless relied on their network of relationships to sense the crisis and find their own ways to adapt. Interestingly, we find that overreliance on trustworthy relationships can diminish the ability to sense a crisis objectively. Our results not only shed light on sensemaking in the hotel industry, but also grapple with the theoretical nature of sensemaking as a socially constructed process."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain could be a key diagnostic and research tool for understanding the neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19. For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. Here we describe the development of such a protocol, based upon the UK Biobank, and its validation with a travelling heads study. A multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI), and arterial spin labelling (ASL), was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N = 8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (King's College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs), measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest, were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines (S2 File). Components of variance and intra-class correlations (ICCs) were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. Intra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. Considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, although there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonisation of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers. These acquisition and analysis protocols are now in use for MRI assessments of post-COVID patients (N = 700) as part of the ongoing COVID-CNS study."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has universally threatened the building blocks of mental health, well-being, and quality of life, namely, expectations of safety, connectedness, hope, and individual and societal efficacy. Consequently, unprecedently large numbers of individuals are significantly stressed and many are at risk for relapse of mental health problems, exacerbations of existing mental and behavioral health problems, and new onset clinical problems. Because of the scope of the problem, a population-based public health perspective is needed, which in the context of disasters has well-established theories and prevention approaches. Public health approaches to disasters and pandemics focus on preventing subclinical problems from becoming clinical disorders, in comparison to clinical care approaches that focus on treating established disorders. Fortunately, specialty care clinicians who typically think about assessing and treating established disorders have the training and clinical competencies to deliver prevention-focused interventions. This paper is designed to help specialty care clinicians who use cognitive-behavioral strategies to understand the biopsychosocial impacts and resource deficits associated with COVID-19-related stressors and the public health perspective to address them. We also provide ways clinicians can help people who are suffering from significant stress and resource deficits bounce back and regain functioning. We describe psychological first aid, stress management, repeated ecological assessment, writing about stressors, problem-solving, and behavioral activation approaches to assist individuals at risk for enduring stress-linked problems."

In a cross-sectional study, using an online survey, we examined changes in travel behavior and preferences after lifting travel restrictions, and how these changes were influenced by exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 travel-related risk and severity, personality, fear of travel, coping, and self-efficacy appraisals in the Romanian population. Our results showed that participants traveled less in the pandemic year than the year before-especially group and foreign travel-yet more participants reported individual traveling in their home county during the pandemic period. Distinct types of exposure to COVID-19 risk, as well as cognitive and affective factors, were related to travel behavior and preferences. However, fun-seeking personality was the only major predictor of travel intention, while fear of travel was the only predictor of travel avoidance. Instead, people traveled more cautiously when they perceived more risk of infection at the destination, and had higher levels of fear of travel, but also a high sense of efficacy in controlling the infection and problem-solving capacity. The results suggest that specific information about COVID-19, coping mechanisms, fear of travel, and neuropsychological personality traits may affect travel behavior in the pandemic period."

These factors must be taken in consideration when caring for this vulnerable patient population during a pandemic, such as COVID-19. Patients with a rare disease have to take their regular medication continuously to control their condition and frequently, the medications, directly or indirectly, affect their immune system. It is important for this patient population, if infected with COVID-19 or another severe form of infection, to adjust the treatment protocol by specialists, in consultation with their own medical team. Special awareness and educational programs, understandable for mentally retarded patients, must be developed to educate them about social distancing, curfew, sanitization, and sensitization to the disease and quarantine.

Initial obstacles ranged from the need to develop testing platforms to the determination of effective treatments to decrease the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Due to significant scientific breakthroughs, the most recent pressing challenge has been the distribution of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to prevent the spread of the infection across the world. Historically, the U.S. Military has been involved in immunizations delivery to prevent disease among its troops. This experience has led to the establishment of programs designed to distribute safe vaccinations to service members and beneficiaries. It is upon this infrastructure that the Air Force (AF) medical community was thrust to devise and execute COVID-19 vaccine delivery implementation across all military treatment facilities. In the AF, specialty trained allergist and immunologists provide the technical expertise for the establishment and execution of the AF immunizations program. These medical professionals have the proficiency, knowledge, and experience to run efficient mass immunization events in order to provide vaccines in a safe and rapid environment. Despite this, significant challenges attributable to the variable and novel nature of COVID-19 vaccine logistical requirements have led to unanswered questions and debate that needed resolution before and during the launch of this program.

In-hospital prevalent treatments for COVID-19 included repurposed medications (<10%) and adjunctive therapies: systemic corticosteroids (6.8%-7.6%), famotidine (9.0%-28.1%), and antithrombotics such as aspirin (2.0%-21.4%), heparin (2.2%-18.1%), and enoxaparin (2.8%-14.8%). Hospitalization was observed in 0.3% to 1.3% of the cohort diagnosed with COVID-19, with undetectable (n < 5 per database) 30-day fatality. Thirty-day outcomes including pneumonia and hypoxemia were more frequent in COVID-19 than influenza.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite negligible fatality, complications including hospitalization, hypoxemia, and pneumonia were more frequent in children and adolescents with COVID-19 than with influenza. Dyspnea, anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differentiate diagnoses. A wide range of medications was used for the inpatient management of pediatric COVID-19."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has impacted heavily on both Canada's society and its health care system. Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The crosscutting concepts of 'clinical uncertainty' and 'flow of human contacts' are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non-governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first-hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in-depth insights that complement the findings of large-scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat-and-containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem-solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases."

The calls related to pandemic were divided into four categories: medical, psychological, information and the others. The secondary categories of psychological calls were determined by text analysis. The number of calls were calculated weekly and the number of various types of calls over time were analyzed. We used stratified random sampling method to extract 600 cases of all kinds of calls related to pandemic and conducted a semantic analysis, through marking new, similar combination to form a feature set, then summed up the call content characteristics of each stage. Two hundred callers were followed up to understand how they felt about the call process in four aspects: the waiting time, call duration, the degree of problem-solving and the way to end the call.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In a total of 13 746 calls, 8978 were related to pandemic, among which 12.59%(1130/8978) were about medical issues, 26.50%(2379/8978) were about mental health, 27.18%(2440/8978) were about information regarding the pandemic and 33.74%(3029/8978) were about other pandemic related issues. Pandemic situation, relevant policy release, frequency of advertising campaigns were predictors of the number of calls per day during the pandemic (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The number of calls differed by gender and identities of callers (both P<0.05). Finally 181 callers accepted telephone follow-up. Among them, 51.38%(93/181) of the callers thought that the waiting time was too long, 33.15%(60/181) of the callers thought that the call time was insufficient, 80.66%(146/181) of callers believed that the hotline could partially or completely resolve their concerns, and 39.23%(71/181) of the callers said the operator proposed to end the call.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      s The changes of the number and content of the mental health assistance hotline calls reflected that the public mental health status experienced four stages during the pandemic: confusion, panic, boredom, and adjustment.

Accurate implementation is crucial for optimal IPC practice. Despite the wide promotion of IPC and research thereof in the hospital and nursing home setting, similar efforts are lacking in disability care settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess perceived barriers and facilitators to IPC among professionals working at residential care facilities (RCFs) for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), as well as to identify professional-reported recommendations to improve IPC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews (before COVID-19) with twelve professionals from five Dutch RCFs for people with IDD.

Problem-solving skills were needed to continue the level of WOC nursing services expected by patients, families, and professional colleagues, while reducing the hours we were physically present at our clinical facility. In order to respond to these demands, our team realized it must create an innovative approach to provide efficient, cost-effective consultations during this global crisis. This Challenges in Practice article summarizes our experience with use of telemedicine technologies to perform remote consultations within the acute care setting.\n    \n\n\n          Cases:\n        \n      \n      Case 1 was a 52-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia.

Governing boards, administrators, and governments made decisions including eliminating faculty and staff, and programs yet these decisions were rarely inclusive of university stakeholders or innovative. This study's purpose is to examine and compare viewpoints of stakeholders in relation to addressing the financial impact of the pandemic in hopes of capturing innovative and effective pathways for universities. Because the purpose involved describing and comparing these viewpoints, the researcher selected a unique mixed method, Q methodology [Q] for this study. In Q, participants sort statements related to the topic into a grid such that their Q-sort provides a snapshot of their subjectivity. Participants' sorts are grouped empirically into factors, each representing unique viewpoints. Three distinct viewpoints emerged: 1) Focus on teaching mission and students, 2) University as a business, and 3) University as community. Views 1 and 3 were dominated by university faculty while View 2 was dominated by non-faculty including administrators and staff. Q's determination of distinguishing statements within each view provides the ability to compare these views' uniqueness. The three views and consensus among the views represent rejection of decisions to lay off faculty or close programs, among others, in order to balance university finances. The importance of tenured faculty in relationship to shared governance and academic freedom is especially stressed by two of the viewpoints.

Methods: In this mixed-method design study, an online survey collected information on parental stress levels before and during COVID-19, sources of stress, and coping strategies using open-ended questions. Qualitative answers were categorized thematically. Multiple linear regression models were built for the association between changes in stress levels (during-before COVID-19) and sources of stress for parents of children of both groups. Results: Answers of 1,827 parents were analyzed; of these, 186 (9.75%) had children with diagnosed problems.

In general, the female immune system responds more efficiently to pathogens. However, this can lead to over-reactive immune responses, which may explain the higher presence of autoimmune diseases in women, but also potentially the more adverse effects of vaccination in females compared with in males. Many clinical and epidemiological studies reported, for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a gender-biased differential response; however, the majority of reports dealt with a comparable morbidity, with males, however, showing higher COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Although gender differences in immune responses have been studied predominantly within the context of sex hormone effects, some other mechanisms have been invoked: cellular mosaicism, skewed X chromosome inactivation, genes escaping X chromosome inactivation, and miRNAs encoded on the X chromosome. The hormonal hypothesis as well as other mechanisms will be examined and discussed in the light of the most recent epigenetic findings in the field, as the concept that epigenetics is the unifying mechanism in explaining gender-specific differences is increasingly emerging."

It encodes the mammalian Diaphanous-related formin (mDia1) protein, which acts downstream of Rho GTPases to promote F-actin polymerization and stabilize microtubules. During mitosis, this protein is expressed in human neuronal precursor cells and considerably affects spindle formation and cell division. In humans, dominant gain-of-function DIAPH1 variants cause sensorineural deafness and macrothrombocytopenia (DFNA1), while homozygous DIAPH1 loss leads to seizures, cortical blindness, and microcephaly syndrome (SCBMS).

Survey studies provide unique opportunities for research during this pandemic, while there are no existing systematic reviews in this setting. The objective was to summarize existing survey studies addressing the effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this systematic review, we performed an electronic search in multiple databases from December 2019 to December 2020. The quality appraisal of the included studies was performed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Because of the high methodological heterogeneity between studies, a narrative synthesis of the qualitative data was used.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 35 survey studies with 65,508 participants, ranging from 4 to 19 years of age, are included in this review. Anxiety (28%), depression (23%), loneliness (5%), stress (5%), fear (5%), tension (3%), anger (3%), fatigue (3%), confusion (3%), and worry (3%) were the most common mental health issues reported. Children and adolescents with psychiatric and/or developmental disorders, such as severe obesity, chronic lung disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cystic fibrosis, and obsessive-compulsive disorders, were especially vulnerable to the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, gender, psychological quality, and negative coping strategies were identified as risk factors for the development of mental health problems. Social and family support, along with a positive coping style, was associated with better outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents is multifaceted and substantial. Survey studies regarding child and adolescent mental health amid COVID-19 indicated that anxiety, depression, loneliness, stress, and tension are the most observed symptoms. Positive coping strategies with family and social support may be important to achieving better outcomes. Due to limited available evidence, more well-designed studies in this area are urgently needed."

All clinical notes were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C, and clinical notes and electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, prior exposure to or testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, laboratory data, imaging, treatment modalities and response to treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      111 patients were identified, with 74 classified as mild COVID-19, 8 patients as moderate COVID-19, 8 patients as severe COVID-19, 10 as mild MIS-C and 11 as severe MIS-C. All groups had a male predominance, with Black and Hispanic patients overrepresented as compared to the demographics of Alabama. Most MIS-C patients were healthy at baseline, with most COVID-19 patients having at least one underlying illness. Fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant in the MIS-C population whereas COVID-19 patients presented with predominantly respiratory symptoms. The two groups were similar in duration of symptomatic prodrome and exposure history to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but MIS-C patients had a longer duration between presentation and exposure history. COVID-19 patients were more likely to have a positive SAR-CoV-2 PCR and to require respiratory support on admission. MIS-C patients had lower sodium levels, higher levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, d-dimer and procalcitonin. COVID-19 patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission. MIS-C patients had coronary artery changes on echocardiography more often than COVID-19 patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      This study is one of the first to directly compare COVID-19 and MIS-C in the pediatric population.

In a two-wave study completed early (March) and later (December) in the pandemic, we found that polarization was greater in the United States (N = 1,339) than in Canada (N = 644) and the United Kingdom. (N = 1,283). Political conservatism in the United States was strongly associated with engaging in weaker mitigation behaviors, lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, greater misperceptions, and stronger vaccination hesitancy. Although there was some evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization in the United States in December (but not March), cognitive sophistication was nonetheless consistently negatively correlated with misperceptions and vaccination hesitancy across time, countries, and party lines. Furthermore, COVID-19 skepticism in the United States was strongly correlated with distrust in liberal-leaning mainstream news outlets and trust in conservative-leaning news outlets, suggesting that polarization may be driven by differences in information environments."

            "abstract": "This study examined the general public's perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities as well how these perceptions relate to people's level of familiarity and contact quality with these groups. A cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of the Dutch population (n = 1458 and n = 1761, comprising questions related to the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities, respectively). The general public was found to be generally aware of the deleterious impact of the pandemic upon the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities. Specifically, the respondents reported that both groups' quality of life, physical and mental health, and quality and frequency of social contact was lower than it was prior to COVID-19, in addition to perceiving them as lonelier and less self-reliant. Notably, the impact on the elderly was considered to be greater than that on people with intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, those who had no familiarity with people with intellectual disabilities in real life perceived the impact to be lower than those who had a greater degree of familiarity. These findings have important implications, both for increasing awareness of the pandemic's negative impact on these vulnerable groups and in terms of sufficiently addressing their specific needs and concerns. The findings also underscore that, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to increase the visibility of groups who already relied more on help and support from others in society prior to the pandemic, such as the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities, via, among other things, self-advocacy, education, and enhanced intergroup contact, in order to be able to sufficiently address their needs during these challenging times."

The study involved 106 primary school children, randomly assigned to the traditional indoor (TI) intervention or to the experimental outdoor (EO) intervention.

Children's anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and abdominal circumference), fitness parameter (VO2peak), health parameters (resting heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure), gross motor coordination, and physical activity level were assessed before and after intervention. Both groups significantly improved fitness and motor coordination but worsened some anthropometric parameters (weight, abdominal circumference) after the intervention period. The EO group showed a higher increase of gross motor coordination than the TI group. Results of this study demonstrated that children benefited from a well-structured PE intervention conducted in the natural environment of the beach improving physical fitness and gross motor coordination. Therefore, planning outdoor PE interventions could be an alternative and safe way to encourage and implement physical activity at school during the particular period of COVID-19 pandemic."

No reports encompass any conclusive confirmation of vertical transmission. Nevertheless, cases of fetal distress and multiple organ failure have been reported, as well as rare cases of fetal demise. While clinicians and scientists continue to seek proof of vertical transmission, they miss the greater point, namely the cause of preterm delivery. In this review, we suggest that the cause might not be due to the viral infection but the fetal exposure to maternal inflammation or cytokine storm that translates into a complication of COVID-19. This statement is extrapolated from previous experience with infections and inflammation which were reported to be fatal by increasing the risk of preterm delivery and causing abnormal neonatal brain development and resulting in neurological disorders like atypical behavioral phenotype or autistic syndrome. Given the potentially fatal consequences on neonate health, we highlight the urgent need for an animal model to study vertical transmission. The preclinical model will allow us to make the link between SARS-COV-2 infection, inflammation and long-term follow-up of child brain development."

Patients and all health professionals have been forced to isolate and become innovative to continue receiving and providing exceptional healthcare services while minimizing the risk of exposure to, or transmission of, COVID-19.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      This document is proposed initially as a guide to the extraordinary implementation of telepsychology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to extend its implementation to use fundamentally as the main guideline for telepsychology services in Saudi Arabia and other Arabic communities.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A professional task force representing different areas of professional psychology reviewed, summarized, and documented methods, policies, procedures, and other resources to ensure that the recommendations and evidence reviews were valid and consistent with best practices.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The practice of telepsychology involves the consideration of legal and professional requirements. This paper provides a guideline and recommendations for procedural changes that are necessary to address psychological services as we transition to telepsychology, as well as elucidates and demonstrates practical telepsychology frameworks, procedures, and proper recommendations for the provision of services during COVID-19. It adds a focused examination and discussion related to factors that could influence the telemedicine guideline, such as culture, religion, legal matters, and how clinical psychologists could expand their telepsychology practice during COVID-19 and after, seeking to produce broadly applicable guidelines for the practice of telepsychology. Professional steps in practical telemedicine were illustrated in tables and examples.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Telepsychology is not a luxury or a temporary response. Rather, it should be considered part of a proactive governance model to secure a continuity of mental health care services.

While there are no practice guidelines specific to AYA telemedicine, observations made during this implementation can highlight challenges encountered and suggest solutions to some of these challenges.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Over the course of several weeks in March, 2020, the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Clinic at the University of California San Francisco rapidly replaced most in-person visits with telemedicine visits. This required logistical problem-solving, collaboration of all clinic staff members, and continuous reassessment of clinical practices. This article describes observations made during these processes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Telemedicine visits increased from zero to 97% of patient encounters in one month. The number of visits per month was comparable with that one year prior. While there were limitations to the clinic's ability to carry out health supervision visits, many general health, mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction treatment services were implemented via telemedicine. Providers identified creative solutions for challenges that arose to managing general confidentiality issues as well as specific challenges related to mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction care. Opportunities to implement and expand high-quality AYA telemedicine were also identified.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to widespread telemedicine implementation. While telemedicine seems to be feasible and acceptable for our clinic patients, unanswered questions remain regarding confidentiality, quality of care, and health disparities.

            "abstract": "The outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution."

            "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to trisomy for all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (β-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging."

Analysis of literature and patent databases determined sectors of accelerated innovation to include manufacturing, personal protective equipment and digital technologies. The ability of flexible and advanced manufacturing technologies to provide more adaptable production capabilities that are less susceptible to disruption, make it likely that these technologies will be incorporated further, changing the way many manufacturing firms operate. Collaboration has increased, demonstrating increases in problem-solving efficiency; however, concerns around intellectual property is likely to reduce the long-term impact of these procedural changes. Advancements in personal protective equipment and disinfection technologies may have the long-term impact of reducing waste production and triggering changes in cleaning protocols throughout society.

While women in undergraduate agricultural programs outperformed men academically prior to and during the pandemic, the achievement may have come at personal cost, especially for those women with fewer personal and environmental resiliency resources. Our research objective was to expand on personal, social, and environmental factors linked with lower mental health and life satisfaction scores for students in agriculture during the pandemic. We measured the influence of such factors across gender-based mental health and life satisfaction outcomes. Our data were collected from 2030 students using an on-line survey across six land-grant university college of agriculture in agriculturally as many distinct regions of the United States. We estimated OLS and Ordered Probit models of their mental health and life satisfaction self-assessments. Our findings reveal students' mental health and life satisfaction were reduced due to a paucity of personal (e.g., less future orientation or graduate school aspirations, food and housing insecurity, and personal health risks) and environmental (e.g., lower quality on-line learning experiences, isolation, family health risk, discrimination experiences) resiliency resources. Our results suggest women were more likely than men to be adversely affected by reduced resiliency resources. These findings suggest university emergency response policies need to address students' needs for housing and food security, on-line course development and delivery, tele health and mental health resources, broad social inclusion and diversity to decrease risk of female attrition and support all students in agricultural degree programs."

Children and young people with pre-existing mental health difficulties may be prone to loneliness. Containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation, with unprecedented school closures and restrictions imposed on social interactions.

A second neurodevelopmental assessment was performed after 9 months ± 2 weeks of cardiac surgery. Follow-up DASII was conducted through interactive video conferencing in 23 of 60 patients due to COVID-19 pandemic. The univentricular and biventricular repair groups were compared in terms of their neurodevelopmental outcomes. Perioperative factors were compared between neurodevelopmental \"delay\" and \"no delay\" groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 89 children enrolled, preoperative motor and mental delay were present in 29 and 24 children, respectively. Follow-up DASII could be performed in 60 children. At follow-up, motor delay was present in seven and mental delay in four children. Overall, there was a significant improvement in both motor and mental developmental quotient at follow-up. There was no significant difference in either motor or mental domains between univentricular and biventricular groups. Among the perioperative variables, only the postoperative length of stay in intensive care unit was significantly different between neurodevelopmental \"delay\" and \"no delay\" groups (P = 0.04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Neurodevelopmental delay occurred substantially among unoperated children with cyanotic CHD.

This group discussed challenges to clinical care and collaboratively problem-solvedsolutions.Results: Three primary challenges to usual care were identified, these include difficulty providing 1) neurobehavioral and cognitive assessments; 2) psychoeducation for caregivers and rapport building; and 3) return to academic instruction and home. Solutions during the pandemic for the first two areas focus on the varying service provision models that include 1) face-to-face care with personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing and 2) provision of care via remote methods, with a focus on telehealth. During the pandemic,neuropsychologists generally combine components of both the face-to-face and remote care models. Solutions to the final challenge focus on issues specific to returning to academic instruction and home after an inpatient stay.Conclusions: By considering components of in-person and telehealth models of patient care during the pandemic, neuropsychologists successfully serve patients within the rehabilitation setting, as well as the patient's family who may be limited in their ability to be physically present due to childcare, illness, work-related demands, or hospital restrictions."

Convenience sampled online survey was conducted between April and June 2020 from 9130 citizens in 21 countries. Illness perceptions toward COVID-19, psychological flexibility, prosociality, coping and mental health, socio-demographics, lockdown-related variables and COVID-19 status were assessed. Results showed that psychological flexibility was the only significant mediator in the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health across all regions (all ps = 0.001-0.021). Seeking social support was the significant mediator across subgroups (all ps range = <0.001-0.005) except from the Hong Kong sample (p = 0.06) and the North and South American sample (p = 0.53). No mediation was found for problem-solving (except from the Northern European sample, p = 0.009). Prosociality was the significant mediator in the Hong Kong sample (p = 0.016) and the Eastern European sample (p = 0.008). These findings indicate that fostering psychological flexibility may help to mitigate the adverse mental impacts of COVID-19 across regions. Roles of seeking social support, problem-solving and prosociality vary across regions."

In the early stages of the epidemic, healthcare professionals have been in the front-line to manage the infection. The current study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals and to detect some risk and protective factors of their distress levels, with regard to socio-demographic variables, direct exposure to COVID-19 and the coping strategies used to deal with stress. The data were collected during the peak of the infection. A total of 595 healthcare professionals enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographical and professional data, perceived stress (PSS) and coping strategies (COPE- NVI-25). Overall, we found that a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while female gender, seeking social support, avoidance strategies and working with COVID-19 patients were risk factors. Economic status, problem solving ability and turning to religion were not associated with stress levels. This study, one of the first on this topic, highlighted the main coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the pandemic."

Enforced national lockdown led to people being unable to access essential services in addition to limiting contact with social support networks. The novel coronavirus, and subsequent condition known as long covid were not well-understood and clinicians were not supported by existing guidelines or pathways. Our study explored people's experiences of healthcare during this period with a person-centered \"lens.\" Methods: Ninety-seven people participated in our online survey about their experiences of the pandemic, particularly while socially isolated and their experiences of healthcare. Following completion of the survey, 11 of these participants agreed to further semi-structured interviews to explore this further in their own words. Interview conversations were transcribed, checked; together with the responses to open questions in the survey. The data were then analyzed thematically by members of the research team. We conducted framework analysis from a post-positivist perspective, using the Person-centered Practice Framework to explore participants' experiences. Results: There were few examples of people describing person-centered care. People experienced barriers to accessing support, and negative experiences of care that represented complexities enacting person-centered care at each level of the framework (processes, practice environment, prerequisites, and macro context). These barriers were influenced greatly by the pandemic, for example, with health professionals being harder to access. Some experiences related to the ways in which health professionals responded to the context, for example, positive examples included active listening, recognition of people's experiences, seeking to find out more, and engaging in collaborative problem-solving. Discussion: People want to feel heard, supported to navigate healthcare systems, source trustworthy information, find appropriate services, and collaborate in learning and problem-solving with healthcare professionals. There have been enormous challenges to the provision of healthcare throughout the pandemic. Moving forward is crucial with emphasis on overcoming barriers to person-centered healthcare. This should focus on steps now and also in planning for the possibility of further rapid changes in the demand for and provision of healthcare."

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid uptake of telehealth to continue care delivery that was facilitated by \"temporary\" policy changes related to the pandemic. As a result, the field of DBP has recognized telehealth as a potential model of care for performing home-based diagnostic assessments, providing medication management follow-up, and delivering therapeutic interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Telehealth has been helpful in mitigating barriers families often face when attending in-person visits (lack of transportation and child care, missed work hours, etc) but has also highlighted additional determinants of health that need to be addressed to provide equitable access to care (broadband connectivity, device access, digital literacy, access to interpretation and sign language services, etc). Anticipating the lifting of pandemic-related emergency declaration and expiration of temporary policies around telehealth, the ability to continue to deliver DBP care by telehealth is uncertain. The purpose of this policy statement is to advocate for legislation and policies that support ongoing, equitable, home-based telehealth care for patients seen by DBP providers while ensuring equitable access to DBP in general. In addition, there is a need to recognize the benefits and challenges of telehealth versus in-person care and to identify clinical scenarios that favor 1 model of care versus the other."

            "abstract": "Students' academic engagement depends on a variety of factors that are related to personal learner characteristics, the teacher, the teaching methodology, peers, and other features in the learning environment. Components that influence academic engagement can be cognitive, metacognitive, affective, social, task-related, communicative, and foreign language-related. Rather than existing in isolated spheres, the factors contributing to an individual's academic engagement intertwine and overlap. The relationships students cultivate with others are prominent in several of these areas. Positive interpersonal relationships enhance individuals' enthusiasm for learning (Mercer and Dörnyei, 2020), which benefits sustainable learning success and self-confidence. The relationships between students and teachers and the perceptions students have of their teachers seem to be particularly influential on students' engagement in academic undertakings. Problem-based learning (PBL), a teaching approach particularly suitable for tertiary education, involves students in authentic problem-solving processes and fosters students' self-regulation and teamwork. Intensive relationship-building is one of the key characteristics of this student-centered approach (Amerstorfer, 2020). The study reported in this article explores the connection between the academic engagement of 34 students and their perceptions of three instructors in a teacher education program for pre-service English teachers in Austria. An online questionnaire was used to investigate the participants' perceived academic engagement (effort, dedication, learning success) in a university course that implements PBL as its underlying teaching methodology in comparison to conventional teaching approaches. The study further examines how the students perceived the course instructors' caring, credibility, communication style, and feedback, which leads to new information about how PBL shapes student-teacher relationships. Due to Covid-19, the otherwise face-to-face course was taught online."

It then spread with enormous rapidity and by mid-March 2020 was declared a world pandemic. Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and \"non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms\" can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not. It is fair to say that having read the current medical and lay press we conclude that it is not easy to reassure our patients with absolute certainty.

The Lancet Commission on pollution and health concludes that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of global disease and premature death. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that links air pollution not only to adverse cardiorespiratory effects but also to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting recent evidence showing that exposure to multiple air pollutants, in particular to fine particles, may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and brain health, thereby contributing to increased risk of stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental disorders, depression and other related conditions. The underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests inflammation and oxidative stress to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of air pollution-induced disorders, driven by the enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to exposure to various air pollutants. From a public health perspective, mitigation measures are urgent to reduce the burden of disease and premature mortality from ambient air pollution."

Communities across the globe have experienced significant infection rates and widespread psychosocial stress and trauma, leading to calls for increased allocation of resources for mental health screening and treatment. In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades. We discuss the current understanding of the possible neurotropism and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and relate this to the history of viral pandemics to better understand the relationship of viral infection, aberrant immune response and neurodevelopment, and the risk for schizophrenia disorder."

We find that HBP Forum utilization is comparable to that of a leading general-interest coding platform, and that online usage metrics quickly recovered after an initial Covid-19-related dip. Regression results show that user interactions on the Forum are more active for questions on programming and in HBP core areas. Further, Cox proportional hazard analyses show that such problems are solved faster. Forum posts with users from different countries tend to be discussed more actively but solved slower. Higher shares of administrator support tend to solve problems faster. There are no clear patterns regarding gender and seniority.

The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 16 in the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition short-form (CVLT-II-sf) total free recall score, assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, participants who completed 16 weeks of treatment and had neuropsychological assessments at T1 and T2). Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from the per-protocol population. Safety and tolerability were monitored and analysed in all participants who started treatment. Steady-state concentrations in plasma of memantine were measured at the end of the trial. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02304302.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      From May 13, 2015, to July 22, 2020, 185 participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79). All participants received their allocated treatment. Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from 149 (81%) participants, 73 in the memantine group and 76 in the placebo group, after 11 people (eight in the memantine group and three in the placebo group) discontinued due to COVID-19 restrictions, illness of their caregiver, adverse events, or low compliance. The primary outcome measure did not differ between groups (CVLT-II-sf total free recall score, change from baseline 0·34 points [95% CI -0·98 to 1·67], p=0·61). Memantine was well tolerated, with infrequent mild-to-moderate adverse events, the most common being viral upper respiratory infection (nine [11%] participants in the memantine group and 12 [15%] in the placebo group) and transient dizziness (eight [10%] in the memantine group and six [8%] in the placebo group). No serious adverse events were observed. Amounts of memantine in plasma were substantially lower than those considered therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Memantine was well tolerated, but cognition-enhancing effects were not recorded with a 20 mg/day dose in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Exploratory analyses point to a need for future work.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Alana Foundation.\n    \n\n\n          Translation:\n        \n      \n      For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section."

We aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children with DS. Using data from an international survey obtained from a range of countries and control data from the United States, we compared the prevalence of symptoms and medical complications and risk factors for severe outcomes between DS and non-DS paediatric populations with COVID-19. Hospitalised COVID-19 patients <18 years with DS had a higher incidence of respiratory symptoms, fever, and several medical complications from COVID-19 than control patients without DS <18 years. Older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalisation among paediatric COVID-19 patients with DS, and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality rates were low in all paediatric COVID-19 patients (with and without DS), contrasting with previous findings in adults with DS (who exhibit higher mortality than those without DS). Children with DS are at increased risk for more severe presentations of COVID-19. Efforts should be made to ensure the comprehensive and early detection of COVID-19 in this population and to identify children with DS who present comorbidities that pose a risk for a severe course of COVID-19. Our results emphasize the importance of vaccinating children with DS as soon as they become eligible."

The objective of the study was to leverage the institution's telemedicine infrastructure to support international clinical child outcome research. In a prospective cohort study of child neurodevelopment (NCT04398901), we used synchronous telemedicine to remotely train a research team and perform live observational assessments of children in Sabanalarga, Colombia. An observational motor and conceptional standardized tool kit was mailed to Colombia; other materials were translated and emailed; team training was done virtually. Children were recruited by team on the ground. Synchronous activities were video-recorded directly to two laptops, each with a telehealth Zoom link to allow simultaneous evaluation of \"table\" and \"standing\" activities, and backup recordings were captured directly on the device in Colombia. The U.S. team attended live over Zoom from four states and five distinct locations, made observational notes, and provided real-time feedback. Fifty-seven, 3-4-year-old children with Zika-virus exposure and 70 non-exposed controls were studied during 10 daytrips. Direct laptop recording ensured complete record of child activities due to internet outages. Telemedicine can be used to successfully perform international neurodevelopmental outcome research in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can benefit global health studies."

            "abstract": "President Trump reacted to a reporter's query about the coronavirus outbreak by stating that the reporter was a \"lousy journalist\", underscoring the importance of perspective-taking in social exchanges. Egocentrism is the belief that others share the same perspective as your own and hampers the perspective-taking of another naive person. An issue is whether it is seen in hindsight bias where we overestimate what we knew beforehand. Via a foreseeability-inevitability platform, participants were randomly assigned to make self-judgments for problem-solving from a foresight (no answers) or three hindsight (answers) conditions. In two hindsight conditions, participants were asked to ignore or not to ignore the answers. In the last condition, participants predicted for an unfamiliar peer asked to ignore the answers. Next, all participants made judgments again from the perspective of the peer. Predominately in hindsight, participants showed significant changes responding but with an appropriate baseline comparison showed essentially the same hindsight bias in judgments for themselves and the peer. Ignoring or not ignoring the answers produced the same outcome. This sharing of perspective-taking dovetails with individuals' believing their hindsight knowledge is commonly present among others. Although participants in hindsight believed their foreseeable predictions for the peer were more accurate or realistic, it was more challenging to predict for the peer than themselves. Implications for individuals' judgments about Donald Trump 's decision-making for COVID-19 are discussed. Researchers should examine perspective-taking in hindsight bias as everyday social interaction involves reasoning about others."

Regular exposure to such stressful news may elicit different emotions in people and engage them in using strategies to control their emotions. In the present study, we aimed at exploring the most common negative emotion(s) experienced by individuals, as well as the most frequent Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies used facing the COVID-19-related news. We also examined whether the variable of personal relevance can moderate these emotional responses.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      617 individuals living in Tehran who regularly read the news about the COVID-19 from the early stages of spread completed an online survey.

This tutorial reviews (a) what has been reported about neurological insults in cases of COVID-19 infection, (b) what is known from similar conditions in other disorders, and (c) how that combined information can inform clinical decision making. Method PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections, cognitive impairment observed following critical care, and disorders for which intermittent or chronic hypoxia is characteristic. These were combined with searches relating to cognition, brain, and communication. All searches were conducted between April 8 and May 23, 2020. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials addressing other critical illnesses were also included to extend findings to potential cognitive communication outcomes following COVID-19. Results COVID-19 infection results in a combination of (a) respiratory infection with mechanical ventilation secondary to inadequate oxygenation, (b) inflammatory system reactivity, and (c) increased blood clotting factors. These affect central nervous system function incurring long-term cognitive communication impairment in a proportion of survivors. Diagnostic and intervention approaches for such impairments are discussed. Conclusions The existing literature on cognitive sequela of COVID-19 infection is small to date, but much can be learned from similar viral infections and disorders. Although COVID-19 is novel, the speech-language pathology approaches to evaluation and intervention of other populations of critical care patients are applicable. However, speech-language pathologists have not routinely been involved in these patients' acute care. As such, this is a call to action to speech-language pathologists to address the unprecedented numbers of patients who will need their services early in the disease process and throughout recovery."

We conducted an international survey (n = 3646) examining the degree to which people's appraisals and coping activities around the pandemic predicted their health and well-being. We obtained subsamples from 12 countries-Bangladesh, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Turkey and the United States. For each, we assessed appraisals and coping strategies as well as indicators of physical and mental health and well-being. Results indicated that, despite mean-level societal differences in outcomes, the pattern of appraisals and coping strategies predicting health and well-being was consistent across countries. Use of disengagement coping (particularly behavioural disengagement and self-isolation) was associated with relatively negative outcomes. In contrast, optimistic appraisals (particularly of high accommodation-focused coping potential and the ability to meet one's physical needs), use of problem-focused coping strategies (especially problem-solving) and accommodative coping strategies (especially positive reappraisal and self-encouragement) were associated with relatively positive outcomes. Our study highlights the critical importance of considering accommodative coping in stress and coping research. It also provides important information on how people have been dealing with the pandemic, the predictors of well-being under pandemic conditions and the generality of such relations."

One area that is severely affected is ear, nose and throat (ENT)/laryngology where speech and language therapists (SLTs) engage in a diverse range of practice with patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems, and head and neck cancers (HNCs). A large majority of these patients are in high-risk categories, and many specialized clinical practices are vulnerable. In addition, workforce and research issues are challenged in both the immediate context and the future.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      To discuss the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for SLTs in ENT/laryngology with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership.\n    \n\n\n          Methods & procedures:\n        \n      \n      The relevant sections of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health systems building blocks framework (2007) were used to structure the study. Expert agreement was determined by an iterative process of multiple-group discussions, the use of all recent relevant policy documentation, and other literature and shared documentation/writing. The final paper was verified and agreed by all authors.\n    \n\n\n          Main contribution:\n        \n      \n      The main threats to ENT/laryngology SLT clinical services include increased patient complexity related to COVID-19 voice and airway problems, delayed HNC diagnosis, reduced access to instrumental procedures and inequitable care provision. The main clinical opportunities include the potential for new modes of service delivery and collaborations, and harnessing SLT expertise in non-instrumental assessment. There are several workforce issues, including redeployment (and impact on current services), training implications and psychological impact on staff. Workforce opportunities exist for service innovation and potential extended ENT/SLT practice roles. Research is threatened by a reduction in immediate funding calls and high competition. Current research is affected by very limited access to participants and the ability to conduct face-to-face and instrumental assessments. However, research opportunities may result in greater collaboration, and changes in service delivery necessitate robust investigation and evaluation. A new national set of research priorities is likely to emerge.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions & implications:\n        \n      \n      The immediate impact of the pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. It is unclear when any of these areas will resume operations and whether permanent changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities will follow. However, significant opportunity exists in the post-COVID era to re-evaluate current practice, embrace opportunities and evaluate new ways of working. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject ENT/laryngology SLTs manage patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems and HNCs. The diverse scope of clinical practice involves highly specialized assessment and treatment practices in patients in high-risk categories. A large majority of active research projects in this field are patient focused and involve instrumental assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has created both opportunities and threats for ENT SLT clinical services, workforce and research. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides a discussion of the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for ENT/laryngology SLT with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. Changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities are of indeterminant duration at this time, and some components could be permanent. Significant clinical practice, workforce and research opportunities may exist in the post-COVID era."

            "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic reveals a major gap in global biosecurity infrastructure: a lack of publicly available biological samples representative across space, time, and taxonomic diversity. The shortfall, in this case for vertebrates, prevents accurate and rapid identification and monitoring of emerging pathogens and their reservoir host(s) and precludes extended investigation of ecological, evolutionary, and environmental associations that lead to human infection or spillover. Natural history museum biorepositories form the backbone of a critically needed, decentralized, global network for zoonotic pathogen surveillance, yet this infrastructure remains marginally developed, underutilized, underfunded, and disconnected from public health initiatives. Proactive detection and mitigation for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) requires expanded biodiversity infrastructure and training (particularly in biodiverse and lower income countries) and new communication pipelines that connect biorepositories and biomedical communities. To this end, we highlight a novel adaptation of Project ECHO's virtual community of practice model: Museums and Emerging Pathogens in the Americas (MEPA). MEPA is a virtual network aimed at fostering communication, coordination, and collaborative problem-solving among pathogen researchers, public health officials, and biorepositories in the Americas. MEPA now acts as a model of effective international, interdisciplinary collaboration that can and should be replicated in other biodiversity hotspots. We encourage deposition of wildlife specimens and associated data with public biorepositories, regardless of original collection purpose, and urge biorepositories to embrace new specimen sources, types, and uses to maximize strategic growth and utility for EID research. Taxonomically, geographically, and temporally deep biorepository archives serve as the foundation of a proactive and increasingly predictive approach to zoonotic spillover, risk assessment, and threat mitigation."

In this paper, we focus on the experiences of families with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) through analysis of two data sets: the emerging research literature and contributions from our author team who have lived experience of intellectual and developmental disability in the context of COVID-19. From these two data sets, we discern five themes of the impact of the pandemic: on health, on education, on services and supports, on families and finally on relationships beyond the family. We conclude with lessons from those living with intellectual and developmental disabilities, the carers and the individuals themselves to draw implications for supporting families in the context of disability during future pandemics."

            "abstract": "A growing body of knowledge highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of many people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) and their caregivers. The underlying reasons are not only due to biomedical factors but also ethical issues. They stem from longstanding and pervasive structural injustices and negative social attitudes that continue to devalue people with IDD and that underlie certain clinical decisions and frameworks for public-health policies during this pandemic. Unless these fundamental ethical shortcomings are addressed, pandemic responses will continue to undermine the human rights and well-being of people with IDD. This paper proposes an ethics framing for policy and practices regarding clinical care and public health based on Martha Nussbaum's approach to Capability Theory. Such a framework can reorient healthcare professionals and healthcare systems to support the capabilities of people with IDD to protect, recover, and promote health and well-being. It could be applied during this pandemic and in planning for future pandemics. The paper presents some practical recommendations that follow from applying this framework."

The most common symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are cough and fever, but severe cases can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human tissue is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and the lungs, heart, and kidneys are the most affected organs. Besides the inflammatory process and tissue damage, the presence of a cytokine \"storm\" has been related to a higher mortality rate. Other infectious viral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and influenza, were associated with complications in pregnant women, such as growth restriction, malformation, preterm birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, and death, although they can also cause developmental disorders in infants and adolescents. Evidence points out that stressors during pregnancy and infancy may lead to the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we hypothesize that COVID-19 infection during the critical phases of development can program the individual to chronic diseases in adulthood.

Understanding what motivates physicians will help physician leaders to develop and sustain effective teams. Reinvigorating the surgical workforce around themes of meaning and joy in the service rendered via our surgical skills may diminish Burnout through generative and aspirational strategies, as opposed to merely reactive ones.

Owing to the onset of the pandemic, subsequent visits were completed through telehealth with a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, behavioral clinician, and social workers who developed a collaborative plan of care. Billy was diagnosed with global developmental delay, significant tantrums, and impulsivity but did not meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder.Billy lives with his parents and 2 sisters in a rural area, 3 hours from the DBP clinic.

            "abstract": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus and causes neurological dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS), but the neuropathological mechanism of PHEV remains poorly understood. We report that Unc51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1/Unc51.1) is a pivotal regulator of PHEV-induced neurological disorders and functions to selectively control the initiation of nerve growth factor (NGF)/TrkA endosome trafficking. We first identified the function of Ulk1 by histopathologic evaluation in a PHEV-infected mouse model in which neuronal loss was accompanied by the suppression of Ulk1 expression. Morphogenesis assessments in the primary cortical neurons revealed that overexpression or mutations of Ulk1 modulated neurite outgrowth, collateral sprouting, and endosomal transport. Likewise, Ulk1 expression was decreased following PHEV infection, suggesting that there was a correlation between the neurodegeneration and functional Ulk1 deficiency. We then showed that Ulk1 forms a multiprotein complex with TrkA and the early endosome marker Rab5 and that Ulk1 defects lead to either blocking of NGF/TrkA endocytosis or premature degradation of pTrkA via constitutive activation of the Rab5 GTPase. Further investigation determined that the ectopic expression of Rab5 mutants induces aberrant endosomal accumulation of activated pTrkA, proving that targeting of Ulk1-TrkA-NGF signaling to the retrograde transport route in the neurodegenerative process that underlies PHEV infection is dependent on Rab5 GTPase activity. Therefore, we described a long-distance signaling mechanism of PHEV-driven deficits in neurons and suggested that such Ulk1 repression may result in limited NGF/TrkA retrograde signaling within activated Rab5 endosomes, explaining the progressive failure of neurite outgrowth and survival.IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a neurotropic coronavirus and targets neurons in the nervous system for proliferation, frequently leaving behind grievous neurodegeneration. Structural plasticity disorders occur in the axons, dendrites, and dendritic spines of PHEV-infected neurons, and dysfunction of this neural process may contribute to neurologic pathologies, but the mechanisms remain undetermined. Further understanding of the neurological manifestations underlying PHEV infection in the CNS may provide insights into both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases that may be conducive to targeted approaches for treatment. The significance of our research is in identifying an Ulk1-related neurodegenerative mechanism, focusing on the regulatory functions of Ulk1 in the transport of long-distance trophic signaling endosomes, thereby explaining the progressive failure of neurite outgrowth and survival associated with PHEV aggression. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from endocytic pathways and the neuropathogenesis of PHEV-induced CNS disease."

Risks also mount as a decades-long demographic shift plays out, with individuals and families relocating from urban centers to more sparsely populated, vegetated areas on the margins of cities and towns-a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As some insurance carriers cease underwriting homeowners insurance in wildfire-prone areas, property owners can be expected to shoulder more costs for home hardening. The equity implications of who pays to fireproof homes and neighborhoods will intensify as wildfire risks multiply in areas beyond the comparatively wealthier wildland-urban interfaces (WUI) of the Pacific coastal states. Systems of polycentric governance, consisting of problem-solving actors who collaborate across jurisdictional and geographical boundaries, can help make wildfire mitigation more equitable. Polycentric governance institutions already help communities adapt to destructive wildfire in the United States.

            "abstract": "Intragravidic and perinatal infections, acting through either direct viral effect or immune-mediated responses, are recognized causes of liability for neurodevelopmental disorders in the progeny. The large amounts of epidemiological data and the wealth of information deriving from animal models of gestational infections have contributed to delineate, in the last years, possible underpinning mechanisms for this phenomenon, including defects in neuronal migration, impaired spine and synaptic development, and altered activation of microglia. Recently, dysfunctions of the neurovascular unit and anomalies of the brain vasculature have unexpectedly emerged as potential causes at the origin of behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders consequent to prenatal and perinatal infections. This review aims to discuss the up-to-date literature evidence pointing to the neurovascular unit and brain vasculature damages as the etiological mechanisms in neurodevelopmental syndromes. We focus on the inflammatory events consequent to intragravidic viral infections as well as on the direct viral effects as the potential primary triggers. These authors hope that a timely review of the literature will help to envision promising research directions, also relevant for the present and future COVID-19 longitudinal studies."

            "abstract": "During COVID-19 pandemic peaks, healthcare professionals are a frontline workforce that deals with death on an almost daily basis and experiences a marked increase in workload. Returning home is also associated with fear of contaminating or be contaminated. An obvious consequence is stress accumulation and associated risks, especially in caregivers in mobility and possibly in human resource teams managing mobility. Here, during the second pandemic peak, we designed a 15-min testing procedure at the workplace, combining HADS and Brief COPE questionnaires with heart rate variability (HRV) recordings to evaluate psychophysiological status in four groups: caregivers in mobility (MOB); human resources teams managing mobility (ADM); caregivers without mobility (N-MOB); and university researchers teaching online (RES). Anxiety, depression, coping strategies, vagally-mediated heart rate regulation, and nonlinear dynamics (entropy) in cardiac autonomic control were quantified. Anxiety reached remarkably high levels in both MOB and ADM, which was reflected in vagal and nonlinear HRV markers. ADM maintained a better problem-solving capacity. MOB and N-MOB exhibited degraded problem-solving capacity. Multivariate approaches show how combining psychological and physiological markers helps draw highly group-specific psychophysiological profiles. Entropy in HRV and problem-solving capacity were highly relevant for that. Combining HADS and Brief COPE questionnaires with HRV testing at the workplace may provide highly relevant cues to manage mobility during crises as well as prevent health risks, absenteeism, and more generally malfunction incidents at hospitals."

By pushing hundreds of thousands of children into poverty, the global coronavirus pandemic has only made the link between social justice and health inequalities in the UK clearer and more relevant than ever. Yet paediatricians face a glaring dearth of opportunities to meaningfully engage with the issue, and lack the resources with which to learn what can be done about it. Using real-life examples from the author's own professional experience, this article demonstrates how ordinary paediatricians can apply a theoretical framework to clinical practice to move from why paediatricians ought to orient their practice towards the social determinants of health, to how. Rather than waiting for institutions to lead the way, this article provides 'rules for radicals' and makes a call for bottom-up, grassroots organizing around social justice and developing the knowledge and tools to fight it, including the exciting new initiatives of the 'social tool kit' and the 'social incubator'."

We investigated the severity of dysphagia in COVID-19 and the need to adapt practices to provide efficient care. We reviewed the literature on COVID-19, post-critical-illness dysphagia, and dysphagia and tracheostomy guidelines during the pandemic. Critically ill COVID-19 patients present a high incidence of dysphagia, aggravated by respiratory distress, deconditioning, and neurological complications. Mechanical ventilation (MV), delirium, sedation and weakness are worse in COVID-19 than in other etiologies of critical care. In awake patients, respiratory compromise impairs breathing-swallowing-coughing coordination. Tracheostomy reduces laryngopharyngeal trauma, sedation, delirium, ICU stay and improves swallowing rehabilitation. Tracheostomy weaning and swallowing evaluation is complex in COVID-19 due to respiratory instability and a team discussion will guide adaptations. Patients assessed in the ICU were 67% recommended to be nil by mouth (were aspirating). Two months following hospital discharge, 83% of those who had undergone tracheostomy were managing a normal diet. Severely ill COVID-19 patients are expected to regain swallow function.

Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students' understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other's mini game concepts. In addition, students were motivated toward designing educational mini games in their future studies. This study also demonstrates how to conduct OCD with students, presents lesson learned, and provides recommendations based on the authors' experience."

            "abstract": "As the nation implements SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults at an unprecedented scale, it is now essential to focus on the prospect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in pediatric populations. To date, no children younger than 12 years have been enrolled in clinical trials. Key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed include (1) rationale for vaccines in children, (2) possible effects of immune maturation during childhood, (3) ethical concerns, (4) unique needs of children with developmental disorders and chronic conditions, (5) health inequities, and (6) vaccine hesitancy. Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children. In this commentary, we briefly address each of these key issues, specify research gaps, and suggest a broader learning health system approach to accelerate testing and clinical trial development for an ethical and effective strategy to implement a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as rapidly and safely as possible. IMPACT: As the US begins an unprecedented implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, substantial knowledge gaps have yet to be addressed regarding vaccinations in the pediatric population. Maturational changes in the immune system during childhood have influenced the effectiveness of pediatric vaccines for other diseases and conditions, and could affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in children. Given that COVID-19 disease is far milder in the majority of children than in adults, the risk-benefit of a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be carefully weighed. The needs of children with developmental disabilities and with chronic disease must be addressed. Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation. Research and strategies to address general vaccine hesitancy in communities must be addressed in the context of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."

This study aims to implement a virtual escape room that will help assist and refine problem-solving skills in fifth-year pharmacy students by reviewing Beer’s criteria and selecting the most appropriate management. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted following the implementation of the virtual escape room using google form. Students had to unlock five puzzles using Beer’s criteria. To evaluate pharmacy students’ perception of this method, they completed a survey to identify their views of the game. Of the 128 students enrolled in the geriatric course, all were able to escape (100%). A one-sample t-test indicated statistical significance between gender. Female students escaped statistically faster than male students (p < 0.00002) and were more likely to recommend the game to other students and thought the game encouraged them to think of the material in a new way, whereas male students were more neutral towards it. In conclusion, the geriatric virtual escape room was successfully implemented as a pilot innovative method to assist in virtual learning. However, future studies should investigate virtual gamification in pharmacy education and its impact on learning, as well as identify if there were any gender-specific differences in using these tools."

The aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Changes in the social context may particularly affect children who are in the transition to adolescents (henceforth referred to as early adolescents) as adolescence is a crucial period for peer interactions and development of independence and autonomy. Yet, the impact of the pandemic and associated governmental regulations on early adolescents' emotional well-being has yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored daily fluctuations in mood in 54 early adolescents (M age = 11.07) during the first few months (April 2020-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the role of parents and peers on adolescents' mood variability was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety) and peer interactions once a day during four separate weeks across different weeks of containment measures in the Netherlands. Moreover, adolescents reported on their experienced attachment to parents and peers and internalizing problems during baseline and the final measurement, respectively. Results showed relatively stable levels of mood during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual differences in mood variability during the first assessment week were negatively associated with the experienced level of attachment to both parents and peers. Moreover, heightened levels of mood variability did not mediate the link between attachment and internalizing problems. Lastly, the quality of offline contact, but not online contact, was negatively related to adolescents' mood variability. Overall, this study suggests that mood of early adolescents did not heavily fluctuated across the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings add to the growing body of literature aiming to understand how adolescent's life are affected by the COVID-19 crisis and illustrates that social connectedness to parents or peers may facilitate resilience to distress and daily mood fluctuation in early adolescents."

The major aims of this study were to: (1) describe the development of telerehabilitation usage guidelines in a large hospital in Israel, and to (2) evaluate the implementation of telerehabilitation from the perspectives of healthcare practitioners and families. An expert focus group developed guidelines which were disseminated to multidisciplinary clinicians. Following sessions, clinicians filled The Clinician Evaluation of Telerehabilitation Service (CETS), a custom-built feedback questionnaire on telerehabilitation, and parents completed the client version of the Therapist Presence Inventory (TPI-C) and were asked to rate the effectiveness of sessions on an ordinal scale. Four goals of telerehabilitation sessions were defined: (1) maintenance of therapeutic alliance, (2) provision of parental coping strategies, (3) assistance in maintaining routine, and (4) preventing functional deterioration. Principal Components Analysis was used for the CETS questionnaire and the relationships of CETS and TPI-C with child's age and the type of session were evaluated using Spearman's correlations and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. In total, sixty-seven telerehabilitation sessions, with clients aged 11.31 ± 4.8 years, were documented by clinicians. Three components (child, session, parent) explained 71.3% of the variance in CETS. According to therapists, their ability to maintain the therapeutic alliance was generally higher than their ability to achieve other predefined goals (p < 0.01). With younger children, the ability to provide feedback to the child, grade treatment difficulty and provide coping strategies to the parents were diminished. Families perceived the therapist as being highly present in therapy regardless of treatment type. These results demonstrate a potential framework for the dissemination of telerehabilitation services in pediatric rehabilitation."

This survey was conducted to understand the magnitude of the impact of lockdown, and its effect on the health and behavior of individuals with ASD and their families.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted an anonymous online survey, disseminated to families registered with our hospital and collaborating centers. The survey questionnaire collected information on sociodemographic details, details of the patient's and parents' behavior and health during the COVID-19 lockdown, and treatment details of the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 153 families completed the survey. Of the 153, nearly half of the individuals with ASD had an inadequate understanding of lockdown, 54% had increased screen-time, while a third reported new-onset behavioral changes. About 40% received online therapies, of which 85% reported benefits. Of the 132 who answered the parent's section, 55% reported decreased interest and/or pleasure in doing daily activities and 43% felt depressed and/or hopeless. About 80% of families reported short-term positive changes such as improved speech, language skills, and participation in household chores.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routines, triggered behavioral issues in individuals with ASD, and impacted the coping skills of both individuals and families, along with the mental health and well-being of the family.

Here we report a 48-year-old male who was a known poorly controlled epileptic that contracted SARS-CoV-2 with subsequently developed status epilepticus and, when worked up, was shown to have features of DDMS. This case is unique as the patient had hemiatrophy and epilepsy but managed to lead a normal, physically demanding, and high functioning academic career and presented late in life. Perhaps only due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was this diagnosis picked up.

A survey of 627 South Korean adults was conducted in March 2020, when the country experienced an early but rapidly accelerating pandemic stage. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that in addition to confirming the major propositions of STOPS, three situational perception variables (i.e., problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition) were highly associated with an individual's fear and anger regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. However, only fear significantly affected situational motivation in problem-solving and information behaviors (i.e., information-seeking, forwarding, and permitting).

Currently in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether antenatal corticosteroids for infant benefit outweigh the potential harm to a pregnant woman with a COVID-19 infection.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine at which gestational ages administering antenatal corticosteroids is the optimal management strategy for hospitalized women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) who have a COVID-19 infection.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We designed a decision-analytic model to assess the maternal and infant outcomes associated with antenatal corticosteroid administration for risk of preterm delivery following rupture of membranes in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. We used a theoretical cohort of 10,000 women at each gestational age between 24 and 32 weeks who were hospitalized with PPROM and found to be COVID-19 positive. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit admission and death related to COVID-19 infection. The infant outcomes of interest included respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, neurodevelopmental delay, and death, and were assessed along with maternal and infant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate model assumptions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women with COVID-19 infection and preterm prelabor rupture of membrane between 24 and 32 weeks, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths at each gestational age. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths at each gestational age. Antenatal corticosteroid administration also resulted in fewer cases of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infant death. Overall, we found that between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation, administering antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy as it resulted in higher combined QALYs than no corticosteroid use. For 31 and 32 weeks of gestation, antenatal corticosteroid administration resulted in lower combined QALYs.

            "abstract": "It is widely held that schizophrenia involves an active process of peripheral inflammation that induces or reflects brain inflammation with activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality."

Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study in China from May 1 to October 31, 2020, that enrolled 135 mother-infant dyads: 57 dyads in the infection cohort and 78 in the non-infection cohort. Among all infants, 14.0% were preterm birth in the infection cohort and 6.4% in the non-infection cohort. Participants were followed by telephone interviews to collect demographic characteristics, medical records of coronavirus disease 2019, breastfeeding data, and early childhood development was assessed by the Age and Stage Questionnaire (ASQ-3) and Age and Stage Questionnaire Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE-2) Chinese versions at 3 months after childbirth. We used multivariable Poisson regression models to estimate the relative risk (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable linear regression models and a mediation model were used to test the direct and indirect associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ASQ-3 score. This study was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Medical Science Research Ethics Committee (No. IRB00006761-M2020127). Results: In the infection cohort, 13.6% of the children showed social-emotional developmental delay, and 13.5% showed overall developmental delay. The corresponding rates in the non-infection cohort were 23.4 and 8.1%. Compared with the non-infection cohort, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy did not increase the risk of social-emotional (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.51-1.49) or overall (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.60-1.73) developmental delay. The mediation model showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection indirectly affected the ASQ-3 score by increasing the length of mother-infant separation. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 during late pregnancy did not increase the risk of developmental delay of the offspring 3 months after delivery. However, SARS-CoV-2 may have indirect effects on early childhood development by increasing mother-infant separation."

However, several cases of neurological symptoms with neuroinflammatory syndromes, such as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), following mild cases, have been reported. As with other viral infections, such as rubella, influenza, and cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2 induces a surge of proinflammatory cytokines that affect microglial function, which can be harmful to brain development. Along with the viral induction of neuroinflammation, other noninfectious conditions may interact to produce additional inflammation, such as the nutritional imbalance of fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Additionally, transient thyrotoxicosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 with secondary autoimmune hypothyroidism has been reported, which could go undetected during pregnancy. Together, those factors may pose additional risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection impacting mechanisms of neural development such as synaptic pruning and neural circuitry formation. The present review discusses those conditions in the perspective of the understanding of risk factors that should be considered and the possible emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders in COVID-19-infected children."

FICare incorporates psychological, educational, communication, and environmental strategies to support parents to cope with the NICU environment and to prepare them to be able to emotionally, cognitively, and physically care for their infant. FICare has been associated with improved infant feeding, growth, and parent wellbeing and self-efficacy; important mediators for long-term improved infant neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes. FICare implementation requires multi-disciplinary commitment, staff motivation, and sufficient time for preparation and readiness for change as professionals relinquish power and control to instead develop collaborative partnerships with parents. Successful FICare implementation and culture change have been applied by neonatal teams internationally, using practical approaches suited to their local environments. Strategies such as parent and staff meetings and relational communication help to break down barriers to change by providing space for the co-creation of knowledge, the negotiation of caregiving roles and the development of trusting relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability within programs supporting parental presence in neonatal units and the profound impacts of parent-infant separation.

We investigated these pre-registered questions in a secondary analysis of data from a large Qualtrics panel of adults (N = 1,297). Pretest performance accuracy, math self-efficacy, gender, and math anxiety were associated with pretest item-level monitoring judgments. Participants randomly assigned to the intervention condition, relative to the control condition, made higher monitoring judgments post intervention. That is, these participants believed they were more accurate when answering problems. Regardless of experimental condition, those who actually were correct on health-related math problems made higher monitoring judgments than those who answered incorrectly.

The severity and variability of function impairment and the impact on patients' and caregivers' daily life are still poorly acknowledged. The SYNGAP1 Italian Family Association developed a survey, shared online with caregivers, exploring several issues, including: epilepsy outcome, comorbidities, daily-living skills, hospitalizations, rehabilitation treatments, economic burden, and COVID-19 pandemic impact. Caregivers of 13 children and adolescents participated in the survey. They most often show a fine and gross-motor impairment and a drug-resistant epilepsy with possibility to experience pluridaily absence seizures that may lead to periods of psychomotor regressions. Eating and sleep problems are reported in the majority. Most parents are concerned about language impairment, behavioral issues and lack of autonomy in daily-living activities. Specific neuropsychological evaluations for autism should be early considered in order to identify intervention strategies involving alternative communication strategies, which can positively affect behavior and quality of life. Rehabilitation treatment should aim to the acquisition and consolidation of personal autonomy."

Acute SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) presents with deficits of memory, attention, movement coordination, and mood. The mechanisms of these central nervous system symptoms remain largely unknown.In an established hamster model of intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 5 , and patients deceased from COVID-19, we report a lack of viral neuroinvasion despite aberrant BBB permeability, microglial activation, and brain expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, especially within the hippocampus and the inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla, when compared with non-COVID control hamsters and humans who died from other infections, cardiovascular disease, uremia or trauma. In the hippocampus dentate gyrus of both COVID-19 hamsters and humans, fewer cells expressed doublecortin, a marker of neuroblasts and immature neurons.Despite absence of viral neurotropism, we find SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, and hypoxia in humans, affect brain regions essential for fine motor function, learning, memory, and emotional responses, and result in loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Neuroinflammation could affect cognition and behaviour via disruption of brain vasculature integrity, neurotransmission, and neurogenesis, acute effects that may persist in COVID-19 survivors with long-COVID symptoms."

Surveys from Australia and the United Kingdom show high clinical consistency in SLP tracheostomy management, and that practice follows guidelines, research evidence and protocols. Swedish SLPs work with tracheostomised patients, however, the content and extent of this practice, and how it compares to international research is unknown. This study reports how SLPs in Sweden work with tracheostomised patients, investigating (a) the differences and similarities in SLPs tracheostomy management and (b) the facilitators and barriers to tracheostomy management, as reported by SLPs.Methods: A study-specific, online questionnaire was completed by 28 SLPs who had managed tracheostomised patients during the previous year. This study was conducted in 2018, pre Covid-19 pandemic. The answers were analysed for exploratory descriptive comparison of data. Content analyses were made on answers from open-ended questions.Results: Swedish SLPs manage tracheostomised patients, both for dysphagia and communication. During this study, the use of protocols and guidelines were limited and SLPs were often not part of a tracheostomy team. Speech-language pathologists reported that the biggest challenges in tracheostomy management were in (a) collaboration with other professionals, (b) unclear roles and (c) self-perceived inexperience. Improved collaboration with other professionals and clearer roles was suggested to facilitate team tracheostomy management.Conclusions: This study provides insight into SLP tracheostomy management in Sweden, previously uncharted. Results suggest improved collaboration, further education and clinical training as beneficial for a clearer and more involved SLP role in tracheostomy management."

            "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused immense social and economic costs worldwide. Most experts endorse the view that the virus has a zoonotic origin with the final spillover being associated with wildlife trade. Besides human consumption, wild animals are also extensively traded as pets. Information on zoonotic diseases has been reported to reduce consumer demand for exotic pets. We conducted a global survey and collected 162 responses from international experts on exotic pet trade (traders, academics, NGOs, enforcement entities) to understand how the legal and illegal trade of exotic pets is expected to be affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Our results suggest that legal purchase of exotic pets is perceived as decreasing during the first pandemic wave due to: lower availability of animals for trade, suppliers' inability to reach consumers and social distancing measures. The general perception is that in the future (i.e., next five years), both demand and supply of legally traded exotic pets are expected to either remain unchanged or decrease only temporarily. The consumer demand for illegal exotic pets is also expected to remain unchanged following the outbreak. The top two challenges reported by respondents, when considering the consequences of the pandemic for the exotic pet trade, are inadequate enforcement of national regulations and increased illegal trade. Our results suggest that the negative consequences of a zoonotic outbreak may not dissuade consumers of exotic pets. Worldwide, the transit/storing conditions and lack of health screenings of traded live animals are conducive to spreading diseases. Consumer demand is a key driver of trade, and enforcement of trade regulations will remain challenging, unless factors driving consumer demand are adequately incorporated in problem-solving frameworks. We emphasize the complexity of trade dynamics and the need to go beyond bans on wildlife trade. Stronger law enforcement, implemented along with initiatives dissuading consumption of wild exotic pets, are essential to sustainably satisfy the market demand."

By slicing the spatiotemporal patterns, we found manifestations of the virus behavior, such as cluster formation and bifurcation. Furthermore, by analyzing morphogenesis processes by entropy, we have been able to detect the virus phase transitions, typical of adaptive biological systems. Our results for the first time describe the virus patterning behavior processes all over the world, giving them quantitative measures.

Both the direct contact of the virus with the developing brain and the strong maternal immune response originated by viral infections can impair proper neurodevelopment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly-infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently responsible for a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. While initial studies focused on the viral impact on the respiratory system, increasing evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects other organs and tissues including the mature brain. While studies continue to determine the neuropathology associated to COVID-19, the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the developing brain remain largely unexplored. The present review discusses evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have persistent effects on the course of pregnancy and on brain development. Studies have shown that several proinflammatory mediators which are increased in the SARS-CoV-2-associated cytokine storm, are also modified in other viral infections known to increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. In this sense, further studies should assess the genuine effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and delivery along with an extended follow-up of the offspring, including neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological examination. It also remains to be determined whether and by which mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 intrauterine and early life infection could lead to an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ), in the offspring."

The escalating number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has conferred the viral spread with the status of global pandemic. However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells.

Although we are at the early stages of understanding the specific impact of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during pregnancy, mounting epidemiological evidence strongly supports a link between exposure to a variety of maternal infections and an increased risk for offspring neurodevelopmental disorders. Inflammatory biomarkers identified from archived or prospectively collected maternal biospecimens suggest that the maternal immune response is the critical link between infection during pregnancy and altered offspring neurodevelopment. This maternal immune activation (MIA) hypothesis has been tested in animal models by artificially activating the immune system during pregnancy and evaluating the neurodevelopmental consequences in MIA-exposed offspring. Although the vast majority of MIA model research is carried out in rodents, the nonhuman primate model has emerged in recent years as an important translational tool. In this review, we briefly summarize human epidemiological studies that have prompted the development of translationally relevant MIA models. We then highlight notable similarities between humans and nonhuman primates, including placental structure, pregnancy physiology, gestational timelines, and offspring neurodevelopmental stages, that provide an opportunity to explore the MIA hypothesis in species more closely related to humans.

SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy could negatively impact fetal brain development via multiple mechanisms. Accumulating evidence indicates that mother to fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does occur, albeit rarely. When it does occur, there is a potential for neuroinvasion via immune cells, retrograde axonal transport, and olfactory bulb and lymphatic pathways. In the absence of maternal to fetal transmission, there is still the potential for negative neurodevelopmental outcomes as a consequence of disrupted placental development and function leading to preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. In addition, maternal immune activation may lead to hypomyelination, microglial activation, white matter damage, and reduced neurogenesis in the developing fetus. Moreover, maternal immune activation can disrupt the maternal or fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to altered neurodevelopment. Finally, pro-inflammatory cytokines can potentially alter epigenetic processes within the developing brain. In this review, we address each of these potential mechanisms. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders in a subset of pregnant women and that long-term studies are warranted."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The past decades have seen a transformational shift in the understanding and treatment for neurological diseases affecting infants and children. These advances have been driven in part by the pediatric neurology physician-scientist workforce and its efforts. However, pediatric neurology research faces substantial challenges from internal and external forces including work-life balance demands, COVID-19 pandemic effects, and research funding. Understanding the impact of these challenges on the perceptions, planning, and careers of pediatric neurology physician-scientists is needed to guide the research mission.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our objective was to survey the research challenges, goals, and priorities of pediatric neurologists. In 2020 we conducted a cross-sectional, 28-question survey emailed to 1,775 members of the Child Neurology Society.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred fifty-one individuals responded to the survey. Most respondents were grant investigators (52%) and conducted clinical research (69%). Research areas included epilepsy (23%), neurodevelopmental and autism (16%), neurocritical care and stroke (11%), neurogenetics and neurometabolics (9%), neonatal neurology (8%), and others. The most common funding source was the National Institutes of Health (37%). Shared major research concerns were funding, utilization of remote technology, overcoming disparities, natural history and multicenter studies, global neurology, and diversification of the research portfolio. Commitment to continuing and increasing research efforts was evident.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our survey demonstrates obstacles for physician-scientist researchers in pediatric neurology, but it also shows optimism about continued opportunity. Creative approaches to address challenges will benefit the research mission, maximize the current and future pool of researchers, and help improve the lives of children with neurological disorders."

The aim of this research was to determine if rurality impacts access to WCV during early childhood, and if altering rurality measurement methods impacts outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Design and methods:\n        \n      \n      We utilized a longitudinal correlational design with early childhood data gathered from the Virginia All Payer Claims Database, which contains claims data from Medicaid and the majority of Virginia commercial insurance payers (n = 6349). WCV attendance was evaluated against three rurality metrics: a traditional metric using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes, a developed land variable, and a distance to care variable, at a zip code level.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Two of the rurality methods revealed that rural children attend fewer WCVs than their urban counterparts, (67% vs. 50% respectively, using a traditional metric; and a 0.035 increase in WCV attendance for every percent increase in developed land). Differences were attenuated by insurance payer; children with Medicaid attend fewer WCVs than those with private insurance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Young children in rural Virginia attend fewer WCVs than their non-rural counterparts, placing them at higher risk for missing timely developmental disorder screenings. The coronavirus disease pandemic has been associated with an abrupt and significant reduction in vaccination rates, which likely indicates fewer WCVs and concomitant developmental screenings. Pediatric nurses should encourage families of young children to develop a plan for continued WCVs, so that early identification of developmental disorders can be achieved."

All women who delivered at Columbia University Irving Medical Center with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy were approached. Women with unexposed infants were approached based on similar gestational age at birth, date of birth, sex, and mode of delivery. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Edition (ASQ-3) at age 6 months. A historical cohort of infants born before the pandemic who had completed the 6-month ASQ-3 were included in secondary analyses.\n## EXPOSURES\nMaternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOutcomes were scores on the 5 ASQ-3 subdomains, with the hypothesis that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy would be associated with decrements in social and motor development at age 6 months.\n## RESULTS\nOf 1706 women approached, 596 enrolled; 385 women were invited to a 6-month assessment, of whom 272 (70.6%) completed the ASQ-3. Data were available for 255 infants enrolled in the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes Initiative (114 in utero exposed, 141 unexposed to SARS-CoV-2; median maternal age at delivery, 32.0 [IQR, 19.0-45.0] years). Data were also available from a historical cohort of 62 infants born before the pandemic. In utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with significant differences on any ASQ-3 subdomain, regardless of infection timing or severity. However, compared with the historical cohort, infants born during the pandemic had significantly lower scores on gross motor (mean difference, -5.63; 95% CI, -8.75 to -2.51; F1,267 = 12.63; P<.005), fine motor (mean difference, -6.61; 95% CI, -10.00 to -3.21; F1,267 = 14.71; P < .005), and personal-social (mean difference, -3.71; 95% CI, -6.61 to -0.82; F1,267 = 6.37; P<.05) subdomains in fully adjusted models.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn this study, birth during the pandemic, but not in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with differences in neurodevelopment at age 6 months. These early findings support the need for long-term monitoring of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"

            "abstract": "Objective: Telerehabilitation (TR) is now, in the context of COVID-19, more clinically relevant than ever as a major source of outpatient care. The social network of a patient is a critical yet understudied factor in the success of TR that may influence both engagement in therapy programs and post-stroke outcomes. We designed a 12-week home-based TR program for stroke patients and evaluated which social factors might be related to motor gains and reduced depressive symptoms. Methods: Stroke patients (n = 13) with arm motor deficits underwent supervised home-based TR for 12 weeks with routine assessments of motor function and mood. At the 6-week midpoint, we mapped each patient's personal social network and evaluated relationships between social network metrics and functional improvements from TR. Finally, we compared social networks of TR patients with a historical cohort of 176 stroke patients who did not receive any TR to identify social network differences. Results: Both network size and network density were related to walk time improvement (p = 0.025; p = 0.003). Social network density was related to arm motor gains (p = 0.003). Social network size was related to reduced depressive symptoms (p = 0.015). TR patient networks were larger (p = 0.012) and less dense (p = 0.046) than historical stroke control networks. Conclusions: Social network structure is positively related to improvement in motor status and mood from TR. TR patients had larger and more open social networks than stroke patients who did not receive TR. Understanding how social networks intersect with TR outcomes is crucial to maximize effects of virtual rehabilitation."

ASD is a developmental disorder characterised by limitations in social communication, repetitive behavioural patterns, and limited interests, and activities. It is expected that many families with children with ASD will experience more problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related public health restrictions.

            "abstract": "There is growing evidence that measurement of SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number can inform clinical and public health management of SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients. Here we show that quantification of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible in a clinical setting, using a duplex RT-qPCR assay which targets both the E gene (Charité assay) and a human RNA transcript, RNase P (CDC assay) as an internal sample sufficiency control. Samples in which RNase P is not amplified indicate that sample degradation has occurred, PCR inhibitors are present, RNA extraction has failed or swabbing technique was insufficient. This important internal control reveals that 2.4 % of nasopharyngeal swabs (15/618 samples) are inadequate for SARS-CoV-2 testing which, if not identified, could result in false negative results. We show that our assay is linear across at least 7 logs and is highly reproducible, enabling the conversion of Cq values to viral copy numbers using a standard curve. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 copy number was independent of the RNase P copy number indicating that the per-swab viral copy number is not dependent on sampling- further allowing comparisons between samples. The ability to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number will provide an important opportunity for viral burden-guided public health and clinical decision making."

As a result, certain trends and phenomena have emerged, which shape the new normality in society and have generated many effects on the mathematics curriculum. For this reason, it is necessary to pose the problem of sketching the orientations of mathematics curriculum for the new situation. In this position paper, I developed an outline based on a description of the problem situation, the demands that the world of work had already been making on the curriculum at the international level, and the research carried out by mathematics education. From these factors, I assert the significant role of critical mathematics education, particularly the motto of reading and writing the world with mathematics. I propose that orientations for the mathematics curriculum in basic education in the new normality should include ethical and political issues, statistical and financial literacy, digital skills as a part of a STEM approach, ethnomathematics from native people, and, finally, a problem-posing and problem-solving approach. In this list, ethical and political issues have primacy."

            "abstract": "Pathogens comprised of viruses, bacteria, gut microbiome, and parasites are a leading cause of ever-emerging diseases in humans. Studying pathogens for their ability to cause diseases is a topic of critical discussion among scientists and pharmaceutical centers for effective drug development that diagnose, treat, and prevent infection-associated disorders. Pathogens impact health either directly by invading the host or by eliciting an acute inflammatory immune response. This paradigm of inflammatory immune responses is even more consequential in people who may be immunocompromised. In this regard, pregnancy offers an altered immunity scenario, which may allow the onset of severe diseases. Viruses, such as Influenza, HIV, and now SARS-CoV-2, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, raise new concerns for maternal and fetal/neonatal health. Intrauterine bacterial and parasitic infections are also known to impact pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health. More importantly, viral and bacterial infections during pregnancy have been identified as a common contributor to fetal brain development defects. Infection-mediated inflammatory uterine immune milieu is thought to be the main trigger for causing poor fetal brain development, resulting in long-term cognitive impairments. The concept of in utero programming of childhood and adult disorders has revolutionized the field of neurodevelopment and its associated complications. Recent findings in mice and humans clearly support the idea that uterine immunity during pregnancy controls the health trajectory of the child and considerably influences the cognitive function and mental health. In this review, we focus on the in utero programming of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and assess the effects of pathogens on the onset of ASD-like symptoms."

This study evaluates how restrictions to curtail this pandemic change parenting self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, couple satisfaction and health-related quality of life in parents after delivery of a newborn. Methods: In this prospective single center evaluation of parental self-efficacy and quality of life, four validated questionnaires were used to repeatedly assess parenting self-efficacy (Tool to measure Parental Self-Efficacy, TOPSE), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), couple satisfaction (Couple Satisfaction Index, CSI) and health-related quality of life (short form 12, SF12). Fifty-three parents of 50 infants answered a total number of 63 questionnaires during the lockdown period to limit the spread of COVID-19. These questionnaires were matched with 63 questionnaires of 58 other parents that had answered them before or after strong pandemic related measures. Results: Parents experienced lower parenting self-efficacy during the strict pandemic measures as compared to before and after (p = 0.04). In terms of age, socioeconomic, marital status and duration of hospitalization we detected no significant difference between both groups. On univariate linear regression, TOPSE scores were associated with gestational age (p = 0.044, parameter estimate 1.67, 95% CI: 0.048 to 3.301), birth weight (p = 0.035, parameter estimate 0.008, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.015), number of newborns' siblings (p = 0.0554, parameter estimate 7.49, 95% CI: -0.174 to 15.145) and distance of home from hospital (p = 0.043, parameter estimate -0.38, 95% CI: -0.745 to -0.011). Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between quality of life and TOPSE scores, suggesting that those who experience a higher self-efficacy also have a higher quality of life. Conclusions: When implementing a lock-down period psychological effects such as lower experience of parental self-efficacy have to be considered."

For the 38 residents who were present 8 weeks before the first lockdown (t1) and the following 8 weeks (t2), mood ratings and ratings of aggressive behavior were compared between the two time periods. In contrast to our hypothesis the mood ratings of the residents had a slight significant improvement, whereas the incidents and severity of aggressive behavior did not change significantly.

Methods: Participants were diagnosed with catatonia, and were receiving care in a specialized clinic. They (n = 9), F = 5, and M = 4, ranged in age from 16 to 21 years; ECT frequency was reduced at end of March 2020 due to institutional restrictions. Two parents/caregivers elected to discontinue ECT due to concern for COVID-19 transmission. Majority (n = 8) were developmentally delayed with some degree of intellectual disability (ID). Observable symptoms were rated on a three point scale during virtual visits. Results: All cases experienced clinically significant decline. Worsening of motor symptoms (agitation, aggression, slowness, repetitive self-injury, stereotypies, speech deficits) emerged within the first 3 weeks, persisted over the 14 week observation period and were more frequent than neurovegetative symptoms (appetite, incontinence, sleep). Four participants deteriorated requiring rehospitalization, and 2 among these 4 needed a gastrostomy feeding tube. Conclusion: Moderate and severe symptoms became apparent in all 9 cases during the observation period; medication adjustments were ineffective; resuming M-ECT at each participant's baseline schedule, usually by week 7, resulted in progressive improvement in some cases but the improvement was insufficient to prevent re-hospitalization in 4 cases.

I then tell three stories that illustrate how our lives - and our bodies - are being shaped by the current pandemic, addressing the ways in which its contribution to my loneliness in COVID-induced lockdown manifested in our everyday life. Engaging with existing scholarship on emotional/personal, social and cultural loneliness, I theorise that life in lockdown suffers from a new type of loneliness: proximal loneliness. Then, I build on the concept of response-ability to argue that multispecies kinship helps to alleviate feelings of proximal loneliness through emergent practices that make us response-able - care and respond - to one another. I contend that even in these unprecedented and viral times that have come to elicit profound feelings of loneliness and despair for many, the repertoire of our multispecies emergent practices that may help us through the difficulties of proximal loneliness continues to exist and grow with shared response-abilities of our kinship across the species boundaries."

We used a multiple baseline design across participants to examine whether RAC might increase on-topic, small talk conversational exchanges. Results demonstrated that RAC effectively increased small talk skills between participants and a confederate.

People with intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown and increased the use of psychotropic medication. People with ID are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 have on people with ID.

The differences in scores between those with and without NSSI on all dimensions of coping styles were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that vocational high school (OR = 1.67), girls (OR = 2.5), single parent with divorced parents (OR = 1.89), remarriage with divorced parents (OR = 1.81), and tolerance (OR = 1.17), venting emotions (OR = 1.15) and fantasy/denial (OR = 1.07) in coping styles may increase the risk of NSSI among middle school students, while problem solving (OR = 0.9) and seeking social support (OR = 0.9) among coping styles may reduce the risk of NSSI among middle school students. The interaction results show that gender has a moderating role in the process of endurance, avoidance, venting of emotions, and fantasy/denial influencing non-suicidal self-injury in middle school students.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is an association between coping styles and self-injury among middle school students in rural areas in western China, with gender playing a moderating role. Active attention should be paid to students' coping styles and encouraging them to adopt positive coping styles as well as avoid negative coping styles, especially in the case of girls, which can help prevent self-injury."

Children with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDDs) are particularly vulnerable to new and unexpected situations; moreover, the parents of these children generally show high levels of psychological stress due to the greater commitment that this condition imposes on them. The aim of this study is to evaluate the disease status of NDDs children before and during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to evaluate the psychological effects related to measures of social distancing on these children and their families.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-one children with NDDs, were enrolled in this study and followed up at the Child Neuropsychiatry Unit of the University Hospital Consortium Corporation Polyclinic of Bari (Italy) along with their parents.

A panel of geneticists worked on the development of this consensus, in which not only patients with Down syndrome were included, but the search was extended to patients with other types of disabilities, in both pediatric and adult ages in or der to contribute to the development of public health measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. The consensus concludes that, given the prevalence of comorbidities associated with Down syndrome, the higher incidence of cases with severe COVID-19 in this population group and a higher mortality, individuals with trisomy 21 should be considered as a high-risk population, and therefore, vaccina tion against SARS-CoV-2 should have a high priority for all people with Down syndrome regardless of their age (except for the age limit established by the clinical trials of each vaccine), and should be preceded only by the groups of health personnel and adults aged > 60-65 years. Likewise, this group of experts urges health authorities to include people with intellectual disabilities and related conditions as a priority population (other chromosomal abnormalities other than Down syndrome, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and conditions that cause disability with microcephaly), as well as the caregivers of people with this type of conditions. Vaccination in children with this type of disorders should be considered as part of the first priority group, once safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available for use in children and adolescents."

Early data on the impact of COVID-19 suggests that people with IDD are experiencing more severe health outcomes compared to the general population. In addition to their elevated health risks, people with IDD, like the rest of the population, are struggling with boredom, isolation, and loneliness as they shelter in place. As people with IDD seek a return to their jobs, friends and families, and the activities of their community, community-based provider organizations must strike a difficult balance between actions that are intended to protect the health and safety of people they support and actions that honor people's choices and encourage self-determination. Practical issues that community-based provider organizations must consider when striking the correct balance are discussed, and recommendations on ways to support people with IDD to make informed, self-determined choices during the pandemic are offered."

At the same time, a start was made on the nationwide exchange of digital teaching/learning materials via the online platform \"LOOOP share\" in order to save local resources. Among other things, virtual patient cases (VP) were shared across faculties for case-based learning, through which students can acquire clinical decision-making skills. Objectives: Within the framework of the cooperation project \"National Learning Platforms for Digital Patient-Related Learning in Medical Studies\" (DigiPaL), the usability of VPs for students and teachers should be improved, and the spectrum of disease patterns that are covered by VPs should be systematically expanded. Results: With the participation of many locations, a total of 150 VPs were developed by 96 case authors from 16 faculties, in addition to the existing 403 VPs. The thematic selection was made on the basis of criteria oriented to the National Competence Based Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM). After completion, these VPs were also made available to all faculties for free use via \"LOOOP share\" and the CASUS learning platform. Discussion: Even after the pandemic, these developed VPs should be available to the faculties and thus make a lasting contribution to improve medical training in Germany - especially in light of digital teaching formats being expressly advocated on the basis of the adapted current Medical Licensure Act (ÄApprO). A possible application is interdisciplinary learning of clinical decision-making with the help of blended learning formats within the framework of a longitudinal curriculum. The large number of involved colleagues and faculties shows that the nationally coordinated development of VPs across faculties was commonly seen as useful."

The virus has mostly affected elderly populations, but there may be corollary effects on young adults' psychosocial adjustment due to educational, economic, and occupational disruptions. Using latent class analysis, we examined unique typologies of coping in response to the pandemic among young adults. We used an expanded set of indicators including traditional measures of problem- and emotion-focused coping as well as measures of resilience and coping flexibility. We also examined whether class membership could be predicted by demographics, stress appraisal, and psychosocial characteristics including catastrophic thinking and impulsivity. The sample of 1,391 young adults (ages 18-35) was recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and snowball methods from late-April to early-May 2020. Six classes were identified: (1) Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (2) Resilient Inflexible Problem-Focused Copers, (3) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Venters, (4) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (5) Non-Resilient Flexible Non-Copers, and (6) Non-Resilient Inflexible Non-Copers. Using Class 1 as the reference class, we found perceived centrality and uncontrollability of the pandemic as well as catastrophic thinking and impulsivity were significant predictors of class membership. The mean levels of stress appraisal and psychosocial characteristics varied significantly between the classes, reinforcing the structural validity of these classes. The findings suggest the importance of training young adults to develop resilience and flexibility as well as specific coping skills that can help offset the psychological effects of dramatic lifestyle changes that may result from pandemics or other health crises in the future."

            "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) profoundly impact neurocognitive development. Specifically, when these events occur during critical periods of brain plasticity, a time of significant synaptogenesis, neural pruning, and myelination, typical neurodevelopment can become derailed. Adverse childhood experiences promote morphological changes in neuronal microcircuitry which may lead to diminished cognitive flexibility, inattention, increased impulsivity, decreased school readiness, and disruptive behaviors. In this regard, the current COVID-19 pandemic represents an especially complex adverse experience that disturbs a child's social milieu and support network, likely interfering with brain maturation and executive function. Here, we take a neurodevelopmental approach to argue for the critical role that pediatricians must fulfill in mitigating the potentially detrimental consequences of COVID-19. We call for ACE screening and anticipatory guidance in the primary care setting, and the use of validated interventions and skills to bolster resilience, when ACEs are identified. We present a clinical workflow for the physician to proactively assess, identify, stratify, and address the severity of ACEs worsened by COVID-19. We discuss home-based activities and resources for children and adolescents to promote stress reduction, connectiveness, and self-awareness and create a more positive environment to maximize neurodevelopmental potential in the face of the ongoing pandemic."

Brain organoid models can overcome some of these limitations, as they are generated from human derived stem cells, differentiated in three dimensions (3D), and can mimic human neurodevelopmental characteristics. Therefore, brain organoids have been increasingly used as brain models in research on various viruses, such as Zika virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Brain organoids allow for the study of viral tropism, the effect of infection on organoid function, size, and cytoarchitecture, as well as innate immune response; therefore, they provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of neurotropic viral infections and testing of antivirals in a physiological model. In this review, we summarize the results of studies on viral CNS infection in brain organoids, and we demonstrate the broad application and benefits of using a human 3D model in virology research. At the same time, we describe the limitations of the studies in brain organoids, such as the heterogeneity in organoid generation protocols and age at infection, which result in differences in results between studies, as well as the lack of microglia and a blood brain barrier."

We adopted an ecologically valid approach to collect 10 experience sampling events within the same day to examine how college students regulated their emotions on a typical weekday during the pandemic and the simultaneous hedonic association of these strategies on their affective experience. Several emotion regulation strategies (including acceptance, calming, reappraisal, problem solving, and social sharing) were associated with increased positivity or reduced negativity that may be better for psychological health. In contrast, other emotion regulation strategies (including rumination, experiential avoidance, catastrophizing, lack of clarity, self-blaming, and other-blaming) were associated with increased negativity or reduced positivity that may worsen psychological health. In these findings, self-reported stress was a crucial contextual moderator to consider while understanding the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and experienced affect. The current study documents variability in affect in response to stressors experienced by college students even within a single day and provides a real-world perspective on the emotion regulation strategies that were adaptive and maladaptive in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate whether personal, social and organizational level resources can buffer against the negative effects of perceived loneliness on stress and exhaustion. The data was collected from Finnish university employees (n = 1463) in autumn 2020 via an electronic survey. Of the respondents, about 78% were working remotely, and 64% were female. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the main and moderating (i.e., buffering) effects. The results indicated that perceived loneliness was directly and positively associated with stress and exhaustion. Further, as hypothesized, personal resilience moderated the relationship between loneliness and stress and exhaustion, and organizational support moderated the relationship between loneliness and stress. Unexpectedly, organizational support did not moderate the loneliness-exhaustion relationship. Moreover, a sense of social belonging was not associated with stress and exhaustion, nor did it moderate loneliness and well-being relationships. The results demonstrate the importance of personal resilience and organizational support in enhancing well-being in organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research directions and practical ways to promote resilience and to increase organizational support are discussed."

            "abstract": "Case-based learning is a valuable tool to impart various problem-solving skills in veterinary education and stimulate active learning. Students can solve imaginary cases without the need for contact with real patients. Case-based teaching can be well performed as asynchronous remote-online class. In time of the COVID-19-pandemic, many courses in veterinary education are provided online. Therefore, students report certain fatigue when it comes to desk-based online learning. The app \"Actionbound\" provides a platform to design digitally interactive scavenger hunts based on global positioning system (GPS)-called \"bounds\" -in which the teacher can create a case study with an authentic patient via narrative elements. This app was designed for multimedia-guided museum or city tours initially. The app offers the opportunity to send the students to different geographic localizations for example in a park or locations on the University campus, like geocaching. In this way, students can walk outdoors while solving the case study. The present article describes the first experience with Actionbound as a tool for mobile game-based and case-orientated learning in veterinary education. Three veterinary neurology cases were designed as bounds for undergraduate students. In the summer term 2020, 42 students from the second to the fourth year of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover worked on these three cases, which were solved 88 times in total: Cases 1 and 2 were each played 30 times, and case 3 was played 28 times. Forty-seven bounds were solved from students walking through the forest with GPS, and 41 were managed indoors. After each bound, students evaluated the app and the course via a 6-point numerical Likert rating scale (1 = excellent to 6 = unsatisfactory). Students playing the bounds outdoors performed significantly better than students solving the corresponding bound at home in two of the three cases (p = 0.01). The large majority of the students rated the course as excellent to good (median 1.35, range 1-4) and would recommend the course to friends (median 1.26, range 1-3). Summarizing, in teaching veterinary neurology Actionbound's game-based character in the context of outdoor activity motivates students, might improve learning, and is highly suitable for case-based learning."

            "abstract": "Research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted negative effects on the general population and particularly on parents. However, little is known about families of children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD). The present study investigated parental stress, coparenting, and child adjustment in Italian families with children with NDD (N = 82) and typical developing children (TD, N = 82) during lockdown, using an online survey. Results of quantitative analyses showed a significant increase in parental stress and child externalizing behaviors, but not of coparenting. Parental stress is predicted by externalizing behaviors, and coparenting acted as a moderator in the relationship between the change in the amount of time spent with the children before and during lockdown and parental stress. In children with NDD, the decrease in therapeutic/rehabilitation support predicted higher externalizing behaviors. Qualitative analysis showed that beyond the difficulties and worries arising during lockdown, most of the parents appreciated the opportunity of spending more time with their children and strengthening the parent-child relationship. In conclusion, our results point out the importance of ensuring continuity of care for children with NDD (e.g. telehealth) during home confinement and of providing psychological support for parents."

In the world that was closed with the pandemic, children were kept away from the social support system of teachers and friends. Pandemic isolated the children. The negative experiences associated with COVID-19 have placed both traditional approaches and important online learning and support applications on the agenda, since both can help to solve the problems we face. Educators and experts have provided psychological support services, questioning the methods used to reach people during the pandemic and rediscovering alternative ways of connecting with individuals through online media. The online framework of this study emerged in response to the needs caused by the pandemic. The study is designed using a real experimental pattern and is based on a pretest-posttest, experimental/control-group model. The Social Support Evaluation Scale for Children and Teenagers was used to select the participants. In total, 18 participants were equally assigned to research groups (experiment n = 9, control n = 9). The psychoeducation programme consisted of six sessions, each lasting 50-60 min on average.

            "abstract": "Pandemic situations present enormous risks to essential rural primary healthcare (PHC) teams and the communities they serve. Yet, the pandemic policy development for rural contexts remains poorly defined. This article draws on reflections of the rural PHC response during the COVID-19 pandemic around three elements: risk, resilience, and response. Rural communities have nuanced risks related to their mobility and interaction patterns coupled with heightened population needs, socio-economic disadvantage, and access and health service infrastructure challenges. This requires specific risk assessment and communication which addresses the local context. Pandemic resilience relies on qualified and stable PHC teams using flexible responses and resources to enable streams of pandemic-related healthcare alongside ongoing primary healthcare. This depends on problem solving within limited resources and using networks and collaborations to enable healthcare for populations spread over large geographic catchments. PHC teams must secure systems for patient retrieval and managing equipment and resources including providing for situations where supply chains may fail and staff need rest. Response consists of rural PHC teams adopting new preventative clinics, screening and ambulatory models to protect health workers from exposure whilst maximizing population screening and continuity of healthcare for vulnerable groups. Innovative models that emerge during pandemics, including telehealth clinics, may bear specific evaluation for informing ongoing rural health system capabilities and patient access. It is imperative that mainstream pandemic policies recognize the nuance of rural settings and address resourcing and support strategies to each level of rural risk, resilience, and response for a strong health system ready for surge events."

The Incredible Years® (IY) Parent Program is a group intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing stress in parents, as well as improving behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes in children. The program has been recently adapted for families of children with autism or language delays (IY-ASLD®). This intervention has not yet been implemented in the Spanish Public Health System, where there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions being offered to families with young children presenting neurodevelopmental problems. The main aims of this study are to determine the feasibility of implementing the IY-ASLD® program within Spanish Child Mental Health Services and to examine parents' acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate its preliminary effectiveness in terms of reducing parental stress and behavioral difficulties in their children. The FIRST STEPS study is a multicenter, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLD® program with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Approximately 70 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties (aged 2-5 years) will be recruited. Families will be assessed prior to randomization and after the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention will consist of 22 weekly online sessions (approximately 6 months). The FIRST STEPS pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of reliably implementing the IY-ASLD® program within the Spanish Public Health System.

School-based SLPs and SLPs who had 3 years or fewer of AAC experience reported lower confidence, whereas SLPs who spent more work time each week using telepractice and who accessed a greater number of different types of training reported higher confidence. The number of people in different roles providing personal support and the number of different electronic/print resources accessed were not significant predictors of SLPs' confidence. The majority of SLPs wanted additional training, support, or resources related to AAC telepractice.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The findings from this research suggest the importance of SLPs' access to quality training and support in the areas of AAC and telepractice, particularly for school-based SLPs."

            "abstract": "Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have relatively mild clinical symptoms without fever or pneumonia, although severe cases with multiple-organ failure have been reported. Neurological symptoms, which have been mainly reported in adults, are very rare in children. This article will review 2 different aspects of neurological involvement related to this infection in children. In the first part, we will review the neurological abnormalities reported in children caused by this viral infection. Adults frequently report muscle pain, headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, and occasionally more severe central or peripheral nervous system damage. Neurological involvement seems infrequent in children, although some cases have been reported. In the second part, we will discuss the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the healthcare system of some countries, causing collateral damage to general pediatric care and in particular to those children affected with chronic diseases, mainly neurological conditions, including autism, intellectual disability, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy, and patients needing neurosurgical procedures."

            "abstract": "The worldwide treatment gap for migraine before COVID-19 inevitably widens as attention focuses on an international emergency. Migraine hits people particularly in their early and middle years, potentially reduces quality of life and productivity, and remains a common emergency presentation. This article examines the impact of COVID-19 on migraine, and changing aspects of migraine care during and after the pandemic. Many risk factors for severe COVID-19-older age, male gender, cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression-are less frequent in migraineurs. Telemedicine is effective for migraine follow-up, and needs ongoing evaluation. Most migraine treatments can start or continue in acute COVID-19, with care to avoid drug interactions. Close contact procedures (botulinum toxin, acupuncture and steroid injections) are avoided in lockdown or in the vulnerable. Secondary effects of COVID-19, including long COVID and its economic impact, are probably equal or greater in people with migraine. Migraine and other long-term conditions need adequate resourcing to prevent personal, social and economic suffering. Treating migraine, a sequel of COVID, potentially reduces the impact of long COVID."

Telepractice is one among an array of service delivery models that can be successfully implemented in the public-school setting. While many school-based SLPs have been plunged into telepractice with the recent pandemic, this temporary shift to emergency instruction is not the same as fully implementing a telepractice service delivery model. SLPs who recognize the potential application of telecommunications would profit from additional training and experience to take advantage of the benefits of this service delivery model. The purpose of this article is to explore the concept of telepractice as a service delivery model, and to answer the who, what, when, where, and why questions of school-based telepractice.

The objectives of this online survey that included both national and international families were to capture changes in access to healthcare and educational services for individuals with IDDs that occurred shortly after restrictions were initiated and to survey families on resources that could improve services for these individuals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was an online survey for caregivers of individuals with (1) a genetic diagnosis and (2) a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or epilepsy.

Seventy-four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele-education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele-education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      COVID-19 restrictions have greatly affected access to services for individuals with syndromic IDDs.

COVID-19 interruption of regular surveillance necessitated a rapid development of telehealth models for effective and standardized care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used implementation science and lean methodologies to develop an effective telehealth neurodevelopmental surveillance program for high-risk infants. Interventions included reorganization of visit flow processes and a telehealth toolkit for standardized neurological and developmental assessments. We tested and improved our intervention through plan-do-study-act cycles, value-added analysis, and parent- and provider-satisfaction questionnaires. Process metrics (standard elements, subspecialty referrals, diagnostic tests, and prescriptions ordered) were compared in group-level analyses between telehealth patients (N = 97) March 16, 2020-July 1, 2020 and a matched in-person cohort at the same period the previous year.

Providers (N = 6) rated telehealth experiences favorably. Process metrics indicated no differences between telehealth and in-person visits (all P > 0.05). Following telehealth implementation, provider efficiency increased to near baseline (median 88.9% versus 91.7%) and median missed visits decreased to 0% from 20% (in-person).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Implementation of telehealth for neurodevelopmental surveillance in a tertiary high-risk infant follow-up clinic successfully provided standardized and timely care during stay-at-home orders; broader telehealth applications may overcome access barriers in this field."

Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England.

            "abstract": "In a special issue that focuses on complex presentations related to Autism, we ask the question in this editorial whether an Autism Spectrum Condition without complexity is a disorder, or whether it represents human diversity? Much research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism Spectrum Conditions. These comparisons have tended to draw attention to 'deficits' in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are characterised as unwanted. Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association. Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability. Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences. We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively. Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic."

We focus specifically on public health emergencies, such as COVID-19. The authors undertook a literature review and gathered empirical data through semi-structured focus group discussions amongst front-line workers from health clinics in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh and in the Abyei Special Administrative Area, South Sudan. The purpose of the project was to identify how front-line workers respond to ethical challenges, including any informal or local decision-making processes, support networks, or habits of response.The research findings highlighted a dissonance between ethical guidance and the experiences of front-line humanitarian health workers. They suggest the possibility: (1) that few problems confronting front-line workers are conceived, described, or resolved as ethical problems; and (2) of significant dissonance between available, allegedly practically oriented guidance (often produced by academics in North America and Europe), and the immediate issues confronting front-line workers. The literature review and focus group data suggest a real possibility that there is, at best, a significant epistemic gulf between those who produce ethical guidelines and those engaged in real-time problem solving at the point of contact with people. At worst they suggest a form of epistemic control-an imposition of cognitive shapes that shoehorn the round peg of theoretical preoccupations and the disciplinary boundaries of western academies into the square hole of front-line humanitarian practice."

Although pregnancy may be a risk factor in respiratory virus infections, there are no considerable differences regarding COVID-19 severity observed between pregnant and nonpregnant women. In these circumstances, an emergent concern is the possibility of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric harm for the offspring of infected mothers. Currently, there is no stronger evidence indicating vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the disease could lead to several impairments in the offspring's brain. Furthermore, in the face of historical knowledge on possible long-term consequences for the progeny's brain after infection by viruses, we must consider that this might be another deleterious facet of COVID-19.

The New York City area was the first major United States epicenter and is home to four genetic counseling graduate programs. We set out to explore the multifaceted programmatic changes required from the four institutions in an early pandemic epicenter, providing the longest time horizon available for assessing the implications of this restructuring on graduate education in the profession. Using practitioner-based enquiry, our iterative reflections identified three phases of COVID-19 response within our programs from March through December 2020. The spring months were marked by significant upheaval and reactivity, with a focus on stabilizing our programs in an unstable environment that included a significant medical response required in our area. By summer, we were reinvesting time and energy into our programs and prioritizing best practices in online learning. Relative predictability returned in the fall with noticeable improvements in flexibility and proactive problem-solving within our new environment. We have begun to identify changes in both curricula and operations that are likely to become more permanent. Telehealth fieldwork, remote supervision, simulated cases with standardized clients, and virtual recruitment and admission events are some key examples. We explored early outcome measures, such as enrollment, retention, course evaluations, and student academic and fieldwork progress, all indicating little change from prior to the pandemic to date. Overall, we found our programs, and genetic counseling graduate education more broadly, to be much more resilient and flexible than we would ever have realized.

During the lockdown period, a huge number of restrictions were imposed, hence interrupting a wide range of activities previously proven to be necessary for some people. Due to the circumstances, rehabilitation treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders have been suspended, resulting in consequent distress for the children themselves and their parents. To overcome this problem, a tele-rehabilitation approach has proven to be an excellent solution to give continuity to children's rehabilitation. The tele-rehabilitation approach allows access to rehabilitation services directly from home. During lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) HomeKit, developed by Khymeia, was employed as a rehabilitation system for the treatment of posture and balance of an adolescent with disabilities for the first time ever. Specifically, a 17-year-old female patient was enrolled and evaluated by the clinical staff before and after the home-training sessions. The system was delivered to the patient's home so that she could perform the tasks in a familiar environment, while under the supervision of the clinical staff. Through a specific platform, using different modules of the system, therapists could remotely check that the proposed exercises were properly performed and provide feedback and/or increase the difficulty according to the patient's needs and progress. Therefore, the treatment performed was carried out at home in a personalized, intensive, and playful way; characteristics do not present in a traditional treatment. Our results are promising and demonstrate both the efficacy of rehabilitation exercises carried out at home and the feasibility of home-based rehabilitation, when using the VRRS HomeKit even with adolescents. The VRRS HomeKit presents some limitations, such as the need to have the line connection and free space at home, the presence of technical issues, and the education of parents and patients to understand the instructions. Despite the limitations, this study provides the basis for continuing the experience of tele-rehabilitation on patients with a motor disorder also by customizing the exercises to their characteristics."

This review systematically analyzed the recent advances of INAAT strategies with practical case for the real-world scenario virus detection applications. With the qualities that make INAAT systems useful for making diagnosis relevant decisions, the key performance indicators and the cost-effectiveness of enzyme-assisted methods and enzyme-free methods were compared. The modularity of nucleic acid amplification reactions that can lead to thresholding signal amplifications using INAAT reagents and their methodology design were examined, alongside the potential application with rapid test platform/device integration. Given that clinical practitioners are, by and large, unaware of many the isothermal nucleic acid test advances. This review could bridge the arcane research field of different INAAT systems and signal output modalities with end-users in clinic when choosing suitable test kits and/or methods for rapid virus detection."

In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a presurvey, the simulation, and a postsurvey, and were sent a 6-week follow-up survey.

It was conducted in February 2021 with 398 university students in South Korea. Data were collected through online surveys. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with an autoregressive correlation structure were employed to distinguish differences in core competencies, academic performance, satisfaction, and usefulness of teaching methods before 2019 and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings revealed that the overall core competencies of participants were significantly lower in 2020 than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, knowledge construction, responsibility practice, and socialization were significantly low during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas information management and identity value did not show a significant difference. However, problem-solving was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enhancing the core competencies of university students is integral in the new learning environment of the post-COVID-19 era.

Still, recent circumstances shed a new light on how to facilitate Design Thinking activities in a remote rather than an analog way. Due to Design Thinking's high production of artifacts and its focus on communication and interaction between team members, the theory of Distributed Cognition, specifically the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork (DiCoT) framework, provides an interesting perspective on the recent going-remote of Design Thinking activities. For this, we first highlight differences of analog vs. remote Design Thinking by analyzing corresponding literature from the recent years.

General population studies, as well as insight into the outcomes for particular groups, will be necessary in order to mitigate potentially long-term effects as well as to prepare for future epidemics or pandemics. The pandemic conditions have been marked by rapid and abrupt changes and unpredictability which are circumstances that leave the autistic population particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes following the distinctive features of the diagnosis. Studies are only beginning to delineate the outcomes of the global autism community and the present study adds to these findings by providing a local, multi-perspective, qualitative analysis of the lived experiences of the Swedish autism community. In this study, autistic youth and adults, caregivers of autistic individuals, as well as representatives of Swedish interest organizations were interviewed. Thematic analysis was performed on the population as a whole and patterns of results were formalized according to the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF-CY). Participants report wide-ranging adverse outcomes of the pandemic relating to mental health and access to support, participation in daily activities and socialization, education, and work as well as parental resources. However, participants also report positive outcomes relating to a reduction in specific social and everyday demands, and normalization of lived experiences.

The students were divided into the \"psychosomatic disorder\" group (group P, n = 42), the \"developmental disorder\" group (group D, n = 89), and the \"other disease\" group (group O, n = 155). Using students' self-reports on the Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items, we assessed the proportion of students with a high risk of psychosomatic disorder in three groups. We investigated how the students requiring the support of somatic symptom (SS) felt about school during school closure. Further, using parents' and caregivers' answers, SS scores were calculated before and during school closure and after school reopening.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proportion of students with a high risk of developing psychosomatic disorder increased in all groups.

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns in countries across the world, changing the lives of billions of people. The United Kingdom's first national lockdown, for example, restricted people's ability to socialize and work. The current study examined how changes to socializing and working during this lockdown impacted ongoing thought patterns in daily life. We compared the prevalence of thought patterns between two independent real-world, experience-sampling cohorts, collected before and during lockdown. In both samples, young (18 to 35 y) and older (55+ y) participants completed experience-sampling measures five times daily for 7 d. Dimension reduction was applied to these data to identify common \"patterns of thought.\" Linear mixed modeling compared the prevalence of each thought pattern 1) before and during lockdown, 2) in different age groups, and 3) across different social and activity contexts. During lockdown, when people were alone, social thinking was reduced, but on the rare occasions when social interactions were possible, we observed a greater increase in social thinking than prelockdown. Furthermore, lockdown was associated with a reduction in future-directed problem solving, but this thought pattern was reinstated when individuals engaged in work. Therefore, our study suggests that the lockdown led to significant changes in ongoing thought patterns in daily life and that these changes were associated with changes to our daily routine that occurred during lockdown."

All nursing decisions had to be innovatively made and measures taken by nurses using their existing knowledge and skills. This required nurses to have a solid theoretical understanding of infectious diseases and epidemiology, evidence-based solid practice skills, and problem-solving skills.

            "abstract": "Microglia, the resident brain immune cells, play a critical role in normal brain development, and are impacted by the intrauterine environment, including maternal immune activation and inflammatory exposures. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo . We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19."

Although virtual courses provided high-quality educational material, the efficiency in children's and adolescents' academic performance in general is yet to be known. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine whether the academic performance of school-aged students was impacted or not through online learning and modified educational methods during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to the studies, either students suffered from learning losses comparing to pre-pandemic years or, in some cases, they benefited from online learning, especially in mathematics. Younger students and students with neurodevelopmental disorders or special education needs seemed to suffer more. Parents/caregivers reported that their children's performance deteriorated, while others thought that online learning was beneficial. Teachers also reported that students presented academic gaps and difficulties in mathematics and reading compared to typical years. Consequently, the new ways of schooling imposed by the restrictions have not been fully tested and the impact cannot be described thoroughly. The investment in technological equipment in schools for the majority of students, along with the training of teachers in digital competence, should be a priority."

After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life-structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between 3 and 7 April 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18 and 22 April 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6 and 10 May 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25 and 29 May 2020 (Time 4). This four-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents' psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted. The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020. Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf.io/g2t3b. This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis. Generally, our study found that: (i) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted; (ii) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normality and restored structure of everyday life; (iii) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted; (iv) people who used problem solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown; (v) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown."

The program provided undergraduates with meaningful talent and skills development opportunities by implementing a student-centred, project-based learning approach inspired by the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. We present evidence from participant exit surveys suggesting that the program delivers a high-quality learning environment and improves learning outcomes compared to traditional work-integrated learning. Notably, 84% of respondents reported an excellent or exceptional learning experience and significant or profound improvements in skills, such as leadership (72% of respondents), problem-solving (42% of respondents) and research preparedness (52%) that are difficult to develop in conventional academic programs. Remarkably, 60% of respondents report that the job-readiness training provided by the program is better or much better than traditional work-integrated learning.

That plan called for a concentrated focus on coalition-building and contracting by state mental health systems to establish a foundation for an improved health system. This paper offers a complementary set of suggestions for the four non-mental health systems mentioned above by recommending actionable steps based on scientific evidence to support improved services for children at risk for MEB problems. For each system we describe examples of evidence-informed services, policies or programs that (1) prevent disabilities and promote health, (2) protect and preserve families and neighborhoods, and (3) provide quality care. Prioritizing the promotion of children's MEB health by all state systems can shape U.S. children's health and well-being for generations to come."

            "abstract": "The most common symptom of COVID-19 in critically ill patients is ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), with many patients requiring invasive or noninvasive respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be a consequence of the respiratory-swallowing incoordination common in ARDS or may occur following the respiratory support interventions. In this commentary, we highlight the risk and complications of oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and urge medical and rehabilitation professionals to consider dysphagia a prognostic complication, provide appropriate referrals, and initiate early interventions as appropriate."

            "abstract": "Since COVID-19 emerged in 2019, significant levels of suffering and disruption have been caused on a global scale. Although vaccines have become widely used, the virus has shown its potential for evading immunities or acquiring other novel characteristics. Whether current drug treatments are still effective for people infected with Omicron remains unclear. Due to the long development cycles and high expense requirements of de novo drug development, many researchers have turned to consider drug repositioning in the search to find effective treatments for COVID-19. Here, we review such drug repositioning and combination efforts towards providing better handling. For potential drugs under consideration, aspects of both structure and function require attention, with specific categories of sequence, expression, structure, and interaction, the key parameters for investigation. For different data types, we show the corresponding differing drug repositioning methods that have been exploited. As incorporating drug combinations can increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity, we also review computational strategies to reveal drug combination potential. Taken together, we found that graph theory and neural network were the most used strategy with high potential towards drug repositioning for COVID-19. Integrating different levels of data may further improve the success rate of drug repositioning."

Previous research on small business managers during the pandemic has mainly focused on traditional pathogenic effects, and there is a lack of studies looking at the issue from a salutogenic health promotion perspective. The aim of this study is to explore whether a sense of coherence and general resistance resources were experienced by small business managers in Sweden and Norway during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative design was applied through exploratory interviews with 16 managers of small businesses in Sweden and Norway.

Survey items included demographic information, parental depression, children's diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders, the total length of school closure, and emotional/behavioral problems. Children's emotional/behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which has cutoff points to differentiate clinical-level problems, which were the primary focus of this study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proportions of clinical-level problems were higher at Wave 2 (emotional symptoms = 24.8%, conduct problems = 22.7%, hyperactivity/inattention = 36.8%, peer relationship problems = 36.2%, and lack of prosocial behavior = 23.5%) compared to Wave 1. Lower grade-level and lower annual family income predicted the increased proportions of children's clinical-level emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior at Wave 2. The total length of school closure was not a significant predictor of subsequent emotional/behavioral problems.

The precision regulation approach can be a helpful approach. It is defined here as a streamlined approach to regulation to deliver the right methods of regulation for the right group of people at the right time. This problem-solving innovation in regulation triggered by the recent epidemiologic crisis in South Korea demonstrates the emergence of the precision regulation approach. South Korea has implemented streamlined fast-track services for the biotechnology industry to produce test kits swiftly.

Bo et al. reported PTSS prevalence of 96.2% among the COVID-19-infected people. The sociocultural and individual vulnerability and protective factors may influence onset and maintenance of the symptoms. However, there is significant lack in understanding the risk factors and preventive factors that influence the maintenance of Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms that defines Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The digital technology gives us the unique opportunity to assess this risk, to monitor and track this evolution longitudinally. In this research project we aimed to design and develop a smartphone application for longitudinal data collection enabling to (1) predict and follow the evolution of PTSS toward PTSD, (2) assess the relative efficacy of several methods to prevent the evolution of PTSS right after exposure to trauma (1-24 h), (3) educate people about psychological effects that can occur during and after trauma, normalize acute distress and refer to professional help if a disorder is constituted. We hope that this research project will help to understand how to maximize the self help support during the acute phase (golden hours) after trauma to prevent the transition from PTSS to PTSD.

Patients of any age may experience negative psychological and physical symptoms during cancer treatment; older adults with cancer simultaneously face the impact of cancer and the effects of aging. Caregivers of older adults with cancer are also vulnerable to experiencing anxiety as their loved one navigates the physical and emotional sequelae of their illness and treatment. This paper describes the use of Managing Anxiety from Cancer (MAC), a 7-session telephone-delivered manualized cognitive-behavioral intervention that includes strategies from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Problem-Solving Therapy, with an older woman with cancer and her adult daughter. MAC includes a variety of techniques for patients and caregivers, who are encouraged to use these strategies individually or in different combinations to manage their anxiety. This brief treatment provided a parallel experience for the participants, as the older adult patient and her caregiver were taught the same anxiety-management techniques by their individual therapists. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using a manualized psychotherapy intervention in this case, as well as MAC's impact on each member of this pair and on the dyad as a unit. Both the patient and her caregiver reported experiencing benefit from their participation in MAC and identified MAC-acquired skills they planned to use in the future to manage their anxiety and improve communication.

The present work addressed the question of how people dealt with stressors during a lockdown period and investigated the role of trait mindfulness and its subcomponents in coping and mental well-being. We recruited a sample of 93 participants to study coping reactions using a multi-wave study over a period of two-months with 13 measurement points. Multilevel analysis revealed that engagement-related coping such as problem-solving was positively related to well-being; the opposite was true for disengagement coping such as blaming. The mindfulness facet orientation towards experience (being open and accepting experiences without judgment) was negatively related to disengagement coping, while the facet self-regulated attention (awareness of the present moment) was positively related to engagement coping. Self-regulated attention but not orientation towards experience was associated with savoring positive aspects of COVID-related changes over time. Engagement-related coping mediated the effects of trait mindfulness on well-being. The findings point to the differential effects of subcomponents of trait mindfulness in the context of coping and mental well-being. Further implications are discussed."

            "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for online counseling to preserve therapeutic processes that have begun face to face and to provide service to others in need during lockdowns. Previous studies underscored the importance of providing updated training as counselors frequently hesitate to use technological advances in therapeutic sessions. This study aims at reducing such barriers by revealing personal characteristics of future professionals that might inhibit or encourage their openness toward providing online counseling. To this end, this study is focused on several precursors of openness to provide online counseling: preference to communicate emotions online, identification of emotional expressiveness advantages in providing online counseling, innovative behavior, creativity, and future problem-solving thinking skills. The question at focus is which constructs would be found contributive to students' openness to provide online counseling. The sample included 277 undergraduate students (future counselors) who filled out questionnaires. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Our findings pointed to the centrality of students' preference to communicate their emotions online in explaining their openness to conducting online counseling. This study might help pinpointing the adjustments curriculum designers should address to better reflect the intensive changes within the counseling field that necessitate transferring face-to-face skills to online settings."

            "abstract": "Congenital viral infections are believed to damage the developing neonatal brain. However, whether neonates exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) show manifestations of such damage remains unclear. For neurodevelopment evaluation, general movement assessments have been shown to be effective in identifying early indicators of neurological dysfunction, including the absence of fidgety movements. This study compared the early motor repertoire by general movement assessment at three to five months of age in neonates who were or were not prenatally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether infants prenatally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of developing neurological disorders. Fifty-six infants, including 28 in the exposed group of mothers without vaccination who had no need for intensive care and likely had SARS-CoV-2 infection close to the time of pregnancy resolution and 28 infants in the nonexposed group, were videotaped to compare their detailed early motor repertoires, in which a motor optimality score-revised (MOS-R) was calculated using Prechtl's method by using the chi-square or Mann-Whitney U tests. In the exposed group, 3 (11%) infants showed the absence of fidgety movements with a total MOS-R<14 points, and 3 (11%) other infants showed abnormal fidgety movements. Between groups, atypical body symmetry (p = 0.009) and MOS-R values were significantly lower (Z = -3.08, p = 0.002), with a large size effect (Cohen's d = 0.97). The consequences of this new virus go beyond the health of the pregnant mother, and these consequences in some of the infants in the exposed group are likely not transitory because of the absence of fidgety movements between 3-5 months; thus, these babies are at increased risk of developing a serious neurological disorder."

Instructors will be able to use our online resource to perform the test remotely, as a supplement to their laboratory classroom, or even under hybrid circumstances. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought many changes, including the way we, as instructors, were able to carry out our educational curricula, since access to laboratory classrooms was not always possible. While COVID-19 restrictions are still in place, and thus access to laboratory classrooms is limited or null, instructors can use our online resource, without the need to set foot in a laboratory classroom. When COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and access to laboratory classrooms is permitted, instructors can follow the procedures we describe and compare their results with ours, which appear in Results and Discussion, or use our data sets as take-home assignments for their students. In addition to its use in detecting the potential mutagenicity of different samples, we have found the Ames test to be extremely useful for developing problem-solving skills by means of exercises like the ones included in this resource. Furthermore, the potential of this test as a starting point for problem-based learning is remarkable. Some suggestions for its use in active learning settings are provided."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential influence of SARS-CoV-2 on infant neurobehavioral development. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, China. Nine pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 9 controls matched by maternal age, parity, and status of chronic disease were included. Infantile neurobehavioral development was assessed through the Ages and Stages Questionnaires Edition 3 (ASQ-3). Results: The majority of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 experienced cesarean section (7 of 9), which was higher than the control group (5 of 9). The throat swabs of all newborn were negative. We found that compared with the control group, neonates of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy had lower scores in communication, gross movement, fine movement, problem solving, and personal-social domains; but only fine movement domain yielded statistical significance (P = 0.031). Conclusion: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy may have a certain impact on infant neurobehavioral development. Further studies with larger sample size are warranted for validation."

Although increases in stress-related symptomatology and other adverse psycho-social outcomes, as well as their most important risk factors have been described, hardly anything is known about potential protective factors. Resilience refers to the maintenance of mental health despite adversity. To gain mechanistic insights about the relationship between described psycho-social resilience factors and resilience specifically in the current crisis, we assessed resilience factors, exposure to Corona crisis-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms in a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 24 languages during the most intense phase of the lockdown in Europe (22 March to 19 April) in a convenience sample of N = 15,970 adults. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (p < 0.0001). The resilience factor PAS also partly mediated the positive association between perceived social support and resilience, and its association with resilience was in turn partly mediated by the ability to easily recover from stress (both p < 0.0001). In comparison with other resilience factors, good stress response recovery and positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis were the strongest factors. Preregistered exploratory subgroup analyses (osf.io/thka9) showed that all tested resilience factors generalize across major socio-demographic categories. This research identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted by public mental health efforts in this and in future pandemics."

This cross-sectional study investigated the associations among self-reported adaptability to the pandemic and personality predispositions (dependency, self-criticism, mattering, and self-esteem), cognitive factors (positive, negative, and loneliness automatic thoughts), loneliness, distress, and mood states. A sample of 462 college students from Israel completed an online questionnaire after 10 weeks of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results confirmed that personality vulnerability factors underscored by a negative sense of self (i.e., self-criticism and dependency) and individual difference factors reflecting self-esteem, feelings of mattering, and fear of not mattering are associated in meaningful ways with adaptability to the pandemic, loneliness, distress, negative mood states, and positive mood states. Most notably, higher self-reported adaptability to the pandemic is associated with lower dependency, self-criticism, and fear of not mattering, and higher levels of self-esteem and mattering. The findings attest to the central role of adaptability and related individual difference factors in acclimatizing to the numerous changes and challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis.

            "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that indicative conditionals like \"If people wear masks, the spread of Covid-19 will be diminished\" require a probabilistic dependency between their antecedents and consequents to be acceptable (Skovgaard-Olsen et al., 2016). But it is easy to make the slip from this claim to the thesis that indicative conditionals are acceptable only if this probabilistic dependency results from a causal relation between antecedent and consequent. According to Pearl (2009), understanding a causal relation involves multiple, hierarchically organized conceptual dimensions: prediction, intervention, and counterfactual dependence. In a series of experiments, we test the hypothesis that these conceptual dimensions are differentially encoded in indicative and counterfactual conditionals. If this hypothesis holds, then there are limits as to how much of a causal relation is captured by indicative conditionals alone. Our results show that the acceptance of indicative and counterfactual conditionals can become dissociated. Furthermore, it is found that the acceptance of both is needed for accepting a causal relation between two co-occurring events. The implications that these findings have for the hypothesis above, and for recent debates at the intersection of the psychology of reasoning and causal judgment, are critically discussed. Our findings are consistent with viewing indicative conditionals as answering predictive queries requiring evidential relevance (even in the absence of direct causal relations). Counterfactual conditionals in contrast target causal relevance, specifically. Finally, we discuss the implications our results have for the yet unsolved question of how reasoners succeed in constructing causal models from verbal descriptions.

In this situation, people tended to think more about current difficulties and their negative consequences due to the fear of infection and changed daily life during quarantine. The aim of this study was to explore the severity of worry in relation to individual characteristics and emotions during COVID-19 outbreak in the Italian people. Socio-demographic questions and standardized self-report questionnaires were administered online. Results highlighted a moderate level of worry, anxiety and distress. People with higher perceptions of COVID-19 severity exhibited higher levels of worry in contrast to those who perceived a greater control over the possibility of infection. Multiple regression analysis indicated that coping styles, emotion regulation strategies and personality traits significantly contributed to explain the variance in worry scores. Findings supported that cognitive reappraisal, emotion-focused coping and extraversion were protective factors for worry, while expressive suppression, dysfunctional and problem-focused coping, and neuroticism were related to high worry. However, neuroticism and dysfunctional coping were particularly important predictors of worry.

Supporting people with intellectual disabilities may be particularly challenging for workers, as some people with intellectual disabilities may have a limited understanding of the pandemic, and find it challenging to adhere to the restrictions imposed by public health guidelines such as social distancing, lockdowns and change in usual routine and activities. In addition, many people with intellectual disabilities have increased vulnerability to more negative effects of COVID-19, with significantly higher mortality rates. Although there is emerging research on the mental health of healthcare staff during this time, there has been little specific work on the mental health of staff working with people with intellectual disability, particularly a lack of qualitative research.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The current study employed semi-structured interviews with 13 healthcare workers (12 women and 1 man) who were working with people with intellectual disability during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interview data were analysed using thematic content analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The participants spoke in depth about the challenges of the working environment, the impact of providing care during the pandemic on staff mental health, supporting staff mental health and wellbeing and learning for the future.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Systematic efforts are required to protect the mental health of this staff cohort, as well as encouraging resilience and successful coping among staff themselves."

            "abstract": "Autistic adults, adults with intellectual disability, and adults with other mental health conditions may have higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing more severe illness from COVID-19 if infected. We used data from Medicaid to look at whether autistic adults and other adults with intellectual disability and other mental health conditions were more likely to have risk factors for COVID-19, such as living in a residential facility, receiving services regularly in the home from outside caregivers, having had a long hospitalization, having had avoidable hospitalizations, and having high-risk health conditions. We found that autistic adults had higher odds of living in a residential facility, receiving in-home services from outside caregivers, having had an avoidable hospitalization, and having a high-risk health condition, compared to neurotypical adults without mental health conditions. Adults with intellectual disability had similar odds of having these conditions. Adults with other mental health conditions were also more likely to live in a residential facility, receive services from outside caregivers, and have had avoidable hospitalizations compared to the neurotypical population without mental health conditions. They had three times higher odds of having a high-risk health condition. High risk of COVID-19 among autistic adults and adults with intellectual disability and mental health conditions should be recognized by clinicians, and these groups should be prioritized for vaccine outreach."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with lifelong impacts and reported trends have revealed a considerable increase in prevalence and incidence. Research had shown that the ASD community provides significant support to its members through Twitter, providing information about their values and perceptions through their use of words and emotional stance. Our purpose was to analyze all the messages posted on Twitter platform regarding ASD and analyze the topics covered within the tweets, to understand the attitude of the various people interested in the topic.

            "abstract": "Training studies extend developmental research beyond single-session lab tasks by evaluating how particular experiences influence developmental changes over time. This methodology is highly interactive and typically requires experimenters to have easy, in-person access to large groups of children. When constraints were placed on in-person data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic, administering this study format in the conventional manner became unfeasible. To implement this type of research under these new circumstances, we devised an alternative approach that enabled us to conduct a live, multi-session training study using a diverse array of activities through an online interface, a task necessitating creative problem solving, since most existing remote methodologies either rely on unsupervised methods or have been limited to single sessions and restricted to a limited number of tasks. The current paper describes the technological and practical adaptations implemented in our online training study of 118 4- and 5-year-old children from a geographically diverse sample. An experimenter interacted with the children once a week for 5 weeks over Zoom. The first and final sessions were dedicated to collecting baseline and post-test measures, while the intermediate 3 weeks were structured as a training designed to teach children specific spatial-cognitive and visuo-motor integration skills. The assessments and training contained image-filled spatial tasks that experimenters shared on their screen, a series of hands-on activities that children completed on their own device and on paper while following experimenters' on-screen demonstrations, and tasks requiring verbal indicators from the parent about their child's response. The remote nature of the study presented a unique set of benefits and limitations that has the potential to inform future virtual child research, as our study used remote behavioral methods to test spatial and visuo-motor integration skills that have typically only been assessed in lab settings. Results are discussed in relation to in-lab studies to establish the viability of testing these skills virtually. As our design entailed continual management of communication issues among researchers, parents, and child participants, strategies for streamlined researcher training, diverse online recruitment, and stimuli creation are also discussed."

            "abstract": "An overly favorable narrative has developed around the role played by digital technologies in containing Covid-19, which oversimplifies the complexity of technology adoption. This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control."

The aim of the current research was to analyze the extent to which these aspects predicted the educational achievement of 9th grade students (mean age 15.4 years) during distance learning, when students had to do relatively more tasks independently, organize their daily learning and deal with problems on their own. Relations between self-assessed problem-solving skills, self-management skills, tests of reasoning abilities and the results of diagnostic tests in Mathematics and Latvian were analyzed for n = 256 and n = 244 students, respectively. The results show that: (1) diagnostic test results in Mathematics are best predicted by the parental education level, fluid nonverbal reasoning and verbal reasoning; (2) the best predictors for the results in the diagnostic test in Latvian are parental education, flexibility to change the solution, fluid nonverbal reasoning and verbal reasoning; (3) self-management cannot significantly predict the results of either of the two tests, although it correlates to the results of the tests in both Mathematics and Latvian; (4) only one of the aspects of problem-solving, flexibility to change the solution, can significantly predict results in diagnostic tests. The results confirm the significance of cognitive abilities as an important predictor of academic achievement, as well as the role of parents' education level. The results also suggest that the flexibility to change the solution, an aspect of problem-solving, might play a role in students' success in academic tests."

To mitigate risks of transmission, and alleviate economic distress associated with containment measures, public health experts and international agencies are calling for community-driven solutions that harness local participation. In slum settlements, such approaches will encounter the informal slum leaders present across cities of the Global South. How are slum leaders positioned to address the health and livelihood threats of the pandemic within their neighborhoods? What problem-solving activities, if any, have they performed for residents during the pandemic? What factors shape success in those efforts? To answer these questions, we conducted a phone survey of 321 slum leaders across 79 slum settlements in two north Indian cities. The survey was conducted in April and May 2020, at the height of India's stringent national lockdown in response to the virus. Our survey reveals striking continuities with pre-pandemic politics. First, slum leaders persist in their problem-solving roles, even as they shift their efforts towards requesting urgently needed government relief (particularly food rations). Second, slum leaders vary in their reported ability to gather information about relief schemes, make claims, and command government responsiveness. The factors that inform the effectiveness of slum leaders during 'normal times', notably their education and degree of embeddedness in party networks, continue to do so during the lockdown. Slum leader reliance on partisan networks raises concerns regarding the inclusiveness of their efforts. Finally, slums are not uniformly challenged in maintaining social distancing. Pre-pandemic disparities in infrastructural development fragment the degree to which residents must depart from social distancing guidelines to secure essential services."

            "abstract": "Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) such as dexamethasone (DEX), while used to mitigate inflammation and disease progression in premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are also associated with significant adverse neurologic effects such as reductions in myelination and abnormalities in neuroanatomical development. Ciclesonide (CIC) is a sGC prodrug approved for asthma treatment that exhibits limited systemic side effects. Carboxylesterases enriched in the lower airways convert CIC to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist des-CIC. We therefore examined whether CIC would likewise activate GR in neonatal lung but have limited adverse extra-pulmonary effects, particularly in the developing brain. Neonatal rats were administered subcutaneous injections of CIC, DEX or vehicle from postnatal days 1-5 (PND1-PND5). Systemic effects linked to DEX exposure, including reduced body and brain weight, were not observed in CIC treated neonates. Furthermore, CIC did not trigger the long-lasting reduction in myelin basic protein expression in the cerebral cortex nor cerebellar size caused by neonatal DEX exposure. Conversely, DEX and CIC were both effective at inducing the expression of select GR target genes in neonatal lung, including those implicated in lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, CIC is a promising, novel candidate drug to treat or prevent BPD in neonates given its activation of GR in neonatal lung and limited adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Furthermore, since sGCs such as DEX administered to pregnant women in pre-term labor can adversely affect fetal brain development, the neurological-sparing properties of CIC, make it an attractive alternative for DEX to treat pregnant women severely ill with respiratory illness, such as with asthma exacerbations or COVID-19 infections."

These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for caregivers logistically.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the telephone during the patient's transitional care period (time when the stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online sessions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with repeated measures.

In the usual care group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line, self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers' burden, knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and changes in stroke survivors' functional abilities and health care use. The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators, barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention.

Severe disease progression is often associated with the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and may require some form of respiratory support, including endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube. These conditions increase the risk of dysphagia, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia. The data on the incidence and risks of dysphagia associated with COVID-19 are not yet available. However, it is assumed that these patients are at high risk, because of respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function. These findings may exacerbate swallowing deficits. The aim of this review is to summarize available information on possible mechanisms of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients. Recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients are described in this contemporary review."

However, steroid administration in the setting of a viral respiratory infection can worsen maternal outcomes. Therefore, the decision to administer corticosteroids must balance the neonatal benefits with the potential harm to the mother if she is infected with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine the gestational ages for which administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at high risk of preterm labor with concurrent COVID-19 infection results in improved combined maternal and infant outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      A decision-analytic model using TreeAge (2020) software was constructed for a theoretical cohort of hospitalized women with COVID-19 in the United States.

We focused on different aspects of sensory processing and used the momentum of a particularly stressful period: during the first months of the global COVID-19 crisis. A total of 116 workers at a mental healthcare institution in The Netherlands completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT). Our results demonstrated that higher scores on sensory sensitivity and low registration were associated with higher scores on perceived stress and core burnout symptoms. Sensory hypersensitivity was also associated with more secondary burnout symptoms. Associations were not driven by underlying sensory-related disorders (e.g., ASD or ADHD). In conclusion, sensory processing difficulties are relevant predictors of stress and occupational burnout, also in healthy employees. This phenomenon warrants further attention, as relatively simple adjustments in working environment may possess important preventive effects."

Starting from the well-known \"pandemic effect\" on sleep and dreaming, we presented a picture of dream activity in pharmacologically treated NT1 patients during the Italian lockdown. Forty-three NT1 patients completed a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 matched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed greater sleepiness than controls; (b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances than NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 was controlled; (c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than controls. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare frequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher intrasleep wakefulness; (b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency were positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 lucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams reported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially concerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. Moreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients. Considering the small sample size and the cross-sectional design, our findings cannot provide a causal relationship between lucid dreams and the COVID-19 lockdown.

            "abstract": "As the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, engaging the public in adherence to precautionary measures for preventing COVID-19 spread or infection becomes difficult. The present study aims to extend our understanding of how illness perceptions, coping, and self-efficacy affect adherence to precautionary measures among the public. An online survey was administered between April and June 2020 to a sample of 514 Hong Kong citizens. Variables considered were illness perceptions toward COVID-19, problem-solving, avoidance-based coping, self-efficacy, as well as adherence to precautionary measures including physical distancing, limiting unnecessary travelling, and washing hands regularly with soap and water. Adjusted structural equation model showed that illness perceptions toward COVID-19 had significant direct effect on their adherence to precautionary measures (unstandardized β = 0.50, [95% CI, 0.28, 0.80], p = 0.001), and indirect effects through avoidance-based coping (β = -0.10 [95% CI, -0.26, -0.01], p = 0.016) and self-efficacy (β = -0.10, [95% CI, -0.18, -0.01], p = 0.025). These results imply that apart from emphasizing the health hazards of a novel infectious disease, an effective public health intervention and crisis communication should address avoidance-based coping and self-efficacy of the public in adherence to precautionary measures for COVID-19."

We examined the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in an induced usual interstitial pneumonia (iUIP) mouse model and patients with IPF as well as the changes in whole-lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression under physiological conditions caused by viral infection. Histopathological and biochemical characteristics were analyzed using human specimens from patients with IPF and precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from iUIP mouse model showing UIP with honeycombing and severe fibrosis after non-specific interstitial pneumonia. ACE2 expression decreased with acute lung inflammation and increased in the abnormal lung epithelium of the iUIP mouse model. ACE2 is also expressed in metaplastic epithelial cells. Poly(I:C), interferons, and cytokines associated with fibrosis decreased ACE2 expression in PCLS in the iUIP model. Hypoxia also decreases ACE2 via HIF1α in PCLS. Antifibrotic agent, nintedanib attenuates ACE2 expression in invasive epithelial cells. Patients with IPF are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the high expression of ACE2. However, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is decreased by immune intermediaries, including interferons and cytokines that are associated with viral infection and upon administration of antifibrotic agents, suggesting that most of the viral infection-induced pathophysiological responses aid the development of resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Using adapted measures from the CRISIS questionnaire, parents of children aged 6-18 (N = 1013; 56% male; 62% pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis) and self-reporting children/adolescents aged 10-18 (N = 385) indicated changes in mental health across six domains: depression, anxiety, irritability, attention, hyperactivity, and obsessions/compulsions. Changes in anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity were calculated for children aged 2-5 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. COVID-19 exposure, compliance with emergency measures, COVID-19 economic concerns, and stress from social isolation were measured with the CRISIS questionnaire. Prevalence of change in mental health status was estimated for each domain; multinomial logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with mental health status change in each domain. Depending on the age group, 67-70% of children/adolescents experienced deterioration in at least one mental health domain; however, 19-31% of children/adolescents experienced improvement in at least one domain. Children/adolescents without and with psychiatric diagnoses tended to experience deterioration during the first wave of COVID-19. Rates of deterioration were higher in those with a pre-exiting diagnosis. The rate of deterioration was variable across different age groups and pre-existing psychiatric diagnostic groups: depression 37-56%, anxiety 31-50%, irritability 40-66%, attention 40-56%, hyperactivity 23-56%, obsessions/compulsions 13-30%. Greater stress from social isolation was associated with deterioration in all mental health domains (all ORs 11.12-55.24). The impact of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis was heterogenous, associated with deterioration in depression, irritability, hyperactivity, obsession/compulsions for some children (ORs 1.96-2.23) but also with improvement in depression, anxiety, and irritability for other children (ORs 2.13-3.12). Economic concerns were associated with improvement in anxiety, attention, and obsessions/compulsions (ORs 3.97-5.57). Children/adolescents with and without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses reported deterioration. Deterioration was associated with increased stress from social isolation.

However, among people who categorized their overall hearing as \"Excellent\" or \"Good,\" younger adults rated their speech understanding ability in noisy situations as poorer than middle-age or older adults. Among people who rated their overall hearing as \"Fair\" or \"Poor,\" middle-age adults indicated having more difficulty communicating with people using face masks, as compared with older adults. Examination of open-ended responses suggested that the strategies individuals use when communicating with people wearing face masks vary by age and self-rated hearing.

Many seeking help for ADHD face prejudice, long waiting lists, and patchy or unavailable services, and are turning to service-user support groups and/or private healthcare for help. Methods: A group of UK experts representing clinical and healthcare providers from public and private healthcare, academia, ADHD patient groups, educational, and occupational specialists, met to discuss shortfalls in ADHD service provision in the UK. Discussions explored causes of under-diagnosis, examined biases operating across referral, diagnosis and treatment, together with recommendations for resolving these matters. Results: Cultural and structural barriers operate at all levels of the healthcare system, resulting in a de-prioritization of ADHD. Services for ADHD are insufficient in many regions, and problems with service provision have intensified as a result of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research has established a range of adverse outcomes of untreated ADHD, and associated long-term personal, social, health and economic costs are high. The consensus group called for training of professionals who come into contact with people with ADHD, increased funding, commissioning and monitoring to improve service provision, and streamlined communication between health services to support better outcomes for people with ADHD. Conclusions: Evidence-based national clinical guidelines for ADHD are not being met. People with ADHD should have access to healthcare free from discrimination, and in line with their legal rights.

            "abstract": "Despite the tremendous success of X-ray cryo-crystallography in recent decades, the transfer of crystals from the drops in which they are grown to diffractometer sample mounts remains a manual process in almost all laboratories. Here, the Shifter, a motorized, interactive microscope stage that transforms the entire crystal-mounting workflow from a rate-limiting manual activity to a controllable, high-throughput semi-automated process, is described. By combining the visual acuity and fine motor skills of humans with targeted hardware and software automation, it was possible to transform the speed and robustness of crystal mounting. Control software, triggered by the operator, manoeuvres crystallization plates beneath a clear protective cover, allowing the complete removal of film seals and thereby eliminating the tedium of repetitive seal cutting. The software, either upon request or working from an imported list, controls motors to position crystal drops under a hole in the cover for human mounting at a microscope. The software automatically captures experimental annotations for uploading to the user's data repository, removing the need for manual documentation. The Shifter facilitates mounting rates of 100-240 crystals per hour in a more controlled process than manual mounting, which greatly extends the lifetime of the drops and thus allows a dramatic increase in the number of crystals retrievable from any given drop without loss of X-ray diffraction quality. In 2015, the first in a series of three Shifter devices was deployed as part of the XChem fragment-screening facility at Diamond Light Source, where they have since facilitated the mounting of over 120 000 crystals. The Shifter was engineered to have a simple design, providing a device that could be readily commercialized and widely adopted owing to its low cost. The versatile hardware design allows use beyond fragment screening and protein crystallography."

The amended research methods were implemented without risk for virus transmission or undue burden on the research team, participant, or caregiver. Recruitment was likely impacted by the coronavirus-mediated quarantine, plausibly resulting in bias. Objective physical activity data collection can be sufficiently modified to protect those with intellectual disabilities and investigators. Future research designs may require greater participant incentives and the creation of in-home participation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Many professional services were pressed to adopt telepractice in response to the global coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The need to adopt a new service delivery approach quickly created different implementation challenges. This study explored the lived experiences of frontline clinicians who successfully transitioned their in-person speech-language therapy services to telepractice through an implementation science lens.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was conducted in partnership with one publicly funded program in Ontario, Canada that offers services to preschoolers with speech, language and communication disorders. Sixteen frontline speech-language pathologists and assistants at this organization shared their lived experience transitioning to telepractice during the pandemic during videoconference interviews. A narrative inquiry approach was used to analyze interview transcripts to identify the processes (or steps) this program took to implement telepractice and to understand the facilitators and barriers to telepractice implementation during the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The following six stages were identified from clinicians' narratives: abrupt lockdown; weeks of uncertainty; telepractice emerged as an option; preparation for telepractice; telepractice trials; and finally, full implementation of telepractice. The stages of events offered significant insights into how government public health measures influenced clinicians' decisions and their processes of adopting telepractice. In terms of barriers, clinicians reported a lack of knowledge, skills and experience with telepractice and a lack of technological support. The organization's learning climate and team approach to transitioning services were identified as the main facilitator of implementation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Findings suggest a need for better coordination of public health measures and professional services, which would have eased clinicians' stress and facilitated an earlier transition to telepractice. Fostering an organization's learning climate may improve organization's resilience in response to emergency situations."

Specifically, we sought to describe telehealth neurodevelopmental evaluations, examine associations between child characteristics and diagnostic factors, determine the impact of technology and family barriers, and report on clinician and caregiver satisfaction with telehealth evaluation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person clinical services at a large children's hospital neurodevelopmental clinic were transitioned to telehealth. Data are presented for 254 remote evaluations of children (18-212 months; referral concern: 51% autism spectrum disorder [ASD], 24% developmental delay/intellectual disability, 25% other neurodevelopmental concern) conducted from May to July 2020. Data were gathered from electronic health records as well as clinician and caregiver surveys.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A clinical diagnosis was provided in 72% of telehealth evaluations. Clinicians rated diagnostic certainty as \"completely\" or \"somewhat\" certain in 74% of evaluations. Certainty ratings were higher for evaluations in which a diagnosis of ASD was provided. Although technology and family challenges were reported, clinicians rarely identified these as disruptive to the evaluation process. Clinicians reported satisfaction with various aspects of delivering telehealth.

            "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) is mediated by activation of inflammatory pathways resulting in increased levels of cytokines and chemokines that cross the placental and blood-brain barriers altering fetal neural development. Maternal viral infection is one of the most well-known causes for immune activation in pregnant women. MIA and immune abnormalities are key players in the etiology of developmental conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression. Experimental evidence implicating MIA in with different effects in the offspring is complex. For decades, scientists have relied on either MIA models or human epidemiological data or a combination of both. MIA models are generated using infection/pathogenic agents to induce an immunological reaction in rodents and monitor the effects. Human epidemiological studies investigate a link between maternal infection and/or high levels of cytokines in pregnant mothers and the likelihood of developing conditions. In this review, we discuss the importance of understanding the relationship between virus-mediated MIA and neurodevelopmental conditions, focusing on autism and schizophrenia. We further discuss the different methods of studying MIA and their limitations and focus on the different factors contributing to MIA heterogeneity."

Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency. Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals."

Mutation of ADAR1 leads to a severe neurodevelopmental and inflammatory disease of children, Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome. In mice, Adar1 mutations are embryonic lethal but are rescued by mutation of the Mda5 or Mavs genes, which function in IFN induction. However, the specific IFN regulated proteins responsible for the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 mutation are unknown. We show that the cell-lethal phenotype of ADAR1 deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells is rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the RNASEL gene or by expression of the RNase L antagonist, murine coronavirus NS2 accessory protein. Our result demonstrate that ablation of RNase L activity promotes survival of ADAR1 deficient cells even in the presence of MDA5 and MAVS, suggesting that the RNase L system is the primary sensor pathway for endogenous dsRNA that leads to cell death."

SSE's potential in delaying cognitive decline in older adults seems to be promising. However, there is scarce research on the SSE program with young adults. Furthermore, the outbreak of coronavirus disease has imposed people to change their lifestyle and behaviors, including exercise behaviors. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of a home-based online SSE trial on cognitive and social functions in sedentary young adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 18 young adults (6 males, 12 females) participated in the present study.

This transition is termed \"care leaving\" and the young people in transition \"care leavers\". The care leaving transition can be particularly difficult for young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism.

In addition to remote working, parents have had to monitor their children's schoolwork and manage their daily lives. When one of the children also has neuro-developmental disorders, this results in an increased burden. We can therefore wonder how these families with one or more young children (under 6 years old) with special needs have experienced and dealt with this lockdown.\n    \n\n\n          Aim of the study:\n        \n      \n      In this context, the \"COVJEUNENFANT\" study focused more specifically on the subjective experience, as a parent, of those who cared for children with special needs (i.e., with developmental disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, proven disabilities or chronic health conditions) compared to the general population.

Intrauterine viral infections induce an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which inhibit the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. Whether a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the present study is to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy. ## Methods\nIn this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopment status of infants (N=298) born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10-12 months post discharge using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were classified into developmental delays (cutoff score: ≤2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean) and no delay (score >2 SDs above the population mean). ## Results\nApproximately 10% of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy showed developmental delays. Two of 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P=0.039) and second trimesters (P=0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester. Infants born at <31 weeks gestation were more prone to developmental delays than those born at >31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002). ## Conclusion\nThe findings of the study highlight the need for long term neurodevelopmental assessment of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection."

            "abstract": "Faces hold a substantial value for effective social interactions and sharing. Covering faces with masks, due to COVID-19 regulations, may lead to difficulties in using social signals, in particular, in individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. Daily-life social participation of individuals who were born preterm is of immense importance for their quality of life. Here we examined face tuning in individuals (aged 12.79 ± 1.89 years) who were born preterm and exhibited signs of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a dominant form of brain injury in preterm birth survivors. For assessing the face sensitivity in this population, we implemented a recently developed experimental tool, a set of Face-n-Food images bordering on the style of Giuseppe Arcimboldo. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Although a coarse face schema is thought to be hardwired in the brain, former preterms exhibit substantial shortages in the face tuning not only compared with typically developing controls but also with individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. The lack of correlations between the face sensitivity and other cognitive abilities indicates that these deficits are domain-specific. This underscores impact of preterm birth sequelae for social functioning at large. Comparison of the findings with data in individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions provides novel insights into the origins of deficient face processing."

            "abstract": "Videolaryngoscopy screening is essential to help assessing human larynx. The use of 70° optical fiber in association with image recording by analog or digital cameras is one of the methods adopted to perform this examination. Endoscopic exams can contaminate the equipment with several microorganisms. The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus reinforces the importance of developing efficient barrier methods to be adopted in videolaryngoscopy procedures. Although dental intraoral camera covers are a barrier method authorized by Brazilian health organs, it has not yet been used in videolaryngoscopy examinations. The aim of the current longitudinal, individualized, single-blind, prospective, self-controlled, and accurate study is to evaluate the quality of images generated through, and confidence level of, diagnosis based on videolaryngoscopy performed with intraoral dental camera equipped with disposable protection cap and connected to 70° rigid laryngoscope in vocally healthy individuals. Videolaryngoscopy examinations based on 70° rigid optics were performed in 13 euphonic and asymptomatic volunteers at an otorhinolaryngology specialist clinic; only 1 patient was excluded from the study. Images were taken with, and without, disposable intraoral dental camera protection cap; high-grade disinfection protocol was applied between examinations. Recorded videos were randomly distributed in a single-blind manner in order to be evaluated by four otorhinolaryngologists, who answered a questionnaire comprising three questions. Statistical analysis was used to compare groups - which were defined by the use, or not, of protection cap - based on Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Statistical significance was set at 5% with 95% confidence interval. There was no statistically significant difference in image quality between examinations performed with, and without, protection cap (P= 0.646) or in the diagnosis confidence level of examinations performed with, or without, the barrier method. The use of disposable protection cap on intraoral dental camera did not significantly change the quality of images taken through videolaryngoscopy performed with 70° rigid optics in vocally healthy patients."

A scoping review was conducted to identify pandemic related demands experienced by caregivers and families of autistic children and youth. The review also consolidated information on coping strategies and parenting-related guidelines that have emerged to help parents meet these demands. Search strategies were approved by a research librarian and were conducted in peer-reviewed and gray literature databases between May 2020 and February 2021. Additional resources were solicited through author networks and social media. All articles were published between December 2019 and February 2021. Article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted with confirmation of findings with our knowledge users. Twenty-three published articles and 14 pieces of gray literature were included in the review. The majority of articles characterized and highlighted the increase in demands on caregivers of autistic children and youth during the pandemic globally. Both quantitative and qualitative studies suggest that parents have experienced an increase in stress and mental health-related symptoms during lockdown measures. Findings suggest that families are employing coping strategies, but there no evidence-based supports were identified. The review highlighted the potential long-term impact of prolonged exposure to increasing demands on the mental health and wellbeing of caregivers and families of autistic people, and pointed to a need for the rapid development and evaluation of flexible and timely support programs. LAY SUMMARY: Caregivers and families of autistic children and youth have faced increased demands due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. We reviewed the literature to outline sources of stress, links to their influence on caregiver mental health, and if support programs have emerged to help them. Our findings suggest a number of demands have increased caregivers' risk to mental health challenges, and their potential impact on family wellbeing. Ongoing development of evidence-based supports of all families of autistic children and youth are needed."

The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public. Public health workers should be trained to effectively and empathetically instruct users on how to use the CoronaMelder app."

This study, using data from five hospitals in Ireland, examines changes in the number and type of paediatric admissions during COVID-19 (March 2020 - February 2021) compared to the previous two years. ICD-10 classification was used to establish admissions with mental, behavioural, neuro-developmental disorders and psychosocial reasons (MBN-PS). Overall hospital admissions fell by 25.3%, while MBN-PS fell by only 2.6%, mostly during an initial lockdown. Admissions for MBN-PS increased in July-August (9.2%), increased further in September-December (28.3%), returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in January-February 2021. Significant increases were observed among youths with anorexia nervosa (47.8%), other eating disorders (42.9%), and admissions for anxiety (29.6%), with these effects relating to females only. Although admissions for self-harm increased (3%) and rates of ASD admissions reduced (17%), these were not statistically significant. The disproportionate increase in admissions for MBN-PS compared to medical admissions suggests an adverse effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health, for females in particular, and supports previous reports of a pandemic specific increase in eating psychopathology.

Owing medicines that were reported for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, this review suggested some control strategies like treatments (medicinal plants, antiviral therapy, cellular therapy, and immunotherapy), nutrition uptake, prevention, and recommendations. This overview showed that severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stage of pregnancy might increase the risk of stress, panic, and anxiety. This disorder can disturb the maternal immune system, and thus causing a neurodevelopmental disturbance. This hypothesis may be depending on the severity and intensity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dams to their fetuses is absent until now. During this global pandemic disease, maintaining safety during pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and breastfeeding may play a vital role in a healthy life for the offspring.

            "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on high school students' psychological symptoms and to understand how ready counselors and school counseling services are based on the data we have. Therefore, this research is designed under two different studies: (A) Study 1: Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on students' psychological symptoms and (B) Study 2: Views and expectations of students and school counselors about school counseling services. The first study was a quantitative study and included 549 high school students (398 female, 151 male). A structural equation model (SEM) was created to examine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on participants' psychological symptoms. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores showed that 107 (19.50%) individuals had a score of 50 and above pointing out that individuals in this group had severe impact of event/trauma symptomologies. The SEM analysis indicated that IES-R scores had a total effect of 0.79 on anxiety, 0.75 on depression, 0.74 on negative self-concept, 0.68 on somatization, and 0.66 on hostility scores. Furthermore, female students had significantly higher scores on anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, somatization, hostility, and impact of events variables than male students. Study 2 was a qualitative design and consisted of five school counselors and five students from different schools. The results indicated that students' difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak were educational, cognitive, emotional, physiological, relational, technological, and related to routines. Academic, social, emotional, and behavioral issues came to the fore among the difficulties that can be experienced if students start face-to-face education. On the other hand, the school counselors listed that family relations, personal-social, emotional, and academic themes were the difficulties experienced by the students at the beginning of the COVID-19. In addition, when COVID-19 started, the services offered by school counselors were discussed under (1) services for the student, (2) services for the family, and (3) services for the teacher. Finally, according to the opinions of the school counselors, if students start face-to-face education, they may experience emotional, academic, and relational difficulties. In summary, it is vital that student personality services be prepared and implemented by school counseling services for schools based on the results."

Grounded in Mezirow's transformative learning theory, this research explores whether pandemic-related emergency remote teaching manifested as a \"disorienting dilemma\" for technology educators. Teachers negotiated curricular outcomes between physical aspects of making and doing, as well as creative problem solving through design, resulting in a pandemic transformed pedagogy. Thematic analysis revealed that making and doing was severely challenged due to decreased communication, student motivation, and engagement. However, most concerning to educators was the heightened disparity in equity and access in their most vulnerable and at-risk students. In conditions of fear and trauma, little is known about the impact a chaotic way of being has on learners and educators. While we cannot predict what the \"new normal\" will look like for schools, and what the long-term effects of emergency remote teaching will be, our research demonstrates that the disorienting dilemma COVID-19 presents will continue to shape the pandemic transformed pedagogy of technology educators."

The need for pediatric neuropsychologists to efficiently screen for learning disorders is likely to increase in the months and years following the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely disrupted access to educational services, especially for children who also face racial and economic disparities. In this paper, we describe a consultation model that can be used to screen for learning disorders and can be completed using both in-person and telemedicine visits. Implementation may result in earlier intervention for struggling children, increase access to neuropsychological services without increasing wait times for comprehensive evaluations, and provide opportunities for collaborations with other health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, therapists, psychiatrists, and neurologists)."

Within occupational therapy, university education programs traditionally delivered in face-to-face classroom, and clinical settings, the transition to online learning presented unique issues and challenges for faculty and students. This study compared the experiences and perceptions of learning in two groups of occupational therapy students during the pandemic: one group converted to online learning only and the other had a blended approach that combined face-to-face on-campus learning with some online lecture content delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred and eight (n = 208) undergraduate occupational therapy students from three Australian universities completed an online self-report demographic questionnaire and two standardised instruments: the Student Engagement in the e-Learning Environment Scale and the Distance Education Learning Environment Scale.

The shift to telehealth assessments has challenged clinicians to reconsider approaches and assumptions that underlie the diagnostic assessment process, and to adopt new ways of individualizing standard assessments according to family and child needs. Mandates for physical distancing have uncovered deficiencies in diagnostic practices for suspected autism and have illuminated biases that have posed obstacles preventing children and families from receiving the services that they truly need.

LAY SUMMARY: Physical distancing and the abrupt end to in-person services for many children on the autism spectrum has forced clinicians to examine the existing challenges with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment and consider things they want to keep and things that should be changed in the years ahead. New approaches such as telehealth both alleviated and exacerbated existing disparities, and brought into stark focus the importance of equitable and timely access to family-centered care. This commentary suggests ways of improving clinical practices related to ASD assessment to continue along this path."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to important challenges in health and education service delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      The present study aimed to document: (i) changes in the use of telepractice by speech-language pathology (SLP) professionals in Quebec since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) perceptions of the feasibility of telepractice by SLPs; (iii) barriers to the use of telepractice; and (iv) the perceptions of SLP professionals regarding the main issues of telepractice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods & procedures:\n        \n      \n      An online survey with closed and open, Likert scale and demographic questions was completed by 83 SLPs in Quebec in June and July 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Outcomes & results:\n        \n      \n      The survey responses showed that within the cohort responding, telepractice use has increased significantly as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents planned to continue using telepractice after the pandemic ends. In addition, the respondents considered telepractice to be adequate for many clinical practices but less so for others (e.g., swallowing disorders, hearing impairment). Most of the reported barriers to the use of telepractice concerned technological problems and a lack of clinical materials for online use. Confidentiality and privacy issues were also raised.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions & implications:\n        \n      \n      SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. The discrepancy between their perceptions and the evidence in the literature for some practices and populations strengthens the need for more information and education on telepractice.\n    \n\n\n          What this paper adds:\n        \n      \n      What is already known on the subject The proportion of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in Canada who use telepractice for clinical activities is unknown. Knowing this information became crucial in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because non-essential activities were interrupted to halt the spread of the disease. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The findings from this survey study confirmed that the use of telepractice in SLP in Quebec increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the majority of the respondents began using telepractice because of the pandemic, and most planned to continue doing so after it ends. This demonstrates how SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Although the SLPs expressed an overall positive perception of telepractice, they also highlighted barriers to its optimal use. The findings of this study should help employers and regulatory bodies in Quebec to bring down those barriers and make telepractice in SLP a durable, effective and efficient service delivery model."

            "abstract": "Circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in significant personal and professional adjustments. Students and trainees, including those in autism research, face unique challenges to accomplishing their training and career goals during this unprecedented time. In this commentary, we, as members of the International Society for Autism Research Student and Trainee Committee, describe our personal experiences, which may or may not align with those of other students and trainees. Our experiences have varied both in terms of the ease (or lack thereof) with which we adapted and the degree to which we were supported in the transition to online research and clinical practice. We faced and continue to adjust to uncertainties about future training and academic positions, for which opportunities have been in decline and have subsequently negatively impacted our mental health. Students and trainees' prospects have been particularly impacted compared to more established researchers and faculty. In addition to the challenges we have faced, however, there have also been unexpected benefits in our training during the pandemic, which we describe here. We have learned new coping strategies which, we believe, have served us well. The overarching goal of this commentary is to describe these experiences and strategies in the hope that they will benefit the autism research community moving forward. Here, we provide a set of recommendations for faculty, especially mentors, to support students and trainees as well as strategies for students and trainees to bolster their self-advocacy, both of which we see as crucial for our future careers. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected students and trainees, including those in autism research, in different ways. Here, we describe our personal experiences. These experiences include challenges. For example, it has been difficult to move from in-person to online work. It has also been difficult to keep up with work and training goals. Moreover, working from home has made it hard to connect with our supervisors and mentors. As a result, many of us have felt unsure about how to make the best career choices. Working in clinical services and getting to know and support our patients online has also been challenging. Overall, the pandemic has made us feel more isolated and some of us have struggled to cope with that. On the other hand, our experiences have also included benefits. For example, by working online, we have been able to join meetings all over the world. Also, the pandemic has pushed us to learn new skills. Those include technical skills but also skills for well-being. Next, we describe our experiences of returning to work. Finally, we give recommendations for trainees and supervisors on how to support each other and to build a strong community."

            "abstract": "The risk of viral infection during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many hospitals to prohibit all patient visitors, including family caregivers for people with intellectual disabilities. Drawing on a postmodern, intersubjective view of the body, as well as my experience as the mother of a young adult with profound disabilities, I argue that caregiver knowledge while unconventional within the medical paradigm must be viewed as essential expertise. People with profound intellectual disabilities often have concurrent, complex medical issues that are complicated by their inability to self-advocate. Optimal care rests upon the ongoing presence and expertise of their primary caregiver. Medical professionals risk patient care by excluding the essential expertise of family caregivers at any time, and specifically during COVID-19."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to the social life and care of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), which could potentially worsen mental health problems. We used baseline data of the PRIME-NL study (N = 844) to examine whether the association between COVID-19 stressors and mental health is disproportionately large in specific subgroups of people with PD and to explore effects of hypothetical reductions in COVID-19 stressors on mental health and quality of life. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 70.3 (7.8) years and 321 (38.0%) were women. The linear regression effect estimate of the association of COVID-19 stressors with mental health was most pronounced in women, highly educated people, people with advanced PD and people prone to distancing or seeking social support. Smaller effect estimates were found in people scoring high on confrontive coping or planful problem solving. The parametric G-formula method was used to calculate the effects of hypothetical interventions on COVID-19 stressors. An intervention reducing stressors with 50% in people with above median MDS-UPDRS-II decreased the Beck Depression Inventory in this group from 14.7 to 10.6, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory from 81.6 to 73.1 and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire from 35.0 to 24.3. Insights from this cross-sectional study help to inform tailored care interventions to subgroups of people with PD most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of life."

            "abstract": "Inflammation, due to infectious pathogens or other non-infectious stimuli, during pregnancy is associated with elevated risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Although historically identified through retrospective epidemiologic studies, the relationship between maternal immune activation and offspring neurodevelopmental disease risk is now well established because of clinical studies which utilized prospective birth cohorts, serologically confirmed infection records, and subsequent long-term offspring follow-up. These efforts have been corroborated by preclinical research which demonstrates anatomical, biochemical, and behavioural alterations that resemble the clinical features of psychiatric illnesses. Intervention studies further demonstrate causal roles of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, in these long-lasting changes in behaviour and brain. This review summarizes a selection of maternal immune activation literature that explores the relationship between these inflammatory mediators and the neuropsychiatric-like effects later observed in the offspring. This literature is presented alongside emerging information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, with discussion of how these data may inform future research regarding the effects of the present coronavirus pandemic on emerging birth cohorts."

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, frontal and bedside teaching was interrupted. Therefore, we decided to provide distant teaching until having the opportunity to resume clinical bedside teaching. A team of tutors composed a course of weekly units, each week assigned to a different subject in internal medicine. A total of 120 students were divided into 15 groups of 8 students, each group guided by a personal tutor. The format of each unit included online pretest, clinical virtual cases and two separate 2 hour ZOOM sessions with the tutor. The pretest was based on 1-3 chapters from Harrison's Internal Medicine textbook, 20th edition, and consisted of both clinical reasoning and knowledge questions. During ZOOM sessions with the tutor, the students practiced clinical problem solving. In addition, all the students were granted free access to the commercial \"Aquifer\" case-based virtual course for more practice. The students' feedback at the end of the learning period revealed that, although frustrated in being away from the clinics, the overall level of satisfaction from the course was good (rated 5 or 4/5 by 65% of responders) and the time was used efficiently. In conclusion, the students received a positive proactive learning experience of both theoretical aspects and clinical reasoning skills in internal medicine. There is no doubt that bedside teaching in medicine is invaluable and can't be replaced by any other means, however, given the circumstances, our format provided a reasonable temporary alternative."

The purpose of this paper is to illuminate tourists' motivations, perceived constraints, and negotiation strategies to participate in outdoor recreation trips, within the current COVID-19 context. To explore and categorize motivating factors, constraints, and negotiation strategies, we employed a qualitative approach via semi-structured online focus group discussion with 16 tourists (mostly residents of Utah, United States) during late summer 2020. First, COVID-19 related restrictions and fewer opportunities to go outdoors were found to encourage outdoor recreation, for novelty-seeking and experiencing normalcy. Through content analysis, we found that tourists experience a blend of personal, social, practical, and ethical constraints. Additionally, we identified how tourists negotiate their constraints through different ways: by extensive planning and information searching, avoiding crowds, and changing leisure aspirations. Finally, we discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the study, followed by recommendations for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Management implications:\n        \n      \n      Understanding of tourists' motivations, constraints, and negotiation strategies-relevant to outdoor recreation trips-provides several managerial implications to destination managers and marketers, as outlined below:•Lack of centralized and reliable information was frequently cited as a constraint in the focus group discussions.

In this manuscript, we describe methods developed for remote assessment of a parent child cohort with a focus on examining the perinatal environment, behavioral and biological indicators of child neurobehavioral development, parent-child interaction, as well as parent and child mental and physical health. We include recommendations relevant to adapting in-laboratory assessments for remote data collection and conclude with a description of the successful dissemination of the methods to eight research sites across the United States, each of whom are involved in Phase 1 of the HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study. These remote methods were born out of pandemic-related necessity; however, they have much wider applicability and may offer advantages over in-laboratory neurodevelopmental assessments."

            "abstract": "Prior research suggests that the pandemic coronavirus pushes all the \"hot spots\" for risk perceptions, yet both governments and populations have varied in their responses. As the economic impacts of the pandemic have become salient, governments have begun to slash their budgets for mitigating other global risks, including climate change, likely imposing increased future costs from those risks. Risk analysts have long argued that global environmental and health risks are inseparable at some level, and must ultimately be managed systemically, to effectively increase safety and welfare. In contrast, it has been suggested that we have worry budgets, in which one risk crowds out another. \"In the wild,\" our problem-solving strategies are often lexicographic; we seek and assess potential solutions one at a time, even one attribute at a time, rather than conducting integrated risk assessments. In a U.S. national survey experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to coronavirus or climate change surveys (N = 3203) we assess risk perceptions, and whether risk perception \"hot spots\" are driving policy preferences, within and across these global risks. Striking parallels emerge between the two. Both risks are perceived as highly threatening, inequitably distributed, and not particularly controllable. People see themselves as somewhat informed about both risks and have moral concerns about both. In contrast, climate change is seen as better understood by science than is pandemic coronavirus. Further, individuals think they can contribute more to slowing or stopping pandemic coronavirus than climate change, and have a greater moral responsibility to do so. Survey assignment influences policy preferences, with higher support for policies to control pandemic coronavirus in pandemic coronavirus surveys, and higher support for policies to control climate change risks in climate change surveys. Across all surveys, age groups, and policies to control either climate change or pandemic coronavirus risks, support is highest for funding research on vaccines against pandemic diseases, which is the only policy that achieves majority support in both surveys. Findings bolster both the finite worry budget hypothesis and the hypothesis that supporters of policies to confront one threat are disproportionately likely also to support policies to confront the other threat."

In this article, we highlight the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing COVID-19) on the central nervous system as there is an urgent need to understand the longitudinal impacts of COVID-19 on brain function, behaviour and cognition. Furthermore, we address the possibility of intergenerational impacts of COVID-19 on the brain, potentially via both maternal and paternal routes. Evidence from preclinical models of earlier coronaviruses has shown direct viral infiltration across the blood-brain barrier and indirect secondary effects due to other organ pathology and inflammation. In the most severely ill patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care, there appears to be additional severe inflammatory response and associated thrombophilia with widespread organ damage, including the brain. Maternal viral (and other) infections during pregnancy can affect the offspring, with greater incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Available reports suggest possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although longitudinal cohort studies of such offspring are needed. The impact of paternal infection on the offspring and intergenerational effects should also be considered. Research targeted at mechanistic insights into all aspects of pathogenesis, including neurological, neuropsychiatric and haematological systems alongside pulmonary pathology, will be critical in informing future therapeutic approaches. With these future challenges in mind, we highlight the importance of national and international collaborative efforts to gather the required clinical and preclinical data to effectively address the possible long-term sequelae of this global pandemic, particularly with respect to the brain and mental health."

Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the degree of severity of six emotional and mood states (sadness, boredom, little enjoyment/interest, irritability, temper tantrums, anxiety) and five disrupted behaviours (verbal and physical aggression, argument, opposition, restlessness) based on their frequency/week (absent; low: 1-2 days/week; moderate: 3-4 days/week; severe: 5-7 days/week) before and during the lockdown. Important fluctuations were found in all dimensions during the lockdown independently by the severity degree. Subjects with previous low severity degree of these behaviors significantly worsened in almost all dimensions during the lockdown. On the contrary, ADHD patients with moderate and severe degree showed important improvement during the lockdown. Little enjoyment/interests and boredom resulted the dimensions more strongly affected by the condition of restriction, overall in children. Children vs. adolescents showed substantially similar trend but the former resulted significantly more vulnerable to emotive changes. The results provided both the individuation of domains affected, and the indirect benefits produced by restriction condition."

This study asked caregivers about their perceptions of how COVID-19 impacted them and the people they support. Method: An online survey was conducted in 12 countries during August-September 2020 and sought information on demographics, support practices, information and training, experiences of COVID-19, social distancing, and wellbeing, as measured by the DASS12. This study reports on 3,754 family members, direct support professionals, and managers who participated in the survey. Results: Caregivers observed increases in depression/anxiety, stereotyped behaviours, aggression towards others and weight gain in the person(s) they supported. They also reported difficulties supporting the person(s) to access healthcare. Families reported reducing or ceasing employment and absorbed additional costs when supporting their family member. Direct support professionals experienced changes in staff shifts, staff absences, increased workload and hiring of casual staff. Caregivers' wellbeing revealed high levels of stress, depression, and less so anxiety. The strongest predictor of wellbeing among families was observation of changes in mood in the person(s) they supported, while for direct support professionals, the strongest predictors of wellbeing were reorganisation of staff shifts and increases in new direct support staff.

In the current scenario, the work of community healthcare agents is undergoing daily reconstruction of professional practice in order to keep pace with the living territories to which they are assigned. Continuing education in healthcare enables construction of feasible scenarios that make problem solving possible, involving a constant reflective analytical perception of professional practices, permitting (re)construction of social skills such as the capacity to mobilize and motivate other actors to participate in political action. Through problematization, identification of needs, and questioning, continuing education in healthcare leads to (de)construction of the working practices of the very actors who are delivering care. Furthermore, continuing education in healthcare reaffirms the importance of the social, technical, and political training of community healthcare agents, thereby confirming their right to dignified and quality work. In a pandemic scenario, an agenda focused on continuing education in healthcare is essential to the continuity of care delivery to communities, facilitating expansion of access to the right to health."

Distress levels may be heightened by the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether distress levels of parents varied by the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate whether parental distress was influenced by the type of NDD. Participants were from Australia (N = 196) and Italy (N = 200); the parents of children aged 3-18 were invited to complete an online self-reported survey which included the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) to determine parental distress. The results show that intellectual or learning disorder (ILD) is a major contributor to parental distress compared to other NDDs in both Australia and Italy. Moreover, the worsening of symptomatic changes in children with NDDs was significantly associated with parental distress. The differences between the two countries in terms of the pandemic impact, however, were not statistically significant. The results suggest that intervention strategies need to be tailored for individual clinical information and factor in the society's stringency level of anti-contagion policies to improve parental wellbeing."

In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn2+ and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn2+ metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid β and α-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn2+ was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-α2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization.

As such, the COVID-19 pandemic likely also has had a detrimental impact on the behavioral problems of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). In Japan, the government issued a stay-at-home order causing children to stop participating in school activities following the first declaration of a state of emergency (April 7 to May 25, 2020). During winter 2020, the stay-at-home order and school closures were lifted. Using longitudinal data of children with NDD, we compared the behavioral problems of children with NDD between October 1 and December 31, 2020 (i.e., winter 2020) with their behavioral problems before the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-COVID-19). In this study, 143 caregivers of children with NDD evaluated their behavioral problems using the Japanese version of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-J) in the pre-COVID-19 period and winter 2020. We found no scores that were higher in winter 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19. Moreover, irritability and hyperactivity scores were significantly lower in winter 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19. These findings suggest weak negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavioral problems of children with NDD. In schools and clinical practice, children learned knowledge about COVID-19 and related preventive behaviors. Therefore, these practices may have alleviated the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with NDD."

            "abstract": "Gitelman's syndrome (GS) and Bartter's syndrome (BS) are rare inherited salt-losing tubulopathies whose variations in genotype do not correlate well with either clinical course or electrolyte requirements. Using GS/BS patients as nature's experiments, we found them to be a human model of endogenous Ang II antagonism with activated Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), resulting in high Ang II levels with blunted cardiovascular effects. These patients are also characterized by increased and directly correlated levels of both Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Ang 1-7. Understanding the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical presentations of GS/BS arises remains challenging. Efforts to find a treatment for COVID-19 has fueled a recent surge in interest in chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and its effects. Of specific interest are chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by impairing ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry point, through terminal glycosylation via effects on TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis. Several different studies with a GS or a BS phenotype, along with a nonsyndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability linked to a mutated SLC9A7, provide additional evidence that specific gene defects can act via misregulation of TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis, which leads to a common mechanistic basis resulting in overlapping phenotypes. We suggest that linkage between the specific gene defects identified in GS and BS and the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical findings may be the result of aberrant glycosylation of ACE2 driven by altered TGN/endosome system acidification caused by the metabolic alkalosis brought about by these salt-losing tubulopathies in addition to their altered intracellular calcium signaling due to a blunted second messenger induced intracellular calcium release that is, in turn, amplified by the RAS system."

ADHD symptoms were assessed with the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener while stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression was used to examine associations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-one (3.5%) individuals had ADHD symptoms, while more than one in ten (11.7%) of the respondents reported past-year suicidal ideation. In an analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors, ADHD symptoms were associated with eight times higher odds for past-year suicidal ideation. However, adjusting the analysis for mental health variables (anxiety and depressive symptoms) attenuated the association which became non-significant (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-4.18). In contrast, in an analysis adjusted for mental health, individuals with ADHD symptoms and stress had significantly higher odds for suicidal ideation (OR: 3.72, 95%CI: 1.43-9.67) whereas, ADHD symptoms without stress were not linked to suicidal ideation (OR: 1.25, 95%CI: 0.38-4.18).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Self-perceived stress is important in the association between ADHD symptoms and suicidal ideation among individuals in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detecting and managing stress and its effects in individuals with ADHD/ADHD symptoms should be a therapeutic focus for improving health-related outcomes in this population both during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond."

            "abstract": "The emergent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could produce a maternal immune activation (MIA) via the inflammatory response during gestation that may impair fetal neurodevelopment and lead to postnatal and adulthood mental illness and behavioral dysfunctions. However, so far, limited evidence exists regarding long-term physiological, immunological, and neurodevelopmental modifications produced by the SARS-CoV-2 in the human maternal-fetal binomial and, particularly, in the offspring. Relevant findings derived from epidemiological and preclinical models show that a MIA is indeed linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. We hypothesize that a gestational infection triggered by SARS-CoV-2 increases the risks leading to neurodevelopmental disorders of the newborn, which can affect childhood and the long-term quality of life. In particular, disruption of either the maternal or the fetal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) could cause or exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 in the maternal-fetal binomial. From a translational perspective, in this paper, we discuss the possible manifestation of a MIA by SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent neurodevelopmental disorders considering the role of the fetal-maternal cytokine cross-talk and the CAP. Specifically, we highlight the urgent need of preclinical studies as well as multicenter and international databanks of maternal-fetal psychophysiological data obtained pre-, during, and post-infection by SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women and their offspring."

Methods for neuropsychological assessments, which typically require an in-person visit, must be modified in order to adhere to social distancing and isolation standards enacted in an effort to slow the pandemic. How can providers continue to meet the needs of patients referred for neuropsychology evaluations, while respecting federal and state guidelines for safety and ethical mandates? We offer a novel, tiered model of care, successfully implemented in response to mandated social distancing, in a large, pediatric neuropsychology program.Method: We describe the considerations and challenges to be addressed in transitioning a large neuropsychology department to a new model of care, including triaging referrals, developing -or rediscovering - types of services to meet the needs of a virtual patient population, and helping patients, parents, and providers to adjust to these new models.Conclusions: Lessons learned as a function of rapid changes in care models have implications for the field of neuropsychology as a whole as well as for future flexibility in meeting the needs of pediatric patients and their families."

On January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 136 patients (85 FR; 51 CR; 93 males; 43 females) had been enrolled in the project with 324 completed time points and 64 still missing. Considering both the huge psychological burden on families with toddlers at risk for ASD during the lockdown and the longitudinal studies reporting the positive \"surveillance effect\" in terms of a better outcome in at-risk toddlers, our priority has been to maintain regular contact and support to enrolled families. To do this, the research team, being authorized for smart-working research activities, has set up a detailed remote surveillance protocol (RSP). The RSP includes three online interviews and one online video registration of parent-child play. In the current community case study, the authors report the telehealth procedure and discuss possible future directions in developing remote assessment and new evaluation modalities for ecological parent-child play video recordings in at-risk populations.

For individuals with neurogenetic conditions, reliance on nonclinical caregivers to facilitate all therapies and care was unprecedented. The study aimed to (1) describe caregivers' reported impact on their dependent's services, therapies, medical needs, and impact on themselves as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) assess the relationship between the extent of disruption of services and the degree of self-reported caregiver burden. Two online questionnaires were completed by caregivers participating in Simons Searchlight in April and May 2020. Surveys were completed by caregivers of children or dependent adults with neurodevelopmental genetic conditions in Simons Searchlight. Caregivers reported that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic moderately or severely disrupted services, therapies, or medical supports. The majority of caregivers were responsible for providing some aspect of therapy. Caregivers reported \"feeling stressed but able to deal with problems as they arise,\" and reported lower anxiety at follow-up. Caregivers reported that telehealth services were not meeting the needs of those with complex medical needs. Future surveys will assess if and how medical systems, educational programs, therapists, and caregivers adapt to the challenges arising during the COVID-19 pandemic."

There were large individual differences in perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image in this period. Women were more likely than men to report increasing struggles with regulating eating, preoccupation with food and worsening body image. Those with a current/past diagnosis of eating disorders reported significantly greater difficulties in regulating eating, increased preoccupation with food, exercise thoughts and behaviours and concern about appearance, even when compared to those with other mental health and developmental disorders.

Methods: In the period from May to July 2021, we evaluated 33 patients (mean age 54.3 ± 14.1) with \"acute vertigo\" post COVID-19 vaccination. A detailed medical history was taken on comorbidities, types of vaccines received, and symptoms associated. All patients underwent otoneurological evaluation, such as head impulse test, nystagmus evaluation, test of skew (HINTS) examination. Head shaking test-induced nystagmus, hyperventilation-induced nystagmus, and parossistic positional nystagmus were studied to search for vestibular impairment. Results: Symptoms included 16 patients (48.5%) with objective vertigo, 14 patients (42.4%) with subjective vertigo, and 3 patients (9.1%) with dizziness. Of the associated ear, nose, and throat (ENT) symptoms, the most expressed was tinnitus (18.2%). Bedside examination showed absent nystagmus in 7 patients (21.2%), 9 patients (27.3%) had horizontal or rotatory nystagmus, 17 patients (51.5%) had a vertical or oblique nystagmus, negative HST, or \"central HINTS.\" Discussion and Conclusions: The 9 patients had an evoked nystagmus pathognomonic for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; in the remaining 17 cases, peripheral vestibular dysfunction could be excluded and central disorder may be suggested. Due to the prevalence of nystagmus of non-peripheral origin, a central nervous system involvement could not be excluded. However, due to the small sample size, a definite cause-effect relationship between vaccination and vertigo cannot be inferred.

Three-quarters (78.7%) of those who were symptomatic or who tested positive had plans to manage self-isolation and two-thirds were able to comply with guidelines. Over half (55%, n=383) reported some COVID-19 related stress/anxiety; and a similar proportion reported positive aspects during this period (58%, n=381). Conclusions: Our data suggests that people with intellectual disability avoided the worst impacts of COVID-19 during the first infection wave in Ireland. Nevertheless, participants' health profiles suggest that this population remains at high risk for adverse infection outcomes. Repeated measures are needed to track health and well-being outcomes across multiple infection waves."

            "abstract": "Several stressors associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are expected to affect the mental health of global populations: the effects of physical distancing, quarantine, and social isolation; the emotional suffering of health and other frontline workers; neuropsychiatric sequelae in those affected by the virus; the impact to families of lives lost to the disease; differential effects for those with severe mental disorders; and the consequences of social and economic deterioration. In this context, we sought: to form a panel of Brazilian experts on child and adolescent health, neurodevelopment, health services, and adult and elderly mental health; and to compile evidence-based interventions to support suggested policy changes in Brazil to mitigate the expected increase in mental health disorders during the pandemic and its mental health consequences. The following actions are recommended: 1) invest in prevention programs for the safe return of students to schools; 2) adopt evidence-based psychosocial interventions to maintain an adequate environment for child and adolescent development; 3) target socially vulnerable populations and those experiencing discrimination; 4) train primary care teams to solve common mental health problems, provide needs-based assessments, and manage long-term, at-home care for older patients; 5) invest in technological advancements (e.g., telemedicine, e-Health, and web-based algorithms) to promote coordinated care; 6) increase access to and literacy in the use of computers and mobile phones, especially among older adults; 7) expand protocols for remote, brief psychotherapy interventions and psychoeducation to manage common mental health problems."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic presents major challenges for mental health care providers. In particular, providers who treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are now tasked with determining whether to initiate trauma-focused therapy during the pandemic and, if so, whether and how to adapt treatment. The purpose of this communication is to identify and organize key considerations for whether and how to deliver commonly used evidence-supported therapy protocols for trauma treatment-specifically, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy-during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for adults who currently meet the criteria for PTSD. Based on relevant public health and clinical literature, we present a structured guide that can be used by treatment teams and individual providers to evaluate whether initiating CPT or PE is indicated given a particular patient-provider pair and system context amidst pandemic conditions. In addition, we suggest appropriate action steps, including problem-solving strategies, evidence-informed modifications to CPT and PE, and alternative intervention approaches."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      This study was designed to assess current recommendations from child neurologists and epileptologists on masking for school-age children with epilepsy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A 7-item survey was created and sent out to members of the Child Neurology Society and Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium in August of 2021 to assess current practice and provider recommendations on masking.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred four individuals participated with representation from all regions of the United States. Masking was recommended by 95.1%, with 63.4% (n = 66) noting exception of those with severe intellectual disability, autism, and behavioral problems. Of those who write exemption letters, 54% write these <5% of the time. Only 3% reported potential adverse events associated with masking.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Nearly all respondents recommended masking for school-age children with epilepsy. Potential risks of masking and adverse events were low. Improved guidance on masking is needed to ensure academic success of our patients with epilepsy."
