Although subjective differences have been observed between radial artery (RA) and long saphenous venous (LSV) grafts, these have not been quantified. This study assessed and compared the flow characteristics and in-vivo graft flow responses of RA and LSV aorto-coronary grafts.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Angiograms from 52 males taken 3.7 +/- 1.0 months after CABG surgery were analyzed using adjusted Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count. Graft and target coronary artery dimensions were measured using quantitative coronary angiography. Estimated TIMI velocity (V(E)) and volume flow (F(E)) were then calculated. A further 7 patients underwent in-vivo graft flow responses assessments to adenosine, acetylcholine and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) using intravascular Doppler.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The V(E) for RA grafts was significantly greater than LSV grafts (P = 0.002), however there was no difference in volume F(E) (P = 0.20). RA grafts showed positive endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation, and LSV grafts showed no statistically significant response to adenosine and acetylcholine. There was no difference in flow velocity or volume responses. Seven RA grafts (11%) had compromised patency (4 (6%) > or = 50% stenosis in the proximal/distal anastomoses, and 3 (5%) diffuse narrowing). Thirty-seven (95%) LSV grafts achieved perfect patency and 2 (5%) were occluded.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The flow characteristics and flow responses of the RA graft suggest that it is a more physiological conduit than the LSV graft.

It was the aim of this study to evaluate transit time flow and clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic results of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with either saphenous vein (SV) or radial artery (RA) employed as the second conduit of choice. The present study evaluates clinical and flowmetric results of a prospective series of elderly patients (>or=70 years old) undergoing RA CABG (75 patients, Group A) or SV CABG (163 patients, Group B) during isolated myocardial revascularization, performed either off-pump (OPCABG) and on-pump during the last 5 years at a single academic institution (between January 2003 and December 2007). Transit time flowmetric (TTF) maximum and mean flow, pulsatility index (P.I.), and graft flow reserve (GFR) were compared. Hospital outcome was analyzed. Clinical data were compared between the two groups and one-year follow-up was completed. The two groups showed comparable preoperative and intraoperative variables. When TTF analysis was considered, patients undergoing RA grafting demonstrated a significantly higher maximum (systolic) and mean flow compared to SV grafting, either in circumflex, diagonal, and right coronary territory. Pulsatility index was significantly lower in the RA group in circumflex, diagonal, and right coronary grafts. Furthermore, when GFR was calculated significantly higher values were found in RA conduits in the circumflex, diagonal, and right coronary grafts. Comparable troponin I leakage was detected between the two groups. Postoperative variables addressing hospital outcome were similar in the two groups. When echocardiographic data were analyzed, no differences were recorded in postoperative recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion score index. One-year follow-up showed better freedom from acute cardiovascular events in the RA group (P = 0.04). Our data show that despite comparable clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic results in elderly patients undergoing RA or SV grafting, better flowmetric results - in terms of GFR, mean flow, and pulsatility index - can be detected in arterial conduits."

For this reason, the minimally invasive endoscopic dissection of vessel conduits is steadily gaining acceptance as a preferable alternative to the standard open-incision technique. Endoscopic systems, originally developed for general surgical procedures in the early 1990s, and readily adapted to saphenous vein harvesting by mid-decade, are now also being applied to minimally invasive radial artery harvesting. The growth of this surgical modality has paralleled the rapid development of remote access minimally invasive endoscopic devices and technologies and therefore remains an evolving body of knowledge. As experience and refinements in instrumentation progress, the endoscopic approach will undoubtedly become the procedure of choice for harvesting vessel conduits.

            "abstract": "The impact of left internal mammary to left anterior descending coronary bypass grafting in enhancing long-term patient survival has led to a widespread interest in arterial grafting over the past decade. It is now accepted that the internal mammary artery is a biologically superior coronary bypass graft compared with the traditional saphenous vein. Experience with other arterial grafts--the right gastro-epiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery and the radial artery--has shown compelling evidence that they share the same biologic advantage. With the judicious use of some or all of these conduits, all regions of the heart can be reached, and total arterial revascularization is a feasible and desirable objective on a routine basis. As long-term results become available, it is inevitable that it will become the operation of choice."

Radial artery grafts, now often used alongside the internal mammary artery in coronary artery bypass surgery, are particularly reactive to several vasoconstrictors but the response to Ap(n)A has not been investigated. This study compared the vasoconstrictor activity of Ap(n)A in human radial artery with other vessels commonly used as bypass grafts. Radial artery demonstrated robust concentration-dependent vasoconstriction to Ap(n)A (n=4-6) at concentrations in the micromolar range. In contrast, average responses in internal mammary artery were negligible. Cross-desensitization revealed that Ap(n)A-mediated vasoconstriction occurred via an alphabetamethyleneATP-sensitive receptor. Responses to both Ap(5)A and alphabetamethyleneATP were inhibited by suramin but were insensitive to the P2X(1) receptor antagonist 8,8'-[Carbonylbis(imino-4,1-phenylenecarbonylimino-4,1-phenylenecarbonylimino)]bis-1,3,5-naphthalenetrisulfonic acid (NF279). Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) enhanced responses to Ap(5)A. Similar responses were obtained in saphenous vein. In conclusion, diadenosine polyphosphates contract radial artery and saphenous vein by an as yet uncharacterized P2X receptor but have only limited activity in internal mammary artery. The selective activity of diadenosine polyphosphates in radial artery would implicate them as potential mediators of post-operative contraction in this graft."

Murray (1954) succeeded in performing experimental CABG using the internal mammary artery (IMA). The first reported CABG using the IMA in humans was performed by R. Goetz using the sutureless technique in 1960. V. Kolessov (1964) performed the first sutured bypass grafting using the IMA. From 1962 to 1967, human CABG using autogenous saphenous vein grafts was performed by D. Sabiston (1962). H. Garrett (1964), D. Kahn (1966), and R. Favaloro (1967). Saphenous vein grafting became the most common CABG technique for the next two decades. In Japan, Y. Sezai et al. performed CABG using the free femoral artery, we performed CABG using the IMA, and S. Asada et al. performed CABG using the saphenous vein in 1970. In 1986, F. Loop et al. reported that the long-term survival rate of CABG was significantly higher when the IMA rather than the saphenous vein was used. IMA grafting, supplemented by the gastroepiploic artery, inferior epigastric artery, and radial artery, has enabled complete arterial revascularization to be performed in almost all patients. In the graft selection for CABG, the first choice is the left IMA and the second choice is the right IMA. The third choice is the gastroepiploic artery and/or radial artery, depending on the target anastomotic site, degree of stenosis, size of the distal graft, and in situ or free use."

Among the patients who had experienced iatrogenic myocardial infarction in the past 4 years, 6 had undergone emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An emergent operation for myocardial infarction was performed on 3 patients, for problems associated with PCI, and 1 patient had died due to cardiac failure. In the latter case, although the emergent CABG was performed after the failure of percutaneous coronary intervention in another hospital, no improvement in cardiac function was observed. The reason for this was that the myocardial damage became almost irreversible due to the delay in transferring the patient to our hospital. An additional CABG was performed in 2 cases, because they experienced a cardiogenic shock after cessation of the cardio-pulmonary bypass system. In these cases, cardiac function had improved immediately after an additional CABG. Some ST elevation in the electrocardiograms was observed in 8 cases in the intensive care unit after isolated CABG. One patient experienced a cardiogenic shock, and was transferred to the operating room immediately. The radial artery graft connected in sequence to circumflex coronary arteries was spastic, and an additional bypass was performed to the same coronary arteries using a saphenous vein graft. Although conservative medical therapy was administered in the remaining 7 cases, 1 case presented an occlusion of the left descending coronary artery, and an emergent CABG should have been performed. ST elevations in 2 cases were caused by coronary spasm, while in the remaining 4 cases, they were caused by pericardiotomy. Although a postoperative change in the electrocardiogram was considered important, the diagnosis was complicated. In myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock develops easily, and an emergent CABG is needed in many cases. It is important to decide on an emergent operation promptly after an accurate diagnosis."

But little is known about TTFM findings in on-pump CABG. We examined the correlation between the TTFM flow pattern and the angiography findings in on-pump CABG. The subjects consisted of 52 patients who underwent on-pump CABG and angiography early after operation. In these patients, 55 internal thoracic artery (ITA), 17 gastroepiploic artery (GEA), 13 saphenous vein graft (SVG) and 41 radial artery (RA) were tested with TTFM during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). TTFM demonstrated a diastolic filling pattern in 53 ITA, 16 GEA, 13 SVG and 36 RA. The angiography revealed that all these grafts were perfectly patent with the exception of a GEA with a flow competition pattern. TTFM revealed an abnormal flow pattern in 2 ITA (these 2 grafts were revised during CPB and the angiography demonstrated their perfect patency), 1 GEA (to and fro pattern), 0 SVG and 5 RA (the abnormal pattern was due to graft spasm in 3 of 5, and the angiography revealed their perfect patency, however, the angiography detected stenosis in the remaining 2 grafts). The present study found that the TTFM flow pattern during CPB correlated well with the angiography findings. TTFM during CPB was useful to detect graft failure, and grafts were revised safely during CPB."

            "abstract": "Radial artery (RA) bypass grafts can develop severe vasospasm. As histamine is known to induce vasospasm, its effect on RA was assessed compared with the classic bypass vessels internal mammary artery (MA) and saphenous vein (SV). The vessels were examined in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Histamine induced contractions on baseline; the sensitivity was higher in RA and SV than MA. After precontraction with norepinephrine, histamine did not evoke relaxations of RA but induced relaxations of MA and less of SV at lower concentrations; it induced contractions at higher concentrations, reaching similar levels in all three vessels. Indomethacin did not affect the response of MA and RA but potentiated relaxations and reduced contractions of SV. Endothelium removal, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), or the H2-receptor blocker cimetidine did not affect the response of RA, but inhibited relaxations and enhanced contractions in MA and inhibited relaxations in SV; in the latter, only L-NAME enhanced contractions. Real-time PCR detected much lower expression of endothelial H2-receptor in RA than MA or SV. Western blots revealed similar endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression in all three vessels. Relaxations to acetylcholine were identical in RA and MA. Thus histamine releases NO by activating the endothelial H2-receptor, the expression of which is much lower in RA than MA or SV. H2-receptor activation also releases prostaglandins in SV, partially antagonizing NO. The lack of histamine-induced NO production represents a possible mechanism of RA vasospasm."

These complications were the impetus for developing minimally invasive techniques for vein harvesting. Minimally invasive saphenous vein harvesting is performed through small incisions and subcutaneous tunnels.

Conversely, NO donors and superoxide scavengers both reduced superoxide release, whereas only NO donors increased peroxynitrite formation. These changes were much larger in arteries that in veins, but there were striking correlations between superoxide production, NO bioavailability, and peroxynitrite formation between the vessel types. Our findings provide direct evidence for coordinated vascular signaling mediated by interactions between NO, superoxide, and peroxynitrite and have important implications for studies of the functional effects of these radicals in human blood vessels."

Our experiences in recent 2 cases happened during off-pump CABG (OPCAB) are presented. Case 1: A 63-year-old male who had 3 vessels disease underwent OPCAB using left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and the radial artery. When the sternotomy was going to be closed, ST elevation of electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred and was followed by ventricular fibrillation. Intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) were applied immediately and an additional grafting to first diagonal artery (D 1) was carried out using a saphenous vein. Case 2: A 67-year-old male underwent OPCAB using LITA and the radial artery. ST elevation of ECG suddenly occurred and was followed by complete atrio-ventricular (AV) block when the sternum was closed. IABP and the ventricular pacing were applied immediately. While OPCAB may be less invasive operating method than conventional CABG, we should pay more attention to the coronary vasospasm."

Two (4%) were redo operations. Mean number of grafts was 2.9 +/- 0.8, 51 internal thoracic artery grafts (ITA), 17 radial artery grafts (RA), and 76 saphenous vein grafts (SVG). Angiographic graft patency was 90.2% for ITA, 88.2% for RA, and 96.1% for SVG. Interpretation of catheterization results was confounded by significant native and arterial graft spasm. Six of seven occluded arterial grafts and one of three SVG were probe patent at immediate reoperation (all had adequate flow by intra-operative doppler at the initial operation). Only two graft occlusions were noted in the 18 patients who did not receive protamine. The patency rate was 95.6% (131/137) when the probe patent anastomoses were excluded. Seven patients (14%) returned to the OR as a result of the catheterization findings; five to revise occluded grafts, one to improve the lie of a kinked SVG, and one to graft an intramyocardial intermediate ramus when an adjacent high diagonal was grafted instead (two of seven on-pump).

The positive effect of an internal thoracic artery graft on survival has been accepted for more than a decade, but it has proven difficult to show additional benefit from additional arterial conduits; this is probably due to multiple factors, including inappropriate choice of target vessels, short follow-up, and inadequate numbers of patients. Recently, however, the positive effect of a second arterial graft was confirmed. It will probably be difficult to show a survival benefit from a third or fourth arterial graft, but we believe that complete arterial revascularization will result in improved long-term freedom from reintervention. Interest in arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass was primarily limited to the left internal thoracic artery until the mid-1980s, when enthusiasm for the use of bilateral internal thoracic arteries grew. More recently, the gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery, and especially the radial artery have all found advocates. However, the original conduit--and the standard against which all others are compared--is the greater saphenous vein."

The primary end point was composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous).\n## RESULTS\nThere was no significant difference in absolute survival, with 12 deaths in each group during the study period (log rank = 0.01, p = 0.979). There were 3 and 2 cardiac deaths in RA and SVG groups, respectively. There was no difference in long-term clinical outcome between the groups (log rank = 0.450, p = 0.509).

Most (34) of the operations were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Saphenous vein (37) or radial artery (1) grafts were placed to one or more coronary arteries from either the left (36) or right (2) axillary artery. Twenty patients underwent sternotomy, and 18 had either a left (16) or right (2) minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) procedure performed. Most of the sternotomies were for primary myocardial revascularization and most of the MIDCABs were reoperations. There were three deaths-all from non-cardiac causes, one myocardial infarction, and one transient brachial plexus injury. Doppler ultrasound, angiographic, and clinical follow-up were limited, but graft patency has been demonstrated up to 9 years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Axillary artery to coronary artery bypass should be part of the armamentarium of surgeons who perform myocardial revascularization operations."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The superior long-term patency of internal mammary artery coronary bypass grafts compared with venous grafts has been attributed in part to increased endothelium-derived nitric oxide (. NO) production. Interest in the radial artery as an alternative bypass conduit has recently been revived; however, its biological characteristics remain incompletely defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the.NO-mediated vasomotor properties of the radial artery to those of the internal mammary artery and saphenous vein.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Matched segments of radial artery, internal mammary artery, and saphenous vein (n=24 patients) were examined by use of organ-chamber methodology. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasomotor responses were assessed by dose-response curves to acetylcholine, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), 8-bromo-cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP), and nitroglycerin. Maximum.NO-mediated radial artery relaxation in response to acetylcholine (86+/-10%) was significantly greater than internal mammary artery (56+/-9%) or saphenous vein (11+/-5%, both P<0.0001). Similarly, acetylcholine-stimulated cGMP accumulation in radial artery (9.1+/-1.7 pmol/mg protein) was also greater than internal mammary artery (6.2+/-0.3 pmol/mg protein) or saphenous vein (1.4+/-0.2 pmol/mg protein, both P<0.05). Estimated basal endothelial.NO production, assayed as the percent maximum contraction in response to L-NAME, was greater in radial artery (39+/-5%) than internal mammary artery (23+/-6%) or saphenous vein (5+/-2%, both P<0.05). Maximum relaxation of all vessels to nitroglycerin was similar, although the sensitivity of radial artery to nitroglycerin was greater (EC(50)=33+/-7 nmol/L) than the internal mammary artery (203+/-32 nmol/L) or saphenous vein (97+/-12 nmol/L, both P<0.05). Vascular cGMP in response to 0.1 micromol/L nitroglycerin was significantly higher in the radial artery (8.3+/-1. 4 pmol/mg protein) compared with the internal mammary artery (3. 5+/-1.3 pmol/mg protein) or saphenous vein (1.4+/-0.3 pmol/mg protein, both P<0.0001). Relaxation to 8-bromo-cGMP was identical for all 3 conduits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These data indicate that. NO-dependent relaxation of radial artery is greater than that of internal mammary artery or saphenous vein. This difference is related to endothelial production of.NO and/or vessel sensitivity to. NO. Such favorable physiological characteristics of radial artery could conceivably contribute to improved long-term patency of this conduit compared with saphenous vein."

These included 4 emergency cases and 12 in an urgent situation, so the overall non-elective rate was 61.5%. There was no hospital death or serious complication. The mean number of grafts per patient was 3.2 +/- 1.6, and the complete revascularization rate was 90.4%. All patients received at least 1 arterial conduit, and 16 patients (61.5%) received all arterial grafts. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 10 patients.

It is apparent that a multitude of events including the development of cardioplegia, improving surgical instrumentation, technological advances including endoscopic approaches and computer assisted robotics and biologic discoveries such as the role of the endothelium have provided the underpinnings for improved surgical outcomes. However, the single most important determinant of late results is the type of bypass conduit used for grafting. Thus, use of the left internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafted to the left anterior descending coronary is a more important determinant of survival than is any other factor (progression of coronary artery disease, increased age, poor left ventricular function, diabetes, female gender and off-pump operations). Use of two ITAs provides further benefit and it is likely that three or more arterial conduits will be shown to be advantageous in this regard in due time. Japanese cardiothoracic surgeons have made significant contributions to the continuing evolution of coronary bypass surgery and particularly to the advance of arterial conduits.

Based on this evidence, the use of arterial conduits for myocardial revascularization has been extended. Several autologous arteries have been investigated and utilized clinically such as the right gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery, and the radial artery. With proper use of these new arterial conduits in addition to ITA, higher quality CABG can be performed safely, and a better long-term result can be expected."

            "abstract": "Minimally invasive conduit harvesting techniques for coronary artery bypass grafting have developed over the past decade, aiming to reduce the morbidity and recovery time associated with the procedure, whilst preserving the quality of the conduit. Two types of commonly harvested free conduits include the great saphenous vein and the radial artery. Although much research has focussed on comparing less invasive and conventional harvest techniques, there is at present no consensus on the areas where one technique is superior to the other. Aspects of conduits that deserve appreciation when comparing minimally invasive and open harvesting techniques include wound healing at the harvest site, the macroscopic, histological and functional quality of the conduit, but perhaps most importantly its long-term angiographic patency. This paper aims to review the literature comparing minimally invasive and conventional conduit harvesting techniques for coronary artery bypass grafting, with regard to the previously mentioned factors. A literature search of Medline, Ovid, Embase and Cochrane databases was used to identify comparative studies published between 1997 and 2005. Outcomes of interest included: wound infection, non-infective healing disturbances, post-operative pain, neurological disturbance, mobility, patient satisfaction, conduit quality (macroscopic, histological and functional) and long-term conduit patency. A scoring system was applied and used to grade the quality of the evidence, based on which a recommendation of it being 'good' (Grade A), 'fair' (Grade B), or 'insufficient' (Grade C) was made. Results showed that there was 'good' evidence to suggest that wound infection and non-infective complications are reduced with minimally invasive harvest as compared to conventional vein harvest. The evidence suggesting that post-operative pain and mobilisation is reduced after minimally invasive vein harvest and that once harvested, the conduits are macroscopically comparable to conventional ones, is only 'fair'. Finally, although initial reports are encouraging, there is at present insufficient evidence to comment on whether minimally invasive radial artery harvesting is better than that of conventional open surgery. Wounds from minimally invasively harvested venous conduits appear to be less prone to complications although more comparative evidence on conduit quality and long-term patency is eagerly awaited."

Most series report OPCAB in selected cases and therefore the results of such studies are affected by selection bias. We report our series of consecutive, unselected OPCAB cases representing an entire coronary revascularization practice and its effect on neurological outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between January and December 2000, 226 consecutive OPCAB cases were performed.

Postoperative outcomes including operation time, ventilation time, inotrope requirement, focal strokes, peak CKMB, length of hospital stay and mortality formed the basis of this study. All OPCAB patients had a median sternotomy approach. Left and right internal mammary arteries and radial arteries were used in varying combinations using composite and sequential grafting techniques to achieve revascularization and completely avoid aortic manipulation. ONCAB cases were performed employing conventional cardiopulmonary bypass techniques and using the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts as appropriate.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      OPCAB cases had significantly lower peak CKMB levels, operative time, length of hospital stay and number of grafts.

The patients were divided into two groups, namely an emergency group (13 patients) and subemergency group. The patients in the emergency group were operated on within 24 hours of diagnosis and those in the subemergency group were operated immediately after 24 hours of diagnosis. In the emergency group, two patients required cardiac resuscitation before operation because of a cardiogenic shock. Eleven patients of the emergency group required intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) before operation. Eleven patients operated for mediansternotomy with a cardiopulmonary bypass and remaining two patients for minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB). The ratio of arterial grafts was 52% in the emergency group (8 LITA, 7 Radial artery, 1 RGEA). Four of the 13 patients used only SVG. There was one each of the operative and hospital death. On the post operative angiography of the grafts, arterial graft were all patent. In the subemergency group, 38 of 46 patients underwent conventional CABG with median sternotomy using a cardiopulmonary bypass. MIDCAB was indicated in eight patients. Thirty-one patients had a bypass formed with only arterial grafts, 84.7% of whom used arterial grafts. On the postoperative angiography, LITA, RGEA, and IEA were all patent and the radial artery was occluded in one anastmosis (96%). Only one patients died of mediastinitis 25 days after operation.

However, limited surgical exposure through a small thoracotomy makes harvesting the full length of the internal mammary artery (IMA) very difficult and time consuming. We are now employing a new alternative with a \"T\" shaped bridge graft constructed from the undisturbed IMA using a 4 centimeter interposition segment of donor vessel. We prefer this approach in high risk cases in order to reduce the trauma of the thoracotomy, minimize pain and narcotic use, promote early extubation, and achieve immediate post-operative mobilization and recovery in patients who would otherwise be at risk for a poor outcome with conventional grafting techniques.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From September 10, 1997 to December 19, 1997 eight high-risk patients underwent at least one \"T-MIDCAB\" graft from the undisturbed IMA to the coronary artery using a short segment of either radial artery or saphenous vein. All cases were performed using a limited access anterior thoracotomy through the bed of the resected costal cartilage and without intercostal retraction. Five males and three females ranging from 58 to 83 years (average 73 years) were operated using this new concept. Pre-operative ejection fractions ranged from 25% to 80% (mean 43%). Parsonnet scores ranged from 21 to 43 (average 34) with predicted mortalities ranging from 30 to 40%.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eleven \"T\" grafts were placed (1.38 distals/patient). All 8 patients survived. Postoperative complications were minimal. The average length of stay was only 8 days (range 3 to 9 days). Intensive care unit stay averaged 3 days (range 1 to 4 days). One patient underwent postoperative angiography which demonstrated full patency of the conduit and all anastomoses.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      \"T-MIDCAB\" using a bridge graft of free radial artery or saphenous vein appears to be successful in high risk patients. The authors noted shorter operative times, reduced chest wall trauma and better pain control than with standard MIDCAB and full IMA harvesting. Cautious use of this procedure as an alternative to more morbid types of surgical revascularization is advised."

In atherosclerotic diseases, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have become an important diagnostic and prognostic marker. The origin of CRP in this setting remains to be elucidated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Monoclonal anti-CRP identified CRP expression in medial and intimal alpha-actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of diseased CABGs with type V and VI lesions and also of native saphenous veins of atherosclerotic individuals. In addition, patent coronary arteries with type IV and V but not with type I through III lesions exhibited intense SMC staining for CRP. Calcified desobliterates of occluded coronary arteries with end-stage disease did not show SMC staining for CRP and were consistently negative for CRP mRNA, as detected by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. However, CRP mRNA was expressed in 11 of 15 diseased CABGs and also in 10 of 15 native veins. By contrast, only 3 of 18 internal mammary and 4 of 12 radial arteries with virtually no atherosclerosis were positive for CRP mRNA.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CRP is produced by SMCs of atherosclerotic lesions with active disease but not in end-stage plaques.

            "abstract": "The saphenous vein was once the standard coronary artery bypass graft. Alternate grafts, primarily the radial artery and the internal mammary artery are now being utilised for revascularisation of the heart. However, the radial artery graft site can be at risk of oedema and the development of haematoma during the post-operative period. Also tension on the suture line may compromise circulation and create functional problems for the patient. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of pressure support (elastic support bandage) and elevation in reducing swelling and arm discomfort in the harvest arm. The patients in the study undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts were randomly assigned to one of three groups: elastic support bandage, collar and cuff sling and elevation on two pillows. There were 30 patients in each group. The circumference at three locations on the forearm was measured pre-operatively and on post-operative days 3 and 5. Pain was measured on a visual pain scale, which went from 1-10, with 10 being the most painful. The patients were also asked whether their arm movement felt restricted. The study found that there was no statistically significant difference (at the 0.05 level) between the three groups in the amount of swelling witnessed at the different forearm locations. There was, however, a significant decrease in swelling for all groups between days 3-5, but no difference in pain scores between the groups. Moreover, the collar and cuff sling group reported movement restriction, which was not apparent in the other two groups. In view of the findings, the researchers advocate the elastic support bandage. Patient compliance has practical implications when applying treatment and this is enhanced by the non cumbersome elastic support bandage. This can be compared to the collar and cuff sling and pillow elevation groups where the patient's daily activities affects compliance with these two treatments. It is recommended that future research be conducted comparing the effects of the elastic support bandage with a control group."

Recently, the RA became a reasonable alternative to the saphenous vein (SV) graft with the trend toward complete arterial revascularization and more frequent off-pump CABG to avoid aortic manipulation. To improve the quality of the RA conduit, harvesting technique and topical and systemic antispasmodic medication are important. The RA should be grafted to severe proximal stenosis (>90%) in the native coronary arteries to avoid flow competition, especially in the right coronary territory. The RA graft could be used as an aortocoronary or composite configuration with similar graft patency. Early graft patency of the RA conduit was as good as other arterial grafts, and better than SV graft in the circumflex and right coronary territories, in many studies, especially in diabetic patients. Long-term results of graft patency and cardiac-event-free survival compared with SV graft are still controversial in randomized controlled trials, probably because the incidence of flow competition and the definition of graft patency varied."

To test this, we 1) determined the acute vasoactive effects of MA (1-1,000 micromol/l) in uncontracted and norepinephrine (NE; 1 micromol/l)-precontracted human blood vessels used for coronary artery bypass grafts [left internal mammary artery (LIMA), radial artery (RA), and right saphenous vein (RSV)]; 2) tested whether MA effects in LIMA and RSV were dependent on SSAO activity using the SSAO inhibitor semicarbazide (1 mmol/l, 15 min); 3) determined the effects of MA metabolites formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in LIMA and RSV; 4) tested whether the MA response was nitric oxide, prostaglandin, or hyperpolarization dependent; 5) measured the LIMA and RSV cGMP levels after MA exposure; and 6) quantified SSAO activity in LIMA, RA, and RSV. In NE-precontracted vessels, MA stimulated a biphasic response in RA and RSV (rapid contraction followed by prolonged relaxation) and dominant relaxation in LIMA (mean +/- SE, %relaxation: 55.4 +/- 3.9, n = 30). The MA-induced relaxation in LIMA was repeatable, nontoxic, and age independent. Semicarbazide significantly blocked MA-induced relaxation (%inhibition: 82.5 +/- 4.8, n = 7) and SSAO activity (%inhibition: 98.1 +/- 1.3, n = 26) in LIMA. Formaldehyde (%relaxation: 37.3 +/- 18.6, n = 3) and H(2)O(2) (%relaxation: 55.6 +/- 9.0, n = 9) at 1 mmol/l relaxed NE-precontracted LIMA comparable with MA. MA-induced relaxation in LIMA was nitric oxide, prostaglandin, and possibly cGMP independent and blocked by hyperpolarization.

Hence, expanded use of arterial conduits for other coronary targets has been advocated. The radial artery possesses a number of anatomic features that are technically advantageous compared with other arterial conduits. This study will determine the relative patency of the radial artery compared to the saphenous vein for right and circumflex coronary bypass. Patients with graftable multivessel coronary disease and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction >/= 35% undergoing nonemergent primary isolated coronary bypass surgery are eligible. The right and circumflex vessels must have high-grade lesions (>/= 70% diameter stenosis), with target segments of reasonable quality >/= 1.5 mm in diameter. Patients serve as their own controls. The radial artery is randomly allocated to bypass the right or circumflex territory and a saphenous vein is used for the nonradial site. An internal thoracic artery is used for the left anterior descending coronary artery in all cases. Randomization is stratified by center. The primary study endpoint is graft patency as determined by angiography, 8-12 months postoperatively. The relative patency of the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein will be determined using McNemar's test. A sample size of 464 patients will provide 80% power for a two-tailed test (alpha = 0.05) for a 40% relative reduction in the rate of distal anastomotic occlusion from 12% in the saphenous vein to 7.2% in the radial arteries assuming a 20% within-patient correlation. A single interim analysis will be performed following completion of 232 angiograms. To allow for lack of follow-up angiography in up to 20% of enrolled patients, we plan to randomize a total of 560 patients. It is also our intention to assess the long-term patency (5-10 years) of radial artery relative to saphenous vein grafts in follow-up studies. Three hundred patients were recruited from 12 Canadian, university-affiliated sites from November 1996 until February 1999, of which 128 patients have undergone follow-up angiography. Approximately 80% of those who have been followed for more than 1 year have undergone follow-up angiography. This trial will determine the 8-12 month patency of the radial artery relative to the saphenous vein for non-left anterior descending coronary bypass using a novel study design which helps control for potential bias from individual patient and vessel factors.

LDE labeled with (3)H-cholesterol and (14)C-cholesteryl oleate was injected into 20 coronary artery disease patients 24 h before a scheduled myocardial coronary artery bypass grafting. The plasma kinetics of both radiolabels was determined from plasma samples collected over 24 h, and fragments of vessels discarded during surgery were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. LDE FC was removed faster than CE. The radioactive counting of LDE CE was greater than that of LDE FC in the blood, but the uptake of FC was markedly greater than that of CE in all fragments: fivefold greater in the aorta (p = 0.04), fourfold greater in the internal thoracic artery (p = 0.03), tenfold greater in the saphenous vein (p = 0.01) and threefold in the radial artery (p = 0.05). In conclusion, the greater removal from plasma of FC compared with CE and the remarkably greater vessel tissue uptake of FC compared with CE suggests that, in the plasma, FC dissociates from the nanoemulsion particles and precipitates in the vessels. Considering LDE as an artificial nanoemulsion model for LDL, our results suggest that dissociation of FC from lipoprotein particles and deposition in the vessel wall may play a role as an independent mechanism in atherogenesis."

Under cardiopulmonary bypass with ventricular fibrillation and left vent through left atrial appendage, the right radial artery was anastomosed to the left circumflex artery from the descending thoracic aorta, and the right gastroepiploic artery was anastomosed to the right coronary artery (4AV branch). Patency of the bypass was confirmed postoperatively. We consider this operative technique was especially useful for reoperation in cases of a patent internal thoracic artery in which left thoracotomy can be conducted safely."

            "abstract": "A 78-year-old male who had a bronchial asthma underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the left internal thoracic artery and the radial artery. The patient could not be weaned from the cardiopulmonary bypass because the radial artery which anastomosed to the obtuse marginal artery (OM) had a spasm after CABG. An additional bypass using a long saphenous vein to OM was carried out immediately. It brought a weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. If the cardiac function after CABG is insufficient in patients with bronchial asthma, CABG must be re-done immediately, considering that they cause the arterial spasm more than patients without bronchial asthma."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is a technique for coronary artery bypass grafting performed under direct vision without sternotomy or cardiopulmonary bypass. The approach has been used principally for primary single vessel grafting of the anterior or inferior coronary circulation. This initial experience presents a new lateral technique for patients with isolated circumflex coronary disease which can be used for both primary and reoperative revascularization with either saphenous vein or a free radial artery conduit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Lateral MIDCAB grafting of the circumflex coronary circulation was accomplished over a 33 month period at a single center using saphenous vein or free radial artery as the bypass conduit. Through a limited posterior thoracotomy, the lung is deflated and reflected superiorly. The pericardium is opened below the phrenic nerve to expose an obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery. After heparinization, the coronary artery is temporarily occluded proximally and distally with local immobilization and an arteriotomy is performed. The distal anastomosis with running suture is followed by the proximal anastomosis on the descending aorta below the hilum of the lung using a side-biting clamp and radiopaque marker. Intraoperative transit time ultrasound flow measurements confirm adequate graft flow before wound closure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      To date, 19 patients have undergone this procedure with a mean follow-up of 12 months. A total of 12 patients received saphenous vein grafts and 7 patients received radial artery grafts. There was one death from arrhythmia on postoperative day 9. There was one elective conversion to conventional sternotomy due to inadequate exposure. Graft flows averaged 33.3 cc/min (range 5-87) and the mean postoperative length of stay was 4.5 days; 4 patients underwent recatheterization; 1 had graft occlusion and 2 received late postoperative catheter-based interventions. All patients are currently free of symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Lateral MIDCAB grafting provides focused revascularization to the circumflex distribution in both primary and reoperative settings. This approach avoids the hazards of resternotomy, eliminates cardiopulmonary bypass, and hastens postoperative recovery. These early results suggest the technique is effective at relieving symptoms and minimizing perioperative morbidity. Further experience at multiple centers will serve to define the ultimate capabilities of this new approach."

Patency outcomes in RAPCO will focus only on the trial graft in each case. However, postoperative angiography from this ongoing study has reassessed all coronary grafts, both trial and nontrial: together these offer a valuable observational overview of likely graft patency in the current era in predominately asymptomatic patients, in contrast to symptom-directed studies that may overestimate the incidence of graft failure.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Protocol-directed percutaneous angiography has been performed at intervals weighted toward the end of the study period, or earlier when directed by symptoms. To date, 184 patients have been studied as per protocol, at time points up to 10 years (mean, 3.9), among whom there are 430 nontrial grafts in addition to the 184 trial grafts. Supplementary angiography (percutaneous or computed tomography) was offered at a fixed 5-year time point postoperatively: at this juncture, 193 trial grafts and 469 nontrial grafts have been imaged. Three masked investigators report grafts as angiographically successful if patent from proximal to distal anastomosis inclusive. Failed grafts include greater than 80% stenosis, string sign, or occlusion.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In staggered protocol-directed angiography, overall patency of the in-situ internal thoracic artery grafts and free arterial grafts was 95.5% (210 of 220) and 91.4%% (150 of 164), respectively, which did not differ significantly (p = 0.13). Saphenous vein graft patency was 83.0% (191 of 230) with a trend to higher failure rate compared with free arterial grafts (p = 0.07), and was significantly lower than that of in-situ internal thoracic artery grafts (p = 0.01). At the optional 5-year time point, outcomes are similar to the protocol-directed findings, with patency of in-situ left and right internal thoracic artery grafts of 95.8% (204 of 213), which was significantly greater than that of the other two groups (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001).

Until the results from RAPCO are available, which will test types of free arterial graft against each other and will compare radial and vein grafts in the longer term, these observational data justify for now our current practice of maximal use of in-situ conduits supplemented by free radial grafts."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The treatment of coronary artery disease has evolved rapidly over the last two decades. The gold standard of surgical revascularization, the on-pump coronary artery bypass graft, has been challenged by the development of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Our experience with the alternative of the off-pump (\"beating heart\") coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) technique during a period of 18 months suggests that OPCAB avoids the complications of cardiopulmonary bypass and offers patients the benefit of long-term graft patency that greatly exceeds that of current endovascular technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The early results of 126 OPCAB procedures performed through a medial sternotomy incision during a period of 18 months were evaluated. There were 80 male and 46 female patients, with a mean age of 69 +/- 4.3 years. Emergency cases and reoperations were not included. A total of 268 anastomoses were performed, with a mean number of 2.12 anastomoses per patient. Conduits used, with their percentage of use, were: left internal thoracic artery (LITA) (100%), right internal thoracic artery (11.1%), greater saphenous vein (84%), and radial artery (31%). In 72% of the cases, off-pump surgery was chosen because of patient risk factors such as atherosclerotic aortic disease, previous cerebrovascular accident or carotid artery disease, renal dysfunction, malignancy or poor left ventricular function.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was no operative mortality. One-month postoperative mortality was three patients (2.3%). Two died because of mesenteric ischemia, and the other death was due to cardiac failure. Seventy-one patients had a control angiogram before discharge. The patency of LITA anastomosis was 100% while overall patency rate was 95%. In 43 patients for whom an angiogram could not be performed, a Thallum 201 stress test was performed three months postoperatively. Thirty-eight patients had a normal test while five patients showed signs of ischemia. These patients had a control angiogram: in four patients anastomoses were patent, but in one patient there was a severe narrowing of a venous anastomosis to the distal right coronary artery (RCA) which was corrected with angioplasty. In the whole series eight patients (6.3%) refused to have any control examination.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our early results suggest that off-pump CABG with Octopus 2 (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) can be a good alternative in high risk patients who need multiple vessel revascularization."

This paper shows how this aim has been achieved during one year in 130 off-pump cases performed through a sternotomy. This strategy allows for full revascularization (up to six grafts) without the disadvantage of cardiopulmonary bypass. The study introduces a variant of the Octopus stabilizer, a single Octopus 1 arm (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) with a dual holder.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      From November 1998 through February 2000, 130 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting through a sternotomy off-pump utilizing a stabilizer and CO2 blower. The stabilizer most frequently used to achieve this was a single Octopus 1 arm equipped with a dual holder to accommodate two straight suction pods. The holder allowed increased flexibility and manipulation of the suction pods with an equivalent of seven degrees' freedom of motion at the dual holder junction. Techniques for carrying out total revascularization are discussed. The progress of proportion of elective primary CABG revascularization performed off-pump is shown and results are compared with published reviews of the literature for off-pump coronary revascularization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patient demographics included: age range 32 to 87, mean 61.3; female sex: 17%; ejection fraction < 50%: 54%; presence of left main stem disease: 17%. Overall Parsonnet risk score ranged 0-31, with a mean of 8.8. Graft numbers carried out were: 34 x 2, 34 x 3, 32 x 4, 25 x 5 and 5 x 6 anastomoses respectively. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3.6 +/- 1.0. There was extensive coverage of the lateral aspect of the heart (153 circumflex territory grafts, 33%). Radial artery, left internal mammary artery or saphenous vein sequential (jump) grafts were used in 26 cases (20%). Apart from general experience, the use of the dual holder and wide opening of the right pleura were the two important factors allowing freedom for multi-vessel lateral and posterior wall grafting. Thirteen Genzyme (Genzyme Surgical Products, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and ten Octopus 2 (or 2+) stabilizers were used, mostly for two or three grafts. The remainder were carried out using the Octopus 1 (dual holder: 83). In the first three-month period, 31% of cases were off-pump compared to the last three-month period, when 96% were off-pump. In the last two months we performed 100% of all 27 cases referred off-pump. There were no deaths, strokes or myocardial infarctions. Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in two cases. Conversions to bypass were undertaken twice. Two unexpected renal failures occurred, neither of which were from the 13 patients with preoperative incipient renal failure, of whom none suffered a rise in postoperative creatinine of greater than 30%. The results compare favorably with published results despite having a large mean number of grafts of 3.6.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Off-pump surgery with full revascularization has now become feasible for all primary elective coronary artery graft operations."

Fourteen patients from the prospective study have received 6 months of angiographic assessment so far. Forty-two grafts have been evaluated: all IMA grafts (n = 14) are patent.

The G/N ratio was determined as a ratio of the luminal diameter of the graft to that of the revascularized coronary artery so as to evaluate the luminal discrepancy between the graft and the native artery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the 122 patients who underwent angiographies about one month after the operation, the patency rate was 99% (144 of 145) in the RA, 97% (139 of 143) in the left internal thoracic artery graft (LITA), 96% (75 of 78) in the saphenous vein graft (SV). In the 23 patients who underwent mid-term angiographies, the patency rate was 91% (24 of 26) in the RA, 100% (23 of 23) in the LITA, and 83% (20 of 24) in the SV. The luminal diameters of the RA and LITA significantly increased from 2.15 to 2.52 mm, and from 1.75 to 1.97 mm, respectively. The luminal change from 3.78 to 3.33 mm in the SV was not significant. The G/N ratios changed from 1.10 to 1.31, from 1.01 to 1.13, and from 2.05 to 1.86 in the RA, LITA, and SV, respectively. The change of the RA alone was statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The angiographic early patency rate was almost the same in three kinds of graft material, but the mid-term patency rate of the RA was between those of the LITA and SV. The mid-term luminal dilatation of the RA could involve two conflicting characteristics, namely, a good intimal function and a propensity to increase in the luminal discrepancy. Therefore, a further observation is required to evaluate whether the clinical outcome of the RA could remain as good as that of the LITA in the long-term period."

To test the role of the lipid peroxidation- and inflammation-derived aldehyde, acrolein, in human vasospasm, we developed an ex vivo model using human coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) blood vessels and a demonstrated acrolein precursor, allylamine. Allylamine induces hypercontraction in isolated rat coronary artery in a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity (SSAO) dependent manner. Isolated human CABG blood vessels (internal mammary artery, radial artery, saphenous vein) were used to determine: (1) vessel responses and sensitivity to acrolein, allylamine, and H(2)O(2) exposure (1 microM-1 mM), (2) SSAO dependence of allylamine-induced effects using SSAO inhibitors (semicarbazide, 1 mM; MDL 72274-E, active isomer; MDL 72274-Z, inactive isomer; 100 microM), (3) the vasoactive effects of two other SSAO amine substrates, benzylamine and methylamine, and (4) the contribution of extracellular Ca(2+) to hypercontraction. Acrolein or allylamine but not H(2)O(2), benzylamine, or methylamine stimulated spontaneous and pharmacologically intractable hypercontraction in CABG blood vessels that was similar to clinical vasospasm. Allylamine-induced hypercontraction and blood vessel SSAO activity were abolished by pretreatment with semicarbazide or MDL 72274-E but not by MDL 72274-Z. Allylamine-induced hypercontraction also was significantly attenuated in Ca(2+)-free buffer. In isolated aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rat, allylamine-induced an SSAO-dependent contraction and enhanced norepinephrine sensitivity but not in Sprague-Dawley rat aorta.

In our clinical experience, the radial artery, if harvested carefully, has proved to be an excellent bypass graft. This investigation was undertaken to study the differences in blood flow measured directly after extracorporeal circulation in radial artery grafts and venous grafts. Both grafts were compared to the left internal mammarian artery anastomosed to the LAD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between January 1998 and December 1999, 198 patients who were undergoing coronary artery revascularization with two grafts were retrospectively investigated. In all patients, the left internal mammarian artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the left anterior descending branch (LAD). For the second graft, either the saphenous vein or the radial artery was used. Proximal anstomoses were performed as end-to-side into the ascending aorta. Patients were divided into four groups: Group 1: n = 79 IMA-LAD, vein to the circumflex artery; Group 2: n = 56 IMA-LAD, vein to the right coronary artery; Group 3: n = 34; IMA-LAD, radial artery to the circumflex artery; Group 4: n = 29 IMA-LAD, radial artery to the right coronary artery. Graft-flow measurements were performed using the transit-time method after extracorporeal circulation was terminated. The mean systolic, diastolic, and mean blood flow were measured, and the pulsatility index was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the of t-test analysis between the variables mean blood flow and pulsatility index. A p-value of < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no statistically significant differences in mean blood flow or pulsatility index between radial artery and saphenous vein grafts to the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery, respectively. Also, there were no differences regarding vein grafts to the right coronary artery and to the circumflex artery, or regarding radial artery grafts to the two coronaries, respectively. In group 4, significantly lower blood flow to the LAD was found compared to group 1, and a significantly higher pulsatility index compared to groups 2 and 3.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Radial artery grafts compared to saphenous vein grafts do not show significant differences early after operation in mean blood flow or pulsatility index. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term performance of radial arteries as coronary bypass grafts and to compare the radial artery to the right mammarian artery and the standard saphenous vein graft."

Internal thoracic artery grafts were used in 248 (71%) patients at the time of the first coronary artery bypass grafting operation and in 154 (44%) patients at reoperation. Patients were grouped based on whether a functional radial artery graft was present after coronary artery bypass grafting reoperation (radial artery cohort, n = 203 [59%]) or not (saphenous vein cohort, n = 144 [41%]). Median time to reoperation was similar for the radial artery (10.3 years) and saphenous vein (10.1 years) cohorts (P = .55). Angiographic data were used to ascertain the number and type of grafts that remained functional from initial coronary artery bypass grafting. Survival data (< or = 12 years) were time segmented based on multiphase hazard modeling at 90 days, and late survival was then analyzed by using proportional hazard Cox regression, with risk adjustment based on a radial artery-use propensity score computed from 48 covariates, including time to reoperation, month of surgical intervention, and total arterial and vein grafts after reoperation. Propensity-matched and propensity quintile comparisons were also done.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Follow-up was similar for the radial artery versus saphenous vein cohorts (5.7 +/- 3.4 vs 5.8 +/- 4.0 years, P = .86), and 112 (50 in the radial artery and 62 in the saphenous vein cohorts) deaths were documented. Early mortality (< or = 90 days) did not differ for the radial artery (7.4%) and saphenous vein (12.5%) cohorts (P = .14). Unadjusted late outcomes were superior for the radial artery versus saphenous vein cohorts, with survival of 97.3% versus 92.9%, 84.9% versus 77.2%, and 74.1% versus 60.3% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

Complications associated with clearing blood from the vessel of a living patient have prevented its wider acceptance. We identify a surgical application that takes advantage of the vascular imaging powers of OCT but that circumvents the difficulties. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most commonly performed major surgery in America. A critical determinant of its outcome has been postulated to be injury to the conduit vessel incurred during the harvesting procedure or pathology preexistent in the harvested vessel. As a test of feasibility, intravascular OCT imaging is obtained from the radial arteries (RAs) and/or saphenous veins (SVs) of 35 patients scheduled for CABG. Pathologies detected by OCT are compared to registered histological sections obtained from discarded segments of each graft. OCT reliably detects atherosclerotic lesions in the RAs and discerns plaque morphology as fibrous, fibrocalcific, or fibroatheromatous. OCT is also used to assess intimal trauma and residual thrombi related to endoscopic harvest and the quality of the distal anastomosis. We demonstrate the feasibility of OCT imaging as an intraoperative tool to select conduit vessels for CABG."

The second section of the study compared outcomes for the RITA (n = 132) versus the RA (n = 171) as second arterial grafts since 1992, when the radial series was initiated. Part I: By multivariable stepwise logistic regression, the use of 1 arterial graft was associated with an increased incidence of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 3.3), with the use of our current patient selection criteria. Double-arterial graft patients had a nonsignificant trend toward increased intermediate-term actuarial survival (P = 0.12) and cardiac event-free survival (P = 0.09). Part II: Comparison of preoperative demographics revealed a higher incidence of diabetes (27% vs 11%, P < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (16% vs 8%, P = 0.03), and elderly age (13% vs 2%, P = 0.001) in patients receiving an RA versus those receiving a RITA as the second arterial graft. Perioperative outcome analysis revealed a decreased intensive care unit stay in the RA versus RITA group (median 30.4 vs 36.2 hours, respectively, P = 0.005) but no significant difference in hospital length of stay. There was no significant difference in perioperative mortality or cardiac morbidity rates. RITA patients had a higher incidence of sternal wound infection (5.3% vs 0.6%, P = 0.01), however, and tended to have increased blood product transfusion rates (51% vs 40%, P = 0.06).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of 2 arterial grafts is safe, with a reduction in perioperative cardiac morbidity or mortality rates compared with 1 arterial graft after adjustment for other risk variables. When comparing RITA to RA as second arterial grafts, patients receiving an RA have a lower incidence of sternal wound infection and decreased transfusion requirements, with no difference in perioperative or intermediate-term cardiac morbidity or mortality rates."

            "abstract": "From April to December 2002, 40 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the St. Jude Medical (Minneapolis) Symmetry bypass system (aortic connector system: ACS). 59 proximal anastomoses (51 saphenous vein grafts, 8 radial artery grafts) were performed with the ACS. One saphenous vein graft occluded during operation. Postoperative evaluation of the anastomotic patency was carried out by angiography in 45 grafts. Five of the saphenous vein grafts were occluded (5/38). One patient who was shock state before operation presented with postoperative unconsciousness. Another patient died at 8th postoperative day caused by ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that the ACS produces a simple, quick way of performing the proximal anastomosis without the need for clamping the aorta, allows reducing risk of embolization by aortic manipulation. However, it is necessary to discuss sufficiently using the ACS, because the graft patency with the ACS is lower than with standard suturing technique."

However, arterial grafts in elderly patients are often diseased. We sought to compare the early outcomes achieved by using the two different types of composite grafts.\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS\nWe conducted a randomized trial to compare radial artery (RA) and SV composite grafts based on the in situ left internal mammary artery in 60 elderly (>70 years old) patients, who were scheduled to undergo OPCAB. Clinical outcomes and 1-year postoperative CT angiography results were compared. The quality of the conduit was evaluated by employing vascular ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histologic examination.\n## RESULTS\nNo differences in immediate postoperative morbidity and mortality were observed between the two groups. Early postoperative CT angiography revealed a SV patency rate of 100%, which was not different from that of RA composite grafts (99.1%). CT angiography after a year showed an overall patency rate of 96.3%. The overall patency rate of the SV group at 1 year was 94.7%, which was similar to that of the RA group (97.4%). Also, there was no difference in overall survival rate between the two groups. Vascular ultrasonographic images showed strong correlations between OCT and histopathology.\n## CONCLUSION\nOur analysis of early outcomes revealed that the SV could be used as an alternative composite graft to the RA in elderly patients. Vascular ultrasonography is an accurate, real-time, and reproducible method for assessing the quality of the RA conduit.\n"

The clear benefits of using the left internal mammary artery for revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery have encouraged the use of other arteries in different areas. The right internal mammary artery and the radial artery are competing for the role as the second most useful conduit. Moreover, use of the right gastroepiploic artery or the inferior epigastric artery, although both are less popular, enables complete revascularization to be carried out using only arterial grafts in most patients. The majority of publications on the subject endorse the extensive use of arterial conduits. However, most findings are based on observational and angiographic data that are derived essentially from studies on symptomatic patients. Consequently, indications for the different techniques have not been standardized. On the other hand, the patency of saphenous vein grafts has improved recently. This article describes the anatomical and histologic characteristics of arterial conduits. The indications for, and advantages and limitations of, the different techniques available are reviewed. In addition, the clinical and angiographic results achieved are considered, as is the role of arterial conduits in different anatomical and clinical settings.

There were significant differences between patent and non patent grafts in all of the intra-operative flow parameters. Only the FFT ratio, the ratio of powers of the fundamental frequency and its first harmonic, could be utilized as a cut-off value to distinguish patent from non patent grafts.

No-React bovine internal mammary artery (NR-IMA) is available for restricted use in Europe. In this first study, our aim was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the clinical performance and patency rates of this conduit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seven patients received 8 grafts with NR-IMA. Approval from the Medical Devices Agency of the United Kingdom was obtained for use of this material. One patient needed salvage coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Graft patency was investigated with cardiac MRI. One patient was excluded from the MRI study because of the presence of intracerebral metal clips. The mean follow-up period was 2.5 years with a range of 1 to 4.5 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was no mortality in this group. After treatment 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 1 patient had class II anginal symptoms. Four (57%) of the 7 NR-IMA grafts remained patent. The longest patency was 4.5 years in a patient who underwent salvage CABG. Other associated grafts in this cohort of patients were 5 left internal mammary arteries (all patent), 1 radial artery graft (patent), and 7 saphenous vein grafts (4 [57%] of 7 patent). There were no occluded NR-IMA grafts in a patient with patent vein grafts.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We concluded that at 2.5 year follow-up, NR-IMA had a patency rate of 57% (4 of 7 cases). This rate matched the vein graft patency rate in this cohort of patients. With the longest patency of 4.5 years, use of NR-IMA seems to hold promise for the future."

If this becomes standardized practice, the optimal conduit for the right coronary system remains to be established. Our objective is to compare the performance of the radial artery versus the saphenous vein when used to graft the right coronary artery or its branches during an 8-year period after primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcomes study is a randomized controlled trial comparing radial artery, saphenous vein, and free right internal thoracic artery.

Noninferiority tests show that absolute radial patency to saphenous patency is at least 0.9526 (p = 0.025). Kaplan-Meier estimates of angiographic outcomes show no significant difference (log rank p = 0.22). Cardiac events in the right coronary territory occurred in the radial artery group (1.79%) versus the saphenous vein group (4.93%; p = 0.26). Overall mortality was 8.03% in the radial artery group versus 12.5% in the saphenous vein group (p = 0.23).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The radial artery patency is at least comparable to that of the saphenous vein when grafted to the right coronary artery or its branches.

Bilateral versus single internal thoracic artery grafts is associated with improved survival, which progressively increased over the 20 years of post-surgery. The average increase in survival was 15% at 20 years. The question of whether to use the radial artery or the saphenous vein graft as supplementary grafts remains unanswered. Current patency data suggest that there is a marginal advantage of radial artery over saphenous graft patency, particularly between 5 and 10 years after surgery. However, there appears to be improved patency of the saphenous vein when used as a coronary artery bypass with the advent of aspirin, lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive therapy."

We investigated whether endothelial dysfunction in radial artery conduits is present, and can be identified, preoperatively using a simple noninvasive ultrasound test of radial artery endothelial response, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). The study population consisted of 126 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting. The afternoon before operation, patients had noninvasive ultrasound assessment of endothelial function in the left radial artery by FMD, which measures change in arterial size after an increase in flow-an endothelial-dependent response. Surplus graft segments were obtained at operation and nitric oxide bioavailability within the vessels determined from ex vivo responses to acetylcholine. Preoperative FMD in the radial artery was associated with vasorelaxations to acetylcholine in radial artery grafts (p<0.001 for both dose-response curves and maximum relaxations), although there was weak borderline association between FMD and vasorelaxations of saphenous vein grafts (p=0.07 for dose-response curves and p<0.05 for maximum relaxations). In multivariate analysis including cardiac risk factors, FMD was a predictor of vasorelaxations of radial artery grafts (beta=0.020, SE=0.009, p=0.030), independent of classic risk factors for atherosclerosis. In conclusion, there is significant interindividual variation in the endothelial function of vessels used for coronary artery bypass surgery, particularly the radial artery.

            "abstract": "Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the standard surgical procedure for the treatment of advanced coronary artery disease. CABG surgery has been demonstrated to improve symptoms and, in specific subgroups of patients, to prolong life. Despite its success, the long-term outcome of coronary bypass surgery is strongly influenced by the fate of the vascular conduits used. Impressive long-term disease-free patency rate of the left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending coronary artery (LITA-LAD) graft, coupled with proven long-term survival benefits, has led to its becoming a 'golden standard' of CABG. Previous long-term studies have also shown unsatisfactory patency of saphenous vein grafts used for myocardial revascularization, compared with internal thoracic artery grafts. Thus, the use of arterial conduits has expanded beyond the internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) to include the right gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery, and the radial artery. The assumption is that although the performance of one or two arterial ITA graft is superb, more arterial grafts should perform better in the long-term follow-up. Several studies concerning the use of the radial artery bypass grafts have documented excellent clinical results and satisfactory short-term as well as mid-term patency rates at restudy angiography, supporting its continued use as a bypass conduit. However, a note of caution concerning radial artery conduit patency rate have appeared in few recent reports. Thus, in this paper, we summarize the current evidence about the radial artery as a conduit in CABG surgery, with special emphasis on the clinical results."
