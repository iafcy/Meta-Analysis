vein grafts (P(cid:1)0.01).
Conclusions—Radial artery aortocoronary bypass grafts to a stenosed branch of the circumflex coronary artery have an
excellent patency rate at 5 years. This was significantly better than the patency rate for saphenous vein grafts and
comparable to reported patency rates for internal thoracic artery grafts. (Circulation. 2008;117:2859-2864.)

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Recentpublicationshighlighttheongoingroleforandimportanceofcoronaryarterybypasssurgeryintheinterventional
management of ischemic heart disease. There is still debate as to the role of radial artery grafts in this procedure. As
GardnerstatedlastyearinaneditorialinCirculation,“Additionalclarityabouttheusefulnessandreliabilityoftheradial
artery ... will ... come from late studies of radial artery graft function especially angiographic studies (cid:1)5 years after
CABG” (Gardner TJ. Searching for the second-best coronary artery bypass graft: is it the radial artery? Circulation.
2007:115:676–680). This small randomized trial is the first to report such data. It is important to note the good 5-year
patency(86%)thatcanbeachievedinthemodernerawithsaphenousveingrafts.Theradialarterypatencyrateat5years

graft disease should substantially change clinical practice, with much more widespread and acceptable use of the radial
artery as an aortocoronary bypass graft.
