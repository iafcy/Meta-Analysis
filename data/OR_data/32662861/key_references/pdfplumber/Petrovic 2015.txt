Abstract
Background: There is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy oftheradial artery (RA) as an aortocoronary conduit,
withfew solid data regardinglong-termclinical results. We sought to determine if theuse of the RA as the second
arterial conduit,beside leftinternal thoracic artery (LITA), would improve long-term clinical outcome after CABG as
compared to saphenous vein graft (SVG).
Methods: Between March 2001 and November 2003, 200 patients underwent isolated CABG and were
randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive either LITA and RA grafts or LITA and SVGs. The primary end point was
composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial
revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous).
Results: Therewasnosignificantdifferenceinabsolutesurvival,with12deathsineachgroupduringthestudyperiod
