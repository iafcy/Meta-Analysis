Background and Objectives: Arterial grafts have a better long-term patency rate than saphenous vein (SV) when used in off-pump coro-
nary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB). However, arterial grafts in elderly patients are often diseased. We sought to compare the early outcomes
achieved by using the two different types of composite grafts.
Subjects and Methods: We conducted a randomized trial to compare radial artery (RA) and SV composite grafts based on the in situ left
internal mammary artery in 60 elderly (>70 years old) patients, who were scheduled to undergo OPCAB. Clinical outcomes and 1-year post-
operative CT angiography results were compared. The quality of the conduit was evaluated by employing vascular ultrasonography, optical co-
herence tomography (OCT), and histologic examination.
Results: No differences in immediate postoperative morbidity and mortality were observed between the two groups. Early postoperative CT
angiography revealed a SV patency rate of 100%, which was not different from that of RA composite grafts (99.1%). CT angiography after a
year showed an overall patency rate of 96.3%. The overall patency rate of the SV group at 1 year was 94.7%, which was similar to that of the
RA group (97.4%). Also, there was no difference in overall survival rate between the two groups. Vascular ultrasonographic images showed
strong correlations between OCT and histopathology.
Conclusion: Our analysis of early outcomes revealed that the SV could be used as an alternative composite graft to the RA in elderly pa-
tients. Vascular ultrasonography is an accurate, real-time, and reproducible method for assessing the quality of the RA conduit. (Korean
