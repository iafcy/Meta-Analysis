Objective: This study was undertaken to compare elective angiographic
patencyandcardiacevent-freesurvivaloftheradialarterygraftwiththat
ofthefreerightinternalthoracicarteryorsaphenousveinduringa10-year
period after primary coronary artery bypass surgery.
Methods:Thisprospective,randomized,single-centertrialwasconducted
on two groups of patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass
surgery. In a younger group (group 1, n (cid:1) 285, (cid:2)70 years), the radial
arterywascomparedwiththefreerightinternalthoracicartery.Inanolder
group(group2,n(cid:1)153,(cid:1)70years),theradialarterywascomparedwith
