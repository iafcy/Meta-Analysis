Background—Graft patency is a fundamental predictor of long-term survival after coronary artery bypass surgery. Left and
right internal thoracic artery (arterial) graft patency has been shown to be superior to that of saphenous vein grafts. More
recently, the radial artery has been used as an aortocoronary graft, but little is known about the midterm and long-term
patency of this conduit. We performed a single-center prospective randomized trial comparing the angiographic patency
of radial artery and saphenous vein aortocoronary bypass grafts at 5 years after surgery.
Methods and Results—We enrolled 142 patients randomized at a single center to have either the radial artery or saphenous
vein grafted to a stenosed branch of the native left circumflex coronary artery. The primary end point was angiographic
graft patency 5 years postoperatively. At 5 years, 134 patients were alive and eligible for reangiography (5-year survival,
94.4%). Angiography was performed in 103 patients (77%); 98.3% of radial artery grafts and 86.4% of saphenous vein
grafts were patent (P0.04). Graft narrowing occurred in 10% of patent radial artery grafts and 23% of patent saphenous
vein grafts (P0.01).
Conclusions—Radial artery aortocoronary bypass grafts to a stenosed branch of the circumflex coronary artery have an
excellent patency rate at 5 years. This was significantly better than the patency rate for saphenous vein grafts and
comparable to reported patency rates for internal thoracic artery grafts. (Circulation. 2008;117:2859-2864.)

T
he therapeutic options for patients with multivessel
coronary artery disease consist of medical therapy only,
percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary arterial
stents, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). It had
been hoped that drug-eluting stents would address some of
the limitations of percutaneous coronary intervention with
bare metal stents. However, a number of recent publications
have questioned both the clinical results and cost-
effectiveness of drug-eluting stents in the management of
coronary artery disease.1–3 This has resulted in renewed
interest in the midterm and long-term results that may be
achievable with CABG.1–3 The ultimate goal of this operation
is to achieve complete revascularization of the patient with
conduits that will remain patent for the duration of the
patient’s lifetime.4 The excellent patency rates achieved with
the pedicled left internal mammary artery are well de-
scribed. Over the past decade, there has been considerable
interest in whether the left internal mammary radial artery
may provide results comparable to the arterial conduit.
Observational studies have reported satisfactory early and
midterm postoperative radial artery patency rates on the
order of 92% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years.5 A recent
prospective, randomized, multicenter trial (the Radial Ar-
tery Patency Study [RAPS]) confirmed these observational
data, reporting significantly better perfect patency rates of
radial artery compared with saphenous vein grafts 1 year
postoperatively. However, the radial artery grafts had a signifi-
cantly higher incidence of compromised flow states.6 At 5 years,
1 prospective randomized study showed no significant differ-
ence in patency rates between the right internal thoracic artery,
radial artery, and saphenous vein grafts, although only 30% of
the study group underwent angiographic assessment.7 Other
studies have suggested inferior patency rates for radial artery
grafts.8,9 Thus, ongoing doubt and debate remain regarding the
efficacy of the radial artery as an aortocoronary conduit, with
few robust data regarding the midterm patency rate of these
grafts. In an editorial in Circulation earlier this year, Gardner,
commenting on the 1-year results of RAPS, concluded, “Addi-
tional clarity about the usefulness and reliability of the radial
artery bypass graft will have to come from late studies of radial

Clinical Perspective p 2864
The Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Graft Patency
(RSVP) trial presented here is a single-center, prospective,
randomized clinical trial designed to compare 5-year patency
rates of radial artery and saphenous vein aortocoronary grafts
to a single coronary artery territory.
Methods
Study Design
The study was designed according to the Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.11 All patients were
scheduled to receive an aortocoronary bypass graft to a large
epicardial coronary artery supplying the lateral wall of the left
ventricle (usually a branch of the circumflex coronary artery).
This vessel was identified angiographically and was deemed by
the surgeon to have a proximal stenosis of 70%. The patients
were randomized preoperatively to receive either a radial artery or
a saphenous vein graft to this vessel. Randomization codes were
obtained by use of a random number generator sequence and
sealed in brown envelopes that were sequentially numbered. The
first 100 patients were to be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 for radial
artery to vein (these patients undergoing angiographic assessment
at 3 months). The randomization process was then to be reversed
to 1:2 for radial artery to vein for the subsequent 100 patients
recruited. The primary objective was to compare the angiographic
patency of the radial artery grafts with that of saphenous vein
grafts 5 years after surgery.
Patient Population
Patients 40 to 70 years of age were enrolled consecutively from all those
undergoing elective primary isolated CABG surgery at the Royal
Brompton Hospital under the care of 5 consultant cardiac surgeons (see
the Acknowledgments for a list of study investigators). Exclusion
criteria were left ventricular ejection fraction 25%, a positive Allen’s
test, a history of Raynaud’s syndrome or vasculitis, bilateral varicose
veins, or any condition that may affect the safety of follow-up angiography.
The study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all
patients provided written informed consent.
Operative Procedure
The nondominant or left (depending on patient-physician preference)
radial artery was harvested in the conventional manner.12 The
saphenous vein was harvested in a routine fashion and gently
distended with heparinized whole blood. The fascia on either side of
the radial artery pedicle was divided radically,13 and the radial artery
was distended with heparinized whole blood with verapamil added
(1 mg/10 mL blood). The intention was to distend the conduit to a
moderate supraphysiological pressure (200 mm Hg).14 Both con-
duits were then stored in the blood or blood/verapamil solutions until
ready for grafting.
All grafts were constructed on cardiopulmonary bypass (“on
pump”). The distal anastomoses were made to the angiographically
identified stenosed epicardial coronary artery supplying the lateral
wall of the left ventricle. All proximal anastomoses were constructed
on the ascending aorta with 6/0 Prolene.
Postoperative Management
Postoperatively, all patients were started on aspirin (150 mg) and a
course of oral diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily for 6 weeks unless
contraindicated by hypotension or bradycardia. Twenty-three pa-
tients with negative Allen’s test of the nondominant forearm were
recruited preoperatively and underwent assessment of bilateral fore-
arm function (soft touch and pinprick neural sensation, circumfer-
ence, handgrip power, cyclical exercise fatigue) and blood flow
measurements (forearm plethysmography).15
Follow-Up Angiography
Follow-up angiography was scheduled for 5 years postoperatively.
Ethics committee approval was given to intubate and view only the
randomized (study) graft at follow-up unless there was a clinical
indication for a full angiographic examination. All coronary angio-
grams were performed by a consultant cardiologist using 5F, 6F, or
7F angiographic catheters with Omnipaque contrast medium. Images
were acquired digitally (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) in 2
planes at an acquisition rate of 12.5 frames per second.
End Points
The primary end point was the proportion of radial artery and
saphenous vein grafts that were patent at 5 years. This was
determined by independent review of the angiograms by 3 experi-
enced observers. Two observers reviewed and graded the angio-
grams on 2 separate occasions. The graft was graded as either patent
or completely occluded. Complete occlusion was defined as the
absence of visible opacification of the study graft despite aortogram
(Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 0 to 3).16
Additional secondary angiographic visual grading of the grafts was
defined as follows: P1perfect patency; P2compromised flow
states (stenosis at anastomoses or in the body of the graft) 50%;
P3compromised flow states 50%; P4severe diffuse graft nar-
rowing (string sign); and P5total occlusion.
The only robust clinical outcome assessed was mortality. All
deaths were confirmed with reports from the UK death registry,
which included date and cause of death.
Statistical Analysis
The study was powered at 80% to detect a 15% absolute difference
in angiographic patency (ie, patent versus occluded) at 5 years. This
was based on an estimate of saphenous vein graft patency to the
circumflex of 75% at 5 years17,18 and a projected radial artery
patency of 90%. With significance set at 5%, a total of 188 patients
were required. Allowing for a 6% dropout, we aimed to recruit 100
patients in each arm.
Patient characteristics were compared between the 2 randomized
groups for all patients and for the subgroup who underwent 5-year
angiography; in addition, characteristics were compared for patients
who did and did not undergo angiography. Fisher’s exact test was
used for categorical variables, and Student’s t test was used for
continuous variables. The primary analysis data percentages are
expressed as the percent of patients who underwent angiography at
5 years. Data are presented as meanSD. Results were analyzed
with STATA 9.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex).

Results
Patients
From 1998 to 2000, 142 patients were enrolled. The Table
lists the clinical characteristics of the 142 patients enrolled
and the 103 patients who underwent follow-up angiography.
The target vessel stenosis was not significantly different
between groups. The patient population undergoing reangiog-
raphy had no systematic or significant differences compared
with the patients who did not undergo reangiography except
for a borderline difference in smoking status between groups
who were randomized to saphenous vein (current, 5%
versus 25%; ex, 68% versus 44%; never, 27% versus 22%;
P0.047, angiography versus no angiography).

Operative Data
Patients randomized to radial artery and saphenous vein
grafts received 3.30.7 (median, 3; range, 2 to 5) and
3.30.6 (median, 3; range, 2 to 4) grafts, respectively.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time (9628 and 9528 minutes)
and cross-clamp time (5019 and 5120 minutes) were the
same for both groups. Thirty-day mortality was 0.7% (n1);
1 patient in the saphenous vein cohort experienced a cata-
strophic stroke on postoperative day 3 and died on day 8.
There was no difference in in-hospital morbidity except for
delayed wound healing in the conduit harvest site, which was
more common in the saphenous vein group (16% versus 5%;
P0.03). In the 23 patients studied, harvesting of the radial
artery did not adversely affect subsequent forearm function or
blood flow to a clinically significant degree 3.40.4 months
postoperatively.15
Postoperative Medical Treatment
At 5 years, patients randomized to radial artery or saphenous
vein grafts were taking equivalent amounts of cardiovascular
medication, including aspirin, lipid-lowering drugs, angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors, -blockers, and calcium
channel antagonists, as prescribed by their primary physician.
There were no significant differences between the groups.
Angiography at 5 Years
Follow-up angiography was performed in 103 of the 134
patients alive and not withdrawn from the study (77%; the
Table). Angiography was performed a meanSD of 6710
and 6812 months after surgery in those patients randomized
to radial artery and saphenous vein grafts, respectively.
Primary Analysis
Graft occlusion (P5) occurred in 6 of 44 saphenous vein grafts
and 1 of 59 radial artery grafts, corresponding to patency rates
of 86.4% and 98.3% (P0.04; Figure 1) and an absolute
difference of 11.9% (95% CI, 5.6 to 18.2) between saphenous
vein and radial artery grafts.
Secondary Analysis
Visual grading of the angiographic data is presented in Figure
2. Ten patients (23%) with patent vein grafts had graft disease
graded P2 or P3. Five radial artery grafts graded P2 or P3
(8.5%) had anastomotic stenoses but remained patent with
good flow and had no evidence of graft disease/atheroma/
intimal proliferation. The string sign (P4) was present in 1
radial artery graft and 0 saphenous vein grafts.

Discussion
In this single-center randomized study of aortocoronary bypass
grafts to a single coronary territory, the angiographic patency of
radial artery grafts at 5 years was significantly superior to that of
saphenous vein grafts. This is the first trial to report the
systematic repeat angiographic study of radial artery grafts at 5
years in a randomized trial. The radial artery grafts were
significantly superior to the saphenous vein grafts in terms of
both absolute patency and perfect patency. This study demon-
strates the relatively frequent (23%) occurrence of occlusive
disease in the body of patent vein grafts at 5 years. This was
absent in the radial artery grafts. However, a number of the latter
(n5) were prone to suboptimal anastomoses. These stenoses
were not severe and did not adversely affect overall graft
patency at 5 years. When such a stenosis was present at the
3-month angiography (n3),1–3 there was no progression in nar-
rowing at 5 years. If anything, there was a tendency for the degree
of stenosis to be less severe. Therefore, radial artery grafts, like
internal thoracic artery grafts, are free of late graft attrition, at least
at 5 years.
Enrollment in the trial did not reach the proposed total of 200
patients. The reasons for this were multifactorial. For logistical
reasons, a firm date was chosen on which recruitment would
end. By this date, 142 patients had been enrolled. The imbalance
in the numbers between the 2 arms of the study was a result of
the randomization strategy (ie, 2:1 for radial artery to vein for the
first 100 patients and then 1:2 for the remainder) and the
incomplete enrollment of the second group of 100 patients. The
randomization strategy was intentional because, at the time of
trial design, there were concerns regarding the clinical safety and
early patency of radial artery grafts. Therefore, the aim was to
have a sufficient number of patients with radial artery grafts in
the 3-month angiography cohort to address these concerns.1–3
Given the results, we do not believe that the failure to recruit 200
patients affects the message of this trial. In fact, the ability to detect
a statistical significance in such a small study indicates a clinically
important difference.
The trial design was prescriptive, enrolling a relatively
low-risk patient population concentrating on a single coro-
nary artery territory. The vessel to be grafted was identified
angiographically and confirmed at the time of surgery. As a
result of patients declining the invitation to return for restudy,
only 103 of the eligible patients (77%) underwent reangiog-
raphy at 5 years. This rate of angiography is comparable to
previous trials of this type of coronary artery surgery.6 The
patient population undergoing reangiography had no signifi-
cant systematic differences compared with the trial popula-
tion as a whole (the Table).
There has been marked variability in the reported early and
midterm patency of radial artery grafts.5 This is unlikely to be
due to inherent biological differences between the radial
arteries and is more likely to reflect technical issues. We
therefore outlined in the Methods section details of the
harvesting and implantation techniques of the radial artery.
Radical division of the fascia enclosing the radial artery,
followed by moderate supraphysiological distention, facili-
tates the use of the radial artery from a technical standpoint.
We have previously shown that supraphysiological distention
to the degree used causes a 70% to 80% loss of contractility
of radial artery rings in vitro,14 thus reducing the propensity
of the radial artery to spasm. This may reduce the risk of early
postoperative spasm in this muscular artery. No incidence of
clinically important hypoperfusion in the grafted territory was
recorded in the patients with radial artery grafts. Endothelial
injury may potentially affect the in vivo physiology of the
graft and subsequent graft patency. However, we have pre-
viously reported that the radial artery grafts implanted in the
study have preserved endothelial function in vitro.14 Clearly,
this degree of distention did not adversely affect the patency
of these grafts at 5 years.
Our study also confirms the importance of the severity of
target vessel stenosis on the patency of arterial grafts as
reported by Desai et al.6 The single radial artery graft
occlusion occurred in a patient in whom the radial artery had
been incorrectly grafted to a vessel that had a minor stenosis
on the original coronary arteriogram. Similarly, the presence
of the string sign occurred in a patient in whom, retrospec-
tively, the target vessel had a moderate rather than severe
stenosis.

The significant difference in patency between radial artery
and saphenous vein grafts was not achieved because of a
particularly high attrition rate of the saphenous vein grafts.
Complete occlusion of saphenous vein grafts in this study at
5 years occurred in 13.6% compared with a 13.6% rate of
occlusion at 1 year in the RAPS6 study and a predicted rate of
occlusion at 5 years, based on the literature at the time of trial
design, of 25%.17,18 Thus, despite a good patency rate for
saphenous grafts in our trial at 5 years, there was still a
significant superiority of the radial artery grafts. One possible
explanation for the difference in patency rates between this
study and some other published data in this field may depend
on the surgical strategy within our unit, which is an intention
to graft only those vessels with important flow-limiting
stenoses rather than those with more moderate disease. In this
trial, almost half of the target vessels were occluded or had a
stenosis of 90%. Published data suggest that this strategy
may be associated with improved arterial graft patency.19–21
There are a number of limitations of this study, including
its relatively small size, the lack of enrollment of the total
planned number of patients, and an imbalance in numbers
between the 2 arms of the trial. The failure to achieve
complete angiographic follow-up at 5 years is a limitation but
is comparable to other studies of this type in this field. There
was a marked preponderance of men randomized into this
trial. This was not by design. Exclusion criteria such as
Raynaud’s syndrome and poor quality or varicose veins were
more common in the female population. At the time of
recruitment into the trial, there were still concerns regarding
safety in terms of early morbidity and mortality using the
radial artery, and a number of female patients were excluded
because of equivocal Allen’s tests. In addition, we have found
in a number of clinical trials that female patients have been
less willing to be randomized.22 Thus, the conclusions of this
study can be directly applied only to male patients, who form
the large majority of patients undergoing surgical revascular-
ization, and are applicable only by inference to females.
However, it is pertinent to note that other studies have
suggested that the patency benefits of radial arteries over vein
grafts are even more marked in women than in men.19–21 The
preparation methods for the grafts differ but reflect the real
world in terms of graft preparation. The supraphysiological
distension of the radial grafts, while attenuating early spasm,
induces endothelial injury14 and, if anything, would be
expected to adversely affect long-term patency. We did not
believe it to be ethical to distend vein grafts in this manner.
Despite these limitations, we believe that there is a very
clear message from the data: The radial artery is a superior
aortocoronary bypass graft to branches of the circumflex
coronary artery with flow-limiting stenoses compared with
the saphenous vein. In fact, the patency rates achieved for the
radial artery grafts in this study are comparable to patency
rates described for left and right internal thoracic artery
grafts. We believe that our study provides evidence to support
a significant change in clinical practice in terms of the choice
of conduit in coronary artery bypass surgery.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Recent publications highlight the ongoing role for and importance of coronary artery bypass surgery in the interventional
management of ischemic heart disease. There is still debate as to the role of radial artery grafts in this procedure. As
Gardner stated last year in an editorial in Circulation, “Additional clarity about the usefulness and reliability of the radial
artery . . . will . . . come from late studies of radial artery graft function especially angiographic studies 5 years after
CABG” (Gardner TJ. Searching for the second-best coronary artery bypass graft: is it the radial artery? Circulation.
2007:115:676–680). This small randomized trial is the first to report such data. It is important to note the good 5-year
patency (86%) that can be achieved in the modern era with saphenous vein grafts. The radial artery patency rate at 5 years
was excellent (98%), significantly superior to that of saphenous vein grafts and comparable to internal mammary artery
patency. Another important finding was the complete absence of occlusive graft disease in the radial grafts. In addition to
previous 1-year data from this and other radial artery trials, we believe that these 5-year patency rates and the absence of
graft disease should substantially change clinical practice, with much more widespread and acceptable use of the radial
artery as an aortocoronary bypass graft.
