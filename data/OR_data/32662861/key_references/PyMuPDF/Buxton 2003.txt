Objective: This study was undertaken to compare elective angiographic
patency and cardiac event-free survival of the radial artery graft with that
of the free right internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein during a 10-year
period after primary coronary artery bypass surgery.
Methods: This prospective, randomized, single-center trial was conducted
on two groups of patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass
surgery. In a younger group (group 1, n  285, 70 years), the radial
artery was compared with the free right internal thoracic artery. In an older
group (group 2, n  153, 70 years), the radial artery was compared with
the saphenous vein. The trial conduit was grafted to the largest available
coronary artery other than the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Angiography was scheduled at intervals between 0 and 10 years according
to a second random assignment. Patients were followed up at yearly intervals to assess
clinical outcomes. Clinical outcomes were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis during the
10-year follow-up with time-related analyses. This interim study reports angiographic
and clinical outcome results during the ﬁrst 5 years.
Results: Graft patency estimates were as follows: 0.95 (95% conﬁdence interval
0.85-0.99) in 39 radial arteries versus 1.0 in 29 right internal thoracic arteries (P 
.4) in group 1, and 0.86 (95% conﬁdence interval 0.67-0.99) in 24 radial arteries
versus 0.95 (95% conﬁdence interval 0.83-0.99) in 22 saphenous veins (P  .5) in
group 2. Cardiac event–free survival estimates were as follows: 0.91 (95% conﬁ-
dence interval 0.76-0.99) for the radial artery versus 0.82 (95% conﬁdence interval
0.63-0.99) for the right internal thoracic artery (P  .7) in group 1, and 0.84 (95%
conﬁdence interval 0.64-0.99) for the radial artery versus 0.89 (95% conﬁdence
interval 0.72-0.99) for the saphenous vein (P  .9) in group 2.
Conclusion: The 5-year interim results do not support the hypothesis that the radial
artery has superior patency to or is associated with fewer clinical events than free
right internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein grafts.
T
he fates of patients after coronary artery bypass surgery for obstruc-
tive coronary artery disease are in part related to the type of bypass
conduit. Techniques of bypass surgery have changed through the
years, with strong evidence to support the use of one or both in situ
internal thoracic arteries (ITAs). Bilateral, compared with single,
ITA grafting is associated with increased survival and also fewer
ischemic cardiac events.1-3 The right and left ITAs grafted to the left anterior

descending coronary artery (LAD) have identical patency
rates, which exceed the rate of the saphenous vein (SV).
The patency results of free ITA grafts are inferior to
those of in situ grafts, with a 2-fold increase in early graft
failure.4
Studies indicate that the SV has excellent early patency
results; however, between 5 and 10 years there is accel-
erated graft atheroma and increasing rates of graft failure,
so that at 10 years approximately 40% of grafts have
failed. This has led to a search for arteries that could be
used to replace the SV. These arteries include the right
gastroepiploic artery, inferior epigastric artery, and radial
artery (RA). All have demonstrated excellent patency
rates in symptom-directed studies; however, there are
few data about their durability when studied by elective
angiography.
The RA was ﬁrst used in the early 1970s by Carpentier
and colleagues.5 It has many desirable characteristics. It is
readily available in a length suitable for bypassing most
coronary lesions. It is similar in diameter to the proximal
coronary arteries, marginally larger than the ITA and
smaller than most SV grafts. The use of the RA was revis-
ited by Acar and colleagues6 and others,7,8 who discovered
the excellent late patency in a number of Carpentier and
colleagues’ early series. These patients had been receiving
calcium channel blockers.
RA grafts are receiving increasing acceptance, and their
removal is associated with few hand complications, such as
ischemia and donor site hematoma,9,10 with a lower sternal
infection rate,11 and with excellent early clinical results.12,13
Fremes and associates,8 Dietl and Benoit,14 and Bhan and
colleagues15 reported low rates of recurrence of angina,
myocardial infarction, and death. Recent angiographic stud-
ies have shown that the RA achieves excellent short-term
patency when used as a coronary artery bypass con-
duit.14,16-25 Although results of RA grafting are encourag-
ing, most angiographic results are from small numbers of
patients who are seen again because of evidence of isch-
emia. There are few long-term patency rates of RA grafts
studied electively in symptom-free patients, and little sci-
entiﬁc evidence comparing the RA with the right ITA used
as a free graft or with the SV. There is one ongoing
randomized study originating from Toronto evaluating the
fate of the RA. This study, which is comparing patency
between the RA and SV in the same patient, is known as the
Radial Artery Patency Study (RAPS).26 However, there are
no previous studies in which patients have been prospec-
tively randomly assigned to receive either the RA or another
bypass conduit. In this study, the Radial Artery Patency and
Clinical Outcome (RAPCO) Study, patients are randomly
assigned to receive either RA or, in two separate stratiﬁed
groups, right ITA or SV.
Material and Methods
Study Design
This is a prospective, randomized, single-center trial, stratiﬁed into
a group younger than 70 years (group 1), in which the RA patency
was compared with that of the free right ITA, and a group aged 70
years or more (group 2), in which RA patency was compared with
that of the SV graft. Programmed angiography was performed at a
predetermined interval between 0 and 10 years according to a
second random assignment. In addition, a 5-year angiogram was
offered to all patients.
Hypotheses
The following hypotheses were tested:
1. Angiographic patency of the RA graft is superior to that of
the free right ITA or SV graft.
2. Patients who receive RA grafts have clinical outcomes su-
perior to those of patients who receive free right ITA or SV
grafts.
Speciﬁc Aims
This study was undertaken to compare elective angiographic pa-
tency of the RA with those of the free right ITA and SV during 5
to 10 years after surgery and to assess the survival, myocardial
infarction, and reintervention rates in patients with RA grafts
versus those with right ITA and SV grafts.
Entry Criteria
Male or female patients younger than 80 years undergoing elective
primary isolated coronary artery bypass surgery and requiring
more than one bypass conduit were eligible for the study. An
ejection fraction greater than 35% and at least one non-LAD vessel
with a proximal stenosis of at least 70% and a diameter of at least
1.5 mm were required.
Exclusion Criteria
General exclusions.
Patients were excluded because of body
mass index greater than 35 kg/m2, renal impairment with serum
creatinine level greater than 300 mol/L, lung disease with a
forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 1 L, associated
major illnesses (eg, malignancy) with the survival expected to be
less than 10 years, concomitant cardiac disease (such as valve
disease or a left ventricular aneurysm), chronic heart failure,
emergency presentation, or myocardial infarction less than 1 week
before surgery.
Speciﬁc exclusions.
Patients were deemed ineligible if either
of the proposed randomly assigned grafts was not available. The
RA was not harvested if the recovery time on the modiﬁed Allen
test was longer than 10 seconds in the nondominant hand.27 The
right ITA was not removed in patients with poor lung function,
chest wall trauma, or previous chest wall radiotherapy. The SV
was not used if it was varicose, if the ankle/brachial systolic blood
pressure index was less than 0.75, or if peripheral pulses were
absent.
Random Assignment
All patients received an in situ left ITA graft to the LAD. The
choice of the second conduit was determined by random assign-

ment. If additional grafts were required, the SV was used. There
were two groups, according to age and current practice. Group 1
consisted of patients younger than 70 years. The trial conduit was
either right ITA (control graft) or RA (experimental graft). This
trial graft was anastomosed to the largest available non-LAD
vessel (Table 1).
Group 2 patients (70 years) were randomly assigned to re-
ceive either SV (control graft) or RA (experimental graft) for the
second conduit. Patients with diabetes are known to have more
severe atherosclerosis than those without diabetes. Stratiﬁcation
between groups 1 and 2 was performed at 60 rather than 70 years
to avoid bilateral ITA harvesting in patients with diabetes older
than 60 years because of higher mortality and morbidity rates
(Table 1).28-30
Random numbers were generated from the Minitab statistical
package (Minitab, Inc, State College, Pa) and placed in sealed
envelopes. The patient’s name, the date, and the name of the
person performing the random assignment were recorded on each
envelope before it was opened. Random assignment was under-
taken by the University Statistical Consulting Center and kept at
arm’s length from the clinical staff involved. Patient information
and consent forms were approved by the institution’s human
research ethics committee.
Surgical Technique
The RA was removed from the nondominant arm. The RA was
dilated in situ with an intraluminal ejection of 4 mL of a 1-mM
solution of papaverine (40 mg in 100 mL) with a mixture of 50%
blood and Ringer’s lactate solution. This was injected retrogradely
into the distal end of the RA, which was clipped and left for 5
minutes to dilate under arterial pressure. The artery was removed
and stored in a bath of the same solution. The SV and the right ITA
were dilated with the same papaverine mixture and stored in an
identical manner to the RA. All operations were performed with
cardiopulmonary bypass. The technique of RA harvest and coro-
nary artery bypass grafting has been described previously else-
where.31-34 The left ITA and right ITA were mobilized with a wide
pedicle. The left ITA was left in situ for anastomosis to the LAD;
the right ITA was used as a free graft. The trial graft was sutured
to the largest available non-LAD coronary artery and grafted
proximally to the aorta as a standard aorta-coronary bypass graft.
All anastomoses were performed by staff surgeons. Sequential
anastomoses were permitted between the diagonal artery and the
LAD and when using nonstudy SV grafts.
Postoperative Management
All patients were given milrinone in a loading dose of 25 g/kg in
15 minutes followed by 0.25 g/(kg · min) to produce a cardiac
index of 2.5 to 3 L/(m2 · min). Milrinone was discontinued if the
cardiac index exceeded 3 L/(m2 · min), the mean blood pressure
was less than 70 mm Hg, or the peripheral vascular resistance was
less than 1000 dynes · s · cm5. Milrinone was continued for the
ﬁrst 12 to 18 hours. After that, oral amlodipine at 2.5 to 5 mg daily
was commenced and continued for 6 months. Aspirin at 100 mg
per day was commenced the day after surgery and continued
indeﬁnitely.
Angiography
Patients underwent a second random assignment for the timing of
the elective coronary angiogram and graft study during the 10
years after surgery. The frequency of protocol-directed angiogra-
phy was weighted toward the end of the study, because it was
anticipated that there would be relatively few events in the ﬁrst 5
years and thus most of the information would come from the latter
part of the study. Ten percent of the patients were randomly
assigned to undergo angiography within 12 months from the time
of surgery, 10% at 2 years after the operation, 20% at 5 years, 30%
at 7 years, and 30% at 10 years (Figure 1). In addition to the
protocol-directed angiography program, all patients were offered
an angiogram at 5 years after the operation. Left ventriculography
was not performed routinely.
Graft failure was deﬁned as occlusion or at least 70% stenosis.
Graft patency was determined by three independent observers, two
surgeons and a cardiologist. Each observer was provided with a
copy of the surgeon’s operation notes, with identiﬁcation of the
target vessel and the position of the trial coronary graft. True
blinding during the assessment was not possible, and furthermore
the size and character of the SV and clips on the free arterial grafts
made them readily identiﬁable. The RA, however, was often not
distinguishable from the free right ITA. Assessment was made of
the graft trunk, and any pathologic ﬁndings at the proximal or
distal anastomoses were recorded separately. Thrombolysis in
Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)35 ﬂows and graft stenoses were
recorded. Disputed angiographic ﬁndings were assessed separately
and adjudicated.
Clinical Data Collection
After discharge from the hospital, those patients recruited into both
the control and experimental groups received standard follow-up

care. All patients were contacted yearly after their coronary artery
bypass surgery. At the time of contact, the clinical nurse consultant
obtained data regarding patient survival, myocardial infarction,
and further revascularization (surgical or percutaneous interven-
tion). Angiography was performed on an outpatient basis to inves-
tigate the patency of the RA, right ITA, and SV grafts. Patients
underwent yearly clinical review by a cardiac surgeon. Survival
was conﬁrmed with the National Death Index, a register of all
deaths.36 All data are stored in a Visual Fox Pro database (Mi-
crosoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash).
Major Outcome Measures
A major end point of the study was angiographic patency of the
RA, right ITA, and SV grafts during a 10-year period after surgery.
This interim study assesses the outcomes of 114 angiograms
performed during the ﬁrst 5 years of the study. Other major
outcomes were survival and cardiac event–free survival. Death,
perioperative or subsequent, was deﬁned as all-cause mortality, and
cardiac event–free survival was deﬁned as survival with freedom from
myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, or reoperation.
Statistical Analysis
All patients randomly assigned were included in the analyses.
Patients whose chosen graft conduit was found during the opera-
tion to be unsuitable were included in the clinical analysis on an
intent-to-treat basis. The focus of this interim report is 5-year graft
patency and cardiac event–free survival. Most angiograms in this
study to date were performed in the latter part of the follow-up
period. Categoric patency, clinical end points, all-cause mortality,
and cardiac event–free survival were analyzed by standard survival
analysis techniques. Kaplan-Meier estimates were obtained for
each of the two arms of both trials. Because of the random
assignment, a simple comparison of the two treatment groups is
unbiased. The log-rank statistic was used to test for differences
between the survival curves.
Estimation of sample size.
The 5-year patency was expected
to be high for both trial and control grafts in both groups. In the
younger patients (group 1), in whom the RA is being compared
with the right ITA, 154 patients in each group are sufﬁcient to
detect a true difference of patency percentages of at least 10%
when the patency is 85% in one group and 95% in the other, by a
2-sided test with a power of 80% and the best approximation for
comparing two proportions.37 In the older patients (group 2), in
whom the comparison is between the RA and SV, to detect a
difference of at least 15% for a 2-sided test with a power of 80%,
84 patients are required in each arm to detect a difference between
a patency of 80% for one treatment and a patency of 95% for the
other.
Enrollment. Between June 1996 and February 2002, a total of
1004 patients were assessed but were not randomly assigned
because they failed to meet the entry criteria, for example, the lack
of availability of one of the potential trial grafts or presence of one
of the major clinical exclusions. Seventy-eight patients met the
entry criteria but refused to comply with the follow-up criteria of
yearly visits and undergoing at least one postoperative angiogram.
Four hundred thirty-eight patients, 285 in group 1 and 153 in group
2, were randomly assigned to receive RA grafting or a control
graft. In group 1, 140 patients were randomly assigned to RA
grafting and 145 to right ITA grafting. In group 2, 73 patients were
randomly assigned to RA grafting and 80 were to receive SV
grafts. All 438 patients were included for analysis of survival and
event-free survival outcomes according to intent to treat.
Angiography enrollment.
Thirty-two patients were with-
drawn from the graft patency study at the time of surgery because
of the poor quality of the randomly assigned conduit (eg, damaged
during removal) or extensive calciﬁcation. A further 8 patients
were withdrawn because the appropriate coronary artery was not
grafted and 2 patients withdrew consent, leaving 396 patients who
were suitable for a scheduled angiogram during the 10-year study.
The decision by the surgeon to alter the operation or grafting
strategy, (for example, to operate off-pump in 2 patients, to repair
a left ventricular aneurysm, to use a sequential graft, or to perform
a proximal anastomosis with the left ITA or the addition of an
arterial graft conduit instead of the SV as a subsequent graft) was
not considered an indication for removal.
This 5-year interim graft patency study reports the Kaplan-
Meier graft patency estimates of 114 angiograms: 53 protocol-
directed angiograms and 61 optional angiograms. The current

Results
Demographic Characteristics
There were no signiﬁcant differences in any of the major
demographic and operative variables between experimental
and control groups (Table 3).
Graft Patency
Five-year patency.
In group 1, a total of 39 RA grafts
were compared with 29 right ITA grafts. One RA graft and
no right ITA grafts failed in the 5-year period. RA graft
patency estimate was 0.95 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]
0.85-0.99) versus 1.00 for the right ITA (P  .4; Figure 2,
A). In group 2, a total of 24 RA grafts were compared with
22 SV grafts. One SV graft and 3 RA grafts failed. The RA
patency estimate was 0.86 (95% CI 0.67-0.99) versus 0.95
(95% CI 0.83-0.99) for the SV (P  .5; Figure 2, B).
Clinical End Points
Survival.
Eighteen of 438 patients died during the 5
years (Table 4). In group 1, 9 of 285 patients died; survival
estimates were 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-0.99) for the RA sub-
group (n  140) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.72-0.99) for the right
ITA subgroup (n  145, P  .3). In group 2, 9 of 153
patients died. The RA subgroup (n  73) survival was 0.87
(95% CI 0.67-0.99); the SV subgroup (n  80) survival was
0.95 (95% CI 0.83-0.99, P  .3).
Cardiac event–free survival.
In addition to the 18
deaths, there were 8 percutaneous interventions and 3 myo-
cardial infarctions among the 438 patients during the 5-year
follow-up (Table 4). In group 1, event-free survival esti-
mates were 0.91 (95% CI 0.76-0.99) for the RA subgroup (n
 140) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.63-0.99) for the right ITA
subgroup (n  145, P  .7; Figure 3, A). In group 2,
event-free survival estimates were 0.84 (95% CI 0.64-0.99)
for the RA subgroup (n  73) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.72-0.99)
for the SV subgroup (n  80, P  .9; Figure 3, B).
Discussion
This article reports the interim results of a randomized study
comparing the patency of the RA used as a coronary artery
bypass graft with those of the free right ITA and also the SV
during a 5-year period. In the ﬁrst 5 years after surgery,
there were no differences in the angiographic failure rates
and major clinical outcomes of the RA compared with the
right ITA and with the SV graft. The study indicates that
when the RA is harvested carefully and implanted with the
use of interoperative and postoperative vasodilators, it is a
satisfactory conduit for grafting to a vessel with a good
diameter and a high-grade stenosis. This interim report
reveals that the patency of the SV and survival of the trial
patients
are

There are a number of reports of RA graft patency in
patients who underwent angiography directed by symptoms
suggestive of ischemia.14,17,18,22,23,25,39 There have been
few published results of elective angiograms of the RA
when used as a coronary artery bypass graft. The angio-
graphic patency rate from the RAPCO study is similar to
other reported RA patency results of studies that were based
on ischemic symptoms. Our early SV graft patency appears
superior to that recorded previously, suggesting that the
choice of a large target artery and factors currently used
to protect grafts, such as vasodilators and 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, may

have improved the outcomes of both the control and
study grafts.
There are two randomized trials that have analyzed graft
patency as an end point, one published,40 and the other in
progress.26 Fremes26 and the RAPS investigators from Sun-
nybrook (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) have enrolled 560 pa-
tients in a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial
comparing the RA patency with that of the SV when grafted
to the right or circumﬂex coronary arteries. This study is
comparing the 8- to 12-month protocol-directed angio-
graphic patency of the RA versus the SV coronary bypass
grafts, with each patient serving as his or her own control.
The primary end point of the study is the proportion of RA
and control SV grafts occluded at the time of angiography.
TIMI ﬂow and graft stenoses are also recorded. Because the
RA and the control SV are used in all patients, however, it
will be difﬁcult to attribute a clinical outcome to the use of
a particular graft. In contrast, the RAPCO trial has both
graft patency and survival end points. The trial was de-
signed with two strata, a younger and older group, which
reﬂects current clinical practice. This study is designed to
answer the following questions: Should the surgeon choose
an RA or ITA graft in young patients? Should the surgeon
favor the RA rather than SV in older patients? There is one
trial graft in each patient, compared with two trial grafts in
the RAPS. Thus the RAPCO angiographic study is rela-
tively underpowered compared with the RAPS; the power
calculation is not time dependent, and therefore it would be
expected that if a true difference existed, a longer follow-up
period would be required to achieve a statistically signiﬁ-
cant result. This 5-year interim report represents a small
proportion of the expected angiographic results. Compli-
ance with the protocol-directed angiography schedule in the
ﬁrst year was about 80%, although some missed the sched-
uled date. The clinical end points of survival and freedom
from myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, and
reoperation are robust end points that will continue to be
recorded during the next decade.
The categoric angiographic end point of graft failure,
deﬁned as occlusion or a stenosis of at least 70%, corre-
sponds with the accepted threshold for intervention in native
coronary arteries. Graft failure is deﬁned by occlusion and
absence of TIMI 3 ﬂow in the RAPS.26 In the RAPCO, trial
the string sign was deﬁned as uniform narrowing (50%) of
a graft with delayed opaciﬁcation of the target artery (TIMI
1 or 2 ﬂow) and recorded as graft failure. Similarly,
Fremes26 deﬁnes the string sign as occlusion of the graft.
Graft disease may involve the proximal and distal anasto-
moses. Anastomotic disease may be the result of poor
surgical technique, the healing and remodeling process, or
disease in the native coronary artery or aorta. Anastomotic
disease in the RAPCO trial has been ﬂagged and will be
analyzed separately. The angiographic committee will make
recommendations on the presurgical entry angiographic cri-
teria and the management of anastomotic disease. Quanti-

tative coronary angiography will be subsequently under-
taken to provide an independent assessment of graft disease.
Protocol-directed angiography, unlike symptom-directed
angiography, provides an opportunity to analyze the rate of
graft failure in patients both with and without symptoms.
There is a paucity of elective angiographic results of con-
duits in coronary artery surgery. Symptom-directed angiog-
raphy may select patients with severe disease, thus intro-
ducing a bias in the patency rate. Previous data from
symptom-directed angiography in our unit suggested that
there would be few graft failures in the ﬁrst 5 years after
surgery with SV or ITA grafts; more graft patency end
points are expected in the second 5 years. Therefore op-
tional 5-year angiograms, which likewise should not intro-
duce bias, were included in this interim analysis. Further-
more, the 61 optional angiograms provide angiographic data
for these elderly patients with associated morbidity, some of
whom will die before the protocol-directed angiogram. The
choice remains to analyze the protocol-directed angiograms
separately from the optional 5-year angiograms. The addi-
tion of a second or even a third angiogram to the protocol-
directed study has the beneﬁt of allowing assessment of the
progression of graft disease.
Time-related analyses of clinical events such as death,
reoperation, or myocardial infarction provide an accurate
assessment that can be used to predict complication rates
and outcomes in a similar population. However, the use of
actuarial techniques to assess graft patency is based on the
assumption that the event occurs at the time of the angio-
gram, and absolute failure rates therefore cannot be deﬁned.
Graft failure, which may be silent, can occur any time from
implantation up to angiography, and rates of failure will
therefore be underestimated. Comparisons of relative failure
rates of trial versus control grafts are valid, because the
same technique and time intervals were used to assess both
trial and control grafts.
Improved graft durability would be expected to correlate
with fewer clinical events and improved survival. This
association is often delayed. Improved survival has been
observed with in situ ITAs relative to SV grafts; a decrease
in clinical events from the use of a second arterial graft or
a different type of arterial conduit is likely to be less
dramatic. Those patients who died or were unavailable for
follow-up and not identiﬁed by the regular clinical fol-
low-up mechanism are readily identiﬁed through the Aus-
tralian National Death Index,36 thus providing reliable sur-
vival data.
Conclusion
The 5-year interim results of the RAPCO study do not
support the hypotheses that the RA has a superior patency to
the free right ITA and the SV when used as a coronary
artery bypass graft and that it is associated with fewer
clinical events. On the basis of the previous experience of
persisting patency of arterial compared with SV grafts,
however, the continued evaluation of the RA is justiﬁed.
