Abstract

Background: There is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of the radial artery (RA) as an aortocoronary conduit,
with few solid data regarding long-term clinical results. We sought to determine if the use of the RA as the second
arterial conduit, beside left internal thoracic artery (LITA), would improve long-term clinical outcome after CABG as
compared to saphenous vein graft (SVG).

Methods: Between March 2001 and November 2003, 200 patients underwent isolated CABG and were
randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive either LITA and RA grafts or LITA and SVGs. The primary end point was
composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial
revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous).
Results: There was no significant difference in absolute survival, with 12 deaths in each group during the study period
(log rank = 0.01, p = 0.979). There were 3 and 2 cardiac deaths in RA and SVG groups, respectively. There was no
difference in long-term clinical outcome between the groups (log rank = 0.450, p = 0.509). Eleven patients in RA group
had one or more non-fatal events; 7 patients suffered a myocardial infarction, 9 patients underwent percutaneous
coronary angioplasty, and 1 patient required redo coronary surgery. Likewise, 13 patients in SVG group had non-fatal
event; 7 patients had myocardial infarction, 13 patients had percutaneous coronary intervention and 3 patients
required redo coronary surgery. Angiograms were performed in 23 patients in RA group (patency rate 92 %) and 24 in
SVG group (patency rate 86 %) (p = 0.67).

Conclusion: In this small randomised study our data indicate that there is no difference in the 8 year clinical outcomes
in relatively young patients between those having a RA or a saphenous vein graft used as a second conduit, beside
LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularisation.

The aim of this study was to determine if the use of
the RA as the second arterial conduit, beside LITA,
would improve long-ter m clinical outcome after CABG
as compared to saphenous vein graft (SVG).

Methods
Patients
Between March 2001 and November 2003, 200 patients
underwent isolated CABG and were randomized in 1:1
fashion to receive either LITA and RA grafts or LITA and
SVGs. Use of additional SVGs was permitted in both
groups depending on angiographic findings. The study
protocol was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee,
and investigation conforms to the principles outlined in
the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was obtained
from all patients prior to the procedure.

Patients were included in the study if at least one
target vessel for RA/SVG grafting had at least 80 %
stenosis, was at least 1.5 mm in diameter, and had
no diffuse distal disease. Patients were excluded in
the case of a single-vessel disease and if they had
undergone any concomitant acquired or congenital
cardiac or aortic surgery. Hemodialysis was considered a strong contraindication for RA harvesting due
to a concern about the need for possible upper limb
dialysis access. The exclusion criteria were a positive
Allen’s test, a history of Raynaud’s syndrome or vasculitis. In all cases, before RA harvesting, the adequacy of ulnar compensation was assessed by the
Doppler method. The RA was always harvested from
the non-dominant arm; bilateral RA harvesting was
never performed.

Procedures
All patients underwent conventional angiography before
surgery using retrograde femoral artery catheterization
under standard fluoroscopy using an iodine contrast
agent. Each angiogram was evaluated by two experienced
cardiologists and the decisions were made by consensus.
During the follow-up period coronary angiographies were
performed if clinically indicated.

Complete echocardiographic examination was performed in all patients prior to index surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed using Simpson
biplane formula.

All patients were operated at the Dedinje Cardiovascular
Institute, Belgrade, Serbia, a tertiary care center. Open
harvest of the RA was used in all patients. For the myocardial protection purposes we used 600–1000 ml of cold
antegrade modified St. Thomas cardioplegic solution to
initially arrest the heart. Topical cooling of the heart was
used during procedure (ice slash). Cardioplegia was repeated only if cross-clamp time exceeded 90 min. Cold
blood cardiopegia was used only in patients with a EF


< 30 %. Side-biting clamps were used for performing
proximal anastomoses in all patients. All RA grafts
were deployed to the artery with at least 80 % stenosis,
providing that it is considered an important coronary
artery (smaller, same territory arteries or arteries supplying heavily infarcted areas were not grafted with
radial artery). During or after the procedure no intravenous drugs were given to prevent RA spasm. However, we used topically verapamil and nitroglycerin
solution (balanced to pH 7.4). All radial arteries were
rinsed after harvesting and kept in this solution before
implantation. All of our patients were given oral preparations of the calcium channel blockers during one
year after surgery to prevent RA spasm.

Follow-up
Patients were followed for 8 years since index surgery
for the composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal
myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous). Data
were collected either by phone or during visits.

Statistical analysis
The data were entered into an electronic database (Access,
Microsoft) and analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 software
(SPSS Inc.). Continuous variables were expressed as mean
and standard deviations. Categorical variables were
expressed as percentages. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using the χ[2] test and Fisher’s exact test, and continuous variables were analyzed using the t-test. Binary
logistic regression analyses with the fixed entry method
were performed in order to identify predictors for RA
graft occlusion. The parameters examined were defined, and included established risk factors for coronary artery disease. Accordingly, those parameters with
the lowest p values in the univariate analysis were entered into the regression model; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant throughout.

Results
Baseline data
The baseline demographic and clinical data of the patients
are depicted in Table 1. The groups were well balanced
with respect to demographic, clinical and angiographic
data. Briefly, patients were predominantly males, in their
mid-fifties, around 40 % were diabetic, and more than
50 % of patients in both groups had previous myocardial
infarction. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was
slightly decreased, and the majority of patients had triple
vessel coronary artery disease.

Operative and perioperative data
There were no perioperative deaths in both groups. The
average number of implanted grafts was similar in patients

who received RA or SVG (3.08 ± 0.66 vs 3.14 ± 0.66, respectively). All the patients in both groups had LITA grafting on LAD implanted. Table 2 details placement of RA
grafts. Briefly, the majority of RA grafts were placed either
on first (50 %) or on second (15 %) obtuse marginal
branch. RA graft was never placed to the right coronary
artery or diagonal branch if they were previously occluded.
Perioperative complications are detailed in Table 3.
There were no difference between the groups, with a
total of 47 events in RA group and 45 events in
SVG group (p = 0.89). Although numerous, events
were mostly mild and resolved upon instution of
adequate therapy. Atrial fibrillation was most frequent adverse event in both groups, followed by
pleural effusion and hemorrhage. The average length
of index hospitalization was 8 days.

Follow-up
All patients were followed for 8 years or until death.
There was no significant difference in absolute survival,

with 12 deaths in each group during the study period
(log rank = 0.01, p = 0.979) (Fig. 1). There were 3 and 2
cardiac deaths in RA and SVG groups, respectively.
There was no difference in long-term clinical outcome
between the groups (log rank = 0.450, p = 0.509) (Fig. 2).
Eleven patients in RA group had one or more non-fatal
events; 7 patients suffered a myocardial infarction, 9 patients underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty,
and 1 patient required redo coronary surgery. Likewise,
13 patients in SVG group had non-fatal event; 7 patients
had myocardial infarction, 13 patients had percutaneous
coronary intervention and 3 patients required redo coronary surgery.

Repeated coronary angiography
Repeated coronary angiography was performed in patients who had a positive physical load test or a new coronary event (unstable angina pectoris or myocardial
infarction). In RA group 23 underwent repeated coronary angiography, whereas in SVG group 24 patients
underwent this procedure. RA graft patency rate was
92 %, whereas SVG patency rate was 86 % (p = 0.67).

Discussion
This study reports on our series of 200 patients undergoing isolated, primary CABG using LITA grafting and the
SVG in one group, and RA grafting as the second conduit
in the second group. Our data indicate that there is no difference in the long-term clinical outcome between the patients in whom RA or SVG is used as a second conduit,
beside LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularization.
Additionally, graft patency in patients who underwent coronary angiography was similar between the groups.

Clinical outcomes
Two randomized clinical trials have reported that eventfree survival was greater in patients receiving a radial artery [9, 13]. In the Stand-in-Y trial, event-free survival
was similar in patients who received a radial artery

compared with a second ITA graft [13]. Two moderately
large, single-center observational studies using propensity scores have recently been published [14, 15]. Both
early and late survival and event-free survival was enhanced with the use of a radial artery compared with a
saphenous vein [15]. Perioperative outcomes including
in hospital mortality (0.1 % for the RA patients and
0.2 % for the SVG patients) were similar. Kaplan-Meier
survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 98.3, 93.9, and 83.1 %
for the RA group versus 97.2, 88.7, and 74.3 % for the


SVG group (log rank, p = 0.0011). Cox proportional hazards models showed a lower all-cause mortality in the
RA group (hazard ratio 0.72, confidence interval: 0.56 to
0.92, p = 0.0084). Ten-year survivals showed a 52 %
increased mortality for the SVG patients (25.7 %) versus
the RA patients (16.9 %; p = 0.0011). For symptomatic
patients, RA patency was 80.7 %, which was not different
than the LITA patency rate of 86.4 % but was superior
to the SVG patency rate of 46.7 % (p < 0.001). However,
it appears that the use of RA yields inferior long-term

clinical outcomes as compared to use of right internal
thoracic artery as a second arterial conduit [16].

Graft patency
There are several reports of the medium to long‐term
clinical outcomes for RA grafting. Buxton and colleagues

[11] in 2003 reported a prospective randomized study
comparing the RA with the free RITA and the SVG.
Their 5‐year interim results did not support the hypothesis of superior patency of the RA compared with the
RITA or the SVG. The most recent update from the
same group in 2010 continued to show no differences in
patency rates with pending clinical results [11].

Zacharias et al. [4] in 2004 evaluated the 6‐year clinical
outcomes of propensity‐matched patients undergoing
LITA‐to‐LAD grafting with either an additional RA graft
or SVG as second conduit. In 925 propensity‐matched
patients, they found cumulative survival was better with
the RA grafts. Angiographic data in restudied symptomatic patients showed a trend toward greater RA graft patency. They reported that the RA graft survival benefit
remained when patients were subdivided on the basis of
specific risk factors, with women, triple‐vessel disease,
younger patients (age ≤65 years), and diabetic patients
having a more pronounced survival benefit. However, the
11‐year Kaplan–Meier analysis showed essentially identical RA versus SVG survival for the diabetic patients.

Desai et al. [17] in 2007 the Radial Artery Patency
Study, examined randomized angiographic data in 440
RA versus 440 SVG grafts in CABG and showed RA was
protective against occlusion, especially in women up to
12 months. A history of peripheral vascular disease was
associated with higher risk of RA occlusion, while grafting to a vessel with proximal occlusion improved RA patency. The same group and others in 2008 showed, via
angiographic data at 1‐year post‐CABG, that diabetes
mellitus was an independent predictor of graft occlusion,
although RA grafting was protective in this subgroup
versus the SVG [17–21].

The RAPS study is the first multicenter clinical trial
reporting radial graft patency beyond 5 years. In the
other and larger multicenter CSP 474 VA trial [7], the
radial artery or saphenous vein was allocated to the
second-best target as determined by the surgeon; they
reported that at 1 year, complete graft occlusion was
similar in radial and study SVGs (11 %). a 5-year extension is underway. At 5.5 years, the single-center RSVP
(Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Patency) study
from London, England, reported that complete graft
occlusion was markedly less frequent in radial grafts
compared with SVGs directed to the circumflex territory

[8]. There was no apparent graft-by-territory interaction
in the RAPS study, indicating that the relative benefit of
the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein


applies to both the right and circumflex territories. Graft
patency was improved when the radial artery was directed
to a more severely narrowed target vessel. The singlecenter Australian RAPCO (Radial Artery Patency and
Clinical Outcomes) study scheduled angiographic followup within 5 years in a minority of patients and between 5
and 10 years post-operatively in the majority; they have
published interim results from 5 to 10 years of follow-up

[16].

Athanasiou et al. [14] included both randomized trials
and observational studies in a meta-analysis to compare
the patency rates across different follow-up intervals—there were 7 studies with a follow-up >5 years. We
updated their review with results from the RAPS study
and new data complete to April 2011 [22–25]. Radial
grafting was associated with a reduced rate of late graft
occlusion compared with saphenous veins (for observational and randomized trials, odds ratio: 0.520, 95 %
confidence interval: 0.342 to 0.790, p = 0.002; and for
randomized trials alone, odds ratio: 0.491, 95 % confidence interval: 0.314 to 0.766, p = 0.002.)

When the type of harvest of the RA is concerned, recent prospective, randomized, open-controlled trial that
included 119 patients demonstrated that following
5 years of the initial operation both RA harvesting techniques (open and endoscopic harvest ) are safe, effective
and result in excellent patency rates [26].

It is very difficult to develop an algorithm for the use of
RA as a second conduit for surgical myocardial revascularization. Since it appears that RA is not superior in
terms of clinical outcome to the vein grafts for the revascularization of the right coronary artery, we usually use
RA for revascularization of the left side system. The main
target for RA graft is reasonably sized (≥1.5 mm) obtuse
marginal artery with at least 80 % stenosis. However, decision about use of RA graft should be tailored individually
in order to achieve greatest clinical benefit for the patient.

Limitations of the study
The major limitation of the trial is the relatively small
number of patients. Additionally, the follow-up duration
in our study group was relatively short (8 years), which
may lead to the underestimation of net clinical benefit in
patients in whom RA graft was used. However, since this
was a single-center randomized trial and patients were
followed for a considerable time, we believe that a meaningful conclusions may be drawn from our data.

Conclusion
In this small randomised study our data indicate that
there is no difference in the 8 year clinical outcomes in
relatively young patients between those having a RA or a
saphenous vein graft used as a second conduit, beside
LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularisation.
