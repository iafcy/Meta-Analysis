Background: There is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of the radial artery (RA) as an aortocoronary conduit, 
with few solid data regarding long-term clinical results. We sought to determine if the use of the RA as the second 
arterial conduit, beside left internal thoracic artery (LITA), would improve long-term clinical outcome after CABG as 
compared to saphenous vein graft (SVG). 

Methods: Between March 2001 and November 2003, 200 patients underwent isolated CABG and were 
randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive either LITA and RA grafts or LITA and SVGs. The primary end point was 
composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial 
revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous). 
Results: There was no significant difference in absolute survival, with 12 deaths in each group during the study period 
(log rank = 0.01, p = 0.979). There were 3 and 2 cardiac deaths in RA and SVG groups, respectively. There was no 
difference in long-term clinical outcome between the groups (log rank = 0.450, p = 0.509). Eleven patients in RA group 
had one or more non-fatal events; 7 patients suffered a myocardial infarction, 9 patients underwent percutaneous 
coronary angioplasty, and 1 patient required redo coronary surgery. Likewise, 13 patients in SVG group had non-fatal 
event; 7 patients had myocardial infarction, 13 patients had percutaneous coronary intervention and 3 patients 
required redo coronary surgery. Angiograms were performed in 23 patients in RA group (patency rate 92 %) and 24 in 
SVG group (patency rate 86 %) (p = 0.67). 
Conclusion: In this small randomised study our data indicate that there is no difference in the 8 year clinical outcomes 
in relatively young patients between those having a RA or a saphenous vein graft used as a second conduit, beside 
LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularisation. 

Background 
Left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG) with the left internal thoracic artery 
(LITA) is regarded as the gold standard in coronary bypass 
surgery [1]. Initially described in 1973 by Carpantier and 
colleagues [2] the radial artery (RA) was soon abandoned 
as a bypass graft as reports documented dismal early 
angiographic outcomes [2, 3]. However, with various 
methods to counter spasms, such as a block harvesting,

Belgrade, Serbia 
the long-term outcome has improved significantly, and 
the RA is currently being used as the second graft of 
choice after the LITA in many institutions [3, 4]. 
Most literature reports [5–10] demonstrate excellent 
patency rates in protocol-driven studies and in symp- 
tomatic patients. Reported RA patency rates range from 
83 to 98 % at 1–7 years after CABG. However, although 
most clinical and patency reports regarding the RA have 
been favorable, some are not [11, 12]. Hence ongoing 
doubt and debate remain regarding the efficacy of the 
RA as an aortocoronary conduit, with few solid data re- 
garding the medium-term patency rate of these grafts.

The aim of this study was to determine if the use of 
the RA as the second arterial conduit, beside LITA, 
would improve long-ter m clinical outcome after CABG 
as compared to saphenous vein graft (SVG). 
Methods 
Patients 
Between March 2001 and November 2003, 200 patients 
underwent isolated CABG and were randomized in 1:1 
fashion to receive either LITA and RA grafts or LITA and 
SVGs. Use of additional SVGs was permitted in both 
groups depending on angiographic findings. The study 
protocol was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee, 
and investigation conforms to the principles outlined in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was obtained 
from all patients prior to the procedure. 
Patients were included in the study if at least one 
target vessel for RA/SVG grafting had at least 80 % 
stenosis, was at least 1.5 mm in diameter, and had 
no diffuse distal disease. Patients were excluded in 
the case of a single-vessel disease and if they had 
undergone any concomitant acquired or congenital 
cardiac or aortic surgery. Hemodialysis was consid- 
ered a strong contraindication for RA harvesting due 
to a concern about the need for possible upper limb 
dialysis access. The exclusion criteria were a positive 
Allen’s test, a history of Raynaud’s syndrome or vas- 
culitis. In all cases, before RA harvesting, the ad- 
equacy of ulnar compensation was assessed by the 
Doppler method. The RA was always harvested from 
the non-dominant arm; bilateral RA harvesting was 
never performed. 
Procedures 
All patients underwent conventional angiography before 
surgery using retrograde femoral artery catheterization 
under standard fluoroscopy using an iodine contrast 
agent. Each angiogram was evaluated by two experienced 
cardiologists and the decisions were made by consensus. 
During the follow-up period coronary angiographies were 
performed if clinically indicated. 
Complete echocardiographic examination was per- 
formed in all patients prior to index surgery. Left ven- 
tricular ejection fraction was assessed using Simpson 
biplane formula. 
All patients were operated at the Dedinje Cardiovascular 
Institute, Belgrade, Serbia, a tertiary care center. Open 
harvest of the RA was used in all patients. For the myocar- 
dial protection purposes we used 600–1000 ml of cold 
antegrade modified St. Thomas cardioplegic solution to 
initially arrest the heart. Topical cooling of the heart was 
used during procedure (ice slash). Cardioplegia was re- 
peated only if cross-clamp time exceeded 90 min. Cold 
blood cardiopegia was used only in patients with a EF 
< 30 %. Side-biting clamps were used for performing 
proximal anastomoses in all patients. All RA grafts 
were deployed to the artery with at least 80 % stenosis, 
providing that it is considered an important coronary 
artery (smaller, same territory arteries or arteries sup- 
plying heavily infarcted areas were not grafted with 
radial artery). During or after the procedure no intra- 
venous drugs were given to prevent RA spasm. How- 
ever, we used topically verapamil and nitroglycerin 
solution (balanced to pH 7.4). All radial arteries were 
rinsed after harvesting and kept in this solution before 
implantation. All of our patients were given oral prepa- 
rations of the calcium channel blockers during one 
year after surgery to prevent RA spasm. 
Follow-up 
Patients were followed for 8 years since index surgery 
for the composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial re- 
vascularization (either surgical or percutaneous). Data 
were collected either by phone or during visits. 
Statistical analysis 
The data were entered into an electronic database (Access, 
Microsoft) and analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 software 
(SPSS Inc.). Continuous variables were expressed as mean 
and standard deviations. Categorical variables were 
expressed as percentages. Dichotomous variables were an- 
alyzed using the χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test, and con- 
tinuous variables were analyzed using the t-test. Binary 
logistic regression analyses with the fixed entry method 
were performed in order to identify predictors for RA 
graft occlusion. The parameters examined were de- 
fined, and included established risk factors for coron- 
ary artery disease. Accordingly, those parameters with 
the lowest p values in the univariate analysis were en- 
tered into the regression model; p < 0.05 was consid- 
ered statistically significant throughout. 
Results 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic and clinical data of the patients 
are depicted in Table 1. The groups were well balanced 
with respect to demographic, clinical and angiographic 
data. Briefly, patients were predominantly males, in their 
mid-fifties, around 40 % were diabetic, and more than 
50 % of patients in both groups had previous myocardial 
infarction. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 
slightly decreased, and the majority of patients had triple 
vessel coronary artery disease. 
Operative and perioperative data 
There were no perioperative deaths in both groups. The 
average number of implanted grafts was similar in patients

artery, SVG saphenous vein graft 
who received RA or SVG (3.08 ± 0.66 vs 3.14 ± 0.66, re- 
spectively). All the patients in both groups had LITA graft- 
ing on LAD implanted. Table 2 details placement of RA 
grafts. Briefly, the majority of RA grafts were placed either 
on first (50 %) or on second (15 %) obtuse marginal 
branch. RA graft was never placed to the right coronary 
artery or diagonal branch if they were previously occluded. 
Perioperative complications are detailed in Table 3. 
There were no difference between the groups, with a 
total of 47 events in RA group and 45 events in 
SVG group (p = 0.89). Although numerous, events 
were mostly mild and resolved upon instution of 
fre- 
adequate therapy. Atrial

followed by 
pleural effusion and hemorrhage. The average length 
of index hospitalization was 8 days. 


Follow-up 
All patients were followed for 8 years or until death. 
There was no significant difference in absolute survival,

with 12 deaths in each group during the study period 
(log rank = 0.01, p = 0.979) (Fig. 1). There were 3 and 2 
cardiac deaths in RA and SVG groups, respectively. 
There was no difference in long-term clinical outcome 
between the groups (log rank = 0.450, p = 0.509) (Fig. 2). 
Eleven patients in RA group had one or more non-fatal 
events; 7 patients suffered a myocardial infarction, 9 pa- 
tients underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty, 
and 1 patient required redo coronary surgery. Likewise, 
13 patients in SVG group had non-fatal event; 7 patients 
had myocardial infarction, 13 patients had percutaneous 
coronary intervention and 3 patients required redo cor- 
onary surgery. 
Repeated coronary angiography 
Repeated coronary angiography was performed in pa- 
tients who had a positive physical load test or a new cor- 
(unstable angina pectoris or myocardial 
onary event 
infarction). In RA group 23 underwent repeated coron- 
ary angiography, whereas in SVG group 24 patients 
underwent this procedure. RA graft patency rate was 
92 %, whereas SVG patency rate was 86 % (p = 0.67). 
Discussion 
This study reports on our series of 200 patients undergo- 
ing isolated, primary CABG using LITA grafting and the 
SVG in one group, and RA grafting as the second conduit 
in the second group. Our data indicate that there is no dif- 
ference in the long-term clinical outcome between the pa- 
tients in whom RA or SVG is used as a second conduit, 
for surgical myocardial revascularization. 
beside LITA, 
Additionally, graft patency in patients who underwent cor- 
onary angiography was similar between the groups. 
Clinical outcomes 
Two randomized clinical trials have reported that event- 
free survival was greater in patients receiving a radial ar- 
tery [9, 13]. In the Stand-in-Y trial, event-free survival 
was similar in patients who received a radial artery 



compared with a second ITA graft [13]. Two moderately 
large, single-center observational studies using propen- 
sity scores have recently been published [14, 15]. Both 
early and late survival and event-free survival was en- 
hanced with the use of a radial artery compared with a 
saphenous vein [15]. Perioperative outcomes including 
in hospital mortality (0.1 % for the RA patients and 
0.2 % for the SVG patients) were similar. Kaplan-Meier 
survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 98.3, 93.9, and 83.1 % 
for the RA group versus 97.2, 88.7, and 74.3 % for the 
SVG group (log rank, p = 0.0011). Cox proportional haz- 
ards models showed a lower all-cause mortality in the 
RA group (hazard ratio 0.72, confidence interval: 0.56 to 
0.92, p = 0.0084). Ten-year survivals showed a 52 % 
increased mortality for the SVG patients (25.7 %) versus 
the RA patients (16.9 %; p = 0.0011). For symptomatic 
patients, RA patency was 80.7 %, which was not different 
than the LITA patency rate of 86.4 % but was superior 
to the SVG patency rate of 46.7 % (p < 0.001). However, 
it appears that the use of RA yields inferior long-term

clinical outcomes as compared to use of right internal 
thoracic artery as a second arterial conduit [16]. 
Graft patency 
There are several reports of the medium to long‐term 
clinical outcomes for RA grafting. Buxton and colleagues 
[11] in 2003 reported a prospective randomized study 
comparing the RA with the free RITA and the SVG. 
Their 5‐year interim results did not support the hypoth- 
esis of superior patency of the RA compared with the 
RITA or the SVG. The most recent update from the 
same group in 2010 continued to show no differences in 
patency rates with pending clinical results [11]. 
Zacharias et al. [4] in 2004 evaluated the 6‐year clinical 
outcomes of propensity‐matched patients undergoing 
LITA‐to‐LAD grafting with either an additional RA graft 
or SVG as second conduit. In 925 propensity‐matched 
patients, they found cumulative survival was better with 
the RA grafts. Angiographic data in restudied symptom- 
atic patients showed a trend toward greater RA graft pa- 
tency. They reported that the RA graft survival benefit 
remained when patients were subdivided on the basis of 
specific risk factors, with women, triple‐vessel disease, 
younger patients (age ≤65 years), and diabetic patients 
having a more pronounced survival benefit. However, the 
11‐year Kaplan–Meier analysis showed essentially identi- 
cal RA versus SVG survival for the diabetic patients. 
Desai et al. [17] in 2007 the Radial Artery Patency 
Study, examined randomized angiographic data in 440 
RA versus 440 SVG grafts in CABG and showed RA was 
protective against occlusion, especially in women up to 
12 months. A history of peripheral vascular disease was 
associated with higher risk of RA occlusion, while graft- 
ing to a vessel with proximal occlusion improved RA pa- 
tency. The same group and others in 2008 showed, via 
angiographic data at 1‐year post‐CABG, that diabetes 
mellitus was an independent predictor of graft occlusion, 
although RA grafting was protective in this subgroup 
versus the SVG [17–21]. 
The RAPS study is the first multicenter clinical trial 
reporting radial graft patency beyond 5 years. In the 
other and larger multicenter CSP 474 VA trial [7], the 
radial artery or saphenous vein was allocated to the 
second-best target as determined by the surgeon; they 
reported that at 1 year, complete graft occlusion was 
similar in radial and study SVGs (11 %). a 5-year exten- 
sion is underway. At 5.5 years, the single-center RSVP 
(Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Patency) study 
from London, England, reported that complete graft 
occlusion was markedly less frequent in radial grafts 
compared with SVGs directed to the circumflex territory 
[8]. There was no apparent graft-by-territory interaction 
in the RAPS study, indicating that the relative benefit of 
the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein 
applies to both the right and circumflex territories. Graft 
patency was improved when the radial artery was directed 
to a more severely narrowed target vessel. The single- 
center Australian RAPCO (Radial Artery Patency and 
Clinical Outcomes) study scheduled angiographic follow- 
up within 5 years in a minority of patients and between 5 
and 10 years post-operatively in the majority; they have 
published interim results from 5 to 10 years of follow-up 
[16]. 
Athanasiou et al. [14] included both randomized trials 
and observational studies in a meta-analysis to compare 
the patency rates across different 
follow-up inter- 
vals—there were 7 studies with a follow-up >5 years. We 
updated their review with results from the RAPS study 
and new data complete to April 2011 [22–25]. Radial 
grafting was associated with a reduced rate of late graft 
occlusion compared with saphenous veins (for observa- 
tional and randomized trials, odds ratio: 0.520, 95 % 
confidence interval: 0.342 to 0.790, p = 0.002; and for 
randomized trials alone, odds ratio: 0.491, 95 % confi- 
dence interval: 0.314 to 0.766, p = 0.002.) 
When the type of harvest of the RA is concerned, re- 
cent prospective, randomized, open-controlled trial that 
included 119 patients demonstrated that 
following 
5 years of the initial operation both RA harvesting tech- 
niques (open and endoscopic harvest ) are safe, effective 
and result in excellent patency rates [26]. 
It is very difficult to develop an algorithm for the use of 
RA as a second conduit for surgical myocardial revascu- 
larization. Since it appears that RA is not superior in 
terms of clinical outcome to the vein grafts for the revas- 
cularization of the right coronary artery, we usually use 
RA for revascularization of the left side system. The main 
target for RA graft is reasonably sized (≥1.5 mm) obtuse 
marginal artery with at least 80 % stenosis. However, deci- 
sion about use of RA graft should be tailored individually 
in order to achieve greatest clinical benefit for the patient. 
Limitations of the study 
The major limitation of the trial is the relatively small 
number of patients. Additionally, the follow-up duration 
in our study group was relatively short (8 years), which 
may lead to the underestimation of net clinical benefit in 
patients in whom RA graft was used. However, since this 
was a single-center randomized trial and patients were 
followed for a considerable time, we believe that a mean- 
ingful conclusions may be drawn from our data. 
Conclusion 
In this small randomised study our data indicate that 
there is no difference in the 8 year clinical outcomes in 
relatively young patients between those having a RA or a 
saphenous vein graft used as a second conduit, beside 
LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularisation.
