charge. Secondary outcomes included a favorable neurologic outcome at discharge.
Results
Of the 1941 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 981 were randomly assigned to
receive chest compression alone and 960 to receive chest compression plus rescue
breathing. We observed no significant difference between the two groups in the
proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge (12.5% with chest com-
pression alone and 11.0% with chest compression plus rescue breathing, P = 0.31)
or in the proportion who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome in the two
sites that assessed this secondary outcome (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively; P = 0.13).
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed a trend toward a higher proportion of pa-
tients surviving to hospital discharge with chest compression alone as compared
with chest compression plus rescue breathing for patients with a cardiac cause of
arrest (15.5% vs. 12.3%, P = 0.09) and for those with shockable rhythms (31.9% vs.
25.7%, P = 0.09).
Conclusions
Dispatcher instruction consisting of chest compression alone did not increase the
survival rate overall, although there was a trend toward better outcomes in key clini-
cal subgroups. The results support a strategy for CPR performed by laypersons that
emphasizes chest compression and minimizes the role of rescue breathing. (Funded

CPR with and without Rescue Breathing
est translation of the intervention effects to com-
munity-based care.22-24 We found no significant
difference between the two types of CPR instruc-
tion with respect to the proportion of patients who
survived to hospital discharge. We did, however, observe a consistent trend toward clinically mean-
ingful survival differences in favor of chest com-
pression alone over chest compression plus res-
cue breathing among patients whose arrest was
due to a cardiac cause (15.5% vs. 12.3%) and
among those with a shockable arrest rhythm
(31.9% vs. 25.7%). These findings in specific clini-
cal groups are consistent with the results of in-
vestigations that have focused on the same sub-
groups of patients or have used corresponding
animal models.10,11,18 One possible explanation is
that the beneficial physiological effects of con-
tinuous chest compressions outweigh the bene-
ficial physiological effects of chest compressions
interspersed with rescue breathing.25 Alternatively,
rescue breathing attempted by bystanders may
have no physiological effects, so the comparison
is essentially between two strategies: continuous
chest compressions and interrupted chest com-
pressions.
We did not observe significant differences in
outcome among the patients with noncardiac
causes of arrest or nonshockable rhythms, al-
though the proportion of patients who survived
was greater in the group randomly assigned to
chest compressions plus rescue breathing. Because
these two (nonexclusive) subgroups accounted for
14.0% (32 of 227) and 21.1% (48 of 227) of sur-
vivors, respectively, they cannot be dismissed as
clinically unimportant. One interpretation of these
results is that the type of bystander CPR does
not make a difference in these subgroups. Alter-
natively, one may speculate that the potential dif-
ference is consistent with the physiological un-
derstanding of rescue breathing and that the study
was underpowered to rigorously evaluate the type
of CPR in these subgroups.
Taken together, the potential differential ef-
fects of CPR with and without rescue breathing
may support a more targeted application of type-
specific CPR. On the basis of data from the cur-
rent study, such a tailored approach, if correctly
applied according to the cause of arrest, would
theoretically result in 156 survivors with a favor-
able neurologic outcome per 1000 patients, as
compared with 144 per 1000 if chest compres-
sion alone were used for all patients or 115 per

CPR with and without Rescue Breathing
1000 if chest compression plus rescue breathing
were used for all patients. Future investigation
may consider whether straightforward, operational
etiologic surrogates can facilitate type-specific CPR
aimed at the underlying cause of arrest.
We also did not observe outcome differences
overall when we evaluated neurologic status at
discharge. This finding provides assurance that
improved resuscitation with chest compression
alone is not achieved at the cost of neurologic im-
pairment. Indeed, there was some suggestion that
the brain may derive specific benefit, given the
increase in the magnitude of both the relative and
absolute differences favoring chest compression
alone over chest compression plus rescue breath-
ing, as evident from the two contrasting outcomes
— survival (16.8% and 14.7%, respectively) and
survival with favorable neurologic status (14.4%
and 11.5%) (Table 3). Because CPR has a host of
effects, a brain-specific advantage related to chest
compression alone may be plausible.26
It is also useful to contrast the effectiveness
and efficacy results in this study. The trial was
an effectiveness study, since about one fourth of
the patients did not progress to chest compres-
sions. Conversely, three fourths did progress to
chest compressions (the group constituting effi-
cacy results) — a finding that underscores the
important contribution a well-trained, assertive
emergency dispatch program can make to increase
bystander CPR. The magnitude of outcome dif-
ferences potentially favoring chest compression
alone was typically larger in the efficacy analysis
as compared with the effectiveness analysis (Ta-
bles 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
One interpretation is that the efficacy associa-
tions better reflect the intervention’s true physi-
ological effects, suggesting that the potential
benefit of chest compression alone is not due sim-
ply to a greater proportion of bystanders imple-
menting chest compressions but may be due in-
stead to the specific physiological effects of chest
compression alone.
The current trial has limitations. The interven- tion randomized bystander CPR either to chest
compressions alone or to chest compressions in-
terspersed with rescue breathing in a ratio of
2 breaths to 15 compressions. This 2:15 ratio was
the guideline specified during the first portion
of the trial. One might expect that the results
— and specifically the differences observed —
would be attenuated if the ratio had been 2:30.
