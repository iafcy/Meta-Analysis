Survival Is Similar After Standard Treatment and Chest
Compression Only in Out-of-Hospital Bystander

Background—We sought to compare the 1-month survival rates among patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who
hadbeengivenbystandercardiopulmonaryresuscitation(CPR)inrelationtowhethertheyhadreceivedstandardCPR
with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation or chest compression only.
MethodsandResults—Allpatientswithout-of-hospitalcardiacarrestwhoreceivedbystanderCPRandwhowerereported
to the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register between 1990 and 2005 were included. Crew-witnessed cases were excluded.
Among 11275 patients, 73% (n(cid:1)8209) received standard CPR, and 10% (n(cid:1)1145) received chest compression only.
There was no significant difference in 1-month survival between patients who received standard CPR (1-month
survival(cid:1)7.2%) and those who received chest compression only (1-month survival(cid:1)6.7%).
Conclusions—Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received bystander CPR, there was no significant
difference in 1-month survival between a standard CPR program with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth
ventilation and a simplified version of CPR with chest compression only. (Circulation. 2007;116:2908-2912.)

treatment promptly when they observe out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The perception that CPR requires mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation is a factor that likely reduces bystander CPR. Data are emerging that support use of chest compressions
without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and international CPR guidelines from 2005 give chest compression a more
predominantrole.UsingtheSwedishCardiacArrestRegister,weexaminedoutcomesfromout-of-hospitalcardiacarrest
when any form of bystander CPR was administered according to whether the bystander included mouth-to-mouth
ventilation or only chest compressions. Interestingly, 10% of the 11275 arrests received chest compressions only. The
