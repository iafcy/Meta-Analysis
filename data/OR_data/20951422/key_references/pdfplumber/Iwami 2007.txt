Background—Previous animal and clinical studies suggest that bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation may be
superior to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Our hypothesis was
that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of (cid:1)15 minutes’ duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve
outcomes for cardiac arrests lasting (cid:1)15 minutes.
MethodsandResults—Wecarriedoutaprospective,population-based,observationalstudyinvolvingconsecutivepatients
with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome
measure was 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was
performedtoevaluatetherelationshipbetweentypeofCPRandoutcomes.Amongthe4902witnessedcardiacarrests,
783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration cardiac
arrests((cid:1)15minutes),thecardiac-onlyresuscitationyieldedahigherrateof1-yearsurvivalwithfavorableneurological
outcome than no bystander CPR (4.3% versus 2.5%; odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95), and conventional CPR
showed similar effectiveness (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). For the very-long-duration arrests,
neurologically favorable 1-year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors
regardlessofthetypeofbystanderCPR(0.3%[2of624],0%[0of92],and2.2%[3of139]inthenobystanderCPR,
cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P(cid:2)0.05).
Conclusions—Bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult
out-of-hospitalcardiacarrests.Forveryprolongedcardiacarrests,theadditionofrescuebreathingmaybeofsomehelp.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
This study addresses 2 important clinical issues regarding bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. First, cardiac-only
bystanderresuscitationwasaseffectiveasconventionalbystandercardiopulmonaryresuscitationwithrescuebreathingfor
cardiacarreststhathada(cid:1)15-minuteintervalfromcollapsetoemergencymedicalserviceresuscitation.Thesedatafrom
nearly 5000 witnessed cardiac arrests provide important new support for the effectiveness of cardiac-only resuscitation.
This is the only large-scale population-based study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to address this issue. This
population-based study design is intended to minimize potential selection biases. Our observations are consistent with
previousstudiesdespitethesubstantialdifferencesinstudydesigns,patientpopulations,andemergencymedicalservice,
which indicate that the clinical data supporting the effectiveness of cardiac-only bystander resuscitation are quite robust.
The second interesting issue addressed by this study is that rescue breathing may be of some help for very prolonged
cardiacarrests((cid:1)15minutes);however,thelimitednumberofsurvivorsfromsucharrestsprecludedasimpleanswerto
thisissue.Evenifrescuebreathingisimportantforveryprolongedarrests,ourdatashowthattherearefewsurvivorsfrom
veryprolongedcardiacarrestsregardlessofthetypeofbystandercardiopulmonaryresuscitation.Inlightofthesedataand
the disappointingly low rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, efforts to teach and encourage lay rescuers to
perform cardiac-only resuscitation may improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
