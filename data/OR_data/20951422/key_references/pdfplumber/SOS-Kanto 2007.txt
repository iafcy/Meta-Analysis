bystander CPR. Any resuscitation attempt was associated with a higher proportion having favourable neurological
outcomes than no resuscitation (5·0% vs 2·2%, p<0·0001). Cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in a higher proportion
of patients with favourable neurological outcomes than conventional CPR in patients with apnoea (6·2% vs 3·1%;
p=0·0195), with shockable rhythm (19·4% vs 11·2%, p=0·041), and with resuscitation that started within 4 min of
arrest (10·1% vs 5·1%, p=0·0221). However, there was no evidence for any benefi t from the addition of
mouth-to-mouth ventilation in any subgroup. The adjusted odds ratio for a favourable neurological outcome after
cardiac-only resuscitation was 2·2 (95% CI 1·2–4·2) in patients who received any resuscitation from bystanders.
Interpretation Cardiac-only resuscitation by bystanders is the preferable approach to resuscitation for adult patients
with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, especially those with apnoea, shockable rhythm, or short periods of
untreated arrest.

the proportions surviving at 30 days showed no

groups, and these two groups also had similar frequencies
of survival until hospital admission.
Discussion
This report shows that bystander cardiac-only resuscitation
is equivalent or superior to conventional bystander CPR
in adult patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, in terms of neurological benefi t. Not only the any
resuscitation group, but also the cardiac-only resuscitation
group had higher proportions of favourable neurological outcome than the no bystander resuscitation group for the whole cohort, and cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in better outcome than conventional CPR in some
important subgroups of patients. These subgroups
included patients with apnoea (about 90% of patients in
this study), and those with shockable cardiac rhythm or
short periods of untreated arrest (CPR that started within

Each curve shows predicted frequency of favourable neurological outcome at 30 days by the non-linear regression
analysis with logarithm (vertical axis shows predicted frequency of favourable neurological outcome, and
predicted frequency of 1 is equivalent to 100%). Each box represents the actual frequencies of favourable
neurological outcome at 30 days for each bystander resuscitation group every 2 min. p=0·0086 for comparison of
