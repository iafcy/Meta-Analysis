We note the relatively low survival rates in this study,
which were consistent with previously reported survival in
our city.39 It is comparable to survival rates in other large
cities40 and may be related to factors such as problems
with multistorey building access, delayed response times
and bystander CPR rates. However, the low survival might

Conclusion
In this study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we found
that patients were more likely to survive with any form of
bystanderCPRthanwithout.Therewasnodifferenceinsur-
vival to discharge between CC-CPR and standard CPR. This
provides additional evidence for the importance of chest
compressions,whetherwithorwithoutventilation.
