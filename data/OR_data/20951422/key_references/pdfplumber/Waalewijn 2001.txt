Abstract
The objective of this study was to analyze the functioning of the first two links of the chain of survival: ‘access’ and ‘basic
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)’. In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by
emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for
variouswitnesses,theperformanceofbasicCPR,thequalityofCPR,theperformersofCPRandthedelays.Alogisticregression
model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links.

Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic
CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately
the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the
performer must be taken into account. Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus on partners of the patients, who are
most likely witness of an arrest. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
