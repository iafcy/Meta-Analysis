point was 30-day survival.
RESULTS
Data for the primary analysis were collected from February 2005 through January
2009 for a total of 1276 patients. Of these, 620 patients had been assigned to receive
compression-only CPR and 656 patients had been assigned to receive standard CPR.
The rate of 30-day survival was similar in the two groups: 8.7% (54 of 620 patients)
in the group receiving compression-only CPR and 7.0% (46 of 656 patients) in the
group receiving standard CPR (absolute difference for compression-only vs. stan-
dard CPR, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −1.2 to 4.6; P = 0.29).
CONCLUSIONS
This prospective, randomized study showed no significant difference with respect
to survival at 30 days between instructions given by an emergency medical dispatch-
er, before the arrival of EMS personnel, for compression-only CPR and instructions
for standard CPR in patients with suspected, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac ar-
rest. (Funded by the Swedish Heart–Lung Foundation and others; Karolinska Clini-
