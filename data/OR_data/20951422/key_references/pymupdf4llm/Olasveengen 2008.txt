urgent changes in the current guidelines, advocating continuous chest compressions (CCC) as the
preferred method for bystander CPR in patients
who suddenly collapse.[15]

Any scientific process developing new treatment
guidelines should rely on as many independent
studies as possible to support changes in treatment
protocols. The aim of this study is therefore to test
the reproducibility of earlier published data,[13,14]

suggesting that CCC are at least as effective as
standard CPR for bystanders.

### Material and methods

#### Description of emergency medical service (EMS)
The city of Oslo has a one-tiered centralised community-run EMS system for a population of 540,000.
On weekdays, between 7 : 30 and 22: 00 hours, a
physician-manned ambulance staffed by two paramedics and an anaesthesiologist functions on the
same level as the regular paramedic-staffed ambulances. The 2005 ERC guidelines were implemented
in January 2006. Before this, 2000 ERC guidelines
were followed modified with 3 min of CPR before
the first defibrillation attempt. Endotracheal intubation was the standard method for securing the
airways, with uninterrupted chest compressions
and 12 ventilations/min thereafter.
Nurses and paramedics staff the dispatch centre.
A maximum of two operators are involved, with a
median interval for dispatch call processing of
2.6 min.[16] Telephone CPR instruction with chest
compressions only was offered to callers. Because
of an ongoing randomised study of the effect
of intravenous (i.v.) access and drugs in the Oslo
EMS, some of our included patients are also included in this study registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT00121524). Less than half of the patients will
therefore be expected to have received i.v. drugs
during resuscitation.

#### Study design and recruitment
All patients older than 18 years suffering from nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of all
causes from May 2003 through 2006 were studied
retrospectively. Upon arrival, ambulance personnel
assessed whether bystander CPR was given, and if
so, which method was used and whether the
bystanders had received dispatcher CPR assistance. Locally adapted Utstein-style forms[17] (with
information on type of bystander CPR upon arrival
of first ambulance), dispatcher recordings and


ambulance and hospital records are routinely collected and reviewed at The National Competence
Centre for Emergency Medicine (Ulleva˚l University Hospital, Oslo, Norway).

#### Statistical analysis
Statistical calculations were performed using a
spreadsheet programme (Excel 2002, Microsoft
Corp., Redmond, WA) and a statistical software
package (SPSS 14.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Values
are given as means with standard deviations, except for response times given as medians with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). CIs for medians were
calculated using normal approximation described
by Altman.[18] Differences between the two groups
were analysed using Students t-tests for continuous
data and w[2] with continuity correction for categorical data. P-values o0.05 were considered to be
significant.
Prognostic factors found to be significant in
preliminary univariate and bivariate analyses
were included in a multivariate logistic regression
analysis together with the BLS method (dependent
variable, discharged from hospital alive). The results from the multivariate logistic regression analysis were reported as adjusted odds ratios with
95% CIs and P-values.

### Results

Between May 2003 and 2006, there were 809 cardiac
arrests treated by our EMS. Ninety-three (11%)
were ambulance witnessed, 15 (2%) were only
given mouth-to-mouth ventilations by bystanders
and for six cases information on bystander CPR
was missing. Six-hundred ninty-five patients were
subsequently included in our study, with 281 (40%)
receiving S-BLS, 145 (21%) receiving CCC and 269
(39%) receiving no BLS. (Fig. 1) The patient group
receiving CCC had more arrests occurring at home
(58% vs. 41%, P 5 0.002), less in public places (29%
vs. 42%, P 5 0.009) and were more frequently found
in asystole (54% vs. 43%, P 5 0.038) and less frequently found in VF/VT (33% vs. 46%, P 5 0.018)
compared with the S-BLS group (Table 1).
After ambulance arrival, fewer shocks were delivered (median 0 vs. 1, P 5 0.019) and i.v. access
was established less frequently (51% vs. 66%,
P 5 0.004) in the CCC group compared with the
S-BLS group. Adrenaline and amiodarone were
administered more often in the S-BLS group (48%

and 13%) compared with the CCC group (37% and
6%) (P 5 0.050 and P 5 0.041) (Table 2). There was
no difference in randomisation for i.v. access (vs. no
i.v. access) before return of spontaneous circulation
between the S-BLS and CCC groups (51% vs. 47%,
P 5 0.476).

Demographic characteristics.


There were no significant differences in outcome
between the two patient groups. Thirty-five (13%)
were discharged from the hospital alive in the
S-BLS group and 15 (10%) in the CCC group
(P 5 0.647) (Table 3), and for subgroups with witnessed arrests, 34 (18%) and 12 (14%), respectively
(P 5 0.586), or for subgroups with initial VF/VT
after witnessed arrest, 32 (29%) and 10 (28%)
patients, respectively (P 5 0.972).
The following prognostic factors were found to
be significant in preliminary univariate (and bivariate) analyses: gender (P 5 0.011), atropine administration (P 5 0.000), bystander-witnessed arrest
(P 5 0.000), shocked vs. not shocked (P 5 0.000),
arrest occurring at home (P 5 0.007), arrest occurring in a public place (0.018), initial VF/VT
(P 5 0.000), initial asystole (P 5 0.000), age
(P 5 0.000), response time (P 5 0.000) and time
from arrest to advanced life support (P 5 0.001).
Only age, response time, gender, bystander witnessed and initial VF/VT rhythm were entered into
the regression model as the remaining variables
reflect at least one of the above variables.
The logistic analysis revealed that favourable
outcomes (an increased likelihood of survival)
were associated with a short response interval,
young age, initial VF/VT and witnessed arrests.

The method of BLS (CCC only vs. S-BLS) was not

### Discussion

Our results support earlier studies suggesting that
there are no significant differences in outcome for
patients receiving CCC compared with standard
BLS from bystanders.[2,13,14,19] There was no significant difference in overall survival in the most
recent Japanese study with continuous compressions vs. standard BLS (P 5 0.146), but post hoc
subgroup analysis gave higher survival rates with
CCC than standard BLS for witnessed out-ofhospital arrests with apnoea, shockable rhythms
and short periods of untreated arrests. We found no
such subgroup with better outcome without ventilation, but the material is small and the opposite
was not the case either.

This indicates that chest compression only is at
least as good as standard BLS for non-traumatic outof-hospital cardiac arrests in adults. Although this
might be the case for the majority of cardiac arrest
victims who have a sudden arrest of cardiac origin,
we do not believe the data are sufficiently strong to
advocate this approach to all cardiac arrest victims.
There are groups of patients with asphyxia-related
arrests such as children, victims of intoxications or
near-drowning who at least theoretically should
benefit more from an open airway and active
ventilation. In the city of Oslo, there are four times
as many patients with drug overdose who require
ventilatory assistance only than patients who require full CPR. Mouth-to-mouth ventilation must
not be a forgotten art. It is also a major concern that
differentiating treatment strategies for lay people
may result in a decreased rate of bystander CPR
rather than an increase. Instructions to lay people
should be kept as simple as possible, with as few
changes as possible unless based on very solid data.
An important argument for removing mouth-tomouth ventilations is the assumption that it will
increase the willingness of lay people to perform
bystander CPR. This is largely deduced from questionnaire-based studies asking people to guess how
they might react in a hypothetical situation.[20,21] It
remains to be proven that removing mouth-tomouth ventilations will increase bystander CPR.
With the large differences in reported bystander
involvement, it seems that other strategies might be
effective in improving the frequency of bystander
CPR. In Norway, the frequency has been high for
decades, usually reported in the 40–60% range.
Detrimental effects of compression pauses constitute most of the rationale for increased emphasis
on chest compressions in the 2005 CPR guidelines.[11,12] Earlier studies[2,13,14,19] as well as most of
our own data were collected while the old guidelines were in effect. We question whether the
guidelines should be changed again until we
have more information with the current 30 : 2 compression-to-ventilation ratio and from areas with
better overall survival than the Japanese study[14]

and longer response intervals than typically reported
from King County, Washington.[13]

Hallstrom et al. documented that dispatchers
spent 2.4 min instructing bystanders to give standard BLS, and that bystanders receiving such instructions were more likely to not complete their
instructions compared with bystanders instructed to
give chest compressions only. Arrival of EMS personnel before completion of dispatch instructions

### 918


and declaring the CPR instructions too difficult
were more than twice as common in the standard
BLS group.[13] These are compelling arguments suggesting dispatchers limit their instructions to chest
compressions for untrained bystanders.
In the present study, the S-BLS group had significantly more patients with witnessed arrests
occurring in public places, with VF or VT as initial
rhythm. Fewer bystanders in this group also received telephone assistance when performing CPR.
This could be expected as it is likely that a larger
proportion of bystanders with prior CPR training
would start S-BLS without any dispatch assistance.
Despite this uneven distribution of known positive
predictors, outcome remained the same for the two
BLS groups after factoring in these variables in a
multivariate logistic regression model. Interestingly, the S-BLS group received more i.v. drugs
than the CCC group, even though there was no
difference in i.v. randomisation. There was also a
tendency towards administering more shocks to
the shocked patients in the S-BLS group. This raises
the question of whether it is the S-BLS treatment
itself that leads to increased need for drug and
shock treatment or whether this is due to some
confounding factor. One such confounder may be
the higher incidence of cardiac arrest occurring in
public places. Cardiac arrests in public places are
known to a have better prognosis, and a higher
level of ambition by ambulance personnel would
be expected. An increased expectation by bystanders for ambulance personnel to exhaust all options
might also be more common in a public setting.
Although no differences could be detected in
outcome for the S-BLS and CCC groups, even after
applying a multivariate regression model, this was
not a randomised trial and the results must be
interpreted with caution. A variety of other, unknown confounders may influence our results, and
prospective, randomised clinical trials are needed.

### Conclusions

Patients receiving CCC from bystanders had no
worse outcome than patients receiving standard
CPR, even with a tendency towards a worse distribution of several known negative predictive features.
