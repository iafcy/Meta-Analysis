# Cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders with chest compression only (SOS-KANTO): an observational study

_SOS-KANTO study group_

### Summary
**Background Mouth-to-mouth ventilation is a barrier to bystanders doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but**
**few clinical studies have investigated the effi cacy of bystander resuscitation by chest compressions without**
**mouth-to-mouth ventilation (cardiac-only resuscitation).**

**Methods We did a prospective, multicentre, observational study of patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. On**
**arrival at the scene, paramedics assessed the technique of bystander resuscitation. The primary endpoint was**
**favourable neurological outcome 30 days after cardiac arrest.**

**Findings 4068 adult patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnessed by bystanders were included; 439 (11%)**
**received cardiac-only resuscitation from bystanders, 712 (18%) conventional CPR, and 2917 (72%) received no**
**bystander CPR. Any resuscitation attempt was associated with a higher proportion having favourable neurological**
**outcomes than no resuscitation (5·0% vs 2·2%, p<0·0001). Cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in a higher proportion**
**of patients with favourable neurological outcomes than conventional CPR in patients with apnoea (6·2% vs 3·1%;**
**p=0·0195), with shockable rhythm (19·4% vs 11·2%, p=0·041), and with resuscitation that started within 4 min of**
**arrest (10·1%** **_vs 5·1%, p=0·0221). However, there was no evidence for any benefi t from the addition of_**
**mouth-to-mouth ventilation in any subgroup. The adjusted odds ratio for a favourable neurological outcome after**
**cardiac-only resuscitation was 2·2 (95% CI 1·2–4·2) in patients who received any resuscitation from bystanders.**

**Interpretation Cardiac-only resuscitation by bystanders is the preferable approach to resuscitation for adult patients**
**with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, especially those with apnoea, shockable rhythm, or short periods of**
**untreated arrest.**


### Introduction
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consisting of
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation
done by bystanders is a major element in the so-called
chain of survival for people with cardiac arrest.[1–4]


Although bystander CPR improves likelihood of
survival,[1–8] reports[9–14] have shown that bystander CPR was
attempted for less than a-third of patients who had
collapsed. Surveys have identifi ed reluctance of
bystanders to undertake mouth-to-mouth ventilation as
a substantial barrier to CPR attempts.[10,15–17] This reluctance
is partly caused by fear of transmission of infectious
diseases. Despite the remote chance of such infection,
fears about disease transmission are common in the
present era of universal precautions.[10,15] Another barrier
to bystanders attempting CPR is the complexity of the
technique as presently taught.[18–20] In CPR guidelines,
cardiac-only resuscitation by bystanders is recom mended
in dispatcher-assisted resuscitation or if a rescuer is
unwilling or unable to do mouth-to-mouth ventilation.[2–4 ]

However, this technique is not generally known,
recommended, or taught to the public. Since few clinical
studies have focused on the effi cacy of cardiac-only
resucitation,[8,21,22] we sought to compare the outcomes for
patients who underwent cardiac-only resuscitation or
conventional CPR by bystanders. If cardiac-only
resuscitation is as eff ective as conventional CPR by
bystanders, rescuers might be more willing and able to
provide this simple intervention than they are at present.
Furthermore, clinical studies have established that
interruptions to chest compressions during
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are common, even by
trained emergency medical staff .[3,23,24] Studies suggest

that such interruptions can have lethal consequences.[25–27]
Kern and colleagues[26] showed that cardiac-only
resuscitation results in sub stantially better survival
without neurological impairment 24 h after cardiac
arrest than conventional CPR.
We therefore assessed the eff ect of cardiac-only
resuscitation by bystanders on adults who had out-ofhospital cardiac arrest. We expected that cardiac-only
resuscitation or conventional CPR would be better than
no bystander intervention and that cardiac-only
resuscitation would show similar neurological outcome
to conventional CPR.

### Methods
#### Participants
A survey of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in
the Kanto region of Japan (SOS-KANTO) was done by the
Association for Acute Medicine of Kanto and included
58 emergency hospitals and emergency medical service
units. Between Sept 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2003, patients
who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnessed by
bystanders and who were subsequently transported by
paramedics to emergency hospitals participating in
SOS-KANTO were included in the study. Exclusion
criteria were: patients younger than 18 years of age;
further cardiac arrest after the arrival of paramedics;
documented terminal illness; presence of a do-notresuscitate order; and bystander resuscitation without
documented chest compressions.

#### Procedures
The study was a prospective, multicentre, observational
trial that followed Utstein style reporting guidelines.[1]
The study was approved by the SOS-KANTO Research
Ethics Board, and the requirement for informed consent
was waived according to Japanese government
guidelines.[28] Paramedics observed the technique of
bystander resuscitation and asked additional questions
of bystanders to assess the characteristics of
resuscitation.[1,2] The technique during bystander
resuscitation was identifi ed as cardiac-only resuscitation,
conventional CPR, pulmonary-only resuscitation,
unidentifi ed resuscitation technique (including change
of technique), or chest compression not documented.
Chest compression rate and depth were not assessed.
The person attempting bystander resuscitation was
classifi ed as a lay person with basic CPR training, a lay
person assisted by a dispatcher, a lay person without
either training or dispatcher assistance, or an off -duty
health worker. All event times were measured by the
dispatch centre clock, and times of collapse and fi rst
bystander resuscitation attempts were obtained from
the bystanders. Cardiac arrest was defi ned as the
cessation of cardiac mechanical activity, manifesting as
unresponsiveness, apnoea (or gasping breathing), and
absence of pulse. The arrest was presumed to be from a
cardiac cause, unless it was known to have been caused


by a non-cardiac cause including trauma, drowning,
and asphyxia.[1]

Resuscitation attempts were documented by both
paramedics and attending physicians according to
Utstein style reporting guidelines.[1] Data for individual
patients were entered into a database by SOS-KANTO
members at each hospital and were independently
cross-checked twice by diff erent investigators. Original
data were made available to the data and safety
monitoring committee for independent scrutiny.

#### Study endpoints
The primary endpoint was favourable neurological
outcome 30 days after cardiac arrest, defi ned as a
Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral-performance category of


-----

1 (good performance) or 2 (moderate disability) on a
fi ve-category scale.[1,2] The other categories of 3 (severe
disability), 4 (vegetative state), and 5 (death) were regarded
as unfavourable neurological outcome.[1,2 ]The secondary
endpoint was survival 30 days after cardiac arrest, defi ned
as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral-performance category
of 1, 2, 3, or 4. The neurological outcome was defi ned by
physicians who were unaware of the patient’s bystander
resuscitation group.


#### Statistical analysis
An estimate of the number of patients needed to test our
hypothesis was derived from analyses of three previous
large-scale studies in Japan.[12–14] The calculation was based
on a two-fold improvement in favourable neurological
outcomes from a baseline outcome of 1·6, and a 1:1:6 ratio
of patients who had bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest
and received cardiac-only resuscitation versus conventional CPR versus no resuscitation. The minimum
sample size for comparison of favourable neurological
outcome at 30 days was estimated to be 400 patients for
each bystander resuscitation group, and 1120 patients for
the no bystander resuscitation group on the basis of a
two-sided α value of 0·05 and a β error of 0·10. Baseline
characteristics were compared by use of the χ² test for
categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous variables, as appropriate. Odds ratios and their
95% CI were calculated for the study endpoints. A multiple
logistic-regression analysis was done for independent
predictors of resuscitation, including age, cause of cardiac
arrest, technique of bystander resuscitation, resuscitationrelated time intervals, and initial recorded cardiac
rhythm.[1,2] The non-linear regression analysis with
logarithm was used to illustrate the relation between
favourable neurological outcome 30 days after cardiac
arrest and the time between fi rst bystander resuscitation
attempts and fi rst use of automated external defi brillator
(AED) in patients receiving bystander CPR with ventricular
fi brillation or ventricular tachycardia as an initial cardiac
rhythm.

### Results
9592 patients received advanced life support by
paramedics and were transported to emergency hospitals
during the study. Of those, 5464 patients were not eligible.
The SOS-KANTO study therefore included 4068 adult
patients who had bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest out
of hospital; 1151 (28%) received bystander resuscitation,
including 439 (11%) who received cardiac-only
resuscitation and 712 (18%) who received conventional
CPR, and 2917 (72%) did not receive any bystander
resuscitation. No patient was lost to follow-up for study
endpoints at 30 days after cardiac arrest (fi gure 1).
At baseline, signifi cant diff erences (table 1) were seen
between the any resuscitation group and the no bystander
resuscitation group for cause of cardiac arrest, location
where the cardiac arrest happened, proportion with
gasping breathing and pupillometer reading at arrival of
emergency medical services, initial recorded cardiac
rhythm, and the need for defi brillation by emergency

medical workers. Generally, the two groups that received
bystander resuscitation had similar baseline
characteristics (table 2). However, higher proportions in
the cardiac-only resuscitation group than in the
conventional group were male, more patients had cardiac
arrest at home, and more were treated by lay people. The
group who had any resuscitation attempt had signifi cantly
higher frequencies of favourable neurological outcome
at 30 days than the no bystander resuscitation group in
the whole cohort (5% [57/1151 vs 2% [63/2917]; p<0·0001)
and in the subgroups of patients with cardiac causes
(7% [53/806] _vs 3% [54/1836]; p<0·0001), with apnoea_
(4% [44/1028] vs 2% [55/2751]; p<0·0001], with ventricular
fi brillation or tachycardia as initial cardiac rhythm
(14% [47/329] vs 8% [45/549]; p=0·0044), and with both of
the times between call to emergency medical services
and fi rst AED analysis (for interval ≤10 min; 6% [44/689]
_vs 3% [52/1801]; p<0·0001: for interval >10 min;_
3% [13/462] vs 1% [11/1116]; p=0·0069). The cardiac-only
resuscitation group also had signifi cantly higher
frequencies of favourable neurological outcome at
30 days than the no bystander resuscitation group in
those categories. Although the frequency of favourable
neurological outcome at 30 days did not diff er between
the cardiac-only resuscitation group and the conventional

resuscitation starting within 4 min of collapse (p=0·0221).
However, the bystander resuscitation groups had similar
frequencies of favourable neurological outcome at 30 days
in the subgroups of patients who received bystander
resuscitation from a lay person or from a medically
trained person. Additionally, there was no evidence for
any benefi t from the addition of mouth-to-mouth
ventilation in any subgroup of patients who received
bystander resuscitation.
Multiple logistic-regression analysis (fi gure 2) showed
that cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in higher
proportions of favourable neurological outcome than


conventional CPR (p=0·0144), and other independent
predictors of favourable outcome were age, time between
fi rst bystander resuscitation attempt and fi rst
AED analysis, and ventricular fi brillation or tachycardia
as initial cardiac rhythm. When sex and gasping
breathing were included in the analysis, the results did
not change.
Figure 3 shows the relation between favourable
neurological outcome at 30 days and the time between
fi rst bystander resuscitation attempt and fi rst
AED analysis (ie, the duration of bystander resuscitation)
in patients with ventricular fi brillation or tachycardia.
Cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in higher proportions
of favourable neurological outcome than conventional
CPR (22% [22/100] vs 10% [17/166], the odds ratio, 2·5;
95% CI, 1·2–4·9; p=0·0086], and likelihood of a
favourable neurological outcome decreased in both
bystander resuscitation groups for every 1 min increment
in time from fi rst resuscitation attempt to fi rst
AED analysis (p=0·0105 for the cardiac-only rescuscitation
and p=0·0003 for conventional CPR). When the time
from collapse to fi rst AED analysis was used instead, the
results were unchanged.
The proportions of people who were alive at 30 days
diff ered from those who had favourable neurological
outcome at 30 days (fi gure 4). In all subgroups of patients,
the proportions surviving at 30 days showed no
diff erences between the two bystander resuscitation
groups, and these two groups also had similar frequencies
of survival until hospital admission.

### Discussion
This report shows that bystander cardiac-only resuscitation
is equivalent or superior to conventional bystander CPR
in adult patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, in terms of neurological benefi t. Not only the any
resuscitation group, but also the cardiac-only resuscitation
group had higher proportions of favourable neurological
outcome than the no bystander resuscitation group for
the whole cohort, and cardiac-only resuscitation resulted
in better outcome than conventional CPR in some
important subgroups of patients. These subgroups
included patients with apnoea (about 90% of patients in
this study), and those with shockable cardiac rhythm or
short periods of untreated arrest (CPR that started within
4 min of arrest). These patients had the greatest chance of
survival (table 3, fi gures 3 and 4). After adjustment for
resuscitation, cardiac-only resuscitation was an independent predictor of favourable neurological outcome
in patients who received bystander resuscitation (fi gure 2).
Furthermore, there was no evidence for any benefi t from
the addition of mouth-to-mouth ventilation in any
subgroup of patients (table 3, fi gures 2, 3, and 4).
Some experts have expressed concern that the absence of
assisted ventilation with chest compressions might result
in lower survival and worse neurological outcomes in
survivors of cardiac arrest.[3,4] Several clinical studies have


-----

shown that cardiac-only resuscitation is at least as eff ective
as chest compression with mouth-to-mouth ventilation.[8,21,22]
In this study, however, cardiac-only resuscitation resulted
in better or similar neurological outcome than conventional
CPR. Moreover, the pro portion of patients surviving,
including those surviving until hospital admission, showed
no diff erences between the cardiac-only resuscitation
group and the conventional CPR group in any subgroup of
patients. The number of patients who received bystander
cardiac-only resuscitation was higher in this study (n=439)
than in previous ones (n=273,[21] 241,[22] and 41[8]). We suggest
that the large number of patients provided adequate power
to attribute better neurological outcome to cardiac-only
resuscitation, and there was no evidence of increased
numbers of survivors with neurologically unfavourable
outcomes in the group who had cardiac-only resuscitation
compared with conventional CPR.
Several mechanisms might account for the effi cacy of
cardiac-only resuscitation. If the airway is open, gasping
breathing and passive chest recoil provide some air
exchange.[15,29–33] Measured minute ventilation and arterial
oxygenation decrease after 4–10 min of resuscitation
irrespective of attempts at ventilation.[15,26,30 ]Several studies
suggest that ventilation is not essential during the initial
12 min of resuscitation with untreated arrest intervals of
less than 6 min,[15,25,30,31 ] and that gasping breathing is
associated with a better outcome.[15,29,31,33] In this study, most
patients who had bystander resuscitation had an untreated
arrest interval of less than 6 min and a duration of
bystander resuscitation of less than 12 min, and the two
bystander resuscitation groups had similar time intervals
and had similar proportions of patients with gasping
breath.
Another reason for the effi cacy of cardiac-only
resuscitation could be that mouth-to-mouth ventilation
has several potential disadvantages. These disadvantages
include gastric insuffl ations and importantly, less cycle
time spent on eff ective compressions.[2–4,15,19,23–28,34] Time
spent on mouth-to-mouth ventilation takes precious time
away from chest compressions that support cerebral and
coronary perfusion.[3,4,15,19,23–28] Intrathoracic pressure drops
after each pause for mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and
several chest compressions have to be done before
previous rates of cerebral and coronary perfusion are
re-established.[3,4,26] In this study, the quality of chest
compressions might not have been as good in the
cardiac-only resuscitation group as in the conventional
resuscitation group, because the proportion of patients
treated by people with no fi rst-aid training, with or without
dispatcher-assistance, was higher in the cardiac-only
group (272/439, 62% vs 234/712, 33%). Also, the proportion
treated by medically trained individuals was lower in the
cardiac-only group than in the conventional CPR group
(97/439, 22% vs 350/712, 49%) However, there would be
less interruption of chest compressions in the cardiac-only
resuscitation group. We suggest that interruption of chest
compressions was the main reason why conventional


CPR did not result in better neurological outcome than
cardiac-only resuscitation.
There are several limitations to our study. It was neither
a randomised controlled trial nor a population-based
study. However, the overall survival and patients’
characteristics in this study were similar to those of
population-based studies from similar large metropolitan
areas—Osaka, Japan,[13] and New York, USA[35] Although
the total number of patients was large, there were few
patients with arrest caused by asphyxia, drowning, or
traumatic brain injury. The quality of bystander
resuscitation was not assessed, and resuscitation-related
event times were known for only 70% of the study
population. Additionally, post-resuscitation care could
not be standardised. Recent studies[3,4,36–38] have shown that
therapeutic hypothermia can result in better outcomes
for patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fi brillation.
In this study, few patients were treated by induction of
hypothermia, and the proportions given this treatment
were similar in the two bystander resuscitation groups.
On the basis of these fi ndings, we conclude that
bystander cardiac-only resuscitation is the preferred
approach to resuscitation for adult patients with
witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest especially those
with apnoea, shockable cardiac rhythm, or short periods
of untreated arrest.
