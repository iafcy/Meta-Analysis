**Abstract**

The objective of this study was to analyze the functioning of the first two links of the chain of survival: ‘access’ and ‘basic
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)’. In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by
emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for
various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression
model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links.
From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112,
but first called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest
(44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience,
was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between
basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival.
Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic
CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately
the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the
performer must be taken into account. Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus on partners of the patients, who are
most likely witness of an arrest. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

**1. Introduction**

The chain of survival concept describes the actions
necessary for an optimal chance to survive an out-ofhospital cardiac arrest [1]. The first two links in the
chain of survival: access and basic cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) are nearly always bystander initiated actions and the success of resuscitation efforts by
health care professionals are highly dependent on the
responsibly initial bystander. This study focussed on
the period of circulatory arrest before the arrival of
emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. We analyzed the actions and the quality of performance of the
four groups most involved in the first two links: family,
bystanders, general practitioners and police officers.

**2. Patients and methods**

2.1. Emergency medical ser�ice system

The EMS system is a one tiered system serving 1.3
million inhabitants in the Amsterdam area of 1030 km[2].
The Netherlands has a national emergency telephone
number 112, connected to regional dispatch centers. All
ambulances were manned with a paramedic and a
driver, who are trained to perform advanced CPR.
Sometimes, the police were also activated after an
emergency call for a suspected circulatory arrest. Telephone instructions for CPR were not used.

2.2. Study design

In a prospective study performed between June 1,
1995 and August 1, 1997 all consecutive out-of-hospital
circulatory arrests confirmed by EMS personnel were
recorded. Included were all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests, where EMS personnel attempted resuscitation. The ethics committees of all the study partners
approved the study.

2.3. Data collection

We followed the Utstein recommendations for registration, definitions, and nomenclature [2]. Data collection was done by specially trained research personnel
on the scene as has been described in detail previously

[3]. Briefly, these personnel consisted of medical students, in a 24-h, 7 days a week coverage of the study


area. When the ambulance dispatchers suspected a circulatory arrest and dispatched accordingly, the researcher ‘‘on call’’ was also directed to the scene. The
researcher usually arrived during or immediately after
the resuscitation attempt and debriefed the witness,
bystanders, performers of basic CPR, and paramedics
immediately after the resuscitation attempt to describe
their actions and the times accurately. Estimation of the
moment of collapse and the quality of basic CPR had a
high priority. Rhythm strips from the ambulance were
recovered and clock differences between the dispatcher’s computer and the time stamp of the defibrillator
were corrected immediately.

2.4. Time inter�als and definitions

The interval between the collapse and the moment
that the call reached the dispatch center was defined as
‘time to call’. When a patient collapsed after the call
but before arrival of the EMS personnel, this was
recorded as ‘call before collapse’. ‘Time from call to
EMS arrival’ was the interval between the moment that
the call reached the dispatch center up to the time that
the EMS arrived at the patient’s side. ‘Time to basic
CPR’ was the interval between collapse and the start of
basic CPR by lay persons. ‘Time from basic CPR to
EMS arrival’ was the interval between the start of basic
CPR to the EMS arrival at the patient’s side. Persons
who had received training in basic CPR procedures
were labeled ‘trained in basic CPR’. ‘Experience in
basic CPR’ was recorded if a person had performed
basic CPR on a human victim at least once before.

2.5. Statistical methods

Differences between proportions were tested with the
� [2] statistic, with a significant level of P-value � 0.05.
Differences between medians were tested with the Median rank test. A logistic regression model was developed from all potential predictors for survival that
could be known before the EMS arrived: the witness,
‘time to call’, the caller, ‘time to basic CPR’, ‘time from
basic CPR to EMS arrival’, the identity training, history and experience of the performance of basic CPR,
and the different ways of performing basic CPR. Stepwise elimination was used and based on the significance
of each variable in the model and the significance in
change of the log-likelihood, both tested with the � [2]

statistic and a P-value � 0.05. All statistics were performed in JMP 3.2 for the Apple Macintosh [4].

3.1. The study cohort

In a study period of 26 months, 1685 patients had a
circulatory arrest confirmed by EMS personnel. We
excluded 400 patients who were not resuscitated by
EMS personnel, 198 patients whose arrest was not
witnessed and 165 patients whose onset of arrest was
witnessed by EMS personnel. Of the remaining 922
patients, attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful in
71% (658/922). After initial successful resuscitation 19%
(171/922) of the patients died during hospital admission
and eventually 10% (93/922) of the patients survived to
hospital discharge.

3.2. The first link of the chain: access to help

3.2.1. The witness
The witnesses were nearly all bystanders (46%) or
family members (44%) (Table 1). When a general practitioner was called for symptoms and witnessed the
collapse, the chance of survival was statistically better
than for any other witness. Police officers were seldom
(1%) witnesses of an out-of-hospital circulatory arrest.

3.2.2. The call
In 95 cases, the call had reached the dispatch center
before the patient collapsed (Table 1). There was a
trend toward a better survival when the call was made
before the arrest. In 827 cases, the call was made after
the arrest and in 634 of these, the call was directly made


cantly better survival than when a call was first made to
others. Who made the call had no significant influence
on the outcome.
When the first call was directly made to the dispatcher, the median call delay was 0.8 min (Fig. 1(A)).
When the first call was to others, such as relatives or
the general practitioner, the median call delay was
significantly longer, 2.8 min (P � 0.001). The median
call delay of the call made by family members and
bystanders was 0.9 and 1.0 min, not significantly different (P = 0.11), (Fig. 1(B)). The median call delay was
significantly longer when the general practitioner or the
police made the call, 2.0 and 1.8 min, with P-values of
0.02 and 0.02, respectively.
The dispatcher recognized the call as a circulatory
arrest in 312 of the 827 cases, resulting in the dispatch
of two ambulances simultaneously and, in 76 cases, also
the police. In 69% (214/312) of these cases, basic CPR
was started, significantly more than when the call was
not recognized as an arrest, 46% (237/515), P � 0.0001.
It was not documented whether basic CPR was initiated before or after the call to the dispatcher.

3.3. The second link of the chain: basic CPR

3.3.1. The basic CPR performer
In 45% of the cases, a bystander started basic CPR,
in 25% a general practitioner, in 19% a police officer,
and in 11% a family member or a relative (Table 2).
The median time to the start of basic CPR for the
general practitioner and the bystander was the same,

the basic CPR performers, the differences were not
statistically significant.

In the 493 patients who received basic CPR, the
outcome was significantly better at all levels of training
and experience, compared to those who did not have
basic CPR (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Twenty-one family
members had been trained in basic CPR procedures,

(68%) had been trained in basic CPR procedures. Family members who performed basic CPR had experience
in 13% (7/52) and bystanders in 37% (83/222). All
general practitioners and police officers had been
trained in basic CPR procedures. Of the general practitioners 91% (113/124) had experience in basic CPR
performance, as did 84% (80/95) of the police officers.

experienced basic CPR performers was the shortest
significantly P � 0.0001.
The interval since the last training lesson did not
significantly influence outcome (Fig. 3). Basic CPR
delivered by an untrained performer with experience
resulted in the best survival. With neither training nor
experience in basic CPR, survival was the worst and
similar to that of patients who received no basic CPR
at all.
In 89% of the cases, basic CPR performance consisted of mouth to mouth ventilation combined with
chest compression (Table 2). Basic CPR consisted of
chest compressions only in 8% and of mouth to mouth
ventilation only in 3%. Initial resuscitation success was
similar for the different forms of basic CPR and survival was not significantly different in the patients when
basic CPR consisted of chest compression with or
without ventilation.


-----

When all factors mentioned were analyzed in a logistic model, a few variables proved independent predictors of survival (Table 3). When no basic CPR was
performed before arrival of EMS personnel, survival
was very low. A delay before basic CPR was initiated
had a greater negative effect on survival than a delay
between the start of basic CPR and the EMS arrival.
When untrained persons without experience performed
basic CPR, there was a lower probability of survival
than then when a trained or experienced person performed basic CPR.

**4. Discussion**

This study focussed on the first two links in the chain
of survival: ‘access’ and ‘basic CPR’. In multivariate
analysis, basic CPR performance before arrival of EMS
personnel substantially improved survival. If the start
of basic CPR was delayed, survival decreased significantly. Furthermore, what did matter was the training
or experience of the basic CPR performer and not who
started basic CPR.
Basic CPR skills as tested on a manikin decline in
time [5]. We could not demonstrate that such a decline
in skills resulted in a decrease in survival after real
resuscitation efforts. However, univariate analysis
showed that basic CPR performed by an untrained and
inexperienced person, resulted in a survival similar to
that when no basic CPR was performed. In the multivariate model, the negative effect on survival of not
performing basic CPR was stronger than the effect of
an untrained and inexperienced basic CPR performer.
This difference in univariate and multivariate analysis
could not be explained by the delay in the start of basic
CPR, since this was identical. So, other predictors in
their situation must have had an additional negative
influence.
Family members were most likely to witness an arrest, but survival was worse then when others were
witnesses, although they did not call later. Family
members were less trained and experienced in basic
CPR, seldom started basic CPR and when they did, the
delay was long. Critically important was an immediate
start of basic CPR efforts, the training or experience of
the basic CPR performer, but not whether they were
physicians, family members or other witnesses. Therefore, basic CPR training should not only seek the
young and the active, but also the partners of potential
patients as target groups, even when older. This was
already emphasized many years ago and is again supported in our study [6].
Some researchers have already suggested that chest
compression alone might be as effective as the combi

lation [7]. Our observations do support this suggestion:
we found a similar survival in cases where chest compression was or was not accompanied by ventilation
efforts. A markedly lower survival was observed when
only mouth to mouth ventilation was delivered. This
difference was not statistically significant, probably because of the small number of cases in this group.
When a circulatory arrest is not recognized or when
panic prevails, a detour causes a delay. Obviously, the
call itself does not contribute to the resuscitation efforts, but it is required for early activation of subsequent links in the chain. Therefore, it is understandable
that the delay in the call itself was not a significant
predictor in the multivariate model [8]. It is important
that a call is recognized as that of a circulatory arrest,
allowing the dispatcher to send EMS and first responders simultaneously and give pre-arrival instructions to
the caller [9]. In the cases, where the dispatcher recognized an arrest, a high proportion received basic CPR
probably because the witness and the caller immediately
understood the true nature of the situation. So a paradox exists: instructions in performing basic CPR are
especially needed for the caller who does not recognize
the situation as a circulatory arrest.
Our multivariate analysis only contained potential
predictors that could be known before EMS arrived at
the patient’s side. Also, unwitnessed arrests were excluded from this study, since no accurate time estimate
was possible without a witness. Therefore, we did not
include in the analysis: ‘witnessing the arrest’, ‘initial
rhythm’ and the ‘cause of the circulatory arrest’ despite
the fact that this was recommended earlier [10].
A limitation of this study is that measuring the
quality of basic CPR performance was not feasible. We
decided not to accept the judgement of quality of basic
CPR by the EMS personnel: EMS personnel saw the
basic CPR efforts at a late stage, they could be biased
by the outcome, and EMS personnel immediately focussed their attention on their own task. Our research
personnel usually arrived after the EMS personnel and
did not observe the basic CPR performers. Therefore,
we employed a substitute measurement and chose the
previous training and experience in basic CPR
procedures.
From our study, we conclude that the statement
‘basic CPR performed’ incompletely describes the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to
initiation of basic CPR and the training and experience
of the performer must also be taken into account. The
importance of immediate initiation of basic CPR must
be stressed in basic CPR courses. This study again
records many patients for whom basic CPR was not
performed at all. Even when it was performed, basic
CPR by trained persons may be delayed because the
most important witness (partner or other family) does

Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus
more on the partners of those who are most likely to
witness a circulatory arrest.
