**BACKGROUND**
Emergency medical dispatchers give instructions on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) over the telephone to callers requesting help for a patient
with suspected cardiac arrest, before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS)
personnel. A previous study indicated that instructions to perform CPR consisting
of only chest compression result in a treatment efficacy that is similar or even superior to that associated with instructions given to perform standard CPR, which
consists of both compression and ventilation. That study, however, was not powered to assess a possible difference in survival. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to evaluate the possible superiority of compression-only CPR over
standard CPR with respect to survival.

**METHODS**
Patients with suspected, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomly assigned to undergo either compression-only CPR or standard CPR. The primary end
point was 30-day survival.

**RESULTS**
Data for the primary analysis were collected from February 2005 through January
2009 for a total of 1276 patients. Of these, 620 patients had been assigned to receive
compression-only CPR and 656 patients had been assigned to receive standard CPR.
The rate of 30-day survival was similar in the two groups: 8.7% (54 of 620 patients)
in the group receiving compression-only CPR and 7.0% (46 of 656 patients) in the
group receiving standard CPR (absolute difference for compression-only vs. standard CPR, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −1.2 to 4.6; P = 0.29).

**CONCLUSIONS**
This prospective, randomized study showed no significant difference with respect
to survival at 30 days between instructions given by an emergency medical dispatcher, before the arrival of EMS personnel, for compression-only CPR and instructions
for standard CPR in patients with suspected, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. (Funded by the Swedish Heart–Lung Foundation and others; Karolinska Clinical Trial Registration number, CT20080012.)

(EMS) personnel.[1] Telephone instructions given for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seem to be
given predominantly for CPR involving chest compression.[2]

Using an animal model, Berg and colleagues[3]
found that compression-only CPR and standard
CPR (i.e., CPR involving both compression and
ventilation) have similar efficacy. In a clinical study
in which dispatchers gave randomly assigned instructions to callers for aid to patients with cardiac arrest — to attempt resuscitation with the use
of either compression-only CPR or standard CPR
— survival rates were similar with the two CPR
methods.[2] However, this lack of difference may
have been due to an undersized study population.
In a subgroup analysis, the rate of survival was
significantly higher among patients with witnessed cardiac arrest receiving compression-only
CPR than among those receiving standard CPR.
Two retrospective registry studies have shown
similar survival rates with compression-only CPR
and standard CPR.[4,5]

We designed this prospective, randomized study
to compare the efficacy (measured as the 30-day
survival rate) of compression-only CPR and standard CPR, as performed on the basis of instructions from an emergency medical dispatcher, before the arrival of EMS personnel, in witnessed
cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.


Methods


**Study Protocol and Data Collection**
The study protocol was approved by the Regional
Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. The requirement for written informed consent was waived. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol (available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org), which contains
details about the methods and statistical analyses
beyond those presented here.
Sweden has 9 million inhabitants, and its 18
Emergency Medical Dispatch Centers respond to
about 10,000 calls daily. The Swedish Emergency
Medical Dispatch Center system and strategies
have been described elsewhere.[6]


In this study, dispatchers who received calls
about suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest first
determined whether randomization was warranted, by asking the caller whether the collapse had
been witnessed (seen or heard), which was an
inclusion criterion, as well as whether the patient
was unconscious and was not breathing or not
breathing normally. The dispatcher also ascertained that none of the following exclusion criteria were met: cardiac arrest caused by trauma,
airway obstruction, drowning, or intoxication; patient’s age under 8 years; and difficulty of the
dispatcher in communicating with the caller. Furthermore, the dispatcher ascertained that no one
at the scene had started CPR and that the caller
did not already know how to perform CPR and
was willing to be instructed to perform it.
If these conditions were met, the dispatcher
gave the caller instructions for either compression-only CPR or standard CPR (mouth-to-mouth
ventilation plus chest compression, consisting of
2 ventilations alternating with 15 compressions).
The type of CPR on which the caller was instructed was determined on the basis of the next available data-collection sheet for each dispatcher, who
removed a paper strip covering the treatment assignment on the sheet after determining that the
inclusion criteria had been met. Data-collection
sheets were distributed in blocks of 100 sheets,
50 for each treatment assignment. The order of
sheets within each block was unique and was
based on the random-number generator in SPSS
software (version 18).
The dispatcher entered information about inclusion and exclusion criteria on the data-collection sheet and, after the call, noted whether CPR
instructions had been given, and if so, instructions
for which type of CPR. The dispatcher also recorded whether EMS personnel arrived at any
point during the call and whether the arrival
interrupted the giving of instructions. Dispatchers were given detailed written instructions to use
for compression-only CPR and standard CPR, but
they were permitted to diverge from the written
instructions if they found it necessary. Our study
started before the guidelines for CPR changed the
recommendation from 2 ventilations alternating
with 15 compressions to 30 compressions alternating with 2 ventilations. Our instructions of
2 ventilations alternating with 15 compressions
were maintained throughout the study, since the

new guidelines did not address dispatcher-assisted CPR.
Data were collected from EMS records, and information about survival status was collected from
national registers. No interrater reliability assessment was performed. However, 50% of the datacollection forms were double-checked and no relevant deviations were observed. In addition, we
evaluated 100 recorded calls and reviewed the
corresponding data-collection forms, finding no
deviation of the information in each.


**End Points**

The primary end point was 30-day survival. The
secondary end points were 1-day survival, defined
as survival until midnight of the day of admission to the hospital, as well as the first detected
cardiac rhythm and survival to discharge from
the hospital.

**Statistical Analysis**
We estimated that a sample of 2213 patients in
each treatment group would be needed to provide


436 n engl j med 363;5 nejm org july 29 2010


-----

- There may have been more than one reason for exclusion. CPR denotes cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and EMS emergency medical services.


a statistical power of 80% to detect an absolute
difference of 2 percentage points in the 30-day
survival rate between the two groups, assuming
a rate of 5% with standard CPR and 7% with compression-only CPR, with a two-sided alpha value
of 0.05.
Because CPR guidelines were altered during
the study, giving compression-only CPR a more
prominent role,[7] and because of the practical difficulties of running a study for more than 4 years,
we decided that 1000 patients in each group was
the largest number that would be realistic to include in our study. This revised sample size was
estimated to provide a statistical power of 78%
to detect an absolute difference of 3 percentage
points in the 30-day survival rate between the two
groups, assuming a rate of 5% with standard CPR
and 8% with compression-only CPR, which was


considered sufficient to detect any clinically important difference in the survival rate. The calculations were performed in SamplePower 2.0 (SPSS).
Data were analyzed according to the randomized treatment assignments, for patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria (the
intention-to-treat population in the primary analysis), as well as according to the treatment actually
received (the per-protocol analysis). The chi-square
test was used to compare compression-only CPR
with standard CPR with regard to 30-day and
1-day survival rates (i.e., the primary and secondary end points). A two-tailed P value of less than
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. We used logistic regression to adjust for
possible confounders due to imbalances in the
baseline characteristics between the two groups
and to perform subgroup analyses to determine

whether the survival end points in each treatment
group varied according to the baseline and endpoint characteristics.


Results


**Enrollment and Characteristics**
**of the Patients**

Enrollment began in February 2005 and ended in
January 2009, at which time there had been 3809
randomized cases of suspected out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest. After exclusions, 1276 patients remained in the study (Fig. 1). Reasons for exclusion
are listed in Table 1. Of the 1276 patients, 620
(48.6%) were randomly assigned to receive compression-only CPR, and 656 patients (51.4%) to
receive standard CPR; 1036 patients (81.2%) were
treated per protocol, and 149 (11.7%) did not re

ceive the assigned treatment. A total of 113 of the
901 patients (12.5%) assigned to receive compression-only CPR were instead given standard CPR
because the dispatchers incorrectly gave standardCPR instructions. The two treatment groups were
similar with respect to the baseline characteristics of the patients and the episodes of cardiac
arrest (Table 2).

**Primary and Secondary Outcomes**
The primary analysis showed a 30-day survival
rate of 8.7% in the group receiving compressiononly CPR and 7.0% in the group receiving standard
CPR (absolute difference for compression-only vs.
standard CPR, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −1.2 to 4.6; P = 0.29) (Table 3). A total of 24.0% of the patients receiving compressiononly CPR survived for 1 day, as did 20.9% of those

receiving standard CPR. There were no significant differences between the two groups with
respect to the other secondary end points.

**Subgroup Analyses**
The rates of the primary outcome of 30-day survival and the secondary outcome of 1-day survival
did not differ significantly among the subgroups
studied (Fig. 2A and 2B). Specifically, the rate of
the primary end point did not vary significantly
with age (P = 0.50), interval between call and first
EMS response (P = 0.95), or first cardiac rhythm
(P = 0.99). Adjustment for the baseline characteristics did not change the results.
There was no significant difference in the rates
of survival between the two groups after data
from patients under 18 years of age were excluded. Nor did the rates of survival differ significantly between the groups for patients who received treatment other than the treatment they had
been randomly assigned to receive. Details of these
subgroup comparisons, with respect to the primary and secondary end points, and comparisons of patients whose cardiac arrest was classified as uncertain and those with “true” cardiac
arrest are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.

**Loss to Follow-up**
Information on follow-up was unavailable for 132
of 1952 patients (6.8%), the main reason being
loss of the corresponding EMS field reports, oc

curring primarily in a small number of EMS districts. We therefore performed a subgroup analysis excluding districts where more than 18% of
patients were lost to follow-up. No difference
from the main results was found.


Our nationwide, randomized study of witnessed
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest shows that giving
instructions for compression-only CPR before the
arrival of EMS personnel does not significantly
improve the outcome of patients as compared
with standard CPR. Neither the 1-day nor 30-day
rates of survival differed significantly between the
two groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the rates of survival among
various subgroups. The findings were similar irrespective of whether the data were analyzed according to the assigned treatment (the primary
analysis) or the treatment received. Our results are
in agreement with those from previously published retrospective registry studies.[4,5,8]

Previous studies in animals have shown no differences in survival or neurologic outcomes with
standard CPR and compression-only CPR.[3,9] One
investigation even showed adverse outcomes related to the interruption of chest compression in
order to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation.[10]
Complete occlusion of the airways does not reduce the chances of survival if reasonable circulation is provided by chest compression.[11]

Compression-only CPR results in more compressions per minute than standard CPR and can
be started more rapidly, but the quality of the
compressions may be inferior, as reported in a
study involving mannequins.[12]

According to American Heart Association
(AHA) Guidelines for Emergency Cardiovascular
Care, the 2 breaths after each set of 15 chest
compression should have a duration of only 1.5 to
2 seconds per breath.[13] However, in a prospective,
randomized study involving persons not trained
in CPR, the total duration of the two ventilations
was 16 seconds on average.[14] It is very difficult
for a layperson to provide adequate ventilation.[15]
Studies have shown that both laypersons and
health workers hesitate to initiate CPR that includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation, for reasons of
health and safety.[16,17] According to a recent observational cohort study, the more time the rescuers spend on chest compressions, the better the
chances of survival.[18]

Our study population was similar to others
with respect to age, sex, location of cardiac arrest,
and findings on electrocardiography.[19] The average EMS response time in this study was longer
than that in previous studies.[2] This may be explained by the inclusion of large rural areas in our
study, which can increase the response time.
Like Hallstrom and colleagues,[2] we found that
patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest who received compression-only CPR, as
compared with standard CPR, performed by callers who received instructions from dispatchers had
similar rates of survival. This result is further supported by the finding that the number of patients
who were admitted to the hospital alive did not
differ significantly between the two groups.
Our study has several limitations. First, 3809
patients were enrolled, but the final analysis included data from only one third of these patients
(approximately 600 patients in each of the two
groups). Thus, one limitation of the study is that
many patients who underwent randomization were
subsequently excluded from the analysis, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Because the analysis was based on fewer
patients than the number originally planned, there
was a high risk of a type II error. We initially calculated that 2213 patients were needed in each
group to detect a small absolute improvement (by
2 percentage points) in the 30-day survival rate
with 80% power (with a 20% risk of type II er

ror), and a sample of 1000 patients seemed realistic to detect an absolute difference of 3 percentage points with 78% power. Thus, although our
study did not show a significant difference in the
30-day survival rate (estimated absolute difference,
1.7 percentage points), our results are in agreement with the findings of Hallstrom and colleagues[2] and Berg and colleagues,[3] who reported
that there might be a small benefit of compression-only CPR.
Second, the dispatchers did not follow the randomization instructions in a small proportion of
cases. The reason for this protocol violation is
probably that some dispatchers had a prejudice
against compression-only CPR and a preference
for standard CPR. Also, some callers showed a
preference for a CPR technique other than that
specified by randomization.
Third, during the course of the study, the AHA
and the European Resuscitation Council changed
their CPR guidelines, giving greater emphasis to
the quality and quantity of chest compressions.
We did not implement these guidelines, because
they were not reflected in the Swedish national
guidelines until January 2007, 2 years after our
study was initiated. Furthermore, these new
guidelines did not include dispatcher-instructed
CPR.[20,21]

Finally, our finding that compression-only CPR
is not significantly better than standard CPR does
not apply to cardiac arrest caused by trauma, respiratory failure, or intoxication or to children
under the age of 8 years or patients in whom bystanders perform CPR without instructions from
dispatchers.
In conclusion, our prospective, randomized
study, which focused on patients with witnessed,
out-of-hospital, primary cardiac arrest, showed no
significant difference in survival when dispatchers gave instructions to callers to perform compression-only CPR, as compared with standard
CPR, before the arrival of EMS personnel. Overall, this study lends further support to the hypothesis that compression-only CPR, which is
easier to learn and to perform, should be considered the preferred method for CPR performed by
bystanders in patients with cardiac arrest.
