**OR WITH MOUTH-TO-MOUTH VENTILATION**

##### ABSTRACT

**_Background_** Despite extensive training of citizens
of Seattle in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
bystanders do not perform CPR in almost half of witnessed cardiac arrests. Instructions in chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation given by dispatchers over the telephone can require 2.4 minutes.
In experimental studies, chest compression alone is
associated with survival rates similar to those with
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation.
We conducted a randomized study to compare CPR
by chest compression alone with CPR by chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation.

**_Methods_** The setting of the trial was an urban, firedepartment–based, emergency-medical-care system
with central dispatching. In a randomized manner,
telephone dispatchers gave bystanders at the scene
of apparent cardiac arrest instructions in either chest
compression alone or chest compression plus mouthto-mouth ventilation. The primary end point was survival to hospital discharge.

**_Results_** Data were analyzed for 241 patients randomly assigned to receive chest compression alone
and 279 assigned to chest compression plus mouthto-mouth ventilation. Complete instructions were
delivered in 62 percent of episodes for the group receiving chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth
ventilation and 81 percent of episodes for the group
receiving chest compression alone (P=0.005). Instructions for compression required 1.4 minutes less
to complete than instructions for compression plus
mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Survival to hospital discharge was better among patients assigned to chest
compression alone than among those assigned to
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation
(14.6 percent vs. 10.4 percent), but the difference
was not statistically significant (P=0.18).

**_Conclusions_** The outcome after CPR with chest
compression alone is similar to that after chest compression with mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and chest
compression alone may be the preferred approach
for bystanders inexperienced in CPR. (N Engl J Med

LTHOUGH bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been associated with an increase of 50 percent or
more in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and despite extensive training of citizens inA
CPR techniques,[1,2] approximately half of the victims of
witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the Seattle–King County, Washington, area during the past
few decades did not receive bystander-initiated CPR.
To address this problem, investigators in King County initiated a program in which dispatchers were
taught to instruct callers in how to initiate CPR.[3,4] The
instructions included airway management, mouthto-mouth ventilation, and chest compression. The investigators reported that dispatcher-instructed CPR
by bystanders was associated with a rate of survival
to hospital discharge that was similar to the historical
experience with bystander-initiated CPR, that the
time required to provide the instructions averaged 2.4
minutes, and that the most common reason for not
completing the instructions was the arrival of emergency-medical-services personnel.
Since the average interval to a response in Seattle
was 3.1 minutes, as compared with 4.5 minutes in
the suburban communities where the King County
study was conducted, it was unclear whether implementing such a program in Seattle might simply be a
drain on dispatch-center resources. In addition, studies in animals, particularly those by Meursing et al.,[5]
demonstrated that central arterial oxygenation remains relatively high for a substantial time after the
onset of ventricular fibrillation.
In 1989 we therefore began a preliminary trial of
dispatcher-instructed bystander CPR that compared
the value of instructions for chest compression only
with that of standard instructions for chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation. After approx

**CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION BY CHEST COMPRESSION ALONE OR WITH MOUTH-TO-MOUTH VENTILATION**


imately 200 victims had been enrolled, the study was
terminated because the conditional power of rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., that chest compression
and chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation result in similar rates of survival to hospital discharge) in favor of superiority of chest compression
plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation was low. Moreover,
since the trial began, a preliminary study using a swine
model of ventricular fibrillation was published and
suggested that chest compression alone might be as
effective as chest compression plus ventilation, even
after 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation.[6] In addition, questions were being raised about the safety of
mouth-to-mouth ventilation, because of the epidemics of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and
hepatitis C.[7]
Accordingly, we initiated a new trial to test the onesided alternative hypothesis that dispatcher-instructed bystander CPR by chest compression alone would
yield an absolute increase of at least 3.5 percent (the
observed difference when the first trial was stopped)
in survival to hospital discharge over dispatcherinstructed chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth
ventilation by bystanders.

**METHODS**

Fire-department dispatchers followed a structured interrogation protocol with two basic questions: “Is the patient conscious
or awake?” and “Is the patient breathing normally?” If the answers to both of these questions were “no” or equivocal, an emergency-medical-services team was immediately dispatched and the
caller was assured that help was on the way; in addition, if there
was no one on the scene who was already performing (or intending
to perform) CPR, and if the caller was willing to be instructed,
the caller was given instructions for performing either chest compression alone or chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation (Fig. 1), as randomly assigned by a microcomputer located
at the dispatcher’s console.
Data from 776 cases randomly assigned to treatment were excluded from the analysis for the a priori reasons shown in Table
1. For all episodes, including those which met the a priori exclusion
criteria, data were collected from the microcomputers (responses
to the interrogation and randomization assignments), the paramedics’ field report, the recorded dispatch call, and the hospital
record (for patients who were admitted). At hospital discharge, a
simple assessment of neurologic morbidity was obtained (with the
patient assigned to one of the following categories: no apparent
morbidity; some impairment, but able to carry out activities of daily living; morbidity sufficient to require some, but not complete,
assistance; or morbidity requiring complete care). Information on
survival status was obtained yearly.
At the end of the study (in August 1998), all patients who had
survived to discharge from the hospital or their families were contacted, and their vital status and degree of residual morbidity were
assessed. All callers who were given instructions were telephoned
approximately one to two months after the episode and, if they consented, underwent a structured interview, including questions
about the episode, the victim, the caller, the dispatcher’s instructions, and the implementation of those instructions. In addition,
the callers were asked whether they had any physical or emotional
problems related to their participation.
As far as possible, the study was blinded. Emergency-medicalservices personnel other than those in the dispatch office were generally unaware that an episode might be part of a trial. Moreover,
the paramedics who completed the field reports typically arrived


after the first responding personnel and thus had limited knowledge of the type or quality of bystander CPR that may have been
performed. Exclusions were based on information taken directly
from the paramedics’ field reports (including cases in which there
was no cardiac arrest; cases of drug overdose, alcohol intoxication,
or carbon monoxide poisoning; cases in which advanced cardiac
life support was not carried out; and cases due to trauma) and on
information from the dispatch recording (the caller was not at the
scene, or cardiac arrest occurred after the call). Hospitalization data
and functional status after discharge from the hospital were obtained through an existing follow-up program whose personnel
were unaware of the treatment assignments.
The primary end point was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary end points included admission to the hospital and estimated neurologic status in the survivors.
The trial was designed to test the alternative one-sided hypothesis that dispatcher-instructed chest-compression CPR was associated with at least a 3.5 percent improvement in the absolute rate
of survival to hospital discharge over the rate with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation. However, only two-sided
P values are reported. Enrollment in the trial began on January
15, 1992, and continued through August 30, 1998. The projected
number of episodes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during this
period was 700. However, because of limited funding, the study
was planned for a fixed period. Monitoring of results (following
Fleming et al.[8]) was conducted three times, after approximately
150, 300, and 450 episodes had occurred. The emphasis was on
compliance and safety, and the reviewers were blinded only to the
primary outcome. The protocol was approved by the investigational review board of the University of Washington, the Seattle
Fire Department, and the legal authorities of the city of Seattle.
The primary analysis consisted of a simple comparison of proportions by Fisher’s exact test. We conducted secondary analyses
using logistic-regression analysis to adjust for characteristics of the
patients and the episodes.

**RESULTS**
Enrollment in the trial was terminated according
to the schedule on August 30, 1998, at which time
there had been 1296 randomized episodes of cardiac
arrest. Of these, 776 were excluded from the analysis
on the basis of a priori criteria, which fell mainly into
three categories: absence of cardiac arrest; cardiac arrest due to drug overdose, alcohol intoxication, or
carbon monoxide poisoning; or no provision of advanced cardiac life support (Table 1). The true cause
was determined for 249 of the 260 episodes initially
misdiagnosed as cardiac arrests; most of these were
attributed to stroke or transient ischemic attack (24.1
percent), seizure (20.9 percent), or syncope (20.5
percent) (Table 2). Of the 520 cases randomly assigned to treatment and included in the analysis, 279
were assigned to chest compression plus mouth-tomouth ventilation and 241 to chest compression alone
(P=0.10). The characteristics of the episodes and
the patients were similar in the two treatment groups
(Table 3), with the exception of race or ethnic group.
The victims averaged 68 years of age, 64 percent were
male, 58 percent of the episodes were witnessed (i.e.,
the collapse was seen or heard) and 88 percent occurred in a home. The time to response by the first
emergency vehicle averaged 4.0 minutes; all of these
units were equipped with automated defibrillators.
Data on discharge were not available for two patients who were admitted to the hospital, one in each

treatment group. A total of 64 patients survived to
discharge from the hospital: 29 (10.4 percent) in the
group receiving chest compression plus mouth-tomouth ventilation, and 35 (14.6 percent) in the group
receiving chest compression only (Table 4) (P=0.18).
The secondary end point of admission to the hospi

tal showed a similar pattern favoring chest compression alone (P=0.15).
Adjustment for characteristics of the episode (age,
sex, and race or ethnic group of the victim[9]; location
of the episode[10]; whether the episode was witnessed;
response time; coexisting conditions[11]; and the presence or absence of symptoms before the episode) by
logistic regression did not substantially change either
the estimates of effect or the significance levels for
the end points of survival to hospital discharge and
admission to the hospital. For survival to hospital discharge, the unadjusted odds ratio for the compression-plus-ventilation group as compared with the
compression-only group was 0.68 (P=0.15), and the
adjusted odds ratio was 0.75 (P=0.31), with location (odds ratio, 0.59; P<0.001), whether the arrest
was witnessed (odds ratio, 2.32; P=0.0025), and age
(odds ratio, 1.0213; P=0.02) as significant predictors. For admission to the hospital, the unadjusted
odds ratio was 0.77 (P=0.14), and the adjusted odds
ratio was 0.80 (P=0.26), with location (odds ratio,
0.69; P=0.01) and whether witnessed (odds ratio,
3.34; P<0.001) significant predictors.
During the trial, the paramedics responded to 4189
cardiac arrests, 253 respiratory arrests, and 38 possible respiratory arrests. Of these, 520 occurred after
the call for help. In 630 cases, the dispatchers did not
attempt a diagnosis, usually because it was a relayed
call or the patient was in an inaccessible location; in
another 155, it was not possible to determine the
dispatcher’s diagnosis. Of the remaining 3175 cardiac arrests, the dispatchers correctly identified 2749
and failed to recognize 426 (13.4 percent), typically
because of insufficient information.
Data from 227 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment for possible cardiac arrest were

pression only, and 2 given instructions only to move
the patient to the floor) reported adverse effects on
themselves. These were not serious, ranging from “out
of breath” to “vomit from patient.” Similarly, few of
the bystanders reported adverse effects of dispatcher-instructed CPR on the patients (7 of those given
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation
and 10 of those given chest compression only). These
included “patient vomited after breaths” to “sound
of rib crack as chest compressions done.”
The compliance of the dispatchers — that is, strict
adherence to the written dispatch protocol — was
generally above 90 percent for each step of the protocol, except for stating that help was on the way before pursuing the question of CPR, which had a compliance rate of only 75 percent. Ninety percent of
callers, when asked, accepted the offer of CPR instruction. In 1 percent of the cases assigned to chest
compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation, the
dispatcher mistakenly gave instructions for chest compression alone; in 2 percent of the cases assigned to
chest compression alone, the dispatcher mistakenly
gave instructions for chest compression plus mouthto-mouth ventilation.
The instructions were completely delivered in only
62 percent of the episodes assigned to chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation, as compared with 81 percent of the episodes assigned to
chest compression alone (P=0.005). The arrival of
emergency-medical-services personnel was the primary reason instruction was not completed, accounting for 58 instances of incomplete instructions among
the 279 cases (20.8 percent) in the group assigned
to chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation and 19 among the 241 cases (7.9 percent) in the
group assigned to chest compression. In 5 percent
of the episodes in both groups, the arrival of a bystander trained in CPR terminated the instructions.
Callers receiving instructions in chest compression
plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation were more likely to
terminate them by hanging up or declaring them too
difficult than were callers receiving instructions in
chest compression alone (7.2 percent vs. 2.9 percent).
The inadequacy of the protocol was responsible for
91 percent of the nonarrests diagnosed as arrests,
and dispatcher error for only 9 percent; however, dispatcher error was responsible for 70 percent of the
cardiac arrests that were diagnosed as nonarrests, and
protocol inadequacy for only 4 percent.

**DISCUSSION**
These data demonstrate that a strategy of dispatcher-instructed chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth
ventilation was no better than a strategy of dispatcherinstructed chest compression alone in Seattle, where
there is a two-tier system with relatively short response
times and a tightly structured dispatch protocol. Although the differences were not statistically signifi

cant, the rates of survival to hospital discharge were
higher with chest compression alone than with chest
compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation (29
percent higher) as was the rate of admission to the
hospital (15 percent higher). The estimated effect of
the type of instruction was not changed by adjustment for base-line characteristics of patients and emergency medical services.
Since this trial was operationally identical to the
preliminary trial described in the Introduction, it is
appropriate to examine the combined data from the
two studies. Of 400 patients randomly assigned to
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation,
134 (33.5 percent) were admitted to the hospital, as
compared with 141 of 352 (40.1 percent) randomly
assigned to chest compression alone (P=0.07). Over
the course of both trials, 91 patients are known to
have survived to discharge from the hospital — 44 of
399 (11.0 percent) assigned to chest compression plus
mouth-to-mouth ventilation and 47 of 351 (13.4 percent) assigned to chest compression alone (P=0.37).
Their vital status and degree of residual morbidity at
the end of the study (after an average of 2.4 years of
follow-up) are summarized in Table 5.
A limitation of this study is that we did not follow
a strict intention-to-treat analysis. This was the case
because data from many patients who were randomly
assigned to treatment were excluded from the analysis for a priori reasons. With out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, it would not be appropriate to have dispatchers
take the time to ask for information about all exclusion criteria before implementing the protocol. The
exclusions are critical for two reasons. First, including data in the analysis on patients who did not have
cardiac arrest would artifactually increase the survival
rate, since most of these patients survived. Similarly,
most patients with drug overdoses, alcohol intoxication, or carbon monoxide poisoning were resuscitated after respiratory arrest and hence were also survivors. Second, if patients who received no advanced
cardiac life support (from whom CPR was withheld
because it was considered futile or for some other
reason) were included, the effect would be to reduce
the survival rate, since all such patients died. The reasons for exclusion did not differ significantly between
the treatment groups (Table 1).
An additional limitation of this study is that the
true worth of providing CPR instructions before the
arrival of emergency medical services has not been established. However, the prevailing opinion at this time
is that bystander-initiated CPR is a highly effective aid
to resuscitation from cardiac arrest.[2] Moreover, a difference in survival rates for episodes of ventricular fibrillation that were entered in the study as compared
with those not entered (24 percent vs. 29 percent) was
explained by differences in the characteristics of the
episodes (84 percent vs. 47 percent occurred at home,
and the victims averaged 69 vs. 66 years of age). The

risks and costs of providing CPR instructions before
the arrival of emergency medical services are minimal, and the benefits are at least probable.
In considering the relative advantages of providing instructions for chest compression plus mouthto-mouth ventilation or for chest compression alone
before the arrival of emergency medical services, several features of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest warrant
consideration. First, the instructions are provided primarily to bystanders who have had little or no CPR
training. Instructions for performing ventilation are
time-consuming and difficult to carry out, whereas
instructions for performing chest compression are
relatively simple. Second, it is assumed that experienced personnel will soon be on the scene. In addition, cardiac arrest due to primary ventilatory failure is
much less common than arrest due to cardiac causes,
except in children and in cases of drug overdose, alcohol intoxication, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
Thus, if the latter conditions are excluded, giving instructions for chest compression would appear to be
more useful than attempting to deliver the more complex and perhaps unnecessary additional instructions
for ventilation. It is possible, however, that simple instructions for opening the upper airway could be added to the chest-compression message. It is relevant to
note that in this study, the survival of patients with apparent drug overdoses, alcohol intoxication, or carbon
monoxide poisoning was similar in the two treatment
groups (80.7 percent of those receiving chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation and 75.7
percent of those receiving chest compression alone).
The question of whether dispatchers might be able
to distinguish which cases should receive instructions
for chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation rather than chest compression alone is interesting. In our study, patients with drug overdoses, alcohol intoxication, or carbon monoxide poisoning


were much younger than other patients (37±10 vs.
68±15 years), were less likely to have collapsed at
home (58 percent vs. 88 percent), and were much
more likely to have collapsed at another residence (38
percent vs. 5 percent).
CPR instruction of some type was given in 550
episodes of cardiac arrest, thus providing an additional 12.3 percent of all 4480 victims of cardiac arrest
with some treatment before the arrival of emergency
medical services. A somewhat unexpected benefit was
that, in an additional 207 episodes, bystanders who
had previously been trained in CPR indicated they had
performed CPR because the dispatcher had prompted them and given them a quick review.
Are the results of this study applicable to other
settings? During the almost seven years of the trial,
substantial laboratory work has been done on the issue of ventilation during CPR. This is well summarized in a special report from the Ventilation Working Group of the Basic Life Support and Pediatric Life
Support subcommittees of the American Heart Association.[12] The committee concluded that “it seems
possible that mouth-to-mouth ventilation is not needed during the first few minutes of sudden witnessed
circulatory arrest . . . and may, in fact, have . . .
potential disadvantages, including gastric insufflation
and less cycle time spent on effective chest compressions.” The committee did not recommend that the
guidelines be changed, largely out of concern for the
usefulness of ventilation for arrests due to primary
respiratory causes. Given the committee’s appraisal
and the results of this trial, we believe chest-compression CPR may be applicable to the more general
setting of bystander-initiated CPR.
