Abstr act


**Background**
The role of rescue breathing in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed by
a layperson is uncertain. We hypothesized that the dispatcher instructions to bystanders to provide chest compression alone would result in improved survival as
compared with instructions to provide chest compression plus rescue breathing.

**Methods**
We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial of dispatcher instructions to bystanders
for performing CPR. The patients were persons 18 years of age or older with out-ofhospital cardiac arrest for whom dispatchers initiated CPR instruction to bystanders.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive chest compression alone or chest compression plus rescue breathing. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included a favorable neurologic outcome at discharge.

**Results**
Of the 1941 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 981 were randomly assigned to
receive chest compression alone and 960 to receive chest compression plus rescue
breathing. We observed no significant difference between the two groups in the
proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge (12.5% with chest compression alone and 11.0% with chest compression plus rescue breathing, P = 0.31)
or in the proportion who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome in the two
sites that assessed this secondary outcome (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively; P = 0.13).
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed a trend toward a higher proportion of patients surviving to hospital discharge with chest compression alone as compared
with chest compression plus rescue breathing for patients with a cardiac cause of
arrest (15.5% vs. 12.3%, P = 0.09) and for those with shockable rhythms (31.9% vs.
25.7%, P = 0.09).

**Conclusions**
Dispatcher instruction consisting of chest compression alone did not increase the
survival rate overall, although there was a trend toward better outcomes in key clinical subgroups. The results support a strategy for CPR performed by laypersons that
emphasizes chest compression and minimizes the role of rescue breathing. (Funded

ut-of-hospital cardiac arrest
claims hundreds of thousands of lives
each year worldwide.[1,2] Successful resus
# Ocitation is challenging but achievable, requiring

an interdependent set of actions that consist of
early arrest recognition, early cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation, expert
advanced life support, and timely postresuscitation care.[3]

Early initiation of CPR by a layperson can increase the patient’s chances of surviving and having a favorable long-term neurologic recovery.[4,5]
CPR performed by a layperson has traditionally
consisted of chest compressions interspersed with
rescue breathing, which allows some measure of
both circulation and oxygenation.[6] Interest in
CPR that focuses on chest compressions and
minimizes or eliminates rescue breathing is increasing.[7] Chest compression alone may be more
acceptable to some laypersons and has the potential physiological advantage of fewer compression interruptions, so that circulation is increased, as compared with traditional CPR, although at a possible cost to oxygenation.[8,9]

Studies in animal models that involve a primary cardiac cause of arrest and simulate challenges to laypersons performing CPR have shown
increased circulation and improved survival with
chest compression alone.[10,11] In contrast, results
in animal models of arrest due to respiratory
causes suggest that chest compression plus rescue breathing may be more beneficial.[12]

Cardiac arrest in humans is a heterogeneous
condition. Although a primary cardiac cause is
the most common mechanism of arrest, respiratory and mixed mechanisms are important contributing factors.[13-15] The pathophysiology of each
arrest is dynamic, and the relative importance of
oxygenation may depend on the time-dependent
phase of the arrest.[16] In observational studies of
bystander-initiated CPR, the two CPR approaches led to similar survival rates, although interpretation of these findings is limited by potential confounding.[14,15,17] In the only randomized
trial comparing these two types of bystander
CPR, there was no significant difference in survival between the two groups, although the observed survival difference between patients randomly assigned to chest compression alone and
those randomly assigned to compression plus rescue breathing (14.6% vs. 10.4%) is clinically rel

evant.[18] This trial was conducted in a community
with a very quick response by emergency medical services (EMS), and the study’s main analysis
was restricted to patients with a primary cardiac
cause of arrest — characteristics that potentially
favor the physiological effects of chest compression alone.
To help determine the best approach to bystander CPR, we undertook a randomized trial of
dispatcher-assisted CPR to compare outcomes
when instructions consisted of chest compression
alone with outcomes when instructions consisted of chest compression plus rescue breathing.
We hypothesized that instruction consisting of
chest compression alone would result in higher
survival rates than instruction consisting of chest
compression plus rescue breathing.


Methods


**Study Design, Population, and Setting**
The Dispatcher-Assisted Resuscitation Trial (DART)
was a randomized trial of dispatcher-assisted CPR
instruction. The study was approved by the appropriate review boards, and patients were enrolled without consent being obtained, although
survivors were later informed that they had been
enrolled in a clinical investigation of CPR.
The study considered consecutive calls by bystanders to the 911 system for patients in cardiac
arrest. Patients were initially eligible if the dispatcher determined that they were unconscious
and not breathing normally and that bystander
CPR was not under way. If the caller was willing
to undertake CPR with the dispatcher’s assistance,
a randomization envelope containing CPR instructions was opened. Dispatchers attempted to
exclude patients with arrest due to trauma,
drowning, or asphyxiation (from choking, strangulation, or suffocation), as well as patients who
were under 18 years of age; and those who had
do-not-resuscitate status or were already receiving
CPR. Final eligibility required postrandomization
exclusion and was restricted to patients who received basic and advanced arrest care from EMS

personnel. Thus, we excluded persons who were
unconscious and not breathing normally but who
were deemed not to be in arrest and persons who
had had a confirmed arrest but were found to
have signs of irreversible death, in which case
EMS personnel did not attempt resuscitation.[19]

King County EMS (in Washington State), Thurston County EMS (in Washington State), and London Ambulance Service (in England) participated
in the trial. At all three sites, callers use a common emergency number to speak with civilian
employee dispatchers. King and Thurston Counties are served by a two-tiered EMS system in
which personnel follow the core resuscitation
strategy detailed by the American Heart Association guidelines. London is served by a single-tier
EMS system in which personnel follow the United
Kingdom Resuscitation Council Guidelines. Because of differences in enrollment rates and time
required for review processes, enrollment took
place from June 1, 2004, through April 15, 2009,
in King County; from June 1, 2005, through April
15, 2009, in Thurston County; and from January 1,
2005, through March 15, 2008, in London.

**Intervention**
On determining patients’ initial eligibility, dispatchers enrolled and randomly assigned each patient to one of the two CPR strategies by opening
an opaque, sequentially numbered envelope to determine which instructions to give the bystander.
Randomization was stratified by dispatch center
and blocked in sets of 10. The bystander was then
instructed to perform either chest compressions
alone, providing 50 consecutive compressions (one
cycle), or chest compressions plus rescue breathing, with 2 initial rescue breaths followed by 15
chest compressions and subsequent cycles continuing the pattern in a ratio of 2 to 15 (see Fig. 1
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the
full text of this article at NEJM.org). With the dispatcher still on the telephone, the bystander then
performed one cycle of CPR during which the dispatcher asked the bystander to count the chest
compressions out loud. After the first cycle, the
dispatcher could inquire about signs of life and,
if warranted, encourage the bystander to continue CPR.

**Outcomes**
The primary outcome was survival to hospital
discharge. Secondary outcomes were a return of
spontaneous circulation at the end of EMS care


and a favorable neurologic status at the time of
hospital discharge, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1 or 2. (There are five
CPC categories; category 1 represents good cerebral performance, 2 moderate cerebral disability,
3 severe cerebral disability, 4 coma or vegetative
state, and 5 death.[20,21])

**Data Collection and Definitions**
Dispatch, EMS, and hospital information was reviewed with the use of a uniform data-abstraction
form.[21] The review of EMS and hospital information was done without knowledge of patients’ randomization status. Step-by-step progress in the
provision of instructions and the initiation of
chest compressions by the bystander was determined by a review of the dispatch audiotape.

**Statistical Analysis**
The trial was designed to detect an absolute difference of 3.5 percentage points in the survival
rates between the two study groups, with the use
of a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a power of
80%. To compare the distribution of characteristics and outcomes for the two types of CPR instruction, we used the chi-square statistic for categorical variables and the independent-samples
t-test or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test
for continuous variables. Primary comparisons
were performed according to randomization status. We also performed an efficacy analysis restricted to cases in which bystander CPR progressed to chest compression as a consequence
of dispatcher instructions. Because one site was
unable to assess neurologic status at discharge,
we present the overall results as well as results
restricted to the two sites that were able to ascertain neurologic status.
We conducted four prespecified subgroup analy­
ses designed to examine the physiological mechanisms of the intervention as well as to provide
a context for interpreting the results in relation
to other investigations. The subgroup analyses
stratified outcomes according to the underlying
cause of arrest, presenting arrest rhythm, witness
status, and EMS response interval among witnessed arrests (≤6 minutes vs. >6 minutes). No
other subgroup analyses were performed. We used
the Breslow–Day test for homogeneity to determine whether the intervention differed according
to subgroup status. Statistical analyses were completed with the use of SPSS software, version 18.0
(SPSS).

Results


**Patients, Arrests, and Progression of CPR**
**Instructions**

During the course of the trial, 5525 randomization
envelopes were opened for patients presumed to be
in cardiac arrest. Of these patients, 1941 (35%) met
the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). The two most common reasons for exclusion were that EMS personnel found the patient to be alive without arrest or
to have signs of irreversible death (in which case
resuscitation by EMS was not attempted). The distribution of exclusions in the two groups was similar according to randomization status.


Among the 1941 eligible patients, approximately 70% had arrests with a cardiac cause, less
than half the arrests were witnessed, and nearly
a third had a shockable rhythm. The average
EMS response time from dispatch to arrival at the
scene was 6.5 minutes. Patients, circumstance,
EMS response, and presenting rhythm characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1).
Patients randomly assigned to instructions for
the bystander to perform chest compression
alone were more likely to undergo bystanderperformed chest compression (80.5% vs. 72.7%,
P<0.001) (Table 2).

**Survival to Discharge**
Survival to hospital discharge could not be ascertained for seven subjects (0.4%), three randomly
assigned to chest compression alone and four to
chest compression plus rescue breathing. We ob

- Overall crossover between the assigned instructions occurred in 42 of 1941 cases (2.2%). Crossover from chest compression plus rescue breathing to chest compression alone was more common than was crossover from chest compression alone to chest compression plus rescue breathing (3.5% [34 of 960] vs. 0.8% [8 of 981]).

served no significant difference in the proportion of patients surviving to hospital discharge
according to randomization status (12.5% for instructions to perform chest compression alone and
11.0% for instructions to perform chest compression plus rescue breathing, P = 0.31) or the
proportion surviving to discharge with a favorable neurologic status (14.4% for chest compression alone and 11.5% for chest compression plus
rescue breathing, P = 0.13) (Table 3).

**Subgroup Analyses**
The Breslow–Day test showed some evidence that
the effect of the two sets of CPR instructions on
outcomes differed according to the underlying
cause of arrest (P = 0.007 for return of pulse,
P = 0.10 for survival to discharge, and P = 0.06 for
survival with a favorable neurologic status) and
presenting arrest rhythm (P = 0.14, P = 0.09, and
P = 0.20, respectively). (Tests for heterogeneity
showed no evidence that the outcome differed
according to whether the arrest was witnessed

[P>0.20].) For example, among patients whose
arrest had a cardiac cause, there was a trend toward an increased proportion of patients surviving to hospital discharge (15.5%, vs. 12.3% for
patients with other causes of arrest; P = 0.09) and
an increased proportion surviving with a favorable
neurologic status at discharge (18.9% vs. 13.5%,


P = 0.03) with chest compression alone (Table 4).
The survival rate among patients with a noncardiac cause of arrest was 5.0% with instructions
to perform chest compression alone, as compared
with 7.2% with instructions to perform chest compression plus rescue breathing (P = 0.29).
In efficacy analyses restricted to patients for
whom the intervention progressed to chest compression, the magnitude of outcome differences
potentially favoring chest compression alone was
typically larger than that observed in the effectiveness analyses (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).


In this multicenter, randomized trial, CPR instructions consisting of chest compression alone did
not increase survival to hospital discharge overall, as compared with instructions consisting of
chest compression plus rescue breathing. However, the results suggest that chest compression
alone may increase survival among certain subgroups of patients — those with a cardiac cause
of arrest and those with ventricular fibrillation.
The current trial was designed to acknowledge
the heterogeneity of the arrest condition and the
potential for disparate intervention effects across
the arrest population, providing in turn the tru

est translation of the intervention effects to community-based care.[22-24] We found no significant
difference between the two types of CPR instruction with respect to the proportion of patients who
survived to hospital discharge. We did, however,
observe a consistent trend toward clinically meaningful survival differences in favor of chest compression alone over chest compression plus rescue breathing among patients whose arrest was
due to a cardiac cause (15.5% vs. 12.3%) and
among those with a shockable arrest rhythm
(31.9% vs. 25.7%). These findings in specific clinical groups are consistent with the results of investigations that have focused on the same subgroups of patients or have used corresponding
animal models.[10,11,18] One possible explanation is
that the beneficial physiological effects of continuous chest compressions outweigh the beneficial physiological effects of chest compressions
interspersed with rescue breathing.[25] Alternatively,
rescue breathing attempted by bystanders may
have no physiological effects, so the comparison
is essentially between two strategies: continuous
chest compressions and interrupted chest compressions.
We did not observe significant differences in
outcome among the patients with noncardiac
causes of arrest or nonshockable rhythms, although the proportion of patients who survived
was greater in the group randomly assigned to
chest compressions plus rescue breathing. Because
these two (nonexclusive) subgroups accounted for
14.0% (32 of 227) and 21.1% (48 of 227) of survivors, respectively, they cannot be dismissed as
clinically unimportant. One interpretation of these
results is that the type of bystander CPR does
not make a difference in these subgroups. Alternatively, one may speculate that the potential difference is consistent with the physiological understanding of rescue breathing and that the study
was underpowered to rigorously evaluate the type
of CPR in these subgroups.
Taken together, the potential differential effects of CPR with and without rescue breathing
may support a more targeted application of typespecific CPR. On the basis of data from the current study, such a tailored approach, if correctly
applied according to the cause of arrest, would
theoretically result in 156 survivors with a favorable neurologic outcome per 1000 patients, as
compared with 144 per 1000 if chest compression alone were used for all patients or 115 per

1000 if chest compression plus rescue breathing
were used for all patients. Future investigation
may consider whether straightforward, operational
etiologic surrogates can facilitate type-specific CPR
aimed at the underlying cause of arrest.
We also did not observe outcome differences
overall when we evaluated neurologic status at
discharge. This finding provides assurance that
improved resuscitation with chest compression
alone is not achieved at the cost of neurologic impairment. Indeed, there was some suggestion that
the brain may derive specific benefit, given the
increase in the magnitude of both the relative and
absolute differences favoring chest compression
alone over chest compression plus rescue breathing, as evident from the two contrasting outcomes
— survival (16.8% and 14.7%, respectively) and
survival with favorable neurologic status (14.4%
and 11.5%) (Table 3). Because CPR has a host of
effects, a brain-specific advantage related to chest
compression alone may be plausible.[26]

It is also useful to contrast the effectiveness
and efficacy results in this study. The trial was
an effectiveness study, since about one fourth of
the patients did not progress to chest compressions. Conversely, three fourths did progress to
chest compressions (the group constituting efficacy results) — a finding that underscores the
important contribution a well-trained, assertive
emergency dispatch program can make to increase
bystander CPR. The magnitude of outcome differences potentially favoring chest compression
alone was typically larger in the efficacy analysis
as compared with the effectiveness analysis (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
One interpretation is that the efficacy associations better reflect the intervention’s true physiological effects, suggesting that the potential
benefit of chest compression alone is not due simply to a greater proportion of bystanders implementing chest compressions but may be due instead to the specific physiological effects of chest
compression alone.
The current trial has limitations. The intervention randomized bystander CPR either to chest
compressions alone or to chest compressions interspersed with rescue breathing in a ratio of
2 breaths to 15 compressions. This 2:15 ratio was
the guideline specified during the first portion
of the trial. One might expect that the results
— and specifically the differences observed —
would be attenuated if the ratio had been 2:30.

Such an inference is uncertain given the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the benefit of CPR and the fixed logistic
considerations of incorporating rescue breathing.[27]
We were able to assess progress through the study
protocol, although we were not able to objectively
and quantitatively measure the core components
of the resuscitation maneuver (e.g., chest compression depth).
This investigation involved dispatcher-instructed CPR. The results do not apply to health professionals, who have a duty to respond and are more
practiced and proficient in CPR, often engaging at
a later stage of arrest physiology. Also, the results
do not necessarily apply to bystanders who have
been previously trained, are able to identify a cardiac arrest, and can provide CPR without dispatcher assistance. Nonetheless, CPR performed by
lay responders trained in compression plus rescue
breathing often falls short of the guideline standards during an actual cardiac arrest.[28]

The optimal outcome measure incorporates
both heart and brain resuscitation. Our study determined the neurologic status of survivors at
two of the three trial sites. We do not know
whether the distribution of neurologic status
differed at the third site, although those who
survived from the third site represent only about
10% of all the survivors.
Although nearly 2000 eligible patients were
enrolled, the study may still be criticized for having insufficient power to detect clinically important differences. For example, the study would
need approximately 4200 subjects to have 80%
power to demonstrate a significant difference in
survival with a favorable neurologic outcome between the group treated with chest compression
alone and the group treated with chest compression plus rescue breathing (14.4% and 11.5%, respectively).
We used a 95% confidence interval to designate
statistical significance, although multiple comparisons were performed. Thus, caution should
be exercised when interpreting the results, since

statistically significant simply by chance.[29] It is
important to note that the subgroup analyses were
all prespecified. Moreover, the pattern of results
across subgroups is consistent with the scientific
understanding of type-specific CPR mechanistic
effects, so collectively these results may strengthen the interpretation.
The study’s limitations should be balanced
against its strengths. Cardiac arrest is a major
public health challenge for which high-level evidence to guide care is lacking. Our trial was conducted in three different emergency medical systems, the intervention was randomized and was
validated through audio review, the outcomes are
clinically meaningful, and the design allowed for
capture of a comprehensive study population so
that translation of the results to the community
can be reasonably gauged.
In conclusion, this randomized trial showed
that dispatcher CPR instruction consisting of chest
compression alone did not increase survival when
compared with chest compression plus rescue
breathing overall. However, there was a consistent trend toward meaningful outcome differences
in favor of chest compression alone in key clinical subgroups (i.e., patients with a cardiac cause
of arrest and patients with shockable rhythms).
The results, viewed within the context of other
investigations, strengthen a layperson CPR strategy that emphasizes chest compression and minimizes the role of rescue breathing.
