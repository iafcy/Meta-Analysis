**Summary**
_Objective: Chest compression only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CC-CPR) without ventila-_
tion has been proposed as an alternative to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for
bystanders. However, there has been controversy regarding the relative effectiveness of both
of these techniques.
We aim to compare the outcomes of cardiac arrest patients in the cardiac arrest and resuscitation epidemiology study who either received CC-CPR, standard CPR or no bystander CPR.
_Methods: This prospective cohort study involved all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)_
patients attended to by emergency medical service (EMS) providers in a large urban centre. The
data analyses were conducted secondarily on these collected data. The technique of bystander
CPR was reported by paramedics who arrived at the scene.
_Results: From 1 October 2001 to 14 October 2004, 2428 patients were enrolled into the study._
Of these, 255 were EMS-witnessed arrests and were excluded. 1695 cases did not receive any
bystander CPR, 287 had standard CPR and 154 CC-CPR. Patient characteristics were similar
in both the standard and CC-CPR groups except for a higher incidence of residential arrests

#### Introduction

In the chain of survival concept[1,2] provision of early
bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients is important to
improve survival in sudden cardiac arrest. Survival rates for
pre-hospital cardiac arrest vary in published reports from 2%
to over 20%.[3]

Recently, chest compression only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CC-CPR) without ventilation has been proposed as
an alternative to standard CPR for bystanders.[4] Proponents
of CC-CPR argue that it overcomes bystander reluctance
to carry out mouth-to-mouth ventilation,[5—13] and is simpler to teach,[14—16] especially when giving instructions to an
untrained bystander over the phone.[17—20] It may also result
in fewer interruptions to chest compressions.[21—24] However
there has been controversy regarding the relative effectiveness of CC-CPR.[25—27]

The current International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) Advanced Cardiac Life Support Guidelines[28]

recommend that CC-CPR should be encouraged only if rescuers are unwilling to do airway or breathing manoeuvres
or are untrained in CPR and are uncertain how to do CPR.
These guidelines also recognise the need for more research
on the efficacy of CC-CPR.
In this study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of cardiac arrest patients in the cardiac arrest and resuscitation
epidemiology (CARE) study who had received either CC-CPR,
standard CPR or no bystander CPR.

#### Methods

The CARE study is a prospective, multi-phase, observational
study of all eligible out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients
in Singapore. The study period was from 1 October 2001 to
14 October 2004.
Singapore is a city—state with a land area of 682.3 km[2]

and a population of 4.1 million.[29,30] The population is multiracial with the major ethnic groups being Chinese, Malay
and Indian. The island’s emergency medical services (EMS)
system is run by the Singapore civil defence force (SCDF)
which currently operates 32 ambulances based in 15 fire stations and 14 satellite stations in a single tier system. Private
ambulance operators do not convey emergency cases. Emergency ambulance patients are delivered to the six major
public hospitals in the country that are equipped with modern emergency departments (EDs).
Singapore EMS is activated by a universal, centralised
and enhanced ‘995’ dispatching system run by the SCDF and
which utilises computer aided dispatch, medical dispatch


protocols, global positioning satellite (GPS) automatic vehicle locating systems and road traffic monitoring systems.
However, during the study period, no dispatcher CPR instructions were being given.
Since 1996, ambulances in Singapore have been manned
by specially trained paramedics (roughly equivalent to North
American EMT-I). The paramedics undergo an 18-month
training session which includes theory, hospital and ambulance attachments. They are able to provide basic life
support (BLS) and defibrillation with automated external
defibrillators (AED). They are able to give medications such
as salbutamol, nitroglycerin, diazepam, aspirin, intravenous
adrenaline, dextrose and saline infusions. They can also perform laryngeal mask airway insertion in cases of cardiac
arrest.
The CARE study group includes representatives from the
six major public hospitals in Singapore, the SCDF, Health
Sciences Authority and the Clinical Trials and Epidemiology Research Unit, Ministry of Health, Singapore. The CARE
phase I study described OHCA epidemiology in Singapore[31]

and found survival from OHCA, in Singapore, to be 2.0%.
Mean (S.D.) EMS response time was 10.2 (4.3) min. Mean
(S.D.) time from call to defibrillation was 16.7 (7.2) min.
Patients of all ages were included. Exclusion criteria were
those ‘obviously dead’ as defined by the presence of decomposition, rigor mortis or dependent lividity.
Patient characteristics (age, gender, race, past medical history), cardiac arrest circumstances (arrest location,
whether witnessed, bystander CPR, whether chest compressions only, ventilation only or both were given,
pre-hospital defibrillation, adrenaline (epinephrine) given),
ECG rhythms, EMS response times and outcomes were
prospectively recorded in a standard report compiled by EMS
and EDs according to the Utstein style. Observations on the
type of bystander CPR performed were based on prospective eyewitness reporting by the paramedics arriving at the
scene. Paramedics would record whether they witnessed any
ongoing bystander CPR, whether chest compressions only
were given, ventilation only or both chest compressions
and ventilation. However, there was no documentation on
whether the rate of chest compressions by either observed
method was in keeping with the recommended compression rates of 80 min[−][1] or 15:2 compressions: ventilations, as
the case may be. These bystander CPR data were included
with the mandatory data required from paramedics filling
in their ambulance run reports, which needed to be submitted immediately on transferring care of the patient to
the ED. ECG recordings were captured using the LIFEPAK
12 (Medtronic, Redmond, WA) and code summary printouts
were subsequently verified by the study physician reviewers.
EMS timings were automatically recorded by the comput

erised central dispatch system and ambulance AEDs. All
watches and AEDs were synchronised with the central dispatch clock at the beginning of each shift. Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained from all participating
institutions.
The primary outcome measure for the study was survival to hospital discharge, which was defined as the
patient leaving the hospital alive or survival to 30 days
post-cardiac arrest, whichever came first. Outcomes were
obtained by hospital chart review or patient assessment
by physicians in the study team. Functional assessment of
survivors was performed by reviewing physicians using standardised cerebral performance category (CPC) and overall
performance category (OPC) scores according to Utstein
guidelines.
Data management was carried out using the Clintrial
application software, version 4.2. All data analyses were
performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL),
presenting descriptive statistics and frequencies. The comparison between mean scene times for the various groups
was made using a t-test. The comparison between groups
for the binary variables ‘survival to discharge from hospital’ and ‘return of spontaneous circulation’ was made using
logistic regression and expressed in terms of the odds ratio
(OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI): an
OR > 1 indicating an advantage.

#### Results

From 1 October 2001 to 14 October 2004, 2428 patients were
enrolled into the study (Figure 1). Of these, 255 were EMSwitnessed arrests and were excluded. 1695 cases did not
receive any bystander CPR while 478 received bystander
CPR. Of these, 287 had standard CPR (ventilation and chest
compression) and 154 had chest compression only.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients who
received any bystander CPR compared to no bystander CPR.
There was a slightly higher incidence of younger patients,
more males, fewer residential arrests, more witnessed

arrests, initial ventricular fibrillation and pre-hospital defibrillation in those who received bystander CPR. Univariate
analysis showed there were significantly more survivors
to discharge with bystander CPR (2.7% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.01)
and more survivors to admission (10.0% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.03)
although there was no significant difference in return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (17.4% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.18).

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the patients who
received chest compression only compared to standard CPR.
Characteristics such as age, race, whether witnessed by
bystander, initial rhythm, EMS response times and prehospital defibrillation were similar in both groups. There
was a higher incidence of residential arrests and previous
heart disease in those who received CC-CPR compared to
standard CPR. Univariate analysis showed there was no significant difference in survival to discharge (2.6% vs. 2.8%,
_p = 1.00), survival to admission (7.8% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.79) or_
ROSC (17.5% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.98).

Table 3 shows the subgroup analysis for study outcomes,
comparing those who had no bystander CPR, standard
CPR and chest compression only. The results are stratified by cause of arrest, presenting rhythm and response
time. Patients who received standard CPR (OR 5.4, 95%
CI 2.1—14.0) or CC-CPR (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.5—16.4) were
more likely to survive to discharge than those who had no
bystander CPR. There was no significant difference in survival to discharge between those who received CC-CPR and
standard CPR (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.3—3.1).
Regarding factors associated with survival to discharge among patients receiving bystander CPR (Figure 2),
increased age was marginally associated with a higher risk of
death (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94—1.00) but CC-CPR did
not have any significant association with survival (adjusted
OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.35—4.94). Also, CC-CPR did not have any
significant association with ROSC (adjusted OR 1.02, 95% CI
0.60—1.73).
Comparing the rates of ROSC and survival to discharge
for CC-CPR and standard CPR stratified by initial rhythm,
there appeared to be a higher rate of ROSC in the CC-CPR
group in those with ventricular fibrillation or ventricular
tachycardia, adjusted OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.0—5.4). However
the difference in survival to discharge was not statistically
significant, adjusted OR 1.5 (95% CI 0.3—7.0).

Table 4 shows the cerebral performance category and
overall performance category of patients in the CC-CPR and
standard CPR groups. Although there was a slightly higher
proportion of patients with CPC 1 in the standard CPR group

#### Discussion

In this study, we found that patients who had received any
form of bystander CPR had higher survival to discharge than
those who did not have bystander CPR. However, there was
no difference in survival to discharge between CC-CPR and
standard CPR.
These results reinforce the importance of bystander CPR,
which has also been demonstrated in previous studies.[32,33]

Our study also appears to lend support to the relative importance of chest compressions compared to ventilations in
the initial period after cardiac arrest. Previous observational studies have also noted that bystander CC-CPR does
not seem to have poorer outcomes compared to standard


CPR.[4,25,27,34] However we note that our number of survivors
was too small to meaningfully analyse differences in postarrest CPC/OPC, although at first glance, they do not appear
very different.
There is some evidence from swine models of cardiac
arrest to suggest that ventilation may not be essential in
the initial 12 min of resuscitation.[23,35] However, when the
animal model was simulated with an obstructed airway, as
might often be the case in real life cardiac arrest, arterial
blood was completely desaturated within 2 min.[36] Also, in
a human model of cardiac arrest, passive ventilation during
CC-CPR was limited in its ability to maintain adequate gas
exchange.[26]

A more important factor is likely to be the problem of
interruption of chest compressions with conventional CPR,
resulting in less cycle time on chest compression and lower
coronary perfusion pressures.[21—24] It is likely that patients
receiving CC-CPR would have had more cycle time receiving

chest compressions with the interruption for ventilation. In
this study, bystander CPR would have been mostly in line
with the ILCOR 2000 guidelines of 5:1 (two rescuers) or
15:2 (one rescuer) ratios of compressions: ventilations.[37] It
remains to be seen whether these assumptions would still
hold true with the advent of the new 2005 CPR guidelines,[28]

which advocate a higher ratio of compressions to ventilations (30:2).
Limitations of this study include the fact that it was not a
randomised controlled trial. However, characteristics of the
CC-CPR and standard CPR groups were mostly similar and
statistical adjustment was applied for any differences. Accuracy of reporting by paramedics of the type of bystander
CPR being performed might also have been affected by the
urgency of the situation at scene, which would likely be
chaotic. However, we note that such data was collected
based on immediate recall of the paramedics involved, not
based on delayed recall.


Another limitation was that the quality of bystander
CPR was largely unassessed, and it is difficult to make
any definite conclusions based only on the observations
of the arriving EMS crews. This limitation is significant,
especially considering that the rates of continuous chest
compressions performed may have been far below those recommended by Ewy and co-workers.[38] The findings of this
study cannot be taken to presume agreement with the proponents of cardio-cerebral resuscitation who recommend
such continuous compressions at the rate of 100 min[−][1] without ventilation. It could well be that less than optimal CPR
is reported as ‘chest compressions and ventilation’, leading
to an unfair comparison between chest compression only
CPR (which may also have been very slow) and ‘standard’
CPR, resulting in no difference in either method. There is
a need for good, prospective, randomised controlled trials
comparing outcomes with continuous chest compressions at
100 min[−][1] vs. CPR at 30:2 (presuming these compressions

are also at 100 min[−][1]). Only trials such as this will adequately address the issue of the value (positive or negative)
of ventilations interposed in between compressions.
We note the relatively low survival rates in this study,
which were consistent with previously reported survival in
our city.[39] It is comparable to survival rates in other large
cities[40] and may be related to factors such as problems
with multistorey building access, delayed response times
and bystander CPR rates. However, the low survival might
also indicate a general low quality of bystander CPR, which
unfortunately, is an untested hypothesis.
Finally, there may have been some variation in the postresuscitation care received at the various hospitals, as this is
difficult to quantify. Therapeutic hypothermia was not being
used in any of the hospitals during the study period.


#### Conclusion

In this study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we found
that patients were more likely to survive with any form of
bystander CPR than without. There was no difference in survival to discharge between CC-CPR and standard CPR. This
provides additional evidence for the importance of chest
compressions, whether with or without ventilation.
