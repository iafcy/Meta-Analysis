Background: The importance of ventilations after cardiac 
arrest has been much debated recently and eliminating mouth- 
to-mouth ventilations for bystanders has been suggested as a 
means to increase bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR). Standard basic life support (S-BLS) is not documented 
to be superior to continuous chest compressions (CCC). 
Methods: Retrospective, observational study of all non- 
traumatic cardiac arrest patients older than 18 years 
between May 2003 and December 2006 treated by the 
in 
community-run emergency medical 
Oslo. Outcome for patients receiving S-BLS was compared 
with patients receiving CCC. All Utstein characteristics 
were registered for both patient groups as well as for 
patients not receiving any bystander CPR by reviewing 
Ambulance run sheets, Utstein forms and hospital records. 
Method of bystander CPR as well as dispatcher instruction 
was registered by ﬁrst-arriving ambulance personnel. 
Results: Six-hundred ninety-ﬁve out of 809 cardiac arrests 
in our EMS were included in this study. Two-hundred 

eighty-one (40%) received S-CPR and 145 (21%) received 
CCC. There were no differences in outcome between the 
two patient groups, with 35 (13%) discharged with a 
favourable outcome for the S-BLS group and 15 (10%) in 
the CCC group (P 5 0.859). Similarly, there was no differ- 
ence in survival subgroup analysis of patients presenting 
with initial ventricular ﬁbrillation/ventricular tachycardia 
after witnessed arrest, with 32 (29%) and 10 (28%) patients 
discharged from hospital in the S-BLS and CCC groups, 
respectively (P 5 0.972). 
Conclusions: Patients receiving CCC from bystanders did 
not have a worse outcome than patients receiving standard 
CPR, even with a tendency towards a higher distribution of 
known negative predictive features.

increases survival after 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.1–3 The rate of bystan- 
der CPR varies considerably (14–53%),3–8 and in- 
creasing the rate of bystander CPR is considered to 
be important to strengthen the chain of survival. 
Studies exploring bystander reluctance to give CPR 
have identiﬁed unwillingness to perform mouth- 
to-mouth ventilations as a major obstacle.9,10 
The importance of ventilations is being debated 
considerably in resuscitation science at present,

with more emphasis on chest compressions and a 
subsequent decrease in ventilations delivered per 
minute.11,12 
In a randomised study of telephone-instructed 
CPR in Seattle, survival tended to be higher with 
instructions in chest compressions only vs. stan- 
dard basic life support (S-BLS), 14.6% vs. 10.4%, 
P 5 0.18.13 In a recent large prospective, observa- 
tional study in Japan,14 there was no signiﬁcant 
difference in 30-day survival with good neurologi- 
cal outcome, 6% with chest compressions only vs. 
4% for standard BLS (P 5 0.146), but higher survi- 
val with chest compressions only for the subgroup 
with ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF) or ventricular 
tachycardia (VT) as initial rhythm (19% vs. 11%, 
P 5 0.041). An accompanying editorial called for 
urgent changes in the current guidelines, advocat- 
ing continuous chest compressions (CCC) as the 
preferred method for bystander CPR in patients 
who suddenly collapse.15 
Any scientiﬁc process developing new treatment 
guidelines should rely on as many independent 
studies as possible to support changes in treatment 
protocols. The aim of this study is therefore to test 
the reproducibility of earlier published data,13,14 
suggesting that CCC are at least as effective as 
standard CPR for bystanders. 

Description of emergency medical service (EMS) 
The city of Oslo has a one-tiered centralised com- 
munity-run EMS system for a population of 540,000. 
On weekdays, between 7 : 30 and 22 : 00 hours, a 
physician-manned ambulance staffed by two para- 
medics and an anaesthesiologist functions on the 
same level as the regular paramedic-staffed ambu- 
lances. The 2005 ERC guidelines were implemented 
in January 2006. Before this, 2000 ERC guidelines 
were followed modiﬁed with 3 min of CPR before 
the ﬁrst deﬁbrillation attempt. Endotracheal intu- 
bation was the standard method for securing the 
airways, with uninterrupted chest compressions 
and 12 ventilations/min thereafter. 
Nurses and paramedics staff the dispatch centre. 
A maximum of two operators are involved, with a 
median interval for dispatch call processing of 
2.6 min.16 Telephone CPR instruction with chest 
compressions only was offered to callers. Because 
of an ongoing randomised study of the effect 
of intravenous (i.v.) access and drugs in the Oslo 
EMS, some of our included patients are also in- 
cluded in this study registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT00121524). Less than half of the patients will 
therefore be expected to have received i.v. drugs 
during resuscitation. 
Study design and recruitment 
All patients older than 18 years suffering from non- 
traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of all 
causes from May 2003 through 2006 were studied 
retrospectively. Upon arrival, ambulance personnel 
assessed whether bystander CPR was given, and if 
so, which method was used and whether the 
bystanders had received dispatcher CPR assis- 
tance. Locally adapted Utstein-style forms17 (with 
information on type of bystander CPR upon arrival 
of ﬁrst ambulance), dispatcher recordings and 

ambulance and hospital records are routinely col- 
lected and reviewed at The National Competence 
Centre for Emergency Medicine (Ulleva˚l Univer- 
sity Hospital, Oslo, Norway). 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical calculations were performed using a 
spreadsheet programme (Excel 2002, Microsoft 
Corp., Redmond, WA) and a statistical software 
package (SPSS 14.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Values 
are given as means with standard deviations, ex- 
cept for response times given as medians with 95% 
conﬁdence intervals (CIs). CIs for medians were 
calculated using normal approximation described 
by Altman.18 Differences between the two groups 
were analysed using Students t-tests for continuous 
data and w2 with continuity correction for catego- 
rical data. P-values o0.05 were considered to be 
signiﬁcant. 
Prognostic factors found to be signiﬁcant 
in 
preliminary univariate and bivariate analyses 
were included in a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis together with the BLS method (dependent 
variable, discharged from hospital alive). The re- 
sults from the multivariate logistic regression ana- 
lysis were reported as adjusted odds ratios with 
95% CIs and P-values. 

Between May 2003 and 2006, there were 809 cardiac 
arrests treated by our EMS. Ninety-three (11%) 
were ambulance witnessed, 15 (2%) were only 
given mouth-to-mouth ventilations by bystanders 
and for six cases information on bystander CPR 
was missing. Six-hundred ninty-ﬁve patients were 
subsequently included in our study, with 281 (40%) 
receiving S-BLS, 145 (21%) receiving CCC and 269 
(39%) receiving no BLS. (Fig. 1) The patient group 
receiving CCC had more arrests occurring at home 
(58% vs. 41%, P 5 0.002), less in public places (29% 
vs. 42%, P 5 0.009) and were more frequently found 
in asystole (54% vs. 43%, P 5 0.038) and less fre- 
quently found in VF/VT (33% vs. 46%, P 5 0.018) 
compared with the S-BLS group (Table 1). 
After ambulance arrival, fewer shocks were de- 
livered (median 0 vs. 1, P 5 0.019) and i.v. access 
was established less frequently (51% vs. 66%, 
P 5 0.004) in the CCC group compared with the 
S-BLS group. Adrenaline and amiodarone were 
administered more often in the S-BLS group (48% 


and 13%) compared with the CCC group (37% and 
6%) (P 5 0.050 and P 5 0.041) (Table 2). There was 
no difference in randomisation for i.v. access (vs. no 
i.v. access) before return of spontaneous circulation 
between the S-BLS and CCC groups (51% vs. 47%, 
P 5 0.476).

There were no signiﬁcant differences in outcome 
between the two patient groups. Thirty-ﬁve (13%) 
were discharged from the hospital alive in the 
S-BLS group and 15 (10%) in the CCC group 
(P 5 0.647) (Table 3), and for subgroups with wit- 
nessed arrests, 34 (18%) and 12 (14%), respectively 
(P 5 0.586), or for subgroups with initial VF/VT 
after witnessed arrest, 32 (29%) and 10 (28%) 
patients, respectively (P 5 0.972). 
The following prognostic factors were found to 
be signiﬁcant in preliminary univariate (and bivari- 
ate) analyses: gender (P 5 0.011), atropine admin- 
istration (P 5 0.000), bystander-witnessed arrest 
(P 5 0.000), shocked vs. not shocked (P 5 0.000), 
arrest occurring at home (P 5 0.007), arrest occur- 
initial VF/VT 
ring in a public place (0.018), 
(P 5 0.000), 
age 
initial 
asystole 
(P 5 0.000), response time (P 5 0.000) and time 
from arrest to advanced life support (P 5 0.001). 
Only age, response time, gender, bystander wit- 
nessed and initial VF/VT rhythm were entered into 
the regression model as the remaining variables 
reﬂect at least one of the above variables. 

The logistic analysis revealed that favourable 
outcomes (an increased likelihood of survival) 
were associated with a short response interval, 
young age, initial VF/VT and witnessed arrests.

The method of BLS (CCC only vs. S-BLS) was not 
signiﬁcant in this logistic model (Table 4). 

Our results support earlier studies suggesting that 
there are no signiﬁcant differences in outcome for 
patients receiving CCC compared with standard 
BLS from bystanders.2,13,14,19 There was no signiﬁ- 
cant difference in overall survival 
in the most 
recent Japanese study with continuous compres- 
sions vs. standard BLS (P 5 0.146), but post hoc 
subgroup analysis gave higher survival rates with 
CCC than standard BLS for witnessed out-of- 
hospital arrests with apnoea, shockable rhythms 
and short periods of untreated arrests. We found no 
such subgroup with better outcome without venti- 
lation, but the material is small and the opposite 
was not the case either.

Prognostic factors that were found to be signiﬁcant in prelimin- 
ary univariate and bivariate analyses were included in this 
multivariate logistic regression analysis to detect independent 
factors potentially affecting survival 
in the standard basic life 
support (S-BLS) group vs. continuous chest compression (CCC) 
group. 
CI, conﬁdence interval; VF/VT, ventricular ﬁbrillation/ventricular

This indicates that chest compression only is at 
least as good as standard BLS for non-traumatic out- 
of-hospital cardiac arrests in adults. Although this 
might be the case for the majority of cardiac arrest 
victims who have a sudden arrest of cardiac origin, 
we do not believe the data are sufﬁciently strong to 
advocate this approach to all cardiac arrest victims. 
There are groups of patients with asphyxia-related 
arrests such as children, victims of intoxications or 
near-drowning who at least theoretically should 
beneﬁt more from an open airway and active 
ventilation. In the city of Oslo, there are four times 
as many patients with drug overdose who require 
ventilatory assistance only than patients who re- 
quire full CPR. Mouth-to-mouth ventilation must 
not be a forgotten art. It is also a major concern that 
differentiating treatment strategies for lay people 
may result in a decreased rate of bystander CPR 
rather than an increase. Instructions to lay people 
should be kept as simple as possible, with as few 
changes as possible unless based on very solid data. 
An important argument for removing mouth-to- 
mouth ventilations is the assumption that it will 
increase the willingness of lay people to perform 
bystander CPR. This is largely deduced from ques- 
tionnaire-based studies asking people to guess how 
they might react in a hypothetical situation.20,21 It 
remains to be proven that removing mouth-to- 
mouth ventilations will increase bystander CPR. 
With the large differences in reported bystander 
involvement, it seems that other strategies might be 
effective in improving the frequency of bystander 
CPR. In Norway, the frequency has been high for 
decades, usually reported in the 40–60% range. 
Detrimental effects of compression pauses con- 
stitute most of the rationale for increased emphasis 
on chest compressions in the 2005 CPR guide- 
lines.11,12 Earlier studies2,13,14,19 as well as most of 
our own data were collected while the old guide- 
lines were in effect. We question whether the 
guidelines should be changed again until we 
have more information with the current 30 : 2 com- 
pression-to-ventilation ratio and from areas with 
better overall survival than the Japanese study14 
and longer response intervals than typically reported 
from King County, Washington.13 
Hallstrom et al. documented that dispatchers 
spent 2.4 min instructing bystanders to give stan- 
dard BLS, and that bystanders receiving such in- 
structions were more likely to not complete their 
instructions compared with bystanders instructed to 
give chest compressions only. Arrival of EMS per- 
sonnel before completion of dispatch instructions 

and declaring the CPR instructions too difﬁcult 
were more than twice as common in the standard 
BLS group.13 These are compelling arguments sug- 
gesting dispatchers limit their instructions to chest 
compressions for untrained bystanders. 
In the present study, the S-BLS group had sig- 
niﬁcantly more patients with witnessed arrests 
occurring in public places, with VF or VT as initial 
rhythm. Fewer bystanders in this group also re- 
ceived telephone assistance when performing CPR. 
This could be expected as it is likely that a larger 
proportion of bystanders with prior CPR training 
would start S-BLS without any dispatch assistance. 
Despite this uneven distribution of known positive 
predictors, outcome remained the same for the two 
BLS groups after factoring in these variables in a 
multivariate logistic regression model. 
Interest- 
ingly, the S-BLS group received more i.v. drugs 
than the CCC group, even though there was no 
difference in i.v. randomisation. There was also a 
tendency towards administering more shocks to 
the shocked patients in the S-BLS group. This raises 
the question of whether it is the S-BLS treatment 
itself that leads to increased need for drug and 
shock treatment or whether this is due to some 
confounding factor. One such confounder may be 
the higher incidence of cardiac arrest occurring in 
public places. Cardiac arrests in public places are 
known to a have better prognosis, and a higher 
level of ambition by ambulance personnel would 
be expected. An increased expectation by bystan- 
ders for ambulance personnel to exhaust all options 
might also be more common in a public setting. 
Although no differences could be detected in 
outcome for the S-BLS and CCC groups, even after 
applying a multivariate regression model, this was 
not a randomised trial and the results must be 
interpreted with caution. A variety of other, un- 
known confounders may inﬂuence our results, and 
prospective, randomised clinical trials are needed. 

Patients receiving CCC from bystanders had no 
worse outcome than patients receiving standard 
CPR, even with a tendency towards a worse distri- 
bution of several known negative predictive features.
