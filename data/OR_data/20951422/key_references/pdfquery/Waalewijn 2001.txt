The objective of this study was to analyze the functioning of the ﬁrst two links of the chain of survival: ‘access’ and ‘basic 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)’. In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by 
emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for 
various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression 
model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these ﬁrst two links. 
From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112, 
but ﬁrst called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest 
(44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience, 
was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between 
basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival. 
Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative inﬂuence on outcome, nor did basic 
CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately 
the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the 
performer must be taken into account. Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus on partners of the patients, who are 
most likely witness of an arrest. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. 


O objectivo deste estudo foi analisar o funcionamento dos 2 primeiros elos da ‘‘cadeia de sobreviveˆncia’’: ‘‘pedido de ajuda’’ 
e ‘‘suporte ba´sico de vida’’ (SBV). Num estudo prospectivo registaram-se todas as paragens cardio-respirato´ ria (PCR) consecuti-

diferenc¸as para os va´rios tipos de testemunhas, o desempenho de SBV, a qualidade do SBV, os reanimadores de SBV e os tempos 
decorridos. Desenhou-se um modelo de regressa˜o logı´stica para todos os potenciais preditores de sobrevida destes 2 elos. 
Dos 922 doentes incluı´dos, 93 tiveram alta hospitalar. Em 21% dos casos a testemunha do colapso na˜o chamou de imediato 
o 112, pediu outras ajudas e daı´ resultou atraso e pior sobrevida. Os familiares das vı´timas foram frequentemente as testemunhas 
do colapso (44%) mas raramente iniciaram SBV (11%). A sobrevida quando o SBV foi feito por pessoas na˜o treinadas e sem 
experieˆncia pre´via foi semelhante a´ das situac¸o˜ es em que na˜o foi realizado SBV (6%). Os preditores independentes de sobrevida 
identiﬁcados foram: na˜o inı´cio de SBV; atraso no inı´cio do SBV; o intervalo de tempo entre o inicio de SBV e a chegada do SEM; 
falta de experieˆncia e falta de treino em SBV. O SBV feito por pessoas treinadas muito tempo antes na˜o pareceu inﬂuenciar a

The chain of survival concept describes the actions 
necessary for an optimal chance to survive an out-of- 
hospital cardiac arrest [1]. The ﬁrst two links in the 
chain of survival: access and basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) are nearly always bystander ini- 
tiated actions and the success of resuscitation efforts by 
health care professionals are highly dependent on the 
responsibly initial bystander. This study focussed on 
the period of circulatory arrest before the arrival of 
emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. We ana- 
lyzed the actions and the quality of performance of the 
four groups most involved in the ﬁrst two links: family, 
bystanders, general practitioners and police ofﬁcers. 

.1. Emergency medical ser(cid:1)ice system 
2 
The EMS system is a one tiered system serving 1.3 
million inhabitants in the Amsterdam area of 1030 km2. 
The Netherlands has a national emergency telephone 
number 112, connected to regional dispatch centers. All 
ambulances were manned with a paramedic and a 
driver, who are trained to perform advanced CPR. 
Sometimes, 
the police were also activated after an 
emergency call for a suspected circulatory arrest. Tele- 
phone instructions for CPR were not used. 


In a prospective study performed between June 1, 
1995 and August 1, 1997 all consecutive out-of-hospital 
circulatory arrests conﬁrmed by EMS personnel were 
recorded. Included were all bystander witnessed circula- 
tory arrests, where EMS personnel attempted resuscita- 
tion. The ethics committees of all the study partners 
approved the study. 


We followed the Utstein recommendations for regis- 
tration, deﬁnitions, and nomenclature [2]. Data collec- 
tion was done by specially trained research personnel 
on the scene as has been described in detail previously 
[3]. Brieﬂy, these personnel consisted of medical stu- 
dents, in a 24-h, 7 days a week coverage of the study 
area. When the ambulance dispatchers suspected a cir- 
culatory arrest and dispatched accordingly, 
the re- 
searcher ‘‘on call’’ was also directed to the scene. The 
researcher usually arrived during or immediately after 
the resuscitation attempt and debriefed the witness, 
bystanders, performers of basic CPR, and paramedics 
immediately after the resuscitation attempt to describe 
their actions and the times accurately. Estimation of the 
moment of collapse and the quality of basic CPR had a 
high priority. Rhythm strips from the ambulance were 
recovered and clock differences between the dispatch- 
er’s computer and the time stamp of the deﬁbrillator 
were corrected immediately. 
.4. Time inter(cid:1)als and deﬁnitions 
2 
The interval between the collapse and the moment 
that the call reached the dispatch center was deﬁned as 
‘time to call’. When a patient collapsed after the call 
but before arrival of the EMS personnel, this was 
recorded as ‘call before collapse’. ‘Time from call to 
EMS arrival’ was the interval between the moment that 
the call reached the dispatch center up to the time that 
the EMS arrived at the patient’s side. ‘Time to basic 
CPR’ was the interval between collapse and the start of 
basic CPR by lay persons. ‘Time from basic CPR to 
EMS arrival’ was the interval between the start of basic 
CPR to the EMS arrival at the patient’s side. Persons 
who had received training in basic CPR procedures 
were labeled ‘trained in basic CPR’. 
‘Experience in 
basic CPR’ was recorded if a person had performed 
basic CPR on a human victim at least once before. 


Differences between proportions were tested with the 
(cid:1) 2 statistic, with a signiﬁcant level of P-value (cid:1)0.05. 
Differences between medians were tested with the Me- 
dian rank test. A logistic regression model was devel- 
oped from all potential predictors for survival that 
could be known before the EMS arrived: the witness, 
‘time to call’, the caller, ‘time to basic CPR’, ‘time from 
basic CPR to EMS arrival’, the identity training, his- 
tory and experience of the performance of basic CPR, 
and the different ways of performing basic CPR. Step- 
wise elimination was used and based on the signiﬁcance 
of each variable in the model and the signiﬁcance in 
change of the log-likelihood, both tested with the (cid:1) 2 
statistic and a P-value (cid:1) 0.05. All statistics were per- 
formed in JMP 3.2 for the Apple Macintosh [4]. 





In a study period of 26 months, 1685 patients had a 
circulatory arrest conﬁrmed by EMS personnel. We 
excluded 400 patients who were not resuscitated by 
EMS personnel, 198 patients whose arrest was not 
witnessed and 165 patients whose onset of arrest was 
witnessed by EMS personnel. Of the remaining 922 
patients, attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful in 
71% (658/922). After initial successful resuscitation 19% 
(171/922) of the patients died during hospital admission 
and eventually 10% (93/922) of the patients survived to 
hospital discharge. 




The witnesses were nearly all bystanders (46%) or 
family members (44%) (Table 1). When a general prac- 
titioner was called for symptoms and witnessed the 
collapse, the chance of survival was statistically better 
than for any other witness. Police ofﬁcers were seldom 
(1%) witnesses of an out-of-hospital circulatory arrest. 
to the dispatcher by dialing 112, resulting in a signiﬁ- 
cantly better survival than when a call was ﬁrst made to 
others. Who made the call had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
on the outcome. 
When the ﬁrst call was directly made to the dis- 
patcher, the median call delay was 0.8 min (Fig. 1(A)). 
When the ﬁrst call was to others, such as relatives or 
the general practitioner, the median call delay was 
signiﬁcantly longer, 2.8 min (P(cid:1) 0.001). The median 
call delay of the call made by family members and 
bystanders was 0.9 and 1.0 min, not signiﬁcantly differ- 
ent (P= 0.11), (Fig. 1(B)). The median call delay was 
signiﬁcantly longer when the general practitioner or the 
police made the call, 2.0 and 1.8 min, with P-values of 
0.02 and 0.02, respectively. 
The dispatcher recognized the call as a circulatory 
arrest in 312 of the 827 cases, resulting in the dispatch 
of two ambulances simultaneously and, in 76 cases, also 
the police. In 69% (214/312) of these cases, basic CPR 
was started, signiﬁcantly more than when the call was 
not recognized as an arrest, 46% (237/515), P(cid:1)0.0001. 
It was not documented whether basic CPR was ini- 
tiated before or after the call to the dispatcher. 






In 95 cases, the call had reached the dispatch center 
before the patient collapsed (Table 1). There was a 
trend toward a better survival when the call was made 
before the arrest. In 827 cases, the call was made after 
the arrest and in 634 of these, the call was directly made 
In 45% of the cases, a bystander started basic CPR, 
in 25% a general practitioner, in 19% a police ofﬁcer, 
and in 11% a family member or a relative (Table 2). 
The median time to the start of basic CPR for the 
general practitioner and the bystander was the same,

CPR. Of the 222 bystanders performing basic CPR, 151 
(68%) had been trained in basic CPR procedures. Fam- 
ily members who performed basic CPR had experience 
in 13% (7/52) and bystanders in 37% (83/222). All 
general practitioners and police ofﬁcers had been 
trained in basic CPR procedures. Of the general practi- 
tioners 91% (113/124) had experience in basic CPR 
performance, as did 84% (80/95) of the police ofﬁcers.

experienced basic CPR performers was the shortest 
signiﬁcantly P(cid:1) 0.0001. 
The interval since the last training lesson did not 
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence outcome (Fig. 3). Basic CPR 
delivered by an untrained performer with experience 
resulted in the best survival. With neither training nor 
experience in basic CPR, survival was the worst and 
similar to that of patients who received no basic CPR 
at all. 
In 89% of the cases, basic CPR performance con- 
sisted of mouth to mouth ventilation combined with 
chest compression (Table 2). Basic CPR consisted of 
chest compressions only in 8% and of mouth to mouth 
ventilation only in 3%. Initial resuscitation success was 
similar for the different forms of basic CPR and sur- 
vival was not signiﬁcantly different in the patients when 
basic CPR consisted of chest compression with or 
without ventilation. 


.4. Multi(cid:1)ariate analysis of the potential predictors 
3 
When all factors mentioned were analyzed in a logis- 
tic model, a few variables proved independent predic- 
tors of survival (Table 3). When no basic CPR was 
performed before arrival of EMS personnel, survival 
was very low. A delay before basic CPR was initiated 
had a greater negative effect on survival than a delay 
between the start of basic CPR and the EMS arrival. 
When untrained persons without experience performed 
basic CPR, there was a lower probability of survival 
than then when a trained or experienced person per- 
formed basic CPR. 

This study focussed on the ﬁrst two links in the chain 
of survival: ‘access’ and ‘basic CPR’. In multivariate 
analysis, basic CPR performance before arrival of EMS 
personnel substantially improved survival. If the start 
of basic CPR was delayed, survival decreased signiﬁ- 
cantly. Furthermore, what did matter was the training 
or experience of the basic CPR performer and not who 
started basic CPR. 
Basic CPR skills as tested on a manikin decline in 
time [5]. We could not demonstrate that such a decline 
in skills resulted in a decrease in survival after real 
resuscitation efforts. However, univariate analysis 
showed that basic CPR performed by an untrained and 
inexperienced person, resulted in a survival similar to 
that when no basic CPR was performed. In the multi- 
variate model, the negative effect on survival of not 
performing basic CPR was stronger than the effect of 
an untrained and inexperienced basic CPR performer. 
This difference in univariate and multivariate analysis 
could not be explained by the delay in the start of basic 
CPR, since this was identical. So, other predictors in 
their situation must have had an additional negative 
inﬂuence. 
Family members were most likely to witness an ar- 
rest, but survival was worse then when others were 
witnesses, although they did not call 
later. Family 
members were less trained and experienced in basic 
CPR, seldom started basic CPR and when they did, the 
delay was long. Critically important was an immediate 
start of basic CPR efforts, the training or experience of 
the basic CPR performer, but not whether they were 
physicians, family members or other witnesses. There- 
fore, basic CPR training should not only seek the 
young and the active, but also the partners of potential 
patients as target groups, even when older. This was 
already emphasized many years ago and is again sup- 
ported in our study [6]. 
Some researchers have already suggested that chest 
compression alone might be as effective as the combi- 
nation of chest compression and mouth to mouth venti- 
lation [7]. Our observations do support this suggestion: 
we found a similar survival in cases where chest com- 
pression was or was not accompanied by ventilation 
efforts. A markedly lower survival was observed when 
only mouth to mouth ventilation was delivered. This 
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant, probably be- 
cause of the small number of cases in this group. 
When a circulatory arrest is not recognized or when 
panic prevails, a detour causes a delay. Obviously, the 
call itself does not contribute to the resuscitation ef- 
forts, but it is required for early activation of subse- 
quent links in the chain. Therefore, it is understandable 
that the delay in the call itself was not a signiﬁcant 
predictor in the multivariate model [8]. It is important 
that a call is recognized as that of a circulatory arrest, 
allowing the dispatcher to send EMS and ﬁrst respon- 
ders simultaneously and give pre-arrival instructions to 
the caller [9]. In the cases, where the dispatcher recog- 
nized an arrest, a high proportion received basic CPR 
probably because the witness and the caller immediately 
understood the true nature of the situation. So a para- 
dox exists: instructions in performing basic CPR are 
especially needed for the caller who does not recognize 
the situation as a circulatory arrest. 
Our multivariate analysis only contained potential 
predictors that could be known before EMS arrived at 
the patient’s side. Also, unwitnessed arrests were ex- 
cluded from this study, since no accurate time estimate 
was possible without a witness. Therefore, we did not 
include in the analysis: ‘witnessing the arrest’, ‘initial 
rhythm’ and the ‘cause of the circulatory arrest’ despite 
the fact that this was recommended earlier [10]. 
A limitation of this study is that measuring the 
quality of basic CPR performance was not feasible. We 
decided not to accept the judgement of quality of basic 
CPR by the EMS personnel: EMS personnel saw the 
basic CPR efforts at a late stage, they could be biased 
by the outcome, and EMS personnel immediately fo- 
cussed their attention on their own task. Our research 
personnel usually arrived after the EMS personnel and 
did not observe the basic CPR performers. Therefore, 
we employed a substitute measurement and chose the 
previous 
in basic CPR 
procedures. 

From our study, we conclude that the statement 
‘basic CPR performed’ incompletely describes the ac- 
tual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to 
initiation of basic CPR and the training and experience 
of the performer must also be taken into account. The 
importance of immediate initiation of basic CPR must 
be stressed in basic CPR courses. This study again 
records many patients for whom basic CPR was not 
performed at all. Even when it was performed, basic 
CPR by trained persons may be delayed because the 
most important witness (partner or other family) does 


not know how to perform basic CPR or delays CPR. 
Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus 
more on the partners of those who are most likely to 
witness a circulatory arrest.
