Abstract 
Incorrectly 
performed 
bystander 
CPR might compromise 
survival 
of the cardiac 
arrest 
patient. 
We therefore 
evaluated 
the outcome 
in 3306 out-of-hospital 
primary cardiac arrests 
of which 885 received bystander 
CPR. bystanders 
performed 
CPR correctly in 52%, incorrect- 
ly in ll%, 31% performed 
only external 
chest compressions 
(ECC) and 6% only mouth-to- 
mouth ventilation 
(MMV). The initial ECG in cases without 
bystander 
CPR was ventricular 
fibrillation 
in 28% (95% confidence 
interval: 
27-30%); 
45% (41-50%) 
and 39% (29-48%), 
respectively 
when bystander 
CPR was performed 
correctly or incorrectly; 
43% (37-49%) when 
only ECC was applied and 22% (1 l-33%) 
when only MMV was practiced. 
Long term survi- 
val, defined as being awake 14 days after CPR, was 16% (13-19%) 
in patients 
with correct 
bystander 
CPR; 10% (7-14%) 
and 2% (O-9%), respectively 
when only ECC or only MMV 
was performed; 
7% (6-8%) when no bystander 
was involved; 4% (O-8%) when bystander

was performed incorrectly. Bystander CPR might have a beneficial effect on survival by main- 
taining the heart in ventricular fibrillation 
by ECC. A negative effect of badly performed 
bystander CPR was not observed compared to cases which had not received bystander CPR.

1. Introduction 
bystander CPR has been advocated as an important link in the chain of survival 
after out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest [ 11. Therefore, citizen-CPR training programs 
were organised in many countries and millions of people were trained in basic CPR. 
Quality control of the CPR training program and of the teaching performance of 
CPR instructors is difficult to achieve. In addition, retention of well trained CPR 
trainees decays rapidly after l-2 years [2]. Despite the fact that literature provides 
information that bystander CPR is overall beneficial, one cannot exclude a harmful 
effect in case the bystander applied bad quality CPR. In this study we investigated 
retrospectively whether long-term survival was negatively influenced when bad qual- 
ity bystander CPR was applied compared to cases where no bystander CPR was per- 
formed. 
2. Methods 
A detailed description of the applied methodology, the registration form and gen- 
eral results of the Belgian Cerebral Resuscitation Study Group were reported before 
[3]. Seven two-tiered emergency medical service teams, using a central telephone 
dispatch (dial ‘100’) and mobile intensive care units (MICU), registered all cardiac 
arrest events during 1983-1989. The registration form was completed by a MICU 
nurse or physician as soon as possible after the resuscitation procedure. Only cases 
of out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest, confirmed by ECG monitoring 
and where ad- 
vanced life support was initiated, were included in the registration. In this analysis, 
only patients with an acute cardiac event as underlying disease and where it was 
known whether bystander was performed or not, were studied (n = 3306). The type 
of cardiac arrest on arrival of the MICU was classified as ventricular fibrillation (in- 
cluding ventricular 
tachycardia 
causing collapse), asystole or electromechanical 
dissociation (EMD). bystanders were identified as lay or as health care workers (e.g. 
general practitioners and nurses) and it was specified whether only external chest 
compressions, only mouth-to-mouth 
ventilation or both were performed, either cor- 
rectly or incorrectly. Quality of bystander CPR was judged by observation of chest 
movements and by palpation of peripheral arteries during chest compression. The 
technique of CPR performance, compared to the Guidelines of American Heart As- 
sociation, was judged subjectively by the MICU team on arrival. Quality of the CPR 
performance was recorded as: correct (good technique with good effect, good tech- 
nique with weak effect) or incorrect (bad technique). A CPR attempt was considered 
as a failure if the patient died before hospital admission. Long term survival was 
defined as consciousness 14 days after the cardiac arrest event. Short term survival 
meant that the patient was admitted and had died within 14 days after the cardiac 
arrest or remained unconscious.

3. Results 
bystander CPR was performed in 885 cases (27%) of the 3306 primary cardiac ar- 
rests registered (Table 1). Genuine laymen represented 37% of these interventions 
and health care workers 60%. The status of the bystander is unknown in 3% of cases. 
Health care workers were scored significantly more frequently to perform CPR cor- 
rectly (58%) and to do only ECC (33%), and were scored less frequently to perform 
incorrect CPR (6%) and only MMV (3%) as compared to lay bystanders (respective- 
ly, 42, 26, 20 and 11%; Chi-square: P < 0.05). 
When bystander CPR was performed correctly, 45% (41-50%) of the patients

Long term survival after out-of-hospital primary cardiac arrest was 16% (13- 19%) 
when bystander CPR was performed correctly and 4% (O-8%) when performed in- 
correctly (Table 4). When only ECC or MMV was applied long-term survival was, 
respectively 10% (7-14%) and 2% (0-9O/,). When no bystander CPR was performed 
long-term survival was 7% (6-8%). In patients presenting with ventricular fibrilla- 
tion on arrival of the MICU, long-term survival was 3 1% (24-37%) when bystander 
CPR was performed correctly, 8% (l-16%) 
when performed incorrectly and, re- 
spectively 20% (13-28%) and 9% (O-26%) when only ECC or only MMV was 
applied (Table 5). When no bystander intervened, 
long-term survival was 15% 
(12-18%). 
4. Discussion 
Outcome studies of out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest demonstrate a beneficial effect 
of bystander CPR. This is especially the case in EMS systems where intervention 
times of the MICU team exceed 8 min [4,5]. Because of these epidemiologic data 
citizen-CPR has been promoted throughout 
the Western countries [l]. Despite in- 
telligent teaching programs and intensive training courses long-term retention of 
basic CPR skills and knowledge is poor [2]. In addition, it is impossible to predict 
the behaviour and performance of a layman in case of emergency. Furthermore, one 
might assume that some bystanders do not perform CPR as prescribed by the Ameri- 
can Heart Association criteria. 
Few studies report on the quality of the bystander CPR performed [5,6]. The most 
obvious and probably the only possible method to collect sufficient data on the influ- 
ence of bad quality bystander CPR on survival, is the retrospective analysis of car- 
diac arrest events. However, the registration of bystander CPR quality can be biased 
by the fact that at the moment of registration the status of the bystander and the 

52 
R.J. Van Hoeyweghen 
el al./Resuscitation 
26 (1993) 47-52 
immediate outcome of the CPR attempt are known. As such, quality of bystander 
CPR during a successful CPR attempt might have been scored better than it was and 
vice versa in case of an unsuccessful attempt. Similarly, it might have been possible 
that CPR techniques of general practitioners were scored better than the perfor- 
mance of a genuine lay person. Another major methodological drawback is the fact 
that study groups might not be completely comparable. For example, it is known 
that cardiac arrest patients receiving bystander CPR have shorter intervention times 
and thus better chances to survive than patients not receiving bystander CPR [S]. 
Our data show that the majority of the bystanders are health care workers (nurses 
and general practitioners), which identifies these citizens as one of the primary target 
group for CPR training. When health care workers do not perform CPR correctly 
they mostly apply only ECC. Genuine lay bystanders perform less correct CPR com- 
pared to health care workers and more frequently apply only MMV. Patients who 
received correct bystander CPR have the highest prevalence of ventricular tibrilla- 
tion and gasping on arrival of the MICU and have the best chance to survive. 
Whether this is due to the bystander CPR, the selection of patients or the bias in- 
duced by the status of the bystander or the immediate outcome of the CPR attempt 
or other factors, cannot be determined. It is more relevant to observe that long-term 
survival is not significantly different between those patients which received incorrect 
or incomplete bystander CPR and those which did not receive bystander CPR at all. 
This suggests that overall bad quality bystander CPR is probably not harmful for 
the patient. 
The prevalence of ventricular fibrillation on arrival of the MICU might positively 
be influenced by applying only ECC, compared to cases where only MMV or incor- 
rect CPR was applied. This is in accordance with the assumption of Kouwenhoven 
et al. in the early days of ‘closed chest massage’ that basic CPR maintains more pa- 
tients in ventricular fibrillation [7]. Therefore, when mouth-to-mouth 
ventilation 
cannot be applied, it is advisible to perform at least external chest compressions 
while maintaining free airway to allow some ventilation of the lungs by changes in 
intrathoracic pressure.
