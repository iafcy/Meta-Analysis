Background—We sought to compare the 1-month survival rates among patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who
had been given bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in relation to whether they had received standard CPR
with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation or chest compression only.
Methods and Results—All patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received bystander CPR and who were reported
to the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register between 1990 and 2005 were included. Crew-witnessed cases were excluded.
Among 11 275 patients, 73% (n8209) received standard CPR, and 10% (n1145) received chest compression only.
There was no significant difference in 1-month survival between patients who received standard CPR (1-month
survival7.2%) and those who received chest compression only (1-month survival6.7%).
Conclusions—Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received bystander CPR, there was no significant
difference in 1-month survival between a standard CPR program with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth
ventilation and a simplified version of CPR with chest compression only. (Circulation. 2007;116:2908-2912.)

S
urvival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) re-
mains poor.1 Improvement is required, all the way from a
deeper understanding of the prodromal symptoms before
cardiac arrest to the handling of early alarm and defibrillation
as well as postresuscitation care.2,3 This chain of care is often
described as the “chain of survival”.4
Editorial p 2894
Clinical Perspective p 2912
It is well established that bystander cardiopulmonary re-
suscitation (CPR) improves survival rates in patients with
prehospital ventricular fibrillation (VF).5,6 The mechanistic
explanation of this improved survival rate may work in the
form of a “bridge to successful defibrillation” on the assump-
tion that early CPR prolongs the patient’s phase of VF.7,8
Bystander CPR can be performed according to a “standard
mode” with chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation
(standard CPR) or as a “single mode” with chest compression
only (compression-only CPR). Standard CPR is widespread and
widely accepted. However, during the last decade, investigators
have addressed the method of compression-only CPR as an
alternative to standard CPR.9,10 The importance of chest com-
pression is now also given a more predominant role in the
recently published international CPR guidelines.11
The aim of this retrospective investigation was therefore to
compare the 1-month survival rates among OHCA patients
who received bystander CPR in the form of standard CPR
with those given the more simplified treatment with
compression-only CPR.
Methods
Register
This study is based on patient material collected by the Swedish
Cardiac Arrest Register, which is a joint venture between the
Federation of Leaders in Swedish Ambulance and Emergency
Services and the Swedish Council for Cardiopulmonary Resuscita-
tion. Since 1993, the register has been funded by the Swedish
National Board of Health and Welfare. This voluntary register was
started in 1990 and covers 70% of the population in Sweden (total
population, 8.9 million). Larger cities (including all major cities) as
well as sparsely populated areas are represented in the register,
which also has a geographic distribution covering most of Sweden.
The ambulance organizations not reporting to the register are not
different in terms of education or guidelines.
Patients
We included patients who suffered from OHCA and received any form
of bystander CPR and who were reported to the Swedish Cardiac Arrest
Register between 1990 and 2005. Crew-witnessed (ambulance staff,
police, healthcare provider) cases of OHCA were excluded.

Study Design
For each OHCA, the ambulance crew completed a form with
demographic information and information regarding whether the
collapse was witnessed (ie, seen or heard). The form also included
questions regarding the resuscitation procedure and interventions, as
well as information regarding the bystander (layman, ambulance
crew, or others). The first recorded rhythm was defined as VF,
pulseless electric activity, or asystole. Rhythm detection by the
rescue team was obtained with the use of a manual defibrillator.
When automated external defibrillators came into use, the rhythm
was defined as shockable or nonshockable. For the purposes of this
survey, VF includes also pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The form
was completed during and immediately after the acute event. Each
form was sent to the medical director, and a copy was sent to the
central register in Göteborg, Sweden. Another copy was subse-
quently sent with additional information about whether the patient
was dead or alive after 1 month. Any uncertainty about survival was
controlled by checking with the National Register of Deaths.
This study was approved by the local ethics committee.
Statistical Methods
Distribution of variables is given as medians (quartile 1 to quartile 3)
and percentage. For comparison between groups regarding ordered
and continuous variables, the Fisher nonparametric permutation test
was used. For comparison of dichotomous variables between groups,
the Fisher exact test was used. Logistic regression was used to adjust
for variables that were significantly different in the 2 groups. Odds
ratio was calculated with 95% confidence interval. A probability
value of 0.05 was regarded as significant.
The authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the
integrity of the data. All authors have read and agree to the
manuscript as written.
Results
After exclusion of crew-witnessed cases, 12 740 patients who
had suffered from OHCA in 1990–2005 and who had
received bystander CPR before arrival of the rescue team
were included in the survey. Information regarding the
type of CPR that had been given was missing in 1465
patients (11%).
Among the remaining 11 275 patients, 8209 (73%) re-
ceived standard CPR, whereas 1145 patients (10%) received
compression-only CPR. For unknown reasons, 1921 patients
(17%) had received only mouth-to-mouth CPR. The purpose
of this study was to compare standard CPR and compression-
only CPR, but a short comment on mouth-to-mouth CPR will
be found in the end of Results.
Standard CPR Versus Compression-Only CPR
Patients who were given compression-only CPR were older
and less likely to have VF, and the interval between the call
for and the arrival of the ambulance was shorter (Table
1).There was, however, no significant difference between
patients who received compression-only CPR and standard
CPR in terms of being hospitalized alive or being alive after
1 month. When we adjusted for differences at baseline (age
[continuous variable], sex [men versus women], time [con-
tinuous variable], type of bystander [healthcare provider
versus non–healthcare provider]), the adjusted odds ratio for
survival to 1 month (standard CPR versus compression-only
CPR) was 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.56), as
shown in Table 2.
Type of Bystander
Patients who received standard CPR had significantly more
often been given CPR by healthcare providers than patients
who received compression-only CPR.

Time Delay
When survival was related to ambulance response time, there
was no significant difference between standard CPR and
compression-only CPR in survival to 1 month either when
delay was short (8 minutes; 11.5% versus 9.5%; PNS) or
when delay was long (8 minutes; 2.7% versus 1.8%;
PNS). The relationship between ambulance response time
and survival in the 2 groups is illustrated in detail in the
Figure.
Standard CPR Versus Mouth-to-Mouth
Ventilation Only
Patients who received mouth-to-mouth ventilation only
were somewhat younger, were more often women, consid-
erably more frequently suffered from OHCA at home,
were less likely to have a cardiac cause, and were less
frequently found in VF. They had a shorter delay time
between call for and arrival of the ambulance than patients
who received standard CPR.
Furthermore, fewer patients who received mouth-to-
mouth ventilation were hospitalized alive, and a lower
proportion of patients were alive after 1 month compared
with
patients
who
received

CPR
(4.5%;

Discussion
Overall Results
We found that in patients who received bystander CPR after
OHCA, 73% received standard CPR, whereas 10% were
given compression-only CPR only. (An additional 17% of
patients received mouth-to-mouth CPR only and were ex-
cluded from the primary analysis.)
There was no significant difference in 1-month survival
between patients who received compression-only CPR com-
pared with those who received standard CPR. This is similar
to the findings of Hallstrom et al,12 who reported equal
survival between these 2 groups in a dispatcher-assisted CPR
study. In a recent report on bystander participation in OHCA,
other workers have described a subset of patients with apnea,
shockable rhythm, and resuscitation start within 4 minutes in
whom there was a better outcome when bystanders performed
compression-only CPR compared with standard CPR.13
Factors Influencing Results
Our 2 groups differed in some aspects at baseline. These
differences were adjusted for in the multivariate analysis with
the exception of initial rhythm because initial rhythm can be
regarded as an effect variable. Some of these aspects need
further comment.
Sex and Age
Women and younger persons are reported to have a better
prognosis in OHCA.14,15 However, none of these 2 factors
affected survival rate in our study population.
Initial Rhythm
VF was more frequently encountered in the standard CPR
group than in the compression-only CPR group. One possible
reason for the similar survival results in the standard CPR and
compression-only CPR groups could be that these 2 methods
are probably similarly effective in maintaining pump function
during VF.
Ambulance Response Time
One of the major contributors to a better survival rate after
OHCA is the time interval between call and arrival of the
rescue team.16 The ambulance response time in the
compression-only CPR group was significantly shorter (6
minutes) than in the standard CPR group (8 minutes), which
may have influenced the outcome in a favorable direction in
the compression-only CPR group. However, when we ad-
justed for this difference, the overall result did not change.
Furthermore, the association between the ambulance response

time and survival appeared very similar in the 2 treatment
groups (Figure).
Quality of CPR
A factor that might affect our results in the univariate analysis
may be that CPR was more often performed by healthcare
providers in the standard CPR group, as also shown by
others.17
Role of Ventilation
The relatively high survival rate in the compression-only
CPR group requires further comment. These patients received
no ventilation before arrival of the rescue team. One possible
explanation for this favorable finding in the compression-
only CPR group is most probably the predominant impor-
tance of rapidly starting and continuously performing chest
compression without interruption,18–20 which, furthermore, is
in agreement with the new CPR guidelines.13
Reason Not to Start CPR
We do not know why some patients received standard CPR,
whereas others were given compression-only CPR. Our study
covers a time when only standard CPR had been taught. In a
small, unpublished survey from Stockholm in which 76
emergency calls for OHCA were evaluated, it was observed
that patients who did not receive standard CPR more often
were lying or sitting in a difficult position, which prevented
the caller from performing standard CPR.
Investigators have also shown that even if people have
been trained to perform CPR, only a minority start such
treatment.21 One reason may be that a considerable number of
bystanders have doubts about performing CPR including
ventilations for reasons that include fear of infections.22–24
Improvement of CPR by Dispatching
A way to stimulate more bystanders to start early and
effective CPR, even among those who have had no previous
CPR training, is for the dispatcher, when responding to the
alarm call, to give CPR instructions to the caller. Similar
survival rates have been obtained with dispatcher-assisted
CPR compared with basic CPR.25 Indeed, dispatcher-assisted
CPR with a compression-only mode seems to result in
survival rates as good as those for dispatcher-assisted stan-
dard CPR.12
Limitations
The major problem with observational studies is how to deal
with confounding factors. Although we adjusted for several
confounding factors in the multivariate analysis, we cannot
exclude the possibility of the existence of other such factors.
One is most likely comorbidity, for which there are no data in
the cardiac arrest register. Data from this survey are applica-
ble for unexpected sudden collapse outside the hospital, a
condition that is almost always due to cardiac arrest. In
contrast, in patients with respiratory arrest, ventilations are
probably more important, and standard CPR including chest
compression and ventilation is superior to either technique
alone.26
Implications
This study lends further support for the use of chest compres-
sion only as a simpler version of CPR in people suffering
from OHCA while waiting for medical assistance. This may
be especially important in dispatcher-assisted CPR and also
in cases involving elderly bystanders, in which the simplest
algorithm is probably also the best.
However, a randomized trial must be performed to give us
further information concerning this central question. Two
large independent, prospective, randomized trials are ongoing
in the United States (Seattle, Wash) and in Finland and
Sweden. The dispatchers randomize patients to either stan-
dard CPR or compression-only CPR. The primary end point
is death, and the studies will include 6000 patients. We
therefore suggest waiting for the results of these randomized
trials before starting any new discussion to change guidelines.
Conclusions
In this retrospective registry study of CPR in patients suffer-
ing from OHCA, there was no significant difference in the
1-month survival rate in patients who received standard CPR
compared with those given compression-only CPR.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the western world, being responsible for 50% of adult
deaths from coronary heart disease. The vast majority of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims die, with only 5%
resuscitated. Early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical link in this “chain of survival” that
improves outcomes. Although many lay people have some awareness of how to perform CPR, only a minority start such
treatment promptly when they observe out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The perception that CPR requires mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation is a factor that likely reduces bystander CPR. Data are emerging that support use of chest compressions
without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and international CPR guidelines from 2005 give chest compression a more
predominant role. Using the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register, we examined outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
when any form of bystander CPR was administered according to whether the bystander included mouth-to-mouth
ventilation or only chest compressions. Interestingly, 10% of the 11 275 arrests received chest compressions only. The
1-month survival was not significantly lower for victims who received only chest compressions compared with those who
received standard CPR. Better public awareness of these findings may increase bystander participation in CPR.
