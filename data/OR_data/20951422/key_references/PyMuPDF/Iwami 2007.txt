Background—Previous animal and clinical studies suggest that bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation may be
superior to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Our hypothesis was
that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of 15 minutes’ duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve
outcomes for cardiac arrests lasting 15 minutes.
Methods and Results—We carried out a prospective, population-based, observational study involving consecutive patients
with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome
measure was 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was
performed to evaluate the relationship between type of CPR and outcomes. Among the 4902 witnessed cardiac arrests,
783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration cardiac
arrests (15 minutes), the cardiac-only resuscitation yielded a higher rate of 1-year survival with favorable neurological
outcome than no bystander CPR (4.3% versus 2.5%; odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95), and conventional CPR
showed similar effectiveness (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). For the very-long-duration arrests,
neurologically favorable 1-year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors
regardless of the type of bystander CPR (0.3% [2 of 624], 0% [0 of 92], and 2.2% [3 of 139] in the no bystander CPR,
cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P0.05).
Conclusions—Bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. For very prolonged cardiac arrests, the addition of rescue breathing may be of some help.

udden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the
industrialized world.1 A strong chain of survival with
early activation of emergency medical services (EMS),
early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibril-
lation, and early advanced life support measures has
improved outcomes substantially in some smaller cities
such as Seattle (Wash),2 Gotëborg (Sweden),3 and Roch-
ester (Minn).4 However, survival rates from out-of-
hospital sudden cardiac arrest in large urban populations
are generally 3%.5–7
Editorial p 2894
Clinical Perspective p 2907
Although bystander CPR can substantially improve outcomes
from cardiac arrest, it typically is provided to 25% of cardiac
arrest victims.8–10 This low rate of bystander CPR can be
explained by fear of causing harm, difficulty in learning and
performing this complex psychomotor task, and aversion to
mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing.11–13 Cultural factors in Japan
may increase the unwillingness to provide mouth-to-mouth

rescue breathing.14 Our clinical observations indicated that
many Japanese lay rescuers provided chest compressions
without rescue breathing even though this approach had not been
taught in any resuscitation training program in Japan.
Animal and clinical investigations suggest that bystander-
initiated cardiac-only resuscitation is at least as effective as
conventional CPR for ventricular fibrillation (VF).15–18 In
addition, the recent SOS-KANTO (Survey of Survivors of
Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the Kanto Region of Japan)
study demonstrated that cardiac-only resuscitation might be
the preferable approach to resuscitation for adult patients with
witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, especially those
with a shockable rhythm or short periods of untreated arrest.19
The Utstein Osaka Project is a large, prospective, population-
based cohort study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Osaka,
Japan.20,21 Among almost 5000 witnessed cardiac arrests of
presumed cardiac origin over 5 years, 500 victims were
provided cardiac-only resuscitation. We hypothesized that by-
stander CPR with either cardiac-only resuscitation or conven-
tional CPR would improve outcomes from cardiac arrests of
15 minutes’ duration with a presumed cardiac origin. Because
of probable progressive atelectasis and hypoxemia after very
long cardiac arrests, we further hypothesized that only conven-
tional CPR with rescue breathing would improve outcomes after
very prolonged cardiac arrests of 15 minutes’ duration.
Methods
The EMS System in Osaka
Osaka Prefecture has 8.8 million residents in a 1892-km2 area of both
urban and rural communities and 35 fire stations with a corresponding
number of emergency dispatch centers. The EMS system is operated by
the local fire stations and activated by dialing 119 on the telephone. Life
support is provided 24 hours each day by the local EMS system, which
is single tiered in 33 stations and 2 tiered in 2 stations. The most highly
trained prehospital emergency care providers are the emergency lifesav-
ing technicians, who were allowed only to insert an intravenous line and
an adjunct airway and to use a semiautomated external defibrillator for
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients under a physician’s online medical
directions during this study period. These EMS providers were not
permitted to administer any medication, including epinephrine. Each
ambulance has 3 providers with at least 1 emergency lifesaving
technician. Systematic CPR training for citizens has been offered mainly
by local fire departments and the Japan Red Cross, Inc. In Osaka,
115 000 citizens per year participated in the conventional CPR training,
consisting of chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation.
Study Participants
This cohort study enrolled all persons 18 years of age who suffered
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin, were
witnessed by bystanders, and were treated by EMS in Osaka
Prefecture from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The research
protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Osaka
University, with the assent of the EMS authorities and local
governments in Osaka prefecture.
Cardiac arrest was defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical
activity as confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation.22 The
arrest was presumed to be of cardiac origin unless it was caused by
trauma, drowning, drug overdose, asphyxia, exsanguination, or any
other noncardiac cause determined by the responsible physician in
collaboration with the EMS rescuers.
Data Collection
Data were collected prospectively with a data form that included all
core data recommended in the Utstein-style reporting guidelines for
cardiac arrests22 such as sex; age; initial cardiac rhythm; time course
of resuscitation; type of bystander-initiated CPR; return of sponta-
neous circulation; hospital admission; 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year
survival; and neurological status 1 year after the event.
The presence and type of bystander-initiated CPR were docu-
mented by the EMS personnel on the scene. Initial rhythm was
recorded and diagnosed by the EMS personnel with semiautomated
defibrillators on the scene and confirmed by the physician respon-
sible for the online medical direction. Special emphasis was placed
on determining the time course of resuscitation. The times of EMS
call receipt and vehicle arrival at the scene were recorded automat-
ically at the dispatch center. The times of collapse and initiation of
bystander CPR were obtained by EMS interview with the bystander
before leaving the scene. The time of defibrillation was recorded in
the semiautomated defibrillator. Watches of EMS personnel were
synchronized with the clock of their dispatch center.
The data form was filled out by the EMS personnel in cooperation
with the physicians in charge of the patient, transferred to the Informa-
tion Center for Emergency Medical Services of Osaka, and then
checked by the investigators. If the data sheet was incomplete, the
relevant EMS personnel were contacted and questioned, and the data
sheet was completed. All survivors were followed up for up to 1 year
after the event by the investigators with the cooperation of the Osaka
Medical Association and medical institutes in this area. Neurological
outcome was determined by a follow-up letter and/or telephone inter-
view 1 year after successful resuscitation using the cerebral performance
category scale: category 1, good cerebral performance; category 2,
moderate cerebral disability; category 3, severe cerebral disability;
category 4, coma or vegetative state; and category 5, death.22
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measure was neurologically favorable 1-year
survival. Favorable neurological outcome was defined as cerebral
performance categories 1 or 2.22 Secondary outcome measures
included return of spontaneous circulation; admission to hospital;
and 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year survival. VF as the initial recorded
rhythm was evaluated as a process variable because VF can be
maintained for a longer time with adequate myocardial perfusion
during CPR.10,23 When the type of bystander-initiated CPR was not
described, the data were not included in either the cardiac-only
resuscitation group or the conventional CPR group. Patients with
very-long-duration cardiac arrests (15 minutes) were analyzed
separately because these patients are pathophysiologically quite
different and have very poor outcomes.24,25 In particular, they suffer
from progressive atelectasis and hypoxemia, presumably limiting
the opportunity for good outcomes with cardiac-only resuscitation.
Patient characteristics were evaluated with ANOVA for numerical
variables and a 2 test for categorical variables. Logistic regression
analysis was performed on the relationship between type of bystander-
initiated CPR and outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs
were calculated. In multivariable analyses, potential confounding factors
significantly associated with survival in the univariable analyses were
incorporated. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical
package version 12.0J (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill) and in part with SAS
software version 9.13 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). A 2-sided value of
P0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
The authors had full access to and take responsibility for the
integrity of the data. All authors have read and agree to the
manuscript as written.
Results
The mean population-based incidence of adult out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest in the Osaka prefecture during this time period was
63 per 100 000 person-years, and the mean incidence of cardiac
arrest of presumed cardiac origin was 36 per 100 000 person-
years, of which 13 per 100 000 person-years were witnessed
(Figure 1). Initial VF was noted in 2.2 per 100 000 person-years.
These data were similar from year to year (Figure 1).

Over these 5 years, 24 347 adult out-of-hospital cardiac
arrests were documented, resuscitation was attempted in 23 436,
and 13 444 were presumed to be of cardiac origin. Figure 2
provides an overview of the arrests with the important outcomes.
Of these out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with presumed cardiac
origin, 4902 were witnessed. Among them, 783 (16%) received
conventional CPR, and 544 (11%) received cardiac-only resus-
citation. Data on the type of bystander-initiated CPR were not
available for 25 cases (0.5%). We could not obtain 1-year
survival or neurological outcome data for 25 patients among the
23 436 patients resuscitated, of whom 4468 survived to hospital
admission. In addition, we could not obtain neurological out-
come data for 4 of 419 known 1-year survivors.
Demographic characteristics of patients with witnessed
cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin and witnessed VF
arrests are noted in Table 1. The cardiac-only resuscitation,
conventional CPR, and no bystander CPR groups were
generally similar except that the no bystander CPR group was
more likely to have their arrests at home and less likely to
have them in healthcare facilities. These similarities of
patients’ characteristics were essentially unaltered when pa-
tients were divided into cardiac arrests lasting 15 minutes
and very-long-duration cardiac arrests (15 minutes). The
mean time intervals from collapse to CPR by EMS personnel
also were similar among the 3 groups when they were divided
into cardiac arrests 15 minutes’ duration (8.7, 8.9, and 9.1
minutes in the no bystander CPR, cardiac-only resuscitation,
and conventional CPR groups, respectively) and very-long-
duration cardiac arrests (23.6, 23.0, and 22.5 minutes, respec-
tively). Factors associated with 1-year survival with favorable

neurological outcome included sex, age, activity of daily
living before arrest, year of arrest, location of arrest, and time
interval from collapse to the initiation of CPR by EMS
personnel.
Crude 1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome
after witnessed cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac origin was
more frequent in the cardiac-only resuscitation group (3.5%) and
the conventional CPR group (3.6%) than the no bystander CPR
group (2.1%). Overall 1-year survival also was more frequent in
both bystander resuscitation groups (Table 2). Similarly, VF was
more likely to be the initial ECG rhythm in the cardiac-only
resuscitation group (23%) and conventional CPR group (21%)
than the no bystander CPR group (15%). The outcomes of
witnessed VF cardiac arrests were similarly improved with both
cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the major results addressing our first hypoth-
esis that either bystander CPR technique would improve out-
come after cardiac arrests of 15 minutes’ duration of a
presumed cardiac origin after adjustment for potential confound-
ing variables. As hypothesized, the cardiac-only resuscitation
group had a higher rate of 1-year survival with favorable
neurological outcome compared with the no bystander CPR
group (4.3% versus 2.5%; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95). The
conventional CPR group had a similar rate (4.1% versus 2.5%;
OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.60). This finding was more
prominent for very-short-duration cardiac arrests (5 minutes),
even suggesting the superiority of cardiac-only resuscitation
over conventional CPR (OR, 2.22 versus 1.67).
Table 3 also shows the results for the second hypothesis that
conventional CPR would improve outcomes for very prolonged

cardiac arrests. The conventional CPR group had a higher rate of
1-year survival with favorable neurological outcome, but there
were few survivors regardless of the type of bystander CPR
(0.3% [2 of 624], 0% [0 of 92], and 2.2% [3 of 139] in the no
bystander CPR, cardiac-only, and conventional CPR groups,
respectively; P0.05). The OR was not calculated because of
the small number of the survivors in the reference group. Among
these patients with very prolonged cardiac arrests, VF was
documented by EMS in 24 of 621 (3.9%) in the no bystander
CPR group, 9 of 91 (9.9%) in the cardiac-only group, and 21 of
138 (15.2%) in the conventional CPR group.
Discussion
Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, the Utstein Osaka study
demonstrates that bystander-initiated CPR with either cardiac-
only resuscitation or conventional CPR improves outcomes from
witnessed cardiac arrests of 15 minutes’ duration. Our obser-
vations are consistent with previous studies in Belgium and the
Netherlands with substantially fewer cases of cardiac-only re-
suscitation (116 and 41, respectively) (Table 4).26–28 Further-
more, Hallstrom and colleagues29 demonstrated that dispatcher-
directed bystander cardiac-only resuscitation was at least as
effective as dispatcher-initiated bystander conventional CPR.
The substantial differences in study designs, patient populations,
and EMS systems in these clinical investigations indicate that
the clinical data supporting the effectiveness of cardiac-only
resuscitation are quite robust.
Our data suggest the time dependency of the effectiveness of
each type of bystander CPR. Cardiac-only resuscitation may be
superior to conventional CPR when provided within 5 minutes
of the cardiac arrest, and rescue breathing may be of some help
for very prolonged cardiac arrests (15 minutes from collapse to
EMS resuscitation). These findings are consistent with animal
experiments showing that perfusion is better with cardiac-only
resuscitation and oxygen content is better with conventional
CPR.11,17,18,30 Although there were many (864 of 4902) pro-

longed cardiac arrests, 1% of those (5 of 864) survived to 1
year with favorable neurological outcomes. Even when conven-
tional CPR was provided to these patients with very prolonged
arrests, the proportion of 1-year survivors with favorable neuro-
logical outcome was only 2% (3 of 139). Therefore, the absolute
number of patients who benefited from conventional CPR was
quite small. Because of the small number of survivors from
cardiac arrests of 15 minutes’ duration, we cannot confirm the
effectiveness of rescue breathing for these very prolonged
arrests. Further investigation is needed.
The SOS-KANTO study reported that cardiac-only resusci-
tation was the preferable approach for adults with witnessed VF
cardiac arrests, the group with the greatest likelihood of good
outcomes.19 In contrast, our study showed no difference in
outcomes between cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional
CPR for witnessed VF (Table 4). Although both studies were
carried out in Japan and backgrounds like race of the participants
and the EMS systems were quite similar, the Utstein Osaka
Project is population based and the SOS-KANTO is hospital
based, suggesting some inherent differences between the studies.
For example, 40% of cardiac arrests in the SOS-KANTO
study but only 18% in the Utstein Osaka study occurred at public
locations. This patient profile might affect the results because it
is well established that outcomes from out-of-hospital arrests are
better in public locations.21
If cardiac-only resuscitation is simply as effective as conven-
tional CPR, is there any reason to change lay CPR programs to
focus on cardiac-only resuscitation? Perhaps. Conventional CPR
is a complex psychomotor task,11,12,31,32 and it typically is
provided for 25% of out-of-hospital arrests. Consistent with
studies throughout the world, the Utstein Osaka bystanders
generally provided no CPR before EMS arrival. Cardiac-only
resuscitation is a much simpler technique that is easier to teach,
learn, remember, and perform.13,29,32 Specific educational cam-
paigns to teach cardiac-only resuscitation may increase the rate
of bystander CPR and improve the quality of cardiac-only

willing to provide CPR if mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing
were not necessary.12,33,34 Interestingly, many Japanese by-
standers choose to provide CPR without rescue breathing
despite the lack of any Japanese training programs with this
CPR technique. Willingness to perform mouth-to-mouth
rescue breathing appears to differ among different cultures. In
a Japanese study, only 2% of high school students, 3% of
teachers and nurses, and 16% of medical students claimed
that they were willing to provide mouth-to-mouth resuscita-
tion for a stranger in cardiac arrest.14 Nearly 40% of rescuers
who provided bystander CPR did not provide mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation. Presumably, other potential rescuers
decided against providing any bystander CPR because they
were unwilling to provide mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing.
Study Limitations
As with all multisite epidemiological studies, data integrity,
validity, and ascertainment bias are potential limitations. The
data collected by EMS providers included relatively few data
points that were easy to attain accurately at the scene with the
clear and concise Utstein-style guidelines for reporting cardiac
arrest.22 The uniform data collection, consistent definitions, time
synchronization process, and large sample size were intended to
minimize these potential sources of bias. In addition, the Utstein
Osaka project is a population-based cohort study that includes all
adult known out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the Osaka Prefec-
ture. The only arrests that may have been missed could be those
associated with illegal activities that were not reported.
The 2 most important limitations of this study are the lack of
data on the quality of bystander CPR and the potential biases
involved in providing cardiac-only resuscitation, conventional
CPR, or no bystander CPR. Evaluating the quality of CPR
before EMS arrival is not feasible. Moreover, the EMS provid-
ers’ first responsibility is to resuscitate the victim, not to evaluate
the bystanders’ effectiveness at the time of their arrival. It is well
known that the critical issues for blood flow during CPR are
force of compressions, rate of compressions, and avoidance of
interruptions in compressions.1,11,16–18,35 These technical issues
are taught during standard CPR training in Japan. However,
cardiac-only resuscitation is not taught. Rescuers who do not
provide rescue breathing may be less well trained and may
provide less effective chest compressions. If so, this may explain
the discrepancy between the Utstein Osaka data and animal
studies that show better outcomes with cardiac-only resuscita-
tion than conventional CPR in models of out-of-hospital single-
rescuer CPR for VF.35 Nevertheless, our data cannot explicitly
address these potential biases.
Conclusions
Data from a large-scale population-based cohort in Osaka
indicate that cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR
as provided by citizens are similarly effective for most adult
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac origin. For
very prolonged cardiac arrests, the addition of rescue breath-
ing may be of some help, but the outcomes were poor
regardless of the type of bystander CPR.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
This study addresses 2 important clinical issues regarding bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. First, cardiac-only
bystander resuscitation was as effective as conventional bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation with rescue breathing for
cardiac arrests that had a 15-minute interval from collapse to emergency medical service resuscitation. These data from
nearly 5000 witnessed cardiac arrests provide important new support for the effectiveness of cardiac-only resuscitation.
This is the only large-scale population-based study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to address this issue. This
population-based study design is intended to minimize potential selection biases. Our observations are consistent with
previous studies despite the substantial differences in study designs, patient populations, and emergency medical service,
which indicate that the clinical data supporting the effectiveness of cardiac-only bystander resuscitation are quite robust.
The second interesting issue addressed by this study is that rescue breathing may be of some help for very prolonged
cardiac arrests (15 minutes); however, the limited number of survivors from such arrests precluded a simple answer to
this issue. Even if rescue breathing is important for very prolonged arrests, our data show that there are few survivors from
very prolonged cardiac arrests regardless of the type of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In light of these data and
the disappointingly low rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, efforts to teach and encourage lay rescuers to
perform cardiac-only resuscitation may improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
