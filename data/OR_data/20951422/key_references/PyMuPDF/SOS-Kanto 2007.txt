Cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders with chest 
compression only (SOS-KANTO): an observational study
SOS-KANTO study group
Summary
Background Mouth-to-mouth ventilation is a barrier to bystanders doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but 
few clinical studies have investigated the eﬃ  cacy of bystander resuscitation by chest compressions without 
mouth-to-mouth ventilation (cardiac-only resuscitation).
Methods We did a prospective, multicentre, observational study of patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. On 
arrival at the scene, paramedics assessed the technique of bystander resuscitation. The primary endpoint was 
favourable neurological outcome 30 days after cardiac arrest.
Findings 4068 adult patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnessed by bystanders were included; 439 (11%) 
received cardiac-only resuscitation from bystanders, 712 (18%) conventional CPR, and 2917 (72%) received no 
bystander CPR. Any resuscitation attempt was associated with a higher proportion having favourable neurological 
outcomes than no resuscitation (5·0% vs 2·2%, p<0·0001). Cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in a higher proportion 
of patients with favourable neurological outcomes than conventional CPR in patients with apnoea (6·2% vs 3·1%; 
p=0·0195), with shockable rhythm (19·4% vs 11·2%, p=0·041), and with resuscitation that started within 4 min of 
arrest (10·1% vs 5·1%, p=0·0221). However, there was no evidence for any beneﬁ t from the addition of 
mouth-to-mouth ventilation in any subgroup. The adjusted odds ratio for a favourable neurological outcome after 
cardiac-only resuscitation was 2·2 (95% CI 1·2–4·2) in patients who received any resuscitation from bystanders. 
Interpretation Cardiac-only resuscitation by bystanders is the preferable approach to resuscitation for adult patients 
with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, especially those with apnoea, shockable rhythm, or short periods of 
untreated arrest.
Introduction
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consisting of 
chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation 
done by bystanders is a major element in the so-called 
chain of survival for people with cardiac arrest.1–4 
Although bystander CPR improves likelihood of 
survival,1–8 reports9–14 have shown that bystander CPR was 
attempted for less than a-third of patients who had 
collapsed. Surveys have identiﬁ ed reluctance of 
bystanders to undertake mouth-to-mouth ventilation as 
a substantial barrier to CPR attempts.10,15–17 This reluctance 
is partly caused by fear of transmission of infectious 
diseases. Despite the remote chance of such infection, 
fears about disease transmission are common in the 
present era of universal precautions.10,15 Another barrier 
to bystanders attempting CPR is the complexity of the 
technique as presently taught.18–20 In CPR guidelines, 
cardiac-only resuscitation by bystanders is recom mended 
in dispatcher-assisted resuscitation or if a rescuer is 
unwilling or unable to do mouth-to-mouth ventilation.2–4 
However, this technique is not generally known, 
recommended, or taught to the public. Since few clinical 
studies have focused on the eﬃ  cacy of cardiac-only 
resucitation,8,21,22 we sought to compare the outcomes for 
patients who underwent cardiac-only resuscitation or 
conventional CPR by bystanders. If cardiac-only 
resuscitation is as eﬀ ective as conventional CPR by 
bystanders, rescuers might be more willing and able to 
provide this simple intervention than they are at present. 
Furthermore, clinical studies have established that 
interruptions 
to 
chest 
compressions 
during 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are common, even by 
trained emergency medical staﬀ .3,23,24 Studies suggest

showed 
that 
cardiac-only 
resuscitation results in sub stantially better survival 
without neurological impairment 24 h after cardiac 
arrest than conventional CPR.
We therefore assessed the eﬀ ect of cardiac-only 
resuscitation by bystanders on adults who had out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. We expected that cardiac-only 
resuscitation or conventional CPR would be better than 
no bystander intervention and that cardiac-only 
resuscitation would show similar neurological outcome 
to conventional CPR.
Methods
Participants
A survey of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 
the Kanto region of Japan (SOS-KANTO) was done by the 
Association for Acute Medicine of Kanto and included 
58 emergency hospitals and emergency medical service 
units. Between Sept 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2003, patients 
who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnessed by 
bystanders and who were subsequently transported by 
paramedics to emergency hospitals participating in 
SOS-KANTO were included in the study. Exclusion 
criteria were: patients younger than 18 years of age; 
further cardiac arrest after the arrival of paramedics; 
documented terminal illness; presence of a do-not-
resuscitate order; and bystander resuscitation without 
documented chest compressions.
Procedures
The study was a prospective, multicentre, observational 
trial that followed Utstein style reporting guidelines.1 
The study was approved by the SOS-KANTO Research 
Ethics Board, and the requirement for informed consent 
was waived according to Japanese government 
guidelines.28 Paramedics observed the technique of 
bystander resuscitation and asked additional questions 
of 
bystanders 
to 
assess 
the 
characteristics 
of 
resuscitation.1,2 
The 
technique 
during 
bystander 
resuscitation was identiﬁ ed as cardiac-only resuscitation, 
conventional 
CPR, 
pulmonary-only 
resuscitation, 
unidentiﬁ ed resuscitation technique (including change 
of technique), or chest compression not documented. 
Chest compression rate and depth were not assessed. 
The person attempting bystander resuscitation was 
classiﬁ ed as a lay person with basic CPR training, a lay 
person assisted by a dispatcher, a lay person without 
either training or dispatcher assistance, or an oﬀ -duty 
health worker. All event times were measured by the 
dispatch centre clock, and times of collapse and ﬁ rst 
bystander resuscitation attempts were obtained from 
the bystanders. Cardiac arrest was deﬁ ned as the 
cessation of cardiac mechanical activity, manifesting as 
unresponsiveness, apnoea (or gasping breathing), and 
absence of pulse. The arrest was presumed to be from a 
cardiac cause, unless it was known to have been caused 
by a non-cardiac cause including trauma, drowning, 
and asphyxia.1
Resuscitation attempts were documented by both 
paramedics and attending physicians according to 
Utstein style reporting guidelines.1 Data for individual 
patients were entered into a database by SOS-KANTO 
members at each hospital and were independently 
cross-checked twice by diﬀ erent investigators. Original 
data were made available to the data and safety 
monitoring committee for independent scrutiny.

1 (good performance) or 2 (moderate disability) on a 
ﬁ ve-category scale.1,2 The other categories of 3 (severe 
disability), 4 (vegetative state), and 5 (death) were regarded 
as unfavourable neurological outcome.1,2 The secondary 
endpoint was survival 30 days after cardiac arrest, deﬁ ned 
as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral-performance category 
of 1, 2, 3, or 4. The neurological outcome was deﬁ ned by 
physicians who were unaware of the patient’s bystander 
resuscitation group.
Statistical analysis
An estimate of the number of patients needed to test our 
hypothesis was derived from analyses of three previous 
large-scale studies in Japan.12–14 The calculation was based 
on a two-fold improvement in favourable neurological 
outcomes from a baseline outcome of 1·6, and a 1:1:6 ratio 
of patients who had bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest 
and received cardiac-only resuscitation versus con-
ventional CPR versus no resuscitation. The minimum 
sample size for comparison of favourable neurological 
outcome at 30 days was estimated to be 400 patients for 
each bystander resuscitation group, and 1120 patients for 
the no bystander resuscitation group on the basis of a 
two-sided α value of 0·05 and a β error of 0·10. Baseline 
characteristics were compared by use of the χ² test for 
categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for 
continuous variables, as appropriate. Odds ratios and their 
95% CI were calculated for the study endpoints. A multiple 
logistic-regression analysis was done for independent 
predictors of resuscitation, including age, cause of cardiac 
arrest, technique of bystander resuscitation, resuscitation-
related time intervals, and initial recorded cardiac 
rhythm.1,2 The non-linear regression analysis with 
logarithm was used to illustrate the relation between 
favourable neurological outcome 30 days after cardiac 
arrest and the time between ﬁ rst bystander resuscitation 
attempts and ﬁ rst use of automated external deﬁ brillator 
(AED) in patients receiving bystander CPR with ventricular 
ﬁ brillation or ventricular tachycardia as an initial cardiac 
rhythm.

Results
9592 patients received advanced life support by 
paramedics and were transported to emergency hospitals 
during the study. Of those, 5464 patients were not eligible. 
The SOS-KANTO study therefore included 4068 adult 
patients who had bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest out 
of hospital; 1151 (28%) received bystander resuscitation, 
including 
439 
(11%) 
who 
received 
cardiac-only 
resuscitation and 712 (18%) who received conventional 
CPR, and 2917 (72%) did not receive any bystander 
resuscitation. No patient was lost to follow-up for study 
endpoints at 30 days after cardiac arrest (ﬁ gure 1).
At baseline, signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences (table 1) were seen 
between the any resuscitation group and the no bystander 
resuscitation group for cause of cardiac arrest, location 
where the cardiac arrest happened, proportion with 
gasping breathing and pupillometer reading at arrival of 
emergency medical services, initial recorded cardiac 
rhythm, and the need for deﬁ brillation by emergency

medical workers. Generally, the two groups that received 
bystander 
resuscitation 
had 
similar 
baseline 
characteristics (table 2). However, higher proportions in 
the cardiac-only resuscitation group than in the 
conventional group were male, more patients had cardiac 
arrest at home, and more were treated by lay people. The 
group who had any resuscitation attempt had signiﬁ cantly 
higher frequencies of favourable neurological outcome 
at 30 days than the no bystander resuscitation group in 
the whole cohort (5% [57/1151 vs 2% [63/2917]; p<0·0001) 
and in the subgroups of patients with cardiac causes 
(7% [53/806] vs 3% [54/1836]; p<0·0001), with apnoea 
(4% [44/1028] vs 2% [55/2751]; p<0·0001], with ventricular 
ﬁ brillation or tachycardia as initial cardiac rhythm 
(14% [47/329] vs 8% [45/549]; p=0·0044), and with both of 
the times between call to emergency medical services 
and ﬁ rst AED analysis (for interval ≤10 min; 6% [44/689] 
vs 3% [52/1801]; p<0·0001: for interval >10 min; 
3% [13/462] vs 1% [11/1116]; p=0·0069). The cardiac-only 
resuscitation group also had signiﬁ cantly higher 
frequencies of favourable neurological outcome at 
30 days than the no bystander resuscitation group in 
those categories. Although the frequency of favourable 
neurological outcome at 30 days did not diﬀ er between 
the cardiac-only resuscitation group and the conventional 
CPR group for the whole cohort (p=0·1459, table 3), 
cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in a higher proportion 
of patients with favourable neurological outcomes than 
conventional CPR in the subgroups of patients with 
apnoea (p=0·0195), with ventricular ﬁ brillation or

resuscitation starting within 4 min of collapse (p=0·0221). 
However, the bystander resuscitation groups had similar 
frequencies of favourable neurological outcome at 30 days 
in the subgroups of patients who received bystander 
resuscitation from a lay person or from a medically 
trained person. Additionally, there was no evidence for 
any beneﬁ t from the addition of mouth-to-mouth 
ventilation in any subgroup of patients who received 
bystander resuscitation.
Multiple logistic-regression analysis (ﬁ gure 2) showed 
that cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in higher 
proportions of favourable neurological outcome than 
conventional CPR (p=0·0144), and other independent 
predictors of favourable outcome were age, time between 
ﬁ rst 
bystander 
resuscitation 
attempt 
and 
ﬁ rst 
AED analysis, and ventricular ﬁ brillation or tachycardia 
as initial cardiac rhythm. When sex and gasping 
breathing were included in the analysis, the results did 
not change.
Figure 3 shows the relation between favourable 
neurological outcome at 30 days and the time between 
ﬁ rst 
bystander 
resuscitation 
attempt 
and 
ﬁ rst 
AED analysis (ie, the duration of bystander resuscitation) 
in patients with ventricular ﬁ brillation or tachycardia. 
Cardiac-only resuscitation resulted in higher proportions 
of favourable neurological outcome than conventional 
CPR (22% [22/100] vs 10% [17/166], the odds ratio, 2·5; 
95% CI, 1·2–4·9; p=0·0086], and likelihood of a 
favourable neurological outcome decreased in both 
bystander resuscitation groups for every 1 min increment 
in time from ﬁ rst resuscitation attempt to ﬁ rst 
AED analysis (p=0·0105 for the cardiac-only rescuscitation 
and p=0·0003 for conventional CPR). When the time 
from collapse to ﬁ rst AED analysis was used instead, the 
results were unchanged. 
The proportions of people who were alive at 30 days 
diﬀ ered from those who had favourable neurological 
outcome at 30 days (ﬁ gure 4). In all subgroups of patients, 
the proportions surviving at 30 days showed no 
diﬀ erences between the two bystander resuscitation 
groups, and these two groups also had similar frequencies 
of survival until hospital admission.
Discussion
This report shows that bystander cardiac-only resuscitation 
is equivalent or superior to conventional bystander CPR 
in adult patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest, in terms of neurological beneﬁ t. Not only the any 
resuscitation group, but also the cardiac-only resuscitation 
group had higher proportions of favourable neurological 
outcome than the no bystander resuscitation group for 
the whole cohort, and cardiac-only resuscitation resulted 
in better outcome than conventional CPR in some 
important subgroups of patients. These subgroups 
included patients with apnoea (about 90% of patients in 
this study), and those with shockable cardiac rhythm or 
short periods of untreated arrest (CPR that started within 
4 min of arrest). These patients had the greatest chance of 
survival (table 3, ﬁ gures 3 and 4). After adjustment for 
resuscitation, cardiac-only resuscitation was an in-
dependent predictor of favourable neurological outcome 
in patients who received bystander resuscitation (ﬁ gure 2). 
Furthermore, there was no evidence for any beneﬁ t from 
the addition of mouth-to-mouth ventilation in any 
subgroup of patients (table 3, ﬁ gures 2, 3, and 4).
Some experts have expressed concern that the absence of 
assisted ventilation with chest compressions might result 
in lower survival and worse neurological outcomes in 
survivors of cardiac arrest.3,4 Several clinical studies have

shown that cardiac-only resuscitation is at least as eﬀ ective 
as chest compression with mouth-to-mouth ventilation.8,21,22 
In this study, however, cardiac-only resuscitation resulted 
in better or similar neurological outcome than conventional 
CPR. Moreover, the pro portion of patients surviving, 
including those surviving until hospital admission, showed 
no diﬀ erences between the cardiac-only resuscitation 
group and the conventional CPR group in any subgroup of 
patients. The number of patients who received bystander 
cardiac-only resuscitation was higher in this study (n=439) 
than in previous ones (n=273,21 241,22 and 418). We suggest 
that the large number of patients provided adequate power 
to attribute better neurological outcome to cardiac-only 
resuscitation, and there was no evidence of increased 
numbers of survivors with neurologically unfavourable 
outcomes in the group who had cardiac-only resuscitation 
compared with conventional CPR.
Several mechanisms might account for the eﬃ  cacy of 
cardiac-only resuscitation. If the airway is open, gasping 
breathing and passive chest recoil provide some air 
exchange.15,29–33 Measured minute ventilation and arterial 
oxygenation decrease after 4–10 min of resuscitation 
irrespective of attempts at ventilation.15,26,30 Several studies 
suggest that ventilation is not essential during the initial 
12 min of resuscitation with untreated arrest intervals of 
less than 6 min,15,25,30,31 and that gasping breathing is 
associated with a better outcome.15,29,31,33 In this study, most 
patients who had bystander resuscitation had an untreated 
arrest interval of less than 6 min and a duration of 
bystander resuscitation of less than 12 min, and the two 
bystander resuscitation groups had similar time intervals 
and had similar proportions of patients with gasping 
breath.
Another reason for the eﬃ  cacy of cardiac-only 
resuscitation could be that mouth-to-mouth ventilation 
has several potential disadvantages. These disadvantages 
include gastric insuﬄ  ations and importantly, less cycle 
time spent on eﬀ ective compressions.2–4,15,19,23–28,34 Time 
spent on mouth-to-mouth ventilation takes precious time 
away from chest compressions that support cerebral and 
coronary perfusion.3,4,15,19,23–28 Intrathoracic pressure drops 
after each pause for mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and 
several chest compressions have to be done before 
previous rates of cerebral and coronary perfusion are 
re-established.3,4,26 In this study, the quality of chest 
compressions might not have been as good in the 
cardiac-only resuscitation group as in the conventional 
resuscitation group, because the proportion of patients 
treated by people with no ﬁ rst-aid training, with or without 
dispatcher-assistance, was higher in the cardiac-only 
group (272/439, 62% vs 234/712, 33%). Also, the proportion 
treated by medically trained individuals was lower in the 
cardiac-only group than in the conventional CPR group 
(97/439, 22% vs 350/712, 49%) However, there would be 
less interruption of chest compressions in the cardiac-only 
resuscitation group. We suggest that interruption of chest 
compressions was the main reason why conventional 
CPR did not result in better neurological outcome than 
cardiac-only resuscitation.
There are several limitations to our study. It was neither 
a randomised controlled trial nor a population-based 
study. However, the overall survival and patients’ 
characteristics in this study were similar to those of 
population-based studies from similar large metropolitan 
areas—Osaka, Japan,13 and New York, USA35 Although 
the total number of patients was large, there were few 
patients with arrest caused by asphyxia, drowning, or 
traumatic brain injury. The quality of bystander 
resuscitation was not assessed, and resuscitation-related 
event times were known for only 70% of the study 
population. Additionally, post-resuscitation care could 
not be standardised. Recent studies3,4,36–38 have shown that 
therapeutic hypothermia can result in better outcomes 
for patients with out-of-hospital ventricular ﬁ brillation. 
In this study, few patients were treated by induction of 
hypothermia, and the proportions given this treatment 
were similar in the two bystander resuscitation groups.
On the basis of these ﬁ ndings, we conclude that 
bystander cardiac-only resuscitation is the preferred 
approach to resuscitation for adult patients with 
witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest especially those 
with apnoea, shockable cardiac rhythm, or short periods 
of untreated arrest.
