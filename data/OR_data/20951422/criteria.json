            "criteria": "We separated the systematic review and meta-analysis into two parts: in the primary analysis, randomized clinical trials were included and in the secondary, observational cohort studies. Only three randomized clinical trials have been conducted where adult patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest received randomized instructions by a dispatcher for either chest compression-only CPR or standard CPR, and all three trials were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. For observational studies, the following eligibility criteria were required for inclusion: (1) observational cohort studies (no case series); (2) comparison between chest-compression-only CPR and standard CPR; (3) survival data available; (3) adult population; (4) unstratified cohort (e.g., arrests of non-cardiac origin only); (5) bystander CPR; (6) out-of-hospital arrest. Articles were considered if published in English and German; this notwithstanding, no other foreign language study was found.",
