            "abstract": "A combination of solid dispersion and surface adsorption techniques was used to enhance the dissolution of a poorly water-soluble drug, BAY 12-9566. In addition to dissolution enhancement, this method allows compression of the granulated dispersion into tablets. Gelucire 50/13 (polyglycolized glycerides) was used as the solid dispersion carrier. Hot-melt granulation was performed to adsorb the melt of the drug and Gelucire 50/13 onto the surface of Neusilin US2 (magnesium alumino silicate), the surface adsorbent. Dispersion granules using various ratios of drug-Gelucire 50/13-Neusilin US2 were thus prepared. The dissolution profiles of BAY 12-9566 from the dispersion granules and corresponding physical mixtures were evaluated using USP Type II apparatus at 75 rpm. The dissolution medium consisted of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) with 1% w/v sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Dissolution of BAY 12-9566 from the dispersion granules was enhanced compared to the physical mixture. The dissolution of BAY 12-9566 increased as a function of increased Gelucire 50/13 and Neusilin US2 loading and decreased with increased drug loading. In contrast to the usually observed decrease in dissolution on storage, an enhancement in dissolution was observed for the dispersion granules stored at 40 degrees C/75% relative humidity (RH) for 2 and 4 weeks. Additionally, the flow and compressibility properties of dispersion granules were improved significantly when compared to the drug alone or the corresponding physical mixture. The ternary dispersion granules were compressed easily into tablets with up to 30% w/w drug loading. The extent of dissolution of drug from these tablets was greater than that from the uncompressed dispersion granules."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Dramatic differences in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) reported from different geographical locations require analysis. We therefore compared patients with OHCA in the two largest cities in Sweden with regard to various factors at resuscitation and outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      All patients suffering an OHCA in Stockholm and Goteborg between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2001, in whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted were included in this retrospective analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All together, 969 OHCA in Stockholm and 398 in Goteborg were registered during the 18-month study period. There were no differences in terms of age, gender, and percentage of witnessed cases or percentage of patients who had received bystander CPR. However, the percentage of patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) at arrival of the ambulance crew was 18% in Stockholm versus 31% in Goteborg (P <0.0001). The percentage of patients who were alive 1 month after cardiac arrest was 2.5% in Stockholm versus 6.8% in Goteborg (P=0.0008). Various time intervals such as cardiac arrest to calling for an ambulance, cardiac arrest to the start of CPR and calling for an ambulance to its arrival were all significantly longer in Stockholm than in Goteborg.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Survival was almost three times higher in Goteborg than in Stockholm amongst patients suffering an OHCA. This is primarily explained by a higher occurrence of VF at the time of arrival of the ambulance crew, which in turn probably is explained by shorter delays in Goteborg. The reason for the difference in time intervals is most likely multifactorial, with a significantly higher ambulance density in Goteborg as one possible explanation."

            "abstract": "Passive calcium ion permeability across liposome bilayers is increased during exposure to fluid shear forces attainable in the mammalian vasculature. In this study, liposomes prepared from three different lipid mixtures (phosphatidylcholine alone; phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol; a mixture of anionic and cationic phospholipids plus cholesterol) are exposed to uniform shear stress in a rotational viscometer. Liposome permeability to calcium ion is estimated from continuous measurement of free intraliposome calcium ion concentration using a fluorescence technique. Calcium ion permeability in the absence of fluid force and susceptibility to shear-induced permeability modulation are positively correlated with estimated bilayer compressibility. Fluid shear forces are presumed to influence bilayer packing and modulate defect formation in proportion to bilayer compressibility. Bilayer defects produced by fluid forces may increase liposome permeability."

Marked extravasation of protein tracers in the nerve occurred where there was compression by 60- and 90-g-force compression, and capillaries in the nerve showed the opening of tight junction and an increase of vesicular transport under the electron microscopy. This situation indicated breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier, with consequent edema formation and was seen as enhancement on MR imaging.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging can detect morphologic and functional changes of blood-nerve barrier in the nerve induced by mechanical compression."

Proponents of vertebroplasty have recently demonstrated that many vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are mobile and positional correction can lead to clinically significant height restoration. The current investigation tested the hypothesis that positional maneuvers do not achieve the same degree of vertebral height correction as kyphoplasty balloon tamps for the reduction of low-energy VCFs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-five consecutive patients with a total of 43 osteoporotic VCFs were entered into a prospective analysis. Each patient was sequentially evaluated for postural and balloon vertebral fracture reduction. Preoperative standing and lateral radiographs of the fractured vertebrae were compared with prone cross-table lateral radiographs with the patient in a hyper-extension position and on pelvic and sternal rolls. Following positional manipulation, patients underwent a unilateral balloon kyphoplasty. Postoperative standing radiographs were evaluated for the percentage of height restoration related to positioning and balloon kyphoplasty.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the middle portion of the vertebrae, the percentage available for restoration restored with extension positioning was 10.4% (median 11.1%) and after balloon kyphoplasty was 57.0% (median 62.2%). This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Thus, kyphoplasty provided an additional 46.6% of the height available for restoration from the positioning alone. With operative positioning, 51.2% of VCFs had >10% restoration of the central portion of the vertebral body, whereas 90.7% of fractures improved at least 10% following balloon kyphoplasty (p<0.002).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Although this study supports the concept that many VCFs can be moved with positioning, balloon kyphoplasty enhanced the height reduction >4.5-fold over the positioning maneuver alone and accounted for over 80% of the ultimate reduction.

            "abstract": "Mechanical stress is one of the risk factors believed to influence intervertebral disc degeneration. Animal models have shown that certain regimes of compressive loading can induce a cascade of biological effects that ultimately results in cellular and structural changes in the disc. It has been proposed that both cell-mediated breakdown of collagen and the compromised stability of collagen with loss of anular tension could result in degradation of lamellae in the anulus fibrosus (AF). To determine whether this may be important in the AF, we subjected entire rings of de-cellularized AF tissue to MMP-1 digestion with or without tension. Biomechanical testing found trends of decreasing strength and stiffness when tissues were digested without tension compared with those with tension. To determine the physiologic significance of tissue level tension in the AF, we used an established in vivo murine model to apply a disc compression insult known to cause degeneration. Afterward, that motion segment was placed in fixed-angle bending to impose tissue level tension on part of the AF and compression on the contralateral side. We found that the AF on the convex side of bending retained a healthy lamellar appearance, while the AF on the concave side resembled tissues that had undergone degeneration by loading alone. Varying the time of onset and duration of bending revealed that even a brief duration applied immediately after cessation of compression was beneficial to AF structure on the convex side of bending. Our results suggest that both cell-mediated events and cell-independent mechanisms may contribute to the protective effect of tissue level tension in the AF."

            "abstract": "Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS) is a new gas-driven CPR device providing automatic chest compression and active decompression. This is a report of the first 100 consecutive cases treated with LUCAS due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (58% asystole, 42% ventricular fibrillation (VF)). Safety aspects were also investigated and it was found that LUCAS can be used safely regarding noise levels and oxygen concentrations within the ambulance. A crash test (10G) showed no displacement of the device from the manikin. Of the 71 patients with witnessed cardiac arrest, 39% received bystander CPR. In those 28 patients where LUCAS-CPR was initiated more than 15 min after the ambulance alarm and in the 29 unwitnessed cases, none survived for 30 days. Of the 43 witnessed cases treated with LUCAS within 15 min, 24 had VF and 15 (63%) of these cases achieved a stable return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 6 (25%) of them survived with a good neurological recovery after 30 days; 5 (26%) of the 19 patients with asystole achieved ROSC and 1 (5%) survived for over 30 days. One patient where ROSC could not be achieved was transported with on-going LUCAS-CPR to the catheter laboratory and after PCI for an occluded LAD a stable ROSC occurred, but the patient never regained consciousness and died 15 days later. To conclude, establishment of an adequate cerebral circulation as quickly as possible after cardiac arrest is mandatory for a good outcome. In this report patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest receiving LUCAS-CPR within 15 min from the ambulance call had a 30-day survival of 25% in VF and 5% in asystole, but if the interval was more than 15 min, there were no 30-day survivors."

The compressive strength and modulus, stress relaxation and fluoride release were tested over 56 days. The results of this investigation indicate that heat treatment had no significant effect on the conventional GIC used but significantly affected the resin modified GIC by increasing both the compressive strength and modulus and reducing the stress relaxation characteristics and the fluoride release. The use of GIC to produce inlay or onlay restorations that adhere to tooth tissue and release fluoride would be highly desirable.

            "abstract": "Mechanisms of blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were studied in a canine model with implanted mitral and aortic flow probes and by use of cineangiography. Intrathoracic pressure (ITP) fluctuations were induced by a circumferential pneumatic vest, with and without simultaneous ventilation, and by use of positive-pressure ventilation alone. Vascular volume and compression rate were altered with each CPR mode. Antegrade mitral flow was interpreted as left ventricular (LV) inflow, and antegrade aortic flow was interpreted as LV outflow. The pneumatic vest was expected to elevate ITP uniformly and thus produce simultaneous LV inflow and LV outflow throughout compression. This pattern, the passive conduit of \"thoracic pump\" physiology, was unequivocally demonstrated only during ITP elevation with positive-pressure ventilation alone at slow rates. During vest CPR, LV outflow started promptly with the onset of compression, whereas LV inflow was delayed. At compression rates of 50 times/min and normal vascular filling pressures, the delay was sufficiently long that all LV filling occurred with release of compression. This is the pattern that would be expected with direct LV compression or \"cardiac pump\" physiology. During the early part of the compression phase, catheter tip transducer LV and left atrial pressure measurements demonstrated gradients necessitating mitral valve closure, while cineangiography showed dye droplets moving from the large pulmonary veins retrograde to the small pulmonary veins. When the compression rate was reduced and/or when intravascular pressures were raised with volume infusion, LV inflow was observed at some point during the compressive phase. Thus, under these conditions, features of both thoracic pump and cardiac pump physiology occurred within the same compression. Our findings are not explained by the conventional conceptions of either thoracic pump or cardiac compression CPR mechanisms alone."

The present study compared the efficacy of topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% (AzaSite; Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc, NC, USA) combined with warm compresses (azithromycin group) to warm compresses alone (compress group) in patients with posterior blepharitis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-one patients diagnosed with posterior blepharitis were randomized in an open-label study to receive either azithromycin plus warm compresses (10 patients), or compresses alone (11 patients). All patients were instructed to apply compresses to each eye for 5-10 minutes twice daily for 14 days. Each eye in the azithromycin group also received azithromycin solution (1 drop) twice daily for the first 2 days followed by once daily for the next 12 days. Patients were evaluated at study initiation (visit 1) and at end of treatment (visit 2) for the severity of five clinical signs: eyelid debris, eyelid redness, eyelid swelling, meibomian gland (MG) plugging, and the quality of MG secretion. At visit 2, patients also rated their degree of overall symptomatic relief.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty patients completed the study. At visit 2, patients in the azithromycin group demonstrated significant improvements in MG plugging, MG secretions, and eyelid redness as compared with the compress group. In the azithromycin group, MG plugging resolved completely in three patients and MG secretion returned to normal in two patients; no such results were seen in the compress group. Furthermore, a higher percentage of patients in the azithromycin group rated overall symptomatic relief as excellent or good.

Data were collected by means of a questionnaire, which was filled out between March and July 2000 for all cases attended to by the Vienna Ambulance Service. A total of 2812 cases were documented. The most frequent causes of trauma were falls from heights less than 1 meter (50%) and traffic accidents (17%). The most frequent injuries were injuries to the extremities (59%) and head and traumatic brain injuries (42%). Most patients were \"moderately\" or \"severely\" injured (69% and 29%, respectively), but life-threatening injuries were rare (2%). Bystanders were present in 57% of the cases. The most frequently required first aid measures were \"application of a dressing\" and \"positioning\" of the patient. \"Control of haemorrhage\", \"ensuring accident site safety\" and \"extrication\" of the patient were less frequently required. \"Clearing of the airway\", \"precautions against hypothermia\" and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation were very rarely required. Bystanders were most frequently policemen, relatives or friends of the patient, and strangers. The vast majority of bystanders had no training in first aid or had only attended the first aid course required to attain a driving license. We found a clear relationship between the level of first aid training and the quality of first aid measures provided.

            "abstract": "Cross-linked amylose starch (CLA), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), and HPMC/CLA matrices were prepared by direct compression. HPMC was used to slow down the enzymatic degradation of CLA matrices. CLA was either granulated alone and mixed with HPMC or cogranulated with the latter. Compaction characteristics of the powder, hydration and mechanical properties of the resulting matrices, as well as the release profiles of three model drugs were investigated. The results showed that wet granulation of CLA in the presence of 10% HPMC improved significantly the flow properties of the powder without compromising its compactibility. Both CLA and HPMC deformed mainly by plastic flow (yield pressures are 75 and 124 MPa, respectively), but CLA exhibited a stronger elastic component (elastic recoveries are 18.4 and 11.5%, respectively). The values of yield pressure increased linearly with the concentration of HPMC. The addition of HPMC to CLA slightly decreased the resistance to consolidation but the crushing force of the final compacts was found to be proportional to the HPMC concentration. Mechanical studies on swollen matrices revealed that CLA formed a stronger gel than HPMC or CLA/HPMC mixture, and swelling and erosion of the tablets increased with HPMC content and incubation time. The in vitro release kinetics of three model drugs (pseudeoephedrine sulfate, sodium diclofenac, and prednisone) showed a clear effect of drug solubility and presence of alpha-amylase in the dissolution medium on the release rate. The addition of HPMC to CLA protected the tablets against alpha-amylase hydrolysis and reduced the release rate of prednisone and sodium diclofenac. The release of pseudoephedrine sulfate was fast and independent of HPMC and occurred mainly by diffusion."

Primary MSCs were isolated and expended in monolayer culture. The cells were seeded in alginate constructs or in pellet culture. The time course of chondrogenic differentiation was assessed by real-time QPCR of mRNA expression analysis for cartilage specific markers. Collagen types II and X mRNA, not present in undifferentiated MSCs, were detectable by 2-4 days of chondrogenic induction and continued to rise significantly throughout the culture period of 10 days (p < 0.001). Basal levels of gene expression for Sox-9 and aggrecan were evident in undifferentiated MSCs, although chondrogenic induction for a period of 8 days resulted in an increased trend in the gene expression levels. The alginate system was also used in mechanical conditioning studies. Dynamic compression was applied, in an intermittent regimen, at a strain amplitude of 15% and frequency of 1 Hz in the presence and absence of 10 ng/ml TGFbeta3, for a period of 8 days. Results indicated significant changes in the levels of mRNA expression for the chondrogenic markers. For example, by day 8, the application of the strain regimen alone caused an up-regulation in all the chondrogenic markers compared to the control samples (no TGFbeta, no compression). However, the combined effects of strain and TGFbeta on these markers were more complex than purely additive."

Many of the life-saving efforts and advances in critical care situations have now begun to focus more and more on how, through evolving technology, the average person can save lives and perhaps even spare precious intensive care unit (ICU) resources. A striking example was the recent study conducted at the Chicago airports at which automated external defibrillators (AEDs) were deployed throughout the airline terminals for use by the public at large. Not only did random bystanders on the concourses save an extremely high percentage of cardiac arrest patients with the AEDs, most patients rapidly awakened, even before the arrival of professional rescuers. Thus, this technology-assisted intervention, performed by an average person, pre-empted the need for many other critical care interventions and prolonged care in the ICU. Equipped with automated prompts to improve performance, new technology also exists to help to monitor the inadequacies and too-frequent interruption of life-saving chest compressions during basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

To determine the effect of public access defibrillation (PAD) programs on survival and other outcomes after SCA, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association (AHA), and others funded a large prospective randomized trial. The results of this study were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine and support current AHA recommendations for lay rescuer AED programs and emphasis on planning, training, and practice of CPR and use of AEDs. The purpose of this statement is to highlight important findings of the Public Access Defibrillation Trial and summarize implications of these findings for healthcare providers, healthcare policy advocates, and the AHA training network."

As part of this study, the authors conducted a retrospective observational cohort study that included all children younger than 18 years of age with out-of-hospital CPA, during an 11-year period from 1991-2002. CPA was defined as patient being pulseless, apneic, and requiring chest compressions. Data were collected from ambulance call reports and centralized dispatch data and were reviewed by two independent investigators.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 503 children with CPA in the sample. Mean age was 5.6 years (range, 0-17 yr); 58.4% of patients were male, and 37.8% were younger than 1 year of age. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) first was started by a bystander in 32.4% of cases, whereas 66.0% were unwitnessed arrests. Initial rhythms were asystole 77.2% of the time, pulseless electrical activity 16.4% of the time, and ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia 4% of the time. Annual incidence was 9.1/100,000 children. CPA was witnessed in 34.0% of cases; 80.7% of these were bystander-witnessed, and 18.1% were EMS-witnessed. Primary pathogenic cause of arrest was medical in 61.2% of cases, trauma in 37.2% of cases, and indeterminate in 1.6% of cases. Initial underlying physiologic compromise of witnessed arrests was judged to be respiratory in 39.8% of cases, sudden collapse (presumed electrical) in 16.4% of cases, progressive shock in 1.2% of cases, and indeterminate in 42.6% of cases. Presumed etiology was trauma, 37.6%; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), 20.3%; and respiratory disease, 11.6%, most commonly. Survival to hospital discharge was 2.0%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This is one of the largest population-based, prospective cohorts of pediatric CPA reported to date, and it reveals that most pediatric arrests are unwitnessed and receive no bystander CPR. Those that are witnessed most often are caused by respiratory arrests or trauma. Trauma, SIDS, and respiratory disease are the most common etiologies overall. These data are vital to planning large resuscitation trials looking at specific interventions (i.e., increasing bystander CPR) and highlight the need for better strategies for prevention and early recognition."

            "abstract": "Airway smooth muscle constriction leads to the development of compressive stress on bronchial epithelial cells. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to an apical-to-basal transcellular pressure difference equivalent to the computed stress in the airway during bronchoconstriction demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The response is pressure dependent and rapid, with phosphorylation increasing 14-fold in 30 min, and selective, since p38 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation remains unchanged after pressure application. Transcellular pressure also elicits a ninefold increase in expression of mRNA encoding heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) after 1 h, followed by prominent immunostaining for pro-HB-EGF after 6 h. Inhibition of the ERK pathway with PD-98059 results in a dose-dependent reduction in pressure-induced HB-EGF gene expression. The magnitude of the HB-EGF response to transcellular pressure and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (1 ng/ml) is similar, and the combined mechanical and inflammatory stimulus is more effective than either stimulus alone. These results demonstrate that compressive stress is a selective and potent activator of signal transduction and gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells."

Sixty-two (26%) of these cases were medical, but only 24 (11.5%) required immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Only one out of the four successful resuscitations finally left hospital alive. In trauma, there was no significant enhancement of survival due to the presence of the team by comparing the expected against observed mortality and the injury severity score for age-matched groups. The value of flying squads as a training aid, perception of the local community and relationships with other emergency services are discussed.

Twenty-nine patients with marked thyroid enlargement were identified: 13 unilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 40 g (mean 122 g, range 41-380 g), and 16 bilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 80 g (mean 160 g, range 82-404 g). Twenty-five patients had compressive symptomatology, 18 had tracheal narrowing and/or displacement, 19 had substernal extension, and one had superior vena cava syndrome. Unilateral vocal cord dysfunction was present in two of three patients with carcinoma and one of 26 patients with benign disease (P = 0.03). Pathology consisted of nodular goiter (11), adenoma (5), carcinoma (3), Grave's disease (5), and toxic multinodular goiter (5). All patients had an uncomplicated endotracheal intubation without the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope as predicted on the basis of preoperative laryngoscopic findings. Ease of intubation was unrelated to the extent of abnormality seen on imaging studies of the neck. Thyroidectomy alone was effective in relieving compressive symptoms with no incidence of nerve injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, or tracheomalacia. Six (21%) of 29 patients had temporary hypocalcemia compared to eight (13%) of 62 patients with lesser thyroid enlargement (P = 0.36). One patient with an unresectable follicular carcinoma died from aspiration pneumonia three weeks following tracheostomy placement. Marked thyroid enlargement and upper airway compression is predominantly caused by benign disease; however, when there is associated recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, carcinoma is more common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "We introduce a simple intermembrane junction system in which to explore pattern and structure formation by membrane-bound proteins. The junction consists of a planar lipid bilayer to which one species of protein (an IgG antibody) is bound, forming a 2D, compressible fluid. Upon the adhesion of a second lipid bilayer, the formerly uniformly distributed proteins rapidly reorganize into patterns of dense and sparse zones. Using a combination of complementary imaging techniques (fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence interference contrast microscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer), we reconstruct the 3D structure of these intermembrane patterns with nanometer-scale topographic resolution, revealing the orientation of the proteins. The patterns form as the rapid bilayer-bilayer adhesion, often radiating outward from an initial, circular contact site, pushes aside the antibodies, sweeping them into areas of high density and clearing low-density regions. Coarsening of these local features is energetically costly and therefore kinetically trapped; the patterns do not change over tens of minutes. These studies demonstrate that membrane mechanical forces alone, i.e., in the absence of specific biochemical interactions, can drive microm-scale organization of membrane proteins."

In this study we used the solid-state stability method, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and isothermal microcalorimetry to investigate the interactions between L-cysteine (as a free base or as a salt) and excipients commonly used in gum. These excipients include xylitol, sorbitol, magnesium stearate, Pharmagum S, Every T Toco and Smily 2 Toco. The influence of temperature and relative humidity during a three-month storage period on gum formulation was also studied. Cysteine alone was stable at 25 degrees C/60% RH and 45 degrees C/75% RH whether stored in open or closed glass ambers. As a component of binary mixtures, cysteine base remained stable at lower temperature and humidity but the salt form was incompatible with all the studied excipients. The results obtained with the different methods corresponded with each other. At high temperature and humidity, excipient incompatibility with both forms of cysteine was obvious. Such sensitivity to heat and humidity during storage was also seen in studies on gum formulations. It was also found that cysteine is sensitive to high pressure and increase in temperature induced by compression. The results suggest that the final product should be well protected from temperature and humidity and, for example, cooling process before compression should be considered."

Among these patients, 1294 were considered of primary cardiac origin patients by the EMT and 722 of these patients suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest. Bystander CPR were performed in 28.4% of these witnessed patients and the discharge rate was 3.5% overall and 11.4% in witnessed VF/VT. Outcome analysis showed that a discharge rate in witnessed primary cardiac arrest was 30% in prehospital resuscitation which was 7.5 times higher than in-hospital emergency room resuscitation groups (4.0%). The longer the interval between an emergency telephone call and defibrillation, the lower the 1 month survival rate, which reached almost 0% at 30 min. Follow up evaluation after discharge revealed that the survival rate rapidly decreased from 24 h to 3 months, then became a plateau in primary cardiac patients was rapidly decreased from 24 h to 1 month, then became a near plateau in non-cardiac origin group. To improve the resuscitation rate in the prehospital phase, a prehospital medical control system should be developed with expansion of on scene techniques by Japanese paramedics such as tracheal intubation, administration of emergency drugs and early defibrillation with standing orders. Education and motivation of first responders will be needed and every effort should be concentrated on improving bystander CPR rate."

We hypothesized that the hospital discharge rate from rural OOHCA was affected by the same factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied all OOHCAs in 1998 for rural Alachua County, Florida, with one emergency medical system (EMS) transport provider and three hospitals. All EMS identified OOHCA were reviewed retrospectively, as were EMS and hospital records. The 1998 County population was 211403; 1495 deaths from all causes occurred (70.7/10(4) pop). Of 167 OOHCAs (7.9/10(4) pop), 145 were of cardiac etiology; 22 were excluded (13 scene deaths, four traumatic, one intraoperative and three respiratory arrests, one arrest during a hospital-to-hospital transfer) and in eight outcome data were not available in any form. A total of 137/145 (94.5%) OOHCA patients had analyzable data. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test and ANOVA. Alpha was set at 0.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 25 patients (18.2% of OOHCA) with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), six survived (4.4% of total, 24% of those with ROSC) to discharge from hospital (four to a skilled nursing facility, one each home with and without assistance). Four patients were still alive at >or=1 year post arrest. Asystole as the initial rhythm (P=0.014), and emergency department (ED) CPR time (8 vs. 15.5 min, P=0.042 for survivors vs. non-survivors) were the only factors statistically affecting survival. While bystander CPR was not significantly different between groups, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients surviving in the ED who had ROSC, and a higher proportion who had ROSC after bystander CPR. Time to defibrillation in nonsurvivors, while not statistically different between city and county patient groups, was clinically different. Statistical significance would likely have been achieved with a larger study population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest improvement in response time and bystander CPR might further improve survival in a rural setting."

            "abstract": "The chain of survival in outcome from major trauma is equally as important as its well established concept in survival from cardiac arrest. Preventive measures have been shown to be an effective means of reducing death from trauma, and the standard of pre-hospital care for those surviving the primary injury is improving in many trauma systems. The optimal pre-hospital interventions are still debated, but evidence suggests that patients with severe head injury in particular will benefit significantly from pre-hospital rapid-sequence intubation and field stabilization, whereas those with penetrating injury require rapid evacuation to hospital with minimal intervention. Pre-hospital asystole from trauma has a universally poor outcome. When delivering appropriate care, several helicopter-based systems have shown improvements in outcome compared with ground-based systems. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recently published guidelines on resuscitation, with particular relevance to pre-hospital trauma care. The importance of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, oxygenation, and the avoidance of iatrogenic morbidity are stressed."

            "abstract": "In sudden cardiac deaths outside hospitals, the present performance of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation-basic life support (CPR-BLS), as a bridge to advanced life support (ALS) attempts for restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), still yields suboptimal results. Therefore, future education research should develop more effective, simpler and quicker ways to enable everyone to acquire the necessary BLS skills. Individualized self-training by lay persons is being revived. Although airway control and direct mouth-to-mouth ventilation skills are difficult to acquire, they must continue to be taught to the lay public and health professionals, primarily for use on relatives and friends where infection risk is not a problem. In children and trauma victims, steps A and B alone may be lifesavers. The best way to ventilate and oxygenate during the initiation of brief external CPR-BLS should be re-evaluated. There is a great difference between animals and humans in the behavior of the airway and thorax during coma, and thus in the need for added positive pressure ventilation. During chest compressions in humans, steps A and B are needed. Details deserve re-evaluation. The low perfusion pressures (borderline blood flows) produced by standard external CPR remain the most serious limitation of this method. In spite of extensive efforts so far, novel laboratory research to remedy this limitation is important for the development of more effective emergency artificial circulation. The results of such studies are greatly influenced by different details in animal models. Active compression-decompression (ACD) external CPR, also called 'push-pull' CPR, with a plunger-type device used by hand or a machine, and intermittent abdominal compression (IAC) external CPR are both promising modifications of standard external CPR. Both need further experimental and clinical clarification. For BLS, developing a more effective purely manual CPR-BLS method for help in rapid ROSC should be given high priority. Portable external CPR machines need improvements. They will serve for bridging ROSC-resistant cases through transport and ALS attempts, primarily by freeing the hands of health professionals for more effective sophisticated ALS measures."

            "abstract": "The effects of listening to time-compressed speech alone and in a competing babble, with speech in and out of phase between ears, were studied in 10 children with no apparent auditory or learning problems and in 10 children with learning disabilities and a suspected central auditory processing problem. The children ranged in age from 8 to 10 years. Both groups showed significant decreases in speech recognition when speech was compressed at a rate of 60 percent as compared with recognition of normal-rate speech. However, the children in the learning disabilities group showed a greater decrease. Listening to time-compressed speech in a binaural mode resulted in better speech recognition than in a monaural mode for both groups. When speech was shifted 180 degrees out of phase between ears, both groups demonstrated a release from masking for speech presented at a fast rate (60% compression), but the normal group had a greater release from masking than the learning disabilities group. Also, the learning disabilities group did not show a release from masking for normal-rate speech (0% compression). When both groups listened to speech that had been compressed and presented in a babble, their performance supported a multiplicative distortion theory, with children in the learning disabilities group showing a slightly greater multiplicative effect than the children with no apparent problems. The results support the necessity of binaural hearing to maximize auditory performance in difficult listening situations in two populations of subjects."

The effects of percutaneous diskectomy on the intradiscal pressure of the human disk are not known. Our aims were to determine (a) whether removal of nucleus through automated percutaneous diskectomy significantly reduces intradiscal pressure without altering the disk geometry and stiffness, and if so, how much nucleus removal is required to achieve these goals; and (b) whether the effects of conventional diskectomy on these same parameters are equivalent to removal of nucleus through automated percutaneous diskectomy. Cyclic compressive loads of 20-900 N were applied to lumbar disks. Conventional diskectomy or automated percutaneous diskectomy (performed for 40 min with biomechanical measurements made four times at 10-min intervals) was then performed under zero load and the specimens retested under the same cyclic compressive loading. There were significant (p < 0.01) decreases in intradiscal pressure (by 7% under 900 N) after 10 min of automated percutaneous lumbar diskectomy. There were no further significant decreases in pressure during the next 30 min of percutaneous diskectomy. There were also significant decreases in pressure due to a puncture hole made with the Nucleotome trephine alone, without removal of disk material, and there was no difference in pressure after trephining alone and after percutaneous diskectomy. Decreases in disk height were significant, ranging from 5% at 10 min to 7% at 40 min of treatment. There were equivalent decreases in intradiscal pressure and disk height due to removal of similar amounts of nucleus during conventional diskectomy and during 40 min of percutaneous diskectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Unwitnessed cardiac arrest patients otherwise have a dismal prognosis because of prolonged circulatory arrest times and late initiation of defibrillation attempts.

            "abstract": "Neurovascular compression syndromes at the thoracic outlet generally present with predominantly arterial, venous, or neurogenic symptoms. The arterial abnormalities produce unique problems in diagnosis and management, and usually affect young, otherwise healthy, active individuals. Between 1984 and 1995 23 patients presented to our facility, with acute symptoms of arterial occlusion or embolization, found to be originating from the axillosubclavian arterial segment. The group comprised 14 females and nine males, ranging from 15 to 74 years, with an average age of 37 years. There were seven competitive athletes, three industrial workers, and 13 home, office, or service workers. The most severe presenting symptoms, occurring alone or in combination, and ranked in order of frequency observed, were: arm 'claudication' (74%), hand ischemia (48%), and digital gangrene (44%). Transaxillary thoracic outlet decompression was undertaken in 22 cases. This was combined with arterial reconstruction in 11 cases and sympathectomy for ischemic causalgia in seven cases. Transaxillary resection of a cervical rib was accomplished in 8 cases. There was one postoperative graft occlusion (PTFE), corrected by thrombectomy, with cumulative secondary patency (to 64 months), and one secondary embolic occlusion. Excepting the two secondary procedures, no patient had recurrent symptoms at a mean follow-up of 61 months. Effective and durable correction of the axillosubclavian arterial compressive abnormalities requires adequate thoracic outlet decompression, and anatomic vascular reconstruction when necessary. Failed prior procedures were a consequence of inaccurate diagnosis, failure to identify and correct the proximal embolizing arterial lesion, or inadequate decompression. Unilateral Raynaud's symptoms require meticulous investigation for arterial compression at the thoracic outlet with careful interpretation of subtle angiographic findings."

However, the benefits of the new guidelines remain undetermined and their influence has not been published in Asia. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing the new resuscitation guidelines and identify factors that influence the discharge survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in an Asian metropolitan city.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      This was an observational cohort study of all OHCA patients seen by the emergency medical service during the period before (Nov 2003 to Oct 2005) and after (May 2006 to Oct 2008) implementing the new resuscitation guidelines.

The rate of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pulseless VT), rate of witnessed arrest, and rate of bystander CPR were much lower than in Western studies. After multivariate logistic regression, factors related to discharge survival were witnessed arrest and initial rhythm with VF/pulseless VT.

Independent factors of survival-to-hospital discharge are witnessed arrest and initial rhythm with VF/pulseless VT.

            "abstract": "The DNA repair protein O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (ATase) is a major component of resistance to treatment with methylating agents and nitrosoureas. Inactivation of the protein, via the administration of pseudosubstrates, prior to chemotherapy has been shown to improve the latter's therapeutic index in animal models of human tumours. We have also shown that rational scheduling of temozolomide, so that drug is administered at the ATase nadir after the preceding dose, increases tumour growth delay in these models. We now report the results of combining these two approaches. Nude mice bearing A375M human melanoma xenografts were treated with vehicle or 100 mg/kg temozolomide ip for 5 doses spaced 4, 12 or 24 hr apart. Each dose was preceded by the injection of vehicle or 20 mg/kg 4BTG. All treatments resulted in significant delays in tumour quintupling time compared with controls: by 6.2, 5.9 and 16.8 days, respectively, for 24-, 12- and 4-hourly temozolomide alone and by 22.3, 21.3 and 22.1 days, respectively, in combination with 4BTG. Weight loss due to TMZ was unaffected by the presence of 4BTG. This was of the order of 6.2-10.6% with 24- and 12-hourly administration and 17.4-20.1% (p < 0.0001) with 4-hourly treatment. In our model, combining daily temozolomide with 4-BTG confers increased antitumour activity equivalent to that achieved by compressing the temozolomide schedule but with less toxicity. Using temozolomide schedule compression with 4-BTG does not improve on this result, suggesting that ATase inactivation with pseudosubstrates is a more promising means of enhancing the activity of temozolomide than compressed scheduling."

            "abstract": "In swimming sharks, vertebrae are subjected, in part, to compressive loads as axial muscles contract. We currently have no information about which vertebral elements, centra, arch cartilages, or both, actually bear compressive loads in cartilaginous vertebrae. To address this issue, the goal of this experiment was to determine the load-bearing ability of arch and centrum cartilages in compression, to determine the material properties of shark vertebrae, and to document fracture patterns in the centra with and without the arches. Intact vertebrae and vertebrae with the arch cartilages experimentally removed (centra alone) were subjected to compressive loading to failure at a single strain rate. The maximum compressive forces sustained by the vertebrae and the centra are statistically indistinguishable. Thus we conclude that under these testing conditions the arch does not bear appreciable loads. Independent evidence for this conclusion comes from the fact that vertebrae fail in compression at the centra, and not at the arches. Overall, the results of these mechanical tests suggest that the neural arches are not the primary load-bearing structure during axial compression."

Both formulations containing tartaric acid produced tablets with a lower surface roughness and with less tendency to stick to tablet punch faces than the two formulations containing citric acid alone.

As the initial symptom of Hodgkin's disease, it is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A case report of a 46-year-old man who presented with signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression and was found to have an extradural mass in the cervical and thoracic spine is described. Biopsy revealed Hodgkin's disease. This case report represents a unique case of a patient with Hodgkin's disease presenting with epidural disease, with spinal cord compression as the only apparent site of initial clinical involvement. A review of the literature of patients with Hodgkin's disease presenting with spinal cord compression from 1970 to the present is presented.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The patient, whom we report, received chemotherapy followed by external beam radiation therapy and achieved complete resolution of symptoms and a complete response by radiologic criteria. Based on a review of the literature, Hodgkin's disease involving the spinal epidural space is very responsive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a good prognosis for both functional recovery (86%), complete response (61%), and long term survival.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is successful treatment for Hodgkin's disease presenting with spinal cord compression. For the rare patient who presents with spinal cord compression as the initial symptom of Hodgkin's disease, the therapeutic options include chemotherapy alone, radiation therapy alone, or combined modality therapy."

In hospital there were signs of intrathoracic bleeding. A left thoracotomy revealed a cardiac rupture of the left ventricle and a large pericardial tear. Intraoperative evaluation of the heart as well as postoperative enzyme levels and ECG did not indicate acute myocardial infarction. The rupture may therefore be traumatic. The cardiac rupture was sutured five hours after the initial resuscitation, and the patient discharged from the intensive care unit two days after the rupture without clinical signs of neurological injury. A precordial thump is advised before start of external chest compression. One beneficial effect may be that the ventricles empty and the risk of traumatic rupture during compression is reduced."

The aim of this in vitro study therefore was to determine the loads acting on fixator rods and cages after anterior compared to transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Six intact human lumbar spine specimens (L1-5) were loaded in a spine tester with pure moments (+/-7.5 N m) in the frontal, sagittal and transverse plane. Loading was repeated, first, after the segments L2-3 and L4-5 were instrumented either with an anterior or a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion cage \"stand alone\" and, second, after additional stabilisation with an internal fixator.

In this loading direction an axial distraction force of in median up to 140 N, an axial compression force of up to 100 N, and a resultant bending moment of up to 1.1 N m were measured in each rod. These loads tended to be lower for the anterior compared to the transforaminal approach. For comparison, the load applied was +/-7.5 N m. The axial strains recorded in the four \"corners\" of the cages considerably varied from one specimen to the other. Differences in cage strain between the two approaches could not be detected.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      The loads acting on the rods of the fixator were small compared to the load that was applied. Thus, other structures such as the cages or the facet joints still play an important role in load transfer. The type of approach (anterior or transforaminal) had only little effect on the loading of the rods. This also applies to the local loading of the cages, which probably more depends on the fit between cage and endplates and on the local stiffness properties of the adjacent vertebral bodies."

A tamping-type encapsulation apparatus was used to fill the capsules. The four formulations that were tested included MCC alone, MCC blended with fumed silica, SMCC, and high-density SMCC (SMCC-HD). The mean capsule weight and the average variation in mean capsule weight of each formulation were determined. Both SMCC products exhibited better flow than the MCC alone, with SMCC-HD being the freest flowing of the powders investigated. Capsules filled with the SMCC products had higher fill weights than those containing the MCC powders. The SMCC-containing capsules exhibited the lowest variation in weight, although these findings were not significantly different from either of the MCC-containing capsules. Significantly higher weight variations were found in capsules filled with SMCC-HD. A relationship between Carr's compressibility index and capsule weight variation was found, with more compressible materials producing more uniformly filled capsules. No relationship could be established between powder flow and capsule weight uniformity. These findings suggest that powder flow may not be a critical parameter in ensuring capsule weight uniformity when the encapsulation equipment utilizes a tamping-type filling system."

Ten male and 10 female track athletes on a university's nationally competitive track team, specializing in sprint or jump events, participated in the study. Testing utilized the compression shorts with loose-fitting gym shorts as the control garment. Several significant effects were revealed for the custom-fit compressive garment. Although 60 m sprint time was not affected, hip flexion angle was reduced. Skin temperature increased more and at a faster rate during a warm-up protocol. Muscle oscillation was decreased during vertical jump landing. Countermovement vertical jump height increased when the participants were wearing the custom-fit compression garment. In materials testing, the elasticity of the compressive garment provides increased flexion and extension torque at the end range of extension and flexion, respectively, and may assist the hamstrings in controlling the leg at the end of the swing phase in sprinting. The compressive garment significantly reduced impact force by 27% compared with American football pants alone. Through various mechanisms, these findings may translate into an effect on athletic performance and a reduction in injuries."

The mesh included 3 restorative designs (3 degrees of interdental wrapping) and a Class III composite filling. Curing contraction of the luting composite was simulated at baseline temperature (37 degrees C). Thermal loads from 37 to 60 degrees C and from 37 to 5 degrees C were assessed with and without preexisting composite shrinkage.

Deformation of the tooth-restoration complex tended to be more uniform for veneers with maximum wraparound. In the presence of thermal loads alone, opposite effects were observed on the restoration surface and the interface, with compressive stresses on one side (up to 13 MPa) and tensile stresses on the other (up to 9 MPa).

A cranial nerve is composed of a central nervous system (CNS) segment and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) segment separated by the root entry/exit zone (REZ). Although vascular compression can occur at any point along the cranial nerve, it has been generally assumed that only vascular contact at the REZ of the affected cranial nerve can cause symptoms. On the basis of personal surgical experience, we propose that vascular compression of the CNS segment alone causes symptoms. This has important repercussions for the future diagnosis and treatment of microvascular compression syndromes, especially the cochleovestibular compression syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For the anatomic study, four autopsy specimens and one surgical biopsy specimen of the vestibulocochlear nerve were microscopically and ultramicroscopically analyzed for structural differences between the CNS and PNS segments. For the clinical study, five patients with the clinical picture of cochleovestibular compression syndrome were treated by microsurgical decompression at the level of the CNS segment and not the REZ. One patient underwent reoperation for recurrent symptoms 4 years later, and a 4-mm vestibular neurectomy was performed at that stage. We performed an epidemiological analysis to demonstrate that the known incidences of trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia are related to the length of their respective CNS segments.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Histological differences between the PNS and CNS segments suggest that the PNS segment is more resistant to compression.

We found a clear epidemiological correlation between the length of the CNS segment, which differed among cranial nerves, and the incidence of the microvascular compression syndrome. Successful decompression of the CNS segment in patients without compression at the REZ of the vestibulocochlear nerve for disabling positional vertigo provides clinical support for this hypothesis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The evidence we present supports the hypothesis that vascular compression syndromes arise from vascular contact along the CNS segment of the cranial nerves."

            "abstract": "Experience has shown that better quality CPR leads to a greater chance of a patient surviving a cardiac arrest. Simple CPR techniques, such as using only chest compressions, lead to better skill retention and greater willingness to attempt resuscitation on strangers. However, it is not clear from clinical or experimental studies whether such techniques offer any physiological benefit over more usual 5:1 or 15:2 compression:ventilation ratios. Computer simulations of blood flow and gas exchange during CPR showed that continuous chest compressions produced much greater blood flow (1.39 l/min) than 5:1 (0.73 l/min), 15:2 (0.86 l/min) or 50:5 (0.94 l/min) ratios. However, the ratio of 5:1 produced the highest arterial oxygen levels, with continuous chest compressions the lowest. The most appropriate measure of CPR efficiency appears to be the amount of oxygen delivered to the body during CPR. The ratios of 15:2 and 50:5 produced significantly greater oxygen delivery to the body than 5:1, the greater blood flow with these techniques offsetting the slightly lower arterial oxygen levels. The best oxygen delivery was provided by continuous chest compression in the early stages of CPR. After 3-4 min however, hypoxia meant that continuous compressions became worse than the other techniques. Spontaneous gasping by the patient during CPR was able to extend the effectiveness of chest compression only CPR for much longer."

However, survival to hospital discharge improved significantly for younger patients, octogenarians, and nonagenarians who had ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (36% vs 24% vs 17%; P<.001). After multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for other factors, increased age was weakly associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0. 85-0.99).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Octogenarians and nonagenarians have lower survival to hospital discharge than younger patients, but age is a much weaker predictor of survival than other factors such as initial cardiac rhythm.

The frequency of bystander CPR in Malaysia is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to find out how frequently bystander CPR was performed among OHA patients with CPR performed at the Emergency Department (ED), Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), prior to their arrival to the department.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this one-year observational study, data was collected from cases of CPR performed in ED, HUSM.

The main goal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) for the victims of cardiac pulmonary arrest(CPA) is not only restoration of cardiopulmonary function but also return to their previous life. An early bystander CPR plays a pivotal role to achieve this target. When encountering an unconscious person, emergency medical systems(EMS) such as calling 119 must be activated immediately. As the next step, cardiopulmonary condition status has to be determined after assurance of airway patency. When there are no signs of breathing or pulse, BLS consisting of artificial respiration and/or chest compression must be started immediately and continued until EMS staffs arrive. In this article, the details of the revised guidelines for BLS by the American Heart Association are described. Current CPR education for pre- or early post-graduate medical students in our institution is reported."

Both are served by similar two-tiered emergency response systems. All arrests were witnessed and occurred before the arrival of emergency responders, and the initial cardiac rhythm observed was ventricular fibrillation. The main outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. Patient age, initiation of CPR by bystanders, interval from collapse to CPR, interval from collapse to defibrillation, bystander CPR/collapse-to-CPR interval interaction, and collapse-to-CPR/collapse-to-defibrillation interval interaction were significantly associated with survival. There was not a significant difference between observed survival rates at the two sites after control for significant predictors.

To substantiate the author's 12-year experience with more than 300 myelograms performed in 16 different countries (plus some 1500 studies during 30 years of practice in the United States), a prospective pilot study was undertaken over 1 month in a community-based neurosurgical setting in western Kenya. Forty patients underwent cervical or lumbar myelography at Tenwek Hospital under the auspices of the Neurosurgery Training Program for East, Central, and South Africa (NSTP-ECSA) following failure of conservative measures to treat spine-related pathology. Thirty-five of the forty patients (88%) came to definitive surgery on the basis of a positive study that correlated with their clinical history and physical examination. There were no significant complications from the procedures, and no false-positive studies, with virtually all patients returning to normal activity and/or gainful employment within 3 weeks of their surgery. Myelography as a stand-alone diagnostic procedure is a sensitive, specific, and cost-effective means of diagnosing symptomatic degenerative spine disorders. Accordingly, its use should be encouraged at every NSTP-ECSA training site to address such ubiquitous pathology."

Levels of symptomatic spinal cord compression were determined by ESCP findings. Spinal N13 potential of the SSEPs was recorded from the surface of the posterior neck with anterior neck reference. Brainstem P14 and cortical N20 potential were recorded from the parietal scalp contralateral to the stimulated side. Spinal N13, P14, and N20 potentials were all normal when the ESCPs were abnormal at localized segmental region (C4-5 or C5-6 level alone). Spinal N13 potential was significantly attenuated in all of patients with abnormal ESCP findings at widespread segmental area of the median nerve territory. In four of these seven patients, brainstem P14 potential was also prolonged or diminished, but three patients showed normal P14 and N20 potentials. Isolated P14 abnormality with normal spinal N13 potential was characteristic in patients with abnormal ESCP at the C3-4 lesion. Although sensitivity of abnormal ESCP was higher than that of the SSEPs, abnormal patterns of spinal N13, P14 and N20 potentials following median nerve stimulation were useful in detecting not only the pathology (posterior horn and/or posterior column) but also symptomatic spinal compression level in compressive cervical myelopathy."

Since symptoms and clinical investigation alone are unreliable in assessing the severity of peripheral arterial disease, complementary functional vascular examinations are needed. Measurement of the systolic blood pressures at ankle level by means of a sphygmomanometric method and a Doppler flowmeter allows reliable determination of the presence or absence of haemodynamically significant arterial obstructions. In the case of minor obstructions the sensitivity of ankle pressure measurements can be increased by examination during a period of hyperaemia, preferably induced by a treadmill walking test. In the case of unreliable ankle pressure measurements due to non-compressible arteries determination of the toe blood pressure is indicated. Segmental blood pressure measurements as well as Doppler analysis of the blood flow at various levels of the leg were not considered reliable enough for the localization of arterial obstructions, unless the obstructive disease is restricted to one single arterial segment. Accurate non-invasive localization of arterial obstructions and the determination of their haemodynamic severity are only possible by means of a combined echo-Doppler (duplex) examination of the arteries. Duplex examination can also be helpful in choosing between surgery and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of localised stenoses and short occlusions."

All consecutive cases with out-of-hospital bystander witnessed VF of cardiac origin between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2002 were included. Data were collected prospectively. Call processing times, call numbers per dispatcher and telephone guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were studied. Discharge alive from hospital was used as primary end point.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study population consisted of 373 cases. Cardiac arrest (CA) was recognised in 296 cases (79.4%) by the dispatcher. Survival to discharge was 37.2% (110/296) if CA was recognised and 28.6% (22/77) if it was not recognised (p=0.1550). When the dispatcher handled <4 VF calls during the study period survival to discharge was 22.1% (17/77) compared to 38.2% (50/131) and 39.4% (65/165) when the call volume was 4-9 or >9 (p=0.0227). The mean time to dispatch a first responding unit (FRU) was 77.1+/-44.3 s. Survival to discharge was 39.4% (65/165) when the FRU dispatching time was <60s and 32.2% (67/208) when dispatching took > or =60 s (p=0.1496). The mean time to CA recognition was 170.2+/-130.1 s. Spontaneous circulation was achieved more rapidly when the time was <150 s (p=0.0426), but there was no difference in survival to discharge. Telephone guided CPR instructions were given in 123 cases (35.5%). Survival to discharge was 43.1% (53/123) when CPR instructions were given and 31.7% (72/223) when they were not given (p=0.0453).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We showed that low CA call numbers per dispatcher is associated with a decreased probability of survival. Giving telephone guided CPR instructions should be promoted as they influence the outcome. Further studies are needed to determine optimal call processing times."

            "abstract": "While ice and compression wraps are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal injuries, the literature describing intramuscular temperatures has not addressed the combination of ice and compression wraps. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intramuscular temperatures at three sites on the anterior thigh (skin surface, 1 cm below the fat layer, and 2 cm below the fat layer) using both ice and compression wraps. Temperatures were recorded in 11 subjects with an isothermex, using implantable and surface thermocouples. Each subject was tested under four conditions: control, compression only, ice only, and ice + compression according to a balanced Latin square. Surface and intramuscular temperatures were recorded at 30 second intervals during 5 minutes of preapplication, 30 minutes application, and 20 minutes postapplication. A repeated measures ANOVA and Duncan post hoc tests were used to evaluate peak temperature differences between the treatment conditions and the depths of measurement. Both ice alone and ice + compression produced significant cooling at all three depths (F(6,60) = 168.5, p<.0005). Likewise, during the 20-minute postapplication period, these temperatures did not return to their preapplication levels. The compression-only condition produced significant warming at the skin surface, but did not have any effect on intramuscular temperature. At all depths, the ice + compression condition produced significantly cooler temperatures than ice alone. We suggest that compression increases the effectiveness of ice in reducing tissue temperatures. Therefore, ice combined with compression should be more effective than ice alone in reducing the metabolism of injured tissue. This provides an additional rationale for combining ice with compression in treating acute musculoskeletal injuries."

            "abstract": "Two polyacid-modified composite resins, Dyract and Compoglass, have been studied for water-uptake on storage in three aqueous media, namely pure water, 0.9% NaCl and 1 M NaCl at 37 degrees C, and the results compared with those of a conventional composite resin, Pekafill. The equilibrium water-uptake of Dyract and Compoglass varied depending on time of cure and ionic strength of the storage medium. This latter finding contrasted with that for Pekafill, where equilibrium water content showed almost no variation with ionic strength of the storage medium. Uptake of water was always greater in Dyract and Compoglass than in Pekafill, reflecting the role of water in promoting the later neutralization reaction in these materials and its further role in hydrating the ionic products of that reaction. Despite this and other evidence of neutralization, specimens of Dyract and Compoglass stored in wet conditions (0.9% NaCl) showed no change in compressive strength on storage from 24 h to 30 days, a result similar to that reported previously for Dyract alone for flexural strength for times up to 1 year. By contrast, specimens of Dyract and Compoglass stored in dry air at 37 degrees C, and therefore unable to undergo any neutralization, showed an increase in compressive strength of between 40 and 70 MPa by 30 days that was significant at P < 0.01."

The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epistry-Cardiac Arrest is a population-based emergency medical services registry of out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Patients were stratified a priori into 3 age groups: <1 year (infants; n=277), 1 to 11 years (children; n=154), and 12 to 19 years (adolescents; n=193). The incidence of pediatric OHCA was 8.04 per 100 000 person-years (72.71 in infants, 3.73 in children, and 6.37 in adolescents) versus 126.52 per 100,000 person-years for adults.

Home care is of particular interest at the infant age, as the disruption of the mother-child relationship may induce severe developmental disorders, known as syndrome of psychosocial deprivation.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We investigated retrospectively the tendency of the ventilator parameters, the support and the daily practice of 16 families with children of all ages with long-term ventilator assistance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The duration of the ventilation ranged between 5 months and 14 years, on the average at 5.5 years. The average portion of the ventilation at home care was 78%. The respiratory patterns, tidal volume and positive inspiration pressure, exceeded occasionally the physiologic standard of the age group. The common reason is, that the children prefer small sized tubes, having advantages in comfort and speech abilities. Therefore results an increased tube-resistance and air leakage of the tracheostomy tubes. The long-term tendency of the ventilator parameters is stable or improving, excluding the patients with progredient primary diseases. Commonly the motivation of the family members is high, therefore the psychosocial integration of the patients satisfying. Two thirds of the families have no personal support for the domiciliary care of the ventilator assisted child. Mothers tell about an enormous distress.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The long-term mechanical ventilation of children at home care is an adequate therapy for all ages. It combines technical support of the underlying chronic respiratory failure with the chance of an intact psychosocial development of the child.

            "abstract": "Various methods are employed in obstetric prophylaxis and treatment to assess the intrauterine condition of the foetus. The systolic time-intervals appear to be a promising new method because they reflect the contractility of the foetal heart which is a reflection of various physiological factors indluding hypoxia and asphyxia. Monitoring of the foetal systolic time intervals is therefore a more sensitive parameter of cardiac function than the foetal heart rate alone. By measurement of the foetal systolic time-intervals, it is therefore theoretically possible to evaluate the intrauterine situation of the foetus as abbreviated pre-exjection time (PEP) is a normal physiological reaction to scalp compressions, uterine contractions, or umbilical cord complications. Finally, the relationship between PEP and the ejection time (PEP/VET) is raised in asphyxia and greatly raised in imminent foetal death."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze the functioning of the first two links of the chain of survival: 'access' and 'basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)'. In a prospective study, all bystander witnessed circulatory arrests resuscitated by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, were recorded consecutively. Univariate differences in survival were calculated for various witnesses, the performance of basic CPR, the quality of CPR, the performers of CPR and the delays. A logistic regression model for survival was developed from all potential predictors of these first two links. From the 922 included patients, 93 survived to hospital discharge. In 21% of the cases, the witness did not immediately call 112, but first called others, resulting in a longer delay and a lower survival. Family members were frequent witnesses of the arrest (44%), but seldom started basic CPR (11%). Survival, when basic CPR performers were untrained and had no previous experience, was similar to that when no basic CPR was performed (6%). Not performing basic CPR, delay in basic CPR, the interval between basic CPR and EMS arrival, and being both untrained and inexperienced in basic CPR were independent predictors for survival. Basic CPR performed by persons trained a long time ago did not appear to have a negative influence on outcome, nor did basic CPR limited to chest compressions alone. The mere reporting that basic CPR has been performed does not describe adequately the actual value of basic CPR. The interval from collapse to initiation of basic CPR, and the training and experience of the performer must be taken into account. Policy makers for basic CPR training should focus on partners of the patients, who are most likely witness of an arrest."

Three cases are reported, treated by intracranial section of n. IX (alone in one case) and upper rootlets of n. X. In two patients no vascular compression of the nerves was observed. In one case an atheromatous elongated basilar artery was observed compressing and deforming the medulla oblongata at the entry zone of nerves IX-X. In this case, pain paroxysms recurred some weeks after surgery, and the patient underwent re-operation (microvascular decompression of the medulla) with good outcome. Clinical implications of the complex sensitive innervation of profound regions of the face and cervicofacial region are emphasized. Certain circumstances, such as gustatory pain due to sympathetic denervation of parotid gland, the neck-tongue syndrome and oropharyngeal pain by irritation of the first cervical spinal nerve (during lateral suboccipital puncture), point to the fact that in this region similar symptoms may be provoked by mechanisms involving different peripheric pain pathways.

Patients treated with laminectomy followed by radiotherapy seemed to respond better than patients treated with radiotherapy or laminectomy alone, but when the patients' pretreatment motor function was taken into account no significant difference was found between the three forms of treatment. In the subgroup of nonambulatory patients, however, a significantly better restoration of gait was observed in patients treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone. A longer survival in the group treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy may reflect that these patients were in a lower stage of disease and thus had a better potential of regaining motor function.

Immediately after training, participants were asked to perform CPR for 2 min and the quality of their CPR skills were evaluated. The number of chest compressions in total and those with appropriate depth were counted every 20-s CPR period from the start of CPR. The primary outcome was the CPR quality index calculated as the proportion of chest compressions with appropriate depth among total chest compressions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total number of chest compressions remained stable over time both in the chest compression-only and the conventional CPR groups. The CPR quality index, however, decreased from 86.6+/-25.0 to 58.2+/-36.9 in the chest compression-only CPR group from 0-20 s through 61-80 s. The reduction was greater than in the conventional CPR group (85.9+/-25.5 to 74.3+/-34.0).

The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The proportion of treated arrests that met inclusion criteria was similar for intervention and control periods (15.4% [134/869] versus 16.6% [374/2255]). Survival to hospital discharge was significantly greater during the intervention period compared with the control period (46% [61/134] versus 33% [122/374], P=0.008) and corresponded to a decrease in the interval from shock to start of chest compressions (28 versus 7 seconds).

One hundred and twenty-two patients (164 knees) who were scheduled to have a unilateral or a one-stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty were separately randomized to be managed with either aspirin alone or the pulsatile pneumatic plantar-compression device and aspirin. The prevalence of deep venous thrombosis was 27 per cent (twenty-two of eighty-one knees) in the group treated with pneumatic plantar compression compared with 59 per cent (forty-nine of eighty-three knees) in the patients managed with aspirin alone (the control group) (p < 0.001). A significant difference was also noted in the group that had had a unilateral arthroplasty (a prevalence of 27 per cent [eleven of forty-one knees] in the group treated with pneumatic plantar compression, compared with 67 per cent [twenty-six of thirty-nine knees] in that treated with aspirin alone; p < 0.006) and in the group that had had a one-stage bilateral procedure (a prevalence of 28 per cent [eleven of forty knees] in the group treated with pneumatic plantar compression, compared with 52 per cent [twenty-three of forty-four knees] in that treated with aspirin alone; p < 0.03). No proximal thrombi were noted in any patient who used the pulsatile pneumatic plantar-compression device, while the prevalence of proximal thrombosis in the popliteal or femoral veins was 14 per cent (twelve of eighty-three knees) in the group treated with aspirin alone (p < 0.0003). In the group treated with a unilateral procedure and aspirin alone the prevalence of proximal thrombosis was 13 per cent (five of thirty-nine knees; p < 0.02), while in the group treated with a bilateral procedure and aspirin alone it was 16 per cent (seven of forty-four knees; p < 0.01). Only in the patients who had had a unilateral procedure was use of the compression device associated with significantly less edema postoperatively than was use of aspirin alone. The change between the preoperative and postoperative circumferences of the thigh and leg was significantly less (9 +/- 4.1 millimeters [mean and standard deviation] less for the thigh [p < 0.01] and 6 +/- 3.9 millimeters less for the leg [p < 0.049]) with the compression device than with aspirin alone. In addition, there was significantly less mean drainage (98 +/- 61.1 milliliters) in the group treated with a unilateral procedure and pneumatic compression, compared with that treated with a unilateral procedure and aspirin alone (p < 0.041). An internal timer of the compression device was used to assess the compliance of the patient with use of the device, and a relationship between deep venous thrombosis and the total duration of treatment with the device was found. The patients in whom deep venous thrombosis did not develop used the device for a mean of 96 +/- 23.4 hours (range, sixty to 164 hours) postoperatively, or 19.2 +/- 5.1 hours a day, while those in whom thrombosis developed used it for a mean of 67 +/- 21.1 hours (range, twenty-six to 101 hours), or 13.4 +/- 4.3 hours a day (p < 0.001). No untoward effects were noted in any patient who used the device. This study confirms the safety and efficacy of pulsatile pneumatic plantar compression and aspirin compared with aspirin alone and supports the use of mechanical compression for prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and for reduction of edema in patients who have had a total knee arthroplasty. In addition, we found a direct relationship between compliance with the use of this device and its efficacy in reducing deep venous thrombosis."

About half of the affected persons had no previous diagnosis of coronary heart disease, thus rendering them practically unreachable for specific preventive measures. This fact makes it necessary to optimize reanimation conditions. The establishment of international reanimation standards (ILCOR) has stimulated an intensified scientific evaluation of therapeutic options. While the use of vasopressin, adrenaline and reanimation by bystanders is being evaluated at the moment, amiodarone has not fulfilled the expectation of reducing mortality. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death after cardiac events is based on betablockers, ACE inhibitors and antilipemic therapy. Guidelines on prevention of sudden cardiac death also recommend aldosterone blockade and n-3-fatty acids. Persons at highest risk gain most from the use of ICDs, yet it has not been shown that their use immediately after myocardial infarction reduces mortality."

            "abstract": "In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that tension and bending, rather than compression alone, determine the functional adaptation of subchondral bone in incongruous joints. We investigated whether tensile stresses in the subchondral bone of the humero-ulnar articulation are affected by the direction of muscle and joint forces, and whether the tensile stresses are large enough to cause microstructural adaptation, specifically a preferential alignment of the trabeculae and the subchondral collagen fibres. Using a previously validated finite element model of the human humero-ulnar joint, we calculated the contact pressure, the principal compressive and tensile stresses, and the strain energy density in the subchondral bone for various flexion angles. A bicentric (ventro-dorsal) pressure distribution was found in the joint at 30 degrees to 120 degrees of flexion, with contact pressures of up to between 2.5 and 3 MPa in the ventral and dorsal aspects of the ulnar joint surface, but less than 0.5 MPa in the centre. The principal tensile stress in the subchondral bone of the trochlear notch quantitatively exceeded the principal compressive stress at low flexion angles (maximum 8.2 MPa), and the distribution of subchondral strain energy density differed substantially from that of the contact stress (r=-0.72 at 30 degrees and r=+0.58 at 90 degrees of flexion). No important tensile stress was computed in the trochlea humeri. On contact radiography, we found sagittally orientated subarticular trabeculae in the notch, running tangential to the surface. Furthermore, we observed sagittally orientated split lines in the subchondral bone of the notch of 20 cadaver joints, suggesting a ventro-dorsal orientation of the collagen fibres. The trochlea humeri, on the other hand, did not show a preferential direction of the subchondral split lines, these findings confirming the predictions of tensile stresses in the model. We conclude that, due to the important contribution of tension to subchondral bone stress, the distribution of subchondral density cannot be directly employed for assessing the long term distribution of joint pressure at the cartilage surface. The magnitude of the tensional stress varies considerably with the direction of the muscle and joint forces, and it appears large enough to cause functional adaptation of the subchondral bone on a microstructural level."

Health care workers performed CPR mainly in older patients, at public places or at the roadside and especially in case of cardiac or respiratory origin. CA caused by trauma/exsanguination and intoxication/metabolic origin received less bystander CPR (23% resp. 22%). Cardiac arrests receiving bystander CPR are more frequently witnessed and have a shorter access time to the emergency medical service (EMS) system and shorter response time of basic life support (BLS). Advanced life support (ALS) response time is significantly longer. In witnessed arrests of cardiac origin receiving bystander CPR a significantly better late survival was observed. In non-witnessed arrests of cardiac origin early and late survival are significantly higher in patients receiving bystander CPR. In CA events where response time of ALS exceeds 8 min, the beneficial effect of bystander CPR is most significant.

            "abstract": "A large body of experimental data indicates that blood flows during CPR because of elevations of intrathoracic pressure and the uneven peripheral transmission of this pressure. Data from humans are less extensive, but also strongly support the mechanism of intrathoracic pressure. It should be remembered that the intrathoracic pressure and direct cardiac compression hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and that effective CPR is above all dependent on vigorous chest compression. Maintenance of sternal displacement for 40% to 50% of each compression-release cycle, intense alpha-adrenergic stimulation, and avoidance of vasodilators are also essential to the maximization of cerebral and myocardial perfusion. Whether movement of blood by manipulation of intrathoracic pressure can be applied successfully to other disease states is unknown. What is established is that vigorous chest compression, adequate ventilation, and generous use of epinephrine, along with prompt defibrillation, form the basis of an effective strategy for life support. Provision of chest compression and mouth-to-mouth ventilation by bystanders prior to delivery of definitive care has been shown to increase survival rates from 8% to 36% in Columbus, Ohio, and from 21% to 43% in Seattle. Bystander-initiated CPR also reduced the frequency of neurologic impairment at the time of hospital discharge from 55% to 4% in the Seattle experience. For patients receiving the full program of chest compression, ventilation, drug therapy, and defibrillation, resuscitation rates in excess of 50% have been reported in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital arrests. Of those who survive to hospital discharge, 6-month survival rates of 80% have been reported from these patients cohorts, with return-to-work rates of 70%. These data demonstrate that CPR is an effective means of supporting the circulation during cardiac arrest. The majority of survivors return to a meaningful existence, and the technique has not burdened society with a large load of neurologically impaired patients. Thus, CPR is very much worthy of the full attention and support of the medical community."

            "abstract": "Strength of both muscles and bone are important for fracture prevention in osteoporotic individuals. Therefore, drugs that are preclinically tested in animals for preventing or treating osteoporosis, and reducing fracture risk, should not only be checked for their effects on bone strength, but also for those on muscle strength. We developed a rat model to measure both in the same animal, using a single test. The model is based on an in vivo, ventral three-point bending test of the lower leg (Nordsletten L. and Ekeland A. J Orthop Res 11:299-304; 1993). This model was developed to test the contribution of triceps surae muscle contraction to the strength of the tibia. We hypothesized that this same test can be applied to determine bone and muscle strength independently, in an absolute sense. To investigate this possibility, the muscle contribution to bone stresses was estimated from mechanical analyses, based on direct assessment of muscle strength in a separate test. Sixteen mature female Wistar rats were used, half of which were ovariectomized. After 12 weeks, the rats were tested in vivo in three-point bending of the right lower leg during muscle contraction, and then the isolated triceps surae muscle strength in the left lower leg was measured separately, in another model. The rats were then killed, and the left nude shafts were tested mechanically in three-point bending in vitro to determine structural strength of the bone alone. Ultimate external bending moments of the in vivo and in vitro tests, maximal muscle force, and geometrical parameters formed the basis for the analysis. While contracting, the triceps surae loads the tibia in axial compression and bending. We found that the axial compressive stress on the bone due to muscle contraction was less than 2.5% of the bending stress this produced. This indicates that muscle contribution to lower leg strength is due almost entirely to the bending moment it produces, counteracting the external moment put on the leg by the testing device. Thus, the difference between the in vivo (lower leg) and in vitro (nude tibia) failure bending moments is approximately equal to the maximal muscle bending moment. This information can be applied to test the effects of hormonal conditions and drugs on both muscle and bone strength independently, in a single rat test, using the aforementioned procedure."

To assess the applicability of this model to manual CPR techniques, two-dimensional echocardiograms were recorded from the right chest wall and/or the esophagus in nine dogs (18 to 26 kg) during manual CPR. The aortic valve opened with chest compression and closed with release, while the pulmonary and tricuspid valve leaflets closed with compression and opened during release. The mitral valve remained open during ventilation alone and during abdominal compressions. With the onset of brief, high-velocity (high-impulse) chest compressions, the mitral valve closed rapidly and the left ventricle was deformed, whether compressions were applied to the sternum or the left mid-chest wall. The mitral valve reopened with release of each compression. Left atrial echocardiographic contrast injections confirmed the absence of anterograde transmitral blood flow during high-impulse compression and its presence during release. Failure of mitral leaflet approximation during chest compression was observed only when a very low-velocity, prolonged (low-impulse) compression technique was used, or when regions that did not directly overlie the heart were compressed. Consistent with these observations, simultaneous recordings of the left ventricular and left atrial pressures during high-impulse sternal compressions in five dogs (19 to 25 kg) demonstrated peak and mean left ventriculoatrial pressure gradients of 38.5 +/- 4.0 and 13.5 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively, and these pressure gradients declined with less impulsive compressions. The observations made during all but low-impulse chest compressions are inconsistent with the thoracic pump model, and support direct cardiac compression as the primary mechanism of forward blood flow with more impulsive manual chest compression techniques."

Furthermore, when the ultrashort-, short-, and long-term survivors were analysed according to indicators of prehospital care (early electrical defibrillation < or =5 min, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulance response time < or =10 min; locations of arrest; initial cardiac rhythms) an OHCA peak was observed for early defibrillation and ambulance response time (ultrashort-term survivors, 18:01-22:00 h) and/or in the case of OHCA that occurred in a public place (short-term survivors, 18:01-22:00 h). The lowest incidence of cardiac arrest was between 22:01-06:00 h in all groups. The evening incidence of OHCA reflects a higher chance of survival in our study area (East Bohemian region)."

            "abstract": "Modified-release multiple-unit tablets of loratadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride with different release profiles were prepared from the immediate-release pellets comprising the above two drugs and prolonged-release pellets containing only pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The immediate-release pellets containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride alone or in combination with loratadine were prepared using extrusion-spheronization method. The pellets of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride were coated to prolong the drug release up to 12 h. Both immediate- and prolonged-release pellets were filled into hard gelatin capsule and also compressed into tablets using inert tabletting granules of microcrystalline cellulose Ceolus KG-801. The in vitro drug dissolution study conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography method showed that both multiple-unit capsules and multiple-unit tablets released loratadine completely within a time period of 2 h, whereas the immediate-release portion of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride was liberated completely within the first 10 min of dissolution study. On the other hand, the release of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride from the prolonged release coated pellets was prolonged up to 12 hr and followed zero-order release kinetic. The drug dissolution profiles of multiple-unit tablets and multiple-unit capsules were found to be closely similar, indicating that the integrity of pellets remained unaffected during the compression process. Moreover, the friability, hardness, and disintegration time of multiple-unit tablets were found to be within BP specifications. In conclusion, modified-release pellet-based tablet system for the delivery of loratadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride was successfully developed and evaluated."

            "abstract": "Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in patients with chronic hypoxaemia is an expanding field. Traditional stationary oxygen, with and without portable compressed gas cylinders, and portable liquid oxygen equipment is available today. No official guidelines exist for the prescription of liquid oxygen vs traditional oxygen supply in LTOT, although it is generally though that patients receiving liquid oxygen are younger and less seriously affected. The authors tested this hypothesis by comparing register data from two national Scandinavian registers of patients on LTOT in the same time period; one including all the patients on traditional oxygen treatment alone, e.g. concentrators and compressed gas cylinders (n = 1039), the other including all the patients using portable liquid oxygen alone (n = 117). About 80% of the patients in both groups suffered from chrome obstructive pulmonary disease. Younger patients were found in the liquid oxygen group (P < 0.004), but with clinically slightly worse blood gas derangement (mostly statistically significant). They had higher frequency of previous or present oedema (P < 0.0001), and there were more smokers in this group (P < 0.0001). No significant differences were seen with respect to sex distribution or oxygen delivery systems. Higher oxygen dose and longer daily oxygen treatment (P < 0.0001) were prescribed for the liquid oxygen patients compared with the patients on traditional oxygen with statistically higher oxygen tension during the prescribed treatment. A slight further increase in PaCO2 was seen in both groups during oxygen treatment, of doubtful significance. Compared with patients on traditional oxygen, liquid oxygen thus appears to be prescribed for younger patients, independent of clinical status or blood gas levels."

Nondestructive, multidirectional flexibility analyses included four loading methods and fatigue component followed by a destructive flexural load to failure.

            "abstract": "Early access to the EMS system helps insure early CPR, defibrillation, and advanced care. Early access is easiest to achieve with 911 systems and widespread community education and publicity. It may also be taught during citizen-CPR classes. Early CPR helps patients by slowing the process of dying, but its effectiveness disappears within minutes, and defibrillation must soon follow. A citizenry well-informed about cardiac emergencies and well-trained in CPR appears to be the best method to achieve early recognition and early CPR. The earliest possible delivery of defibrillation is critical and, almost by itself, sufficient for many sudden death cases. It has, therefore, emerged as the single most effective intervention for patients in nontraumatic cardiac arrest. Automated external defibrillators help accomplish this goal and now permit widespread implementation of a variety of early defibrillation programs. Early advanced care helps those who do not immediately convert to an organized cardiac activity or who do not achieve a spontaneous circulation following early defibrillation. Advanced care allows a system to approach its highest possible survival rate by respiratory and anti-arrhythmic stabilization and monitoring of patients in the post-resuscitation period. At present, early CPR and rapid defibrillation, combined with early advanced care, can result in long-term survival rates as high as 30% for witnessed VF. Because neurological and psychological recovery from cardiac arrest are tied to the time within which these critical interdependent treatment modalities are delivered (1, 87), high resuscitation rates will also lead to a high percentage of patients who recover to their pre-arrest neurologic level. The public health challenge is to develop programs that will allow recognition, access, bystander-CPR, defibrillation, and advanced care to be delivered as quickly as possible, ideally within moments of the collapse of a sudden death victim. Achievement of such a goal requires the deployment of multiple properly directed programs within an EMS system; each program lends strength to the chain of survival, thereby enhancing successful recovery and long-term survival. What benefits would occur if a majority of EMS systems in the United States could establish cost-effective programs with respectable survival rates? The AHA estimates that full implementation of potential life-saving mechanisms in the community may save 10,000-100,000 lives each year in the US (2). If the maximum survival rate for all nontraumatic cardiac arrests in mature EMS systems is about 20% (33) among the annual 400,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 80,000 persons would be saved (33).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

High-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of 78 orbits of 31 patients with thyroid eye disease were reviewed. Axial scans alone were inadequate for demonstrating compression of the optic nerve. With a coronal reformatted scan from the axial scans, a muscular index was devised and measured to reflect extraocular muscle impingement on the optic nerve. Orbits with optic nerve dysfunction had significantly higher muscular indices than those without optic nerve dysfunction, supporting the hypothesis that optic nerve dysfunction is usually secondary to compression by enlarged extraocular muscles. Muscular indices of 67% or greater in patients with optic nerve dysfunction were diagnostic of compressive optic neuropathy, while muscular indices of less than 50% appeared to exclude optic nerve compression. A single case of optic nerve dysfunction without muscular compression is also discussed."

It has been estimated that by the year 2030, minority elders will make up one-fourth of all elderly Americans. Among minority populations, African-Americans are at the highest risk for CHD and SCA. Approximately two-thirds of all out-of-hospital SCA cases are 65 years of age and older. The rate of a bystander initiated CPR as well as the rate of survival after out-of-hospital SCA is significantly lower among blacks than among whites. Studies have shown that racial differences in outcomes of out-of-hospital SCA cannot be fully explained by features of collapse or relevant service factors and that the underlying socioeconomic and health status of the minority population are factors likely to affect outcome of SCA. Most minority populations in the U. S. have a poorer socioeconomic and health status and access to the health care system than their white counterparts. SCA, as a leading cause of mortality, has been found to be associated with socioeconomic status and has been identified as a key area in which to study minority populations.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the etiology of CPA and the outcome of the patients. We also investigated the effects of the pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by a bystander or emergency life-saving technicians (ELST) on the restoration of spontaneous circulation. Seventy-seven patients were transferred to our hospital from September 1997 to April 2000, 10 of who underwent bystander (basic) CPR. All the patients underwent advanced CPR by the attending physician immediately after admission to the emergency room. The etiology of CPA was categorized into three groups: (1) unknown endogenous disease (43 patients, 56%), (2) exacerbation of previous disease such as heart, respiratory or cerebrovascular disease (12 patients, 15%), (3) accident or suicide (22 patients, 29%). Spontaneous circulation of 30 patients was restored temporary, but only two patients recovered fully and were discharged from the hospital. The rate of restored spontaneous circulation of the CPA patients with bystander CPR was higher compared to that of the CPA patients without bystander CPR. The two fully recovered patients underwent bystander CPR. The CPR by ELST did not affect the resuscitated rate significantly. These results indicate that the most common etiology of CPA is unknown endogenous disease, and the rate of full recovery is very low (2.6%). This study suggests that bystander CPR may contribute to an improved outcome of the patients suffering out-of-hospital CPA."

            "abstract": "Despite research and public education, myocardial disease, infarction, and death from cardiac arrest continue to be one of the top public health issues. Many patients experiencing AMIs access health care and receive initial treatment from EMS personnel in the prehospital setting. Prompt identification and diagnosis of these patients, relief of chest pain, and shortening delays to definitive care can decrease morbidity and mortality. Prehospital diagnosis of AMI is enhanced with the use of 12-lead electrocardiograms, which can shorten time to thrombolysis or angiography. Prehospital use of thrombolytic agents has not gained widespread use in this country; it is, however, commonplace in Europe, where research suggests improved outcomes when thrombolysis is initiated prior to hospital arrival. Resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients is difficult, resulting in dismal survival rates. Factors that appear to be associated with enhanced survival are witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, and short response times to defibrillation."

            "abstract": "All prehospital resuscitations performed by emergency physicians in the city of Bochum, Germany, were recorded and evaluated prospectively from 1 August 1989 to 30 September 1990. Initially successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was achieved in 33.8% (alive at admission), and definitive success in 10.4% (discharged alive). Of the patients who presented with cardiac arrest before the arrival of the emergency physician, 28.4% could be resuscitated initially and 7.6% survived definitively. In patients who suffered circulatory arrest on or after the arrival of the emergency physician, the initial success rate of CPR was 51.7%, and the definitive success rate 11.1%. Although the initial success rate was significantly more favourable, the definitive outcome did not differ statistically between these two groups. Two time periods were compared. During the first period of 5 months only one base with two ambulances staffed with emergency physicians was available. During the second period of 9 months an additional base with a physician-staffed ambulance was established. This reorganization resulted in the reduced call to arrival time falling from 8.5 +/- 2.4 min to 7.6 +/- 2.4 min (univariate variance analysis: f = 8.89, d.f. = 1.31, p < 0.01). This decrease, however did not improve either the initial or the definitive success of CPR. From these results we conclude that further improvement of prehospital resuscitation can only be achieved to a small extent by reducing the call to arrival time of ambulances staffed with emergency physicians. Improvement is more likely to be seen when immediate resuscitation is performed by bystanders present at the scene."

            "abstract": "We examined the role of glutamatergic mechanisms in acute injury to rat spinal cord white matter. Compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded from isolated dorsal column segments in vitro. Under control conditions (Ringer's solution), the CAPs decreased to 71.4 +/- 2.0% of preinjury values after compression injury with a clip exerting a closing force of 2 g. The combination of the NMDA receptor blocker APV (50 microM) and the AMPA/kainate (KA) receptor blocker CNQX (10 microM) resulted in significantly improved recovery of CAP amplitude postinjury; however, the NMDA receptor antagonist APV alone did not enhance postinjury recovery, and infusion of NMDA (10 microM) did not affect recovery of the CAPs. In contrast, the AMPA/KA receptor blockers NBQX (10 microM) or CNQX (10 microM) significantly enhanced the recovery of CAP amplitude postinjury. The agonists AMPA (100 microM) or KA (100 microM) resulted in significant attenuation of CAP amplitude postinjury. Coapplication of AMPA/KA plus NBQX and CNQX was also associated with improved functional recovery. After incubation with AMPA and KA, Co(2+)-positive glia were visualized in spinal cord white matter. Similar results were seen after compressive injury but not in control cords. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated AMPA (GluR4)- and KA (GluR6/7 and KA2)-positive astrocytes in spinal cord white matter. In summary, non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord injury. The presence of AMPA (GluR4) and KA (GluR6/7 and KA2) receptors on periaxonal astrocytes suggests a role for these cells in glutamatergic white matter injury."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of 2D and 3D microarchitectural characteristics in the assessment of the mechanical strength of os calcis cancellous bone. A sample of cancellous bone was removed in a medio-lateral direction from the posterior body of calcaneus, taken at autopsy in 17 subjects aged 61-91 years. The sample was first used for the assessment of morphological parameters from 2D morphometry and 3D synchrotron microtomography (microCT) (spatial resolution=10 microm). The 2D morphometry was obtained from three slices extracted from the 3D microCT images. Very good concordance was shown between 3D microCT slices and the corresponding physical histologic slices. In 2D, the standard histomorphometric parameters, fractal dimension, mean intercept length, and connectivity were computed. In 3D, histomorphometric parameters were computed using both the 3D mean intercept length method and model-independent techniques. The 3D fractal dimension and the 3D connectivity, assessed by Euler density, were also evaluated. The cubic samples were subjected to elastic compressive tests in three orthogonal directions (X, Y, Z) close to the main natural trabecular network directions. A test was performed until collapse of trabecular network in the main direction (Z). The mechanical properties were significantly correlated to most morphological parameters resulting from 2D and 3D analysis. In 2D, the correlation between the mechanical strength and bone volume/tissue volume was not significantly improved by adding structural parameters or connectivity parameter (nodes number/tissue volume). In 3D, one architectural parameter (the trabecular thickness, Tb.Th) permitted to improve the estimation of the compressive strength from the bone volume/tissue volume alone. However, this improvement was minor since the correlation with the BV/TV alone was high (r=0.96). In conclusion, which is in agreement with the statistic's rules, we found, in this study, that the determination of the os calcis bone compressive strength using the 3D bone volume fraction cannot be improved by adding 3D architectural parameters."

            "abstract": "The 2010 impact goal of the American Heart Association is to reduce death rates from heart disease and stroke by 25% and to lower the prevalence of the leading risk factors by the same proportion. Much of the burden of acute heart disease is initially experienced out of hospital and can be reduced by timely delivery of effective prehospital emergency care. Many patients with an acute myocardial infarction die from cardiac arrest before they reach the hospital. A small proportion of those with cardiac arrest who reach the hospital survive to discharge. Current health surveillance systems cannot determine the burden of acute cardiovascular illness in the prehospital setting nor make progress toward reducing that burden without improved surveillance mechanisms. Accordingly, the goals of this article provide a brief overview of strategies for managing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We review existing surveillance systems for monitoring progress in reducing the burden of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States and make recommendations for filling significant gaps in these systems, including the following: 1. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and their outcomes through hospital discharge should be classified as reportable events as part of a heart disease and stroke surveillance system. 2. Data collected on patients' encounters with emergency medical services systems should include descriptions of the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders and defibrillation by lay responders. 3. National annual reports on key indicators of progress in managing acute cardiovascular events in the out-of-hospital setting should be developed and made publicly available. Potential barriers to action on cardiac arrest include concerns about privacy, methodological challenges, and costs associated with designating cardiac arrest as a reportable event."

            "title": "Use of automated external defibrillators in cardiac arrest: an evidence-based analysis.",
            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objectives were to identify the components of a program to deliver early defibrillation that optimizes the effectiveness of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in out-of-hospital and hospital settings, to determine whether AEDs are cost-effective, and if cost-effectiveness was determined, to advise on how they should be distributed in Ontario.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical need:\n        \n      \n      Survival in people who have had a cardiac arrest is low, especially in out-of-hospital settings. With each minute delay in defibrillation from the onset of cardiac arrest, the probability of survival decreases by 10%. (1) Early defibrillation (within 8 minutes of a cardiac arrest) has been shown to improve survival outcomes in these patients. However, in out-of-hospital settings and in certain areas within a hospital, trained personnel and their equipment may not be available within 8 minutes. This implies that \"first responders\" should take up the responsibility of delivering shock. The first responders in out-of-hospital settings are usually bystanders, firefighters, police, and community volunteers. In hospital settings, they are usually nurses. These first responders are not trained in reading electrocardiograms and identifying abnormal heart rhythms restorable by defibrillation.\n    \n\n\n          The technology:\n        \n      \n      An AED is a device that can analyze a heart rhythm and deliver a shock if needed. Thus, AEDs can be used by first responders to deliver early defibrillation in out-of-hospital and hospital settings. However, simply providing an AED would not likely improve survival outcomes. Rather, AEDs have a role in strengthening the \"chain of survival,\" which includes prompt activation of the 911 telephone system, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), rapid defibrillation, and timely advanced life support. In the chain of survival, the first step for a witness of a cardiac arrest in an out-of-hospital setting is to call 911. Second, the witness initiates CPR (if she or he is trained in CPR). If the witness cannot initiate CPR, or the first responders of the 911 system (e.g., firefighters/police) have arrived, the first responders initiate CPR. Third, the witness or first responders apply an AED to the patient. The device reads the patient's heart rhythm and prompts for shock when indicated. Fourth, the patient is handed over to the advanced life-support team with subsequent admission to an intensive care unit in a hospital. The use of AEDs requires developing and implementing a program at sites where the cardiac arrest rate is high, where a number of potential first responders are trained and retained, and where patients are transferred to an advanced care facility after initiating resuscitation. Obviously, placing an AED at a site where no cardiac arrests are likely to occur would be futile, as would placing an AED at a site where no one knows how to use it. Moreover, abandoning patients after initial resuscitation by not transferring them to an advanced care facility would negate all earlier efforts. Thus, it is important to identify the essential components of an AED program that might also optimize the effectiveness of AED use.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      There is a large body of literature on the use of AEDs in various settings ranging from closed environments such as hospitals, airlines, and casinos to open places such as sports fields and highways. There is little doubt regarding the effectiveness and safety of AEDs to treat people in cardiac arrest. It is intuitive that these devices should be provided in hospitals in areas that are not readily accessible to the traditional responders, the \"code blue team.\" Similarly, it is intuitive to provide AEDs in out-of-hospital settings where the risk of cardiac arrest is high and a response plan involving trained first responders in the use of AEDs is in place. Thus, the Medical Advisory Secretariat reviewed the literature and focused on the components of an AED program in out-of-hospital settings that maximize the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the program in the management of cardiac arrest. Search engines included MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit and Web sites of other agencies that assess health technologies. Any study that reported results of an AED program in an out-of-hospital setting was included. Studies that did not use AEDs, had a physician-assisted emergency response plan, did not have a program for the use of AEDs, or did not include cardiac arrest as an outcome were excluded.\n    \n\n\n          Summary of findings:\n        \n      \n      A total of 133 articles were identified; 62 were excluded after reviewing titles and abstracts. Of the 71 articles reviewed, 8 reported findings of 2 large studies, the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) study and the Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) trial. These studies examined the effect of a community program to respond to cardiac arrest with and without the use of AEDs. Their authors had reported a significant reduction in overall mortality from cardiac arrest with the use of AEDs. Factors That Improve the Effectiveness of an AED Program The PAD trial investigators reported a significant improvement in survival (P = .03) after providing AEDs in public access areas and training volunteers in CPR compared with training volunteers in CPR only. The OPALS study investigators reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for significant predictors of survival, which were age (OR [age per 10 year], 0.8; CI, 0.8-0.9), arrest witnessed by bystander (OR, 3.9; CI, 2.7-5.5), CPR initiated by bystander (OR, 3.7; CI, 2.6-5.1), CPR initiated by first responder (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.1-2.3), and emergency medical service response within 8 minutes (OR, 3.0; CI, 1.8-5.1). The last 3 variables are modifiable and thus may improve the effectiveness of an AED program. For example, the rate of bystander-initiated CPR was only 14% in the OPALS study, but it was 100% in the PAD trial. This was because PAD trial investigators trained community volunteers whereas the OPALS study investigators did not. Cost-Effectiveness A systematic review of the literature suggests that cost-effectiveness varies from setting to setting. Most of the studies have estimated cost-effectiveness in American settings from a societal perspective; therefore, the results are not applicable to this report. However, results from this review suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest in out-of-hospital setting in Ontario is 59 per 100,000 people. The mean age of cardiac arrest patients is 69 years. Eighty-five percent of these cardiac arrests occur in homes. Of all the cardiac arrests, 37% have heart rhythm abnormalities (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) that are correctable by delivering shock through an AED. Thus, in an out-of-hospital setting, general use of AEDs by laypersons would not be cost-effective. Special programs are needed in the out-of-hospital setting for cost-effective use of AEDs. One model for the use of AEDs in out-of-hospital settings was examined in the OPALS study. Firefighters and police were trained and provided with AEDs. The total initial cost (in US dollars) of this program was estimated to be $980,000. The survival rate was 3.9% before implementing the AED program and 5.2% after its implementation (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03-1.7; P = .03). Applying these estimates to cardiac arrest rates in Ontario in 2002, one would expect 54 patients of the total 1,395 cardiac arrests to survive without AEDs compared with 73 patients with AEDs; thus, 19 additional lives might be saved each year with an AED program. It would initially cost $51,579 to save each additional life. In subsequent years, however, total cost would be lower (about $50,000 per year), when it would cost $2,632 to save each additional life per year. One limitation of the OPALS study was that the authors combined emergency medical service response time and application of an AED into a single variable. Thus, it was not possible to tease out the independent effects of reduction in response time and application of an AED on the small improvement in survival. Nevertheless, the PAD study found that when response time was fixed, the application of AED improved survival. There are other delivery models for AEDs in casinos, sports arenas, and airports. The proportion of cardiac arrest at these sites out of the total cardiac arrests in Ontario is between 0.05% and 0.4%. Thus, an AED placed at these sites would likely not be used at all. Of the 85% cardiac arrests that occur in homes, 56% occur in single residential dwellings (houses), 23% occur in multi-residential dwellings (apartments/condominiums), and 6% occur in nursing homes. There is no program in place except the 911 system to reach these patients. Accordingly, the Medical Advisory Secretariat examined the cost-effectiveness of providing AEDs in hospitals, office buildings, apartments/condominiums, and houses. The results suggested that deployment of AEDs in hospitals would be cost-effective in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year gained. Conversely, deployment of AEDs in office buildings, apartments, and houses was not cost-effective. An exception, however, was noted for people at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest; these were patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The OPALS study model appears cost-effective, and effectiveness can be further enhanced by training community volunteers to improve the bystander-initiated CPR rates. Deployment of AEDs in all public access areas and in houses and apartments is not cost-effective. Further research is needed to examine the benefit of in-home use of AEDs in patients at high risk of cardiac arrest."

Listening to time-compressed speech in a binaural homophasic mode resulted in better speech recognition than in a monaural mode for both adults and children. When speech was antiphasic, both adults and children demonstrated a release from masking for normal-rate (0% compression) and 60 percent time-compressed speech.

The objective of this literature review is to address the mechanics of interbody cage fixation in the lumbar spine with respect to three-dimensional stabilization and the strength of the cage-vertebra interface. The effect of supplementary posterior fixation is reviewed. Only three-dimensional stabilization evaluations in human cadaveric models are included. These studies involve the application of different loads to the spine and the measurement of vertebral motion in flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending. There are no published studies which detected any differences between different cage designs. However, it does seem that cages inserted from an anterior direction provide better stabilization to the spine than those inserted from a posterior direction. In general, anterior cages stabilize better than posterior cages in axial rotation and lateral bending. Cages from both directions stabilized well in flexion, but not in extension. Supplementary posterior fixation with pedicle or translaminar screws substantially improves the stabilization in all directions. The strength of the cage-vertebra interface from studies using human cadaveric specimens is also reviewed. The axial compressive strength of this interface is highly dependent upon vertebral body bone density. Other factors such as preservation of the subchondral bony end-plate and cage design are clearly less important in the compressive strength. Supplementary posterior instrumentation does not enhance substantially the interface strength in axial compression."

Affected vertebral bodies with osteonecrosis were defined as an avascular area (nonenhanced area on enhanced T1-weighted images) with collections of intravertebral fluid (hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images), air (signal void on all images), or both. The degree of vertebral collapse was classified as mild (>50%) or severe (<50%) preserved vertebral height. Changes in adjacent intervertebral disks or vertebral bodies 2 above and 2 below the affected vertebrae were compared.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled 112 patients (30 men, 82 women; 121 vertebral bodies) in our study. Intravertebral air alone was observed in 48 involved levels (39.7%), intravertebral fluid alone was found in 47 (38.8%), and both coexisted in 26 (21.5%). Degree of vertebral collapse in affected vertebral bodies significantly differed with presence of air or fluid (P < .05).

Communicable diseases, primarily diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria and measles, contribute to substantially higher mortality rates in refugee populations compared to similar non-displaced populations.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A systematic sample of 402 households in one portion of the camp were surveyed for diarrhoeal risk factors, and then interviewed twice weekly for 4 months regarding new diarrhoea episodes and the presence of soap in the household. Two-hundred grams of soap per person was distributed monthly.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Households had soap on average only 38% of the interview days. Soap was used primarily for bathing and washing clothes (86%). Although 81% of mothers reported washing their children's hands, only 28% of those mothers used soap for that purpose. The presence of soap in a household showed a significant protective effect: there were 27% less episodes of diarrhoea in households when soap was present compared to when no soap was present (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54 < RR < 0.98). Potential confounding factors were assessed and did not appear to be responsible for the association between the presence of soap and reductions in diarrhoea incidence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In summary, our findings suggest that the provision of regular and adequate soap rations, even in the absence of a behaviour modification or education programme, can play an important role in reducing diarrhoea in refugee populations. If subsequent study confirms the soap as a cheap and effective measure to reduce diarrhoea, its provision in adequate amounts should be a high priority in refugee settings."

On account of its spreading properties and the ability to re-expand atelectatic areas, exogenous surfactant may act as a pulmonary drug delivery agent. We investigated the interactions between antitubercular drugs and the main surfactant component, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with the aim of developing more effective antitubercular drug loaded surfactants. The surface properties were evaluated using a Langmuir-Blodgett trough and Wilhelmy balance at 37 degrees C. Lung surfactant was modeled as DPPC monolayers. The isoniazid (INH)-DPPC combination in 1:1 ratio by weight significantly improved the adsorption of DPPC, reached a minimum surface tension of zero, formed a low compressibility film and required 32.7% area change to decrease surface tension from 30 to 10 mN/m. The triple drug (INH-rifampicin-ethambutol in 1:2:3 ratio by weight) DPPC combination when used in 1:1 or 1:2 ratios by weight also achieved surface properties superior to those of DPPC alone. A significant improvement in the adsorption was observed (surface tensions of 34.7 mN/m for 1:1 and 32.0 mN/m for 1:2 triple drug: DPPC combinations in the first second), and the films had low compressibility reaching a minimum surface tension of zero on compression. Thus, we observed statistically significant improvements in all the surface parameters and we feel encouraged to continue developing a tuberculosis therapy consisting of surfactant liposomes carrying antitubercular drugs."

            "abstract": "Environmental enrichment of laboratory mice can improve the quality of research, but debate arises over the means of enrichment and its ability to be used in a sterile environment. One important form of enrichment is nesting material. Mice in the wild build dome-shaped, complex, multilayered nests, but this behavior is not seen in the laboratory, perhaps due to inappropriate nesting material rather than the nest-building ability of the mice. Here we focus on the use of naturalistic nesting materials to test whether they improve nest quality through the use of a 'naturalistic nest score' system; we also focus on materials that can be sterilized and easily used in existing housing systems. We first determined whether C57BL/6J mice build naturalistic nests when given shredded paper strips. We then compared these shredded paper strips with other commonly used nesting enrichments (facial tissues and compressed cotton squares). Nests were scored for 6 d. We found that the shredded paper strips allowed the mice to build higher quality nests than those built with any of the other materials. Nests built with tissues were of intermediate quality, and nests built with compressed cotton squares were of poor quality, similar to those built by the control group. These results suggest that C57BL/6J mice given appropriate nesting materials can build nests similar to those built by their wild counterparts."

A new minimal invasion procedure of percutaneous posterior-lateral lumbar interbody fusion (PPLIF) using a B-Twin stand-alone expandable spinal spacer (ESS) was designed to treat this disease and evaluated by follow-up more than 1 year. 12 cases with chronic low back pain and compressive radiculopathy due to DDD refractory were selected to conservative treatment. Under fluoroscopy in the posterior-lateral position, a K-wire was advanced into the intervertebral space and a dilator and working cannula were introduced into the disc space step by step. Discectomy and endplate scratching were performed through the cannula using pituitary forceps and endplate curettage. An ESS was inserted into the intervertebral space by a B-Twin expandable spinal delivery system after some bone graft chips implanted into the disc space. The ongoing study includes intraoperative difficulties, complications, radiologic evidence of fusion and clinical outcome as scored by pre- and postoperative questionnaires pertaining to pain intensity and degree of disability. The 12 procedures of lumbar interbody fusion using stand-alone expandable spinal system through percutaneous approach were successful. Radiologic study demonstrated fusion in a total of 11 cases and only 1 exception after more than 1 year visiting. The values of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on movement and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) dropped by more than 80 and 67.4%, respectively.

For example, consonant recognition improved by approximately 50 percentage points, on average, between the HA-alone listening conditions and the CI-alone condition. There were no statistically significant score differences between conditions with SoundRecover enabled and disabled. There was a small but significant improvement in the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to understand 50% of the words in the sentences presented in noise when an HA was used simultaneously with the CI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although each of these CI users readily accepted the Phonak Naida HA with SoundRecover frequency compression, no benefits related specifically to the use of SoundRecover were found in the particular tests of speech understanding applied in this study. The relatively high levels of perceptual performance attained by these subjects with use of a CI by itself are consistent with the finding that the addition of an HA provided little further benefit. However, the use of an HA with the CI did provide better performance than the CI alone for understanding sentences in noise."

In comparison, the statistics for cardiac arrest victims who did not receive bystander CPR were 14.6% and 4.7%, respectively (p less than 0.001). A critical factor in patient survival was the amount of time that elapsed before the EMS personnel arrived and administered CPR.

            "abstract": "Zenker's diverticulum is the single most common diverticular event arising in the esophagus. Its physiopathology is universally recognized. Lack of coordination between the propulsive pharyngeal contractions and the release of the upper esophageal sphincter creates abnormally high pressure in the pharyngeal chamber, resulting in the collapse of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, i.e., the Laimer-Killian triangle (or Killian's dehiscence). The mucosal hernia that develops constitutes the diverticulum, which grows in volume and above all in length and is compressed between two rigid structures, namely, the spine posteriorly and the trachea anteriorly. Swallowing progressively fills the diverticulum, which in turn leads to compression of the esophagus and hence to the characteristic symptom of \"delayed dysphagia\" or \"dysphagia of the 3rd bite\". These physiopathological considerations underpin the rationale for surgical treatment, namely upper esophageal sphincter myotomy and diverticulectomy, which is the standard approach used in the 44 cases presented here. A diverticulopexy was performed only once due to the patient's advanced age. Myotomy alone was performed in only one case, given the small size of the diverticulum. In two patients the standard procedure was carried out following emergency therapy for iatrogenic perforation of the diverticulum. The patient with cancer underwent chemo-radiotherapy after futile surgical attempts. Complications included transitory salivary leakage (1 case), and a transitory laryngeal nerve deficit (1 case). Gastroesophageal reflux disease was present in two-thirds of the patients. A Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication was performed one year after treatment of the diverticulum in 5 patients. The following important aspects emerged: i) the incidence of neoplasia on the diverticulum; ii) the association and possible pathogenetic relationship with gastro-esophageal reflux disease iii) the validity of myotomy plus diverticulectomy as a treatment option in view of the negligible complications and the absence of relapse and/or persistence of dysphagia."

            "abstract": "Rupture of the thoracic aorta is a leading cause of rapid fatality in automobile crashes, but the exact mechanisms of this injury remain unidentified. One commonly postulated mechanism is a differential motion of the aortic arch relative to the heart and its neighboring vessels caused by high-magnitude acceleration of the thorax. This paper investigates acceleration as an aortic injury mechanism using nine impact-sled tests with human cadaver thoraces. The test system utilized generates very high posteriorly directed thoracic accelerations with minimal compression of the chest. The sled tests resulted in peak mid-spine accelerations of 169+/-35.0 g (mean+/-standard deviation) with sustained mid-spine accelerations of up to 80 g for 20 ms in most cases. The tests resulted in maximum chest compressions of 7+/-3.1% of the total chest depth, and maximum recorded increases in intra-aortic, tracheal, and esophageal pressure of 177, 112, and 156 kPa, respectively. No macroscopic injuries to the thoracic aorta resulted from these tests, though other limited visceral injury was observed. The results suggest that posteriorly directed acceleration alone (up to the magnitudes studied here) is not sufficient to cause gross aortic injury. Furthermore, the observed transient increases in intra-aortic and extra-aortic pressure indicate that complex pressure distributions are present during dynamic thoracic deceleration events. This suggests that any attempt to model traumatic aortic injury should include consideration for both the intra-aortic fluid pressure and the extra-aortic, intra-thoracic pressure present during the event."

This study will be conducted in three phases using the Theory of Planned Behaviour. In Phase One, we will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews with a purposeful selection of 9-1-1 call takers from Ontario, and identify common themes and belief categories. In Phase Two, we will use the qualitative interview results to design and pilot a quantitative survey. In Phase Three, a final version of the quantitative survey will be administered via an electronic medium to all registered call takers in the province of Ontario. We will perform qualitative thematic analysis (Phase One) and regression modelling (Phases Two and Three), to determine direct and indirect relationship of behavioural constructs with intentions to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructions.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study will provide valuable insight into the factors associated with the successful recognition of agonal breathing and cardiac arrest by 9-1-1 call takers.

            "abstract": "Historically, cardiac arrest outcomes have been stagnant with few therapies demonstrating clinical benefit. Recent advances in our understanding of cardiac arrest physiology and therapy have led to improved outcomes and renewed interest in defining the \"optimal\" approach. Cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) represents a bundle of specific therapies designed to enhance perfusion during cardiopulmonary arrest by emphasizing chest compressions over ventilations and \"priming\" the heart with compressions before and after defibrillation attempts. Implemented in Arizona and Wisconsin in 2003, patients treated using CCR appear to have improved outcomes compared with those treated under the 2000 guidelines from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR). This was particularly true in the subgroup of patients with bystander-witnessed collapse, who may represent a group with adequate oxygen reserves at the time of arrest and decreased requirement for immediate positive-pressure ventilation. Many components of CCR have since been incorporated in the 2005 ILCOR guidelines. Beyond the specific treatment approaches that define CCR, this alternative approach may represent the future of resuscitation science in which each institution and emergency medical services agency will define an optimal approach to treatment and training based on the specific resources available and patient population. This may mandate a paradigm shift away from advanced cardiac life support and basic life support, which emphasize standardization of content and format rather than institution- or agency-specific protocols and training."

            "abstract": "Prophylaxis against pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii is most often carried out using pentamidine administered as an aerosol. For reasons both of comfort and cost this technique should be developed at home or at least in an extra-hospital environment. Using the Respirgard II as the nebuliser of reference this requires a compressor. We have assessed four different compressors and compared these to pressurised oxygen used in a hospital environment. During the course of nebulisation with a pentamidine aerosol two physical factors may coincide to limit their efficacy. First the deposition of some of the particles on the walls of the apparatus and secondly the production of a particle size which is incompatible with alveolar deposition. This study showed that according to the source of compressed air: 1) the fraction of the pentamidine solution found in an aerosol at the mouthpiece varies from 29 to 62%; 2) the fraction of the aerosol whose particle size is suitable for alveolar deposition (1 to 3 microns) varies from 35 to 48%. The product of these two fractions enables an assessment of the efficiency of each apparatus: 14 to 24% of the pentamidine solution may be deposited at the alveolar level. In addition to this efficiency the duration of the session (from 25 to 50 minutes) for each machine should be taken into consideration when considering the choice of the compressor to be coupled with the Respirgard II in order to improve the comfort and therefore the compliance to the treatment."

Fifty-two limbs were operated on in 41 patients.

All patients with symptomatic aneurysms and 22 patients with asymptomatic aneurysms (21 larger than 2 cm in diameter, 1 with thrombus at duplex ultrasound scanning) underwent surgery as first-line treatment. Of the 7 patients with asymptomatic aneurysm managed with surveillance with duplex ultrasound scanning, acute ischemia developed in three, 1 aneurysm ruptured, compressive symptoms developed in 1, and 2 remained asymptomatic but required surgery because of aneurysm enlargement (>2 cm). Of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, 13 had neurologic signs and underwent immediate thromboembolectomy (trifurcation alone in 8, ankle-level arteriotomy in 4) and bypass grafting (n = 12) or inlay grafting (n = 1), and the other 4 underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis initially. Of these 4 procedures, 2 were successful and had elective surgery; the other 2 required urgent surgery because of secondary distal embolism and failure of recanalization. Thirteen of the 17 grafts were to the crural vessels. Bypass grafting (medial approach) was used in 16 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, all 5 patients with chronic ischemia, and the 8 patients with no symptoms. An inlay technique (posterior approach) was used in 16 patients with no symptoms, the 3 patients with symptoms of nerve or vein compression, and 1 patient with acute ischemia. The distal anastomoses were to the below-knee popliteal artery in 35 patients and the crural arteries in 15 patients, using autologous vein. Two of the patients with rupture underwent ligation alone, the other undergoing bypass grafting in addition. The overall 5-year primary patency rate was 69%, secondary patency rate was 87%, and limb salvage rate was 87%. Limb salvage was achieved in 14 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia. Patients with asymptomatic aneurysms had better secondary graft patency (100%) compared with symptomatic aneurysms (74%; P <.01). Acute ischemia, technique used, and crural artery grafts were not predictors of graft failure with either univariate or multivariate analysis. Symptomatic aneurysms were associated with more postoperative complications and greater 30-day mortality (4 of 28 vs 0 of 24).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Thromboembolectomy followed by crural bypass grafting is an effective treatment for popliteal aneurysm with severe acute limb ischemia.

Abnormal SCEPs correlated significantly with the severity of spinal cord compromise and symptoms, such as myelopathy.

To assess the influence of the surface zone on the viscoelastic properties of cartilage under compressive loading, we prepared osteochondral plugs from skeletally mature steers, with and without the surface zone of articular cartilage, for study in the confined compression creep experiment. The relative contributions of two viscoelastic mechanisms, i.e. a flow-independent mechanism [Hayes and Bodine, J. Biomechanics 11, 407-419 (1978)], and a flow-dependent mechanism [Mow et al. J. biomech. Engng 102, 73-84 (1980)], to the compressive creep response of these two types of specimens were determined using the biphasic poroviscoelastic theory proposed by Mak. [J. Biomechanics 20, 703-714 (1986)]. From the experimental results and the biphasic poroviscoelastic theory, we found that frictional drag associated with interstitial fluid flow and fluid pressurization are the dominant mechanisms of load support in the intact specimens, i.e. the flow-dependent mechanisms alone were sufficient to describe normal articular cartilage compressive creep behavior. For specimens with the surface removed, we found an increased creep rate which was derived from an increased tissue permeability, as well as significant changes in the flow-independent parameters of the viscoelastic solid matrix. permeability, as well as significant changes in the flow-independent parameters of the viscoelastic solid matrix. From these tissue properties and the biphasic poroviscoelastic theory, we determined that the flow-dependent mechanisms of load support, i.e. frictional drag and fluid pressurization, were greatly diminished in cartilage without the articular surface. Calculations based upon these material parameters show that for specimens with the surface zone removed, the cartilage solid matrix became more highly loaded during the early stages of creep. This suggests that an important function of the articular surface is to provide for a low fluid permeability, and thereby serve to restrict fluid exudation and increase interstitial fluid pressurization. Thus, it is likely that with increasing severity of damage to the articular surface, load support in cartilage under compression shifts from the flow-dependent modes of fluid drag and pressurization to increased solid matrix stress. This suggests that it is important to maintain the integrity of the articular surface in preserving normal compressive behavior of the tissue and normal load carriage in the joint."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The efficacy of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is vital for saving lives of victims with sudden cardiac arrest. In 1960, Kuowenhoven and colleagues proposed the method that has become standard for CPR. Despite vast input of resources for public education and training of this procedure, its success rate outside hospitals remains poor to dismal. During CPR, restoration of respiration is as important as circulation. But opening the airway and giving effective mouth-to-mouth respiration is difficult for lay people to learn. Furthermore, most bystanders are reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth respiration because of the risk of infection. Therefore, the general population needs a more simplified CPR method for outpatients. The practice of CPR in the prone position, first proposed by McNeil in 1989, has not been adopted, despite the fact that it meets the desirable requirements of ideal resuscitation: simultaneous restoration of circulation and respiration with a very simple maneuver.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Part 1 (circulation test): Eleven patients who expired in the intensive care unit (ICU), with arterial lines attached, received standard pre-cordial cardiac massage, and the generated blood pressure (BP) was recorded. They were then turned to the prone position, with the head turned to one side. We compressed the patient's thoracic spine with the same force used in standard CPR (rhythm of approximately 60 per minute each time when the back bounces back), and the BP was also recorded. Part 2 (ventilation test): Ten healthy volunteers (5 doctors and 5 nurses) were enlisted for respiratory assessment during compression on the back. With the nose clipped and spontaneous breathing held, the volunteer's exhaled tidal volume upon compression was measured with a spirometer.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Standard external cardiac massage of the cadavers generated BPs of 55 +/- 20/13 +/- 7 mmHg; however, external compression on the back of the cadavers generated higher BP of 79 +/- 20/17 +/- 10 mmHg (p = 0.028, Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis). External compression on the back of the volunteers generated mean tidal volumes of 399 +/- 110 mL.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study revealed that prone CPR provides good respiratory and circulatory support at the same time. It is easy to perform and it may be a good alternative way for bystanders to perform CPR in public surroundings. We recommend that more investigators do further studies on this topic."

            "abstract": "This study is concerned with the value of basic CPR (manual ventilation and closed chest cardiac massage) initiated within 5 min in delaying brain damage after cardiac arrest in adult patients at ambient temperature. In 88 cases of cardiac arrest, basic CPR was initiated within 5 min of collapse by trained ambulance personnel. Basic CPR was continued during transport to the hospital in ambulances not equipped with defibrillators. Advanced CPR was instituted in all patients upon hospital arrival. All 11 patients eventually discharged from the hospital without apparent brain damage arrived at the hospital within 10 min of cardiac arrest. A significant number of patients arriving later could be resuscitated acutely but later died unconscious or were discharged with severe brain damage. We conclude that basic CPR, including bystander CPR initiated within 5 min of cardiac arrest is likely to be of long-term value only if definitive advanced life support can be provided within 10 min after the patient's collapse."

A reliable multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method based on the second derivative Raman measurements of the three pure physical forms was developed and validated with 3.5% root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for Form B, which was selected as the preferred form for further development. A partial least squares (PLS) algorithm was also used for the multivariate calibration of both the NIR and Raman measurements. The long-term stability of Form B as a neat active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in a tablet formulation was quantitatively monitored under various stress conditions of temperature and moisture. Moisture, temperature, excipients and compression were found to have significant effects on the phase transition behavior of Form B."

In three UK cities, victims of non-traumatic, out of hospital cardiac arrest, over the age of 8 years received either standard or ACD-CPR on arrival of ambulance personnel. Main outcome measures were return of spontaneous circulation, survival to be admitted to the intensive care unit, survival to hospital discharge, and neurological outcome. A total of 576 patients (STD-CPR, n=309; ACD-CPR, n=267) were analysed. The treatment groups were similar with respect to age, gender, proportion of witnessed arrests, initial cardiac rhythm, and call to advanced life support interval. The proportion of patients receiving bystander CPR was higher in the ACD group (37.1% vs. 28.5%; P=0.028). The interval between collapse and defibrillation was longer in the ACD group (12.3 min vs. 10.4 min; P=0.028). There was no difference between the STD-CPR and ACD-CPR groups in survival to admission to the intensive care unit (13.6% vs. 13.8%; P=0.93) or hospital discharge (4.8% vs. 6.0%; P=0.67). There was no difference between the groups with respect to the neurological outcome of those patients surviving to hospital discharge. Analysis of important subgroups also showed no benefit for ACD-CPR. We conclude that there was no improvement in outcome with ACD-CPR when used by ambulance personnel in Cardiff and Portsmouth."

The problem is that for a small, but important, minority of victims (children and those suffering an asphyxial or prolonged arrest) this is suboptimal treatment. The forthcoming guidelines revision process will require a compromise to be reached. The solution proposed is citizen training in two stages: adult compression-only CPR initially, then a second, follow-up stage when ventilation is added to satisfy the needs of minority victims."

Relevant knowledge is provided to the public by various course conceptions. The learning success concerning a one day first aid course (\"LSM\" course in Germany) has not been much investigated in the past.

We have used Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation for the modeling of methane storage at 293 K and pressures up to 80 MPa in idealized bundles of (10,10) armchair-type single-walled carbon nanotubes and wormlike carbon pores. We have found that these carbon nanomaterials can be treated as the world's smallest high-capacity methane storage vessels. Our simulation results indicate that such novel carbon nanostructures can reach a high volumetric energy storage, exceeding the US FreedomCAR Partnership target of 2010 (5.4 MJ dm(-3)), at low to moderate pressures ranging from 1 to 7 MPa at 293 K. On the contrary, in the absence of these nanomaterials, methane needs to be compressed to approximately 13 MPa at 293 K to achieve the same target. The light carbon membranes composed of bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes or wormlike pores efficiently physisorb methane at low to moderate pressures at 293 K, which we believe should be particularly important for automobiles and stationary devices. However, above 15-20 MPa at 293 K, all investigated samples of novel carbon nanomaterials are not as effective when compared with compression alone since the stored volumetric energy and power saturate at values below those of the bulk, compressed fluid."

The complex density expresses the geometry-dependent viscous coupling between the gas and the pore walls and is related to the thermoacoustic function f(mu), or equivalently, F(lambdaV). The acoustic impedance of a compliant region coupled to a pore (or pore-array) is measured and the impedance of the compliant region is subtracted to yield the impedance of the pore(s) alone, which is directly related to F(lambdaV). Pores of different lengths are measured in order to eliminate end effects. Working down to very low frequencies achieves a wide range of values for the ratio of the viscous penetration depth to the mean pore size. The results agree very well with analytical solutions for circular pores. The technique is also applied to two porous foam materials. Comparing the results to previous measurements of the complex compressibility, it is shown that two different shape factors (or equivalently, characteristic dimensions) are required to account for the data."

An overall greater proportion of patients survived to hospital discharge in Edinburgh, 12.4%, compared with 7.2% in Milwaukee (P < 0.01). However patients were more likely to have a witnessed collapse in Edinburgh 65.7%, compared with 25% (P < 0.001) and significantly more of those patients received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 42.3%, compared with 27.1% (P < 0.005).

            "abstract": "Vasovagally mediated cardiac asystole has been proposed as a potential cause of sudden cardiac death. To assess this possibility and identify characteristics that define patients with vasovagally mediated asystole, head-upright tilt-table testing was performed in 50 consecutive patients (26 women and 24 men, mean age 42 +/- 10 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope. The upright tilt-table test was performed in the fasting state for 30 minutes, with or without the use of intravenous isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/min). The production of ventricular asystole lasting greater than 4 seconds was considered a positive result. All patients with tilt-induced asystole received therapy with either beta blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine or atrioventricular permanent pacing, the efficacy of which was evaluated with serial tilt-table tests. Reproducible tilt-induced asystole occurred in 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, mean age 23 +/- 12 years) (7 patients during baseline tilt, and 3 during isoproterenol infusion). Analysis of this group revealed that they had significantly more frequent and severe syncopal episodes (3 patients had episodes needing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation) than did those patients with tilt-induced syncope without asystole. All patients who had tilt-induced asystole eventually became tilt-table negative with therapy (4 with beta blockers, 2 with disopyramide, and 4 with atrioventricular permanent pacing), and over a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 6 months no further syncopal episodes occurred. It is concluded that patients with recurrent tilt-induced asystole represent a distinct subgroup that has recurrent severe syncope that may mimic or result in sudden cardiac death. Thus, the predischarge electrophysiologic study could predict late outcome with recurrence of preexicitation or supraventricular tachycardia in patients who had undergone surgical ablation of the accessory pathway with an overall predictive accuracy of 95% (107 of 113 patients), negative predictive value of 96% (103 of 107), and positive predictive value of 67% (4 of 6)."

Age, initial arrhythmia and duration of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) were important factors in determining the initial success of CPR. Long-term survival was associated with CPA of less than 4 minutes duration, with bystander-initiated CPR and with CPR lasting less than 30 minutes. Better education of the public and more direct access to the system should make it possible to treat more patients in more favourable conditions and improve overall results. A more determined effort to educate the public in CPR would also improve the prognosis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."

Epidemiologic studies from different cities have shown conflicting results. We conducted a study to determine the effect of early CPR versus no CPR on resuscitability, 24-hour survival, and neurologic deficit in an animal model of cardiac arrest. Twenty-two mongrel dogs were subjected to five minutes of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation. In 11 dogs, closed-chest massage and ventilation with room air was begun immediately and was continued for five minutes. The other 11 dogs received no CPR. At five minutes defibrillation was attempted and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols were followed until the animal was resuscitated or died. No statistical difference in resuscitability or 24-hour survival between the two groups was demonstrated. Eight of 11 \"early CPR\" animals were resuscitated and survived 24 hours; six of 11 \"no CPR\" dogs were resuscitated, and five lived for 24 hours. A significant difference was demonstrated by the Student t test in neurologic deficit and ease of resuscitation. \"Early CPR\" dogs had no neurologic deficit, while \"no CPR\" dogs had a 41% deficit (P less than .01). \"Early CPR\" dogs were resuscitated in significantly less time once ACLS was started (29 versus 317 seconds), and required less electrical energy (100 versus 560 J), fewer countershocks (1.3 versus 4.0), and less epinephrine (0.1 versus 1.7 mg) than did \"no CPR\" animals. In this animal model of cardiac arrest, early CPR was shown to be beneficial to neurologic function and ease of resuscitation, even when ACLS was provided within five minutes."

Very few communities or emergency medical service (EMS) systems report survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Among those who do, survival rates vary substantially between cities, due in large part to community differences in the chain of survival. To improve survival in cardiac arrest, care must be optimized at each point along the cardiac arrest continuum, including a rapid emergency response, provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by bystanders, delivery of high-quality chest compressions with minimal interruptions by first responders, rapid defibrillation, and optimization of postresuscitation care, including therapeutic hypothermia. Important current initiatives to improve cardiac arrest survival include hands-only CPR delivered by laypersons prior to the arrival of EMS, dispatcher-assisted CPR, and implementation of hospital-based therapeutic hypothermia protocols to improve postresuscitation care. Optimizing cardiac arrest survival requires a team effort between EMS directors, emergency physicians, cardiologists, hospital leadership, and the public."

Initial animal studies and a prospective randomized patient trial had suggested that omission of ventilation during the first minutes of lay cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) did not impair patient outcomes. More recent studies demonstrate, however, that this may hold true only in very specific scenarios, and that the chest compression-only technique was never superior to standard BLS. Instead of calling basics of BLS training and practice into question, more and better training of lay persons and professionals appears mandatory, and targeted use of dispatcher-guided telephone CPR should be evaluated and, if it improves outcome, it should be encouraged. Future studies should focus much less on the omission but on the optimization of ventilation under the specific conditions of CPR."

In addition to routine measurements, partial and maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves were superimposed, and the flow transient equivalent of the MEFV curve was determined. Its volume dimension (volume of airway contribution, VACMEFV) partially reflects airway distensibility. Changes in airway compressibility--the other consequence of airway wall instability--were assessed by observing changes in end-expiratory flow rate. Airway resistance, expired volumes, and early expired flow rates, as well as VACMEFV improved significantly after beta 2 medication. Mean end-expiratory flow also increased after beta 2; in two patients, however, it decreased significantly, indicating that enhanced airway compression dominated over the release of bronchospasm. The alone had only minor effects on lung function. Early expired volume and flow rates as well as VACMEFV showed no significant difference between beta 2 alone and Th + beta 2; airway resistance even decreased significantly with this drug combination. End-expiratory flow rate, however, was significantly lower after Th + beta 2 than after beta 2 alone. Although theophylline does not alter lung function in most patients with CF, sympathomimetics relieve bronchospasm in many, but they enhance airway compressibility and thereby decrease peripheral expiratory airflow in some.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Microarray measurements of mRNA abundances is a standard tool for evaluation of transcriptional activity in functional genomics. The methodology underlying these measurements assumes existence of a direct link between transcription levels, that is, gene-specific mRNA copy numbers present in the cell, and transcription rates, that is, the numbers of gene-specific mRNA molecules synthesized per unit of time. In this paper, the question of whether or not such a tight interdependence may exist is examined in the context of nonlinear dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. Using the equations of chemical kinetics, a model has been constructed that is capable of explicitly taking into consideration nonlinear interactions between the genes through the teamwork of transcription factors. Jacobian analysis of stability has shown that steady state equilibrium is impossible in such systems. However, phase space compressibility is found to be negative, thus suggesting that asymptotic stability may exist and assume either the form of limit cycle or of a chaotic attractor. It is argued that in rapidly fluctuating or chaotic systems, direct evaluation of transcription rates through transcription levels is highly problematic. It is also noted that even if a hypothetical steady state did exist, the knowledge of transcription levels alone would not be sufficient for the evaluation of transcription rates; an additional set of parameters, namely the mRNA decay rates, would be required. An overall conclusion of the work is that the measurements of mRNA abundances are not truly representative of the functionality of genes and structural fidelity of the genetic codes."

The involved roots were C5 in 9 patients, C6 in 14, C7 in 14, and C8 in 13.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The pain preceded the arm/fingers symptoms in 35 patients (70%). Although the pain had lasted for more than 7 months on average before surgery, it was relieved early after surgery in 46 patients (92%). When the painful site was suprascapular, C5 or C6 radiculopathy was frequent (P < 0.01). When it was interscapular, C7 or C8 radiculopathy was frequent (P < 0.001). When it was scapular, C8 radiculopathy was frequent (P < 0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pain in the suprascapular, interscapular, or scapular regions can originate directly in the compressed root.

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the effects of cyclic compressive loading on chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in agarose cultures. Rabbit BM-MSCs were obtained from the tibias and femurs of New Zealand white rabbits. After the chondrogenic potential of BM-MSCs was verified by pellet cultures, cell-agarose constructs were made by suspending BM-MSCs in 2% agarose (10(7) cells/ml) for a cyclic, unconfined compression test performed in a custom-made bioreactor. Specimens were divided into four groups: control; transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) (with TGF-beta1 treatment); loading (with stimulation of cyclic, unconfined compressive loading); and TGF-beta loading (with TGF-beta1 treatment and loading stimulation) groups. In the loading experiment, specimens were subjected to sinusoidal loading with a 10% strain magnitude at a frequency of 1 Hz for 4 hours a day. Experiments were conducted for 3, 7, and 14 consecutive days. While the experimental groups (TGF-beta, loading, and TGF-beta loading) exhibited significantly higher levels of expressions of chondrogenic markers (collagen II and aggrecan) at three time periods, there were no differences among the experimental groups after an extra 5-day culture. This suggests that compressive loading alone induces chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit BM-MSCs as effectively as TGF-beta or TGF-beta plus loading treatment. Moreover, both the compressive loading and the TGF-beta1 treatment were found to promote the TGF-beta1 gene expression of rabbit BM-MSCs. These findings suggest that cyclic compressive loading can promote the chondrogenesis of rabbit BM-MSCs by inducing the synthesis of TGF-beta1, which can stimulate the BM-MSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes."

            "abstract": "The principles of aerosol drug delivery by compressed-air nebulization are described, and the therapeutic agents administered by this process for management of asthma are reviewed. For therapy of acute and chronic asthma, aerosol inhalation has become the primary method of drug administration. Aerosolized particles with aerodynamic diameters of 1 to 5 microns are most efficiently deposited in the lower respiratory tract. Delivery systems for therapeutic aerosols include compressed-air nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers. Compressed-air nebulizers are less efficient than metered-dose inhalers; therefore, the drug dosages recommended for nebulizer solutions are 3 to 10 times higher than those delivered by a metered-dose inhaler. Because many asthma patients are treated with nebulization drug therapy at home, both patients and pharmacists must understand how to use the equipment correctly. Drugs used in aerosol therapy of acute and chronic asthma include the beta 2-receptor agonists epinephrine, isoproterenol, isoetharine, metaproterenol, terbutaline, and albuterol; cromolyn sodium; and the anticholinergic agents atropine and ipratropium bromide. Terbutaline and albuterol have longer durations of action and greater beta 2-receptor selectivity than metaproterenol, isoetharine, and isoproterenol. Cromolyn is a first-line prophylactic agent for asthma management. Atropine is indicated for maintenance therapy of chronic asthma and in combination with the beta 2-receptor agonists for therapy of acute asthma; ipratropium bromide is a new agent similar to atropine but with substantially fewer adverse effects. Acute and chronic asthma may be managed by aerosol administration of beta 2-receptor agonists, cromolyn, and atropine, alone or in combination. Inhalation is the preferred route of drug delivery because small doses of medication provide maximal therapeutic benefit with minimal adverse effects."

The calendar included algorithms for removal of a foreign body from the airways and infant and child CPR. The knowledge and skills in these procedures were tested in two groups using a previously validated check-list before and after the introduction of the calendar. One group received the calendar by mass mailing, free-of-charge. Six months after calendar distribution the mean result for 52 persons tested was 18% correct, not different from the 19% correct for 65 persons tested before calendar distribution. The other group received the calendar as part of an internal company campaign focusing on infant and child safety with a possibility for borrowing a baby manikin, but with no instruction involved. In this group the mean result improved significantly from 27% precalendar (n = 57) to 47% (n = 125) (P < 0.001) 1 week after calendar distribution with a significant reduction to 38% (n = 52) (P = 0.004) 6 months later, still significantly better than precalendar (P = 0.004).

In conclusion the calendar had no educational effect when distributed by mail, but a safety campaign which included distribution of the calendar and a possibility to borrow a manikin had a positive influence on the first aid skills and knowledge of lay people.

Logistical, demographic, and other special characteristics of large cities may have affected the rates. To improve treatment of cardiac arrest in large cities and maximize the use of community resources, we recommend further study of comparable metropolitan areas using standardized terms and methodology. Detailed analysis of each component of the emergency medical services systems will aid in making improvements to maximize survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."

In a test comprising 647 persons we studied to what extent it is possible to impact first aid know-how to bystanders. 60% were in the position to recognise the presence of distinct signs of respiratory failure and to assess the situation correctly. Only one-third (35%) of the participants, who had taken the first-aid course more than two years before the test, were able to carry out a proper examination of the respiration. The technique of ventilation was definitely deficient. Already one year after the instruction 30% found it difficult to position the head correctly. More than two years after the instruction 39% of the tested persons were able to insufflate a sufficient tidal volume. In a second test 198 emergency medical technicians were examined who had taken part in a cardiopulmonary resuscitation course. Only 53.2% had sufficient theoretical knowledge. 40% could apply efficiently the single-person-method of basic life support and 55% the corresponding two-person-method. These results prove that a once-only instruction of bystanders does not suffice by itself to impart sufficient knowledge for handling the emergency situation. It is, therefore, proposed to introduce compulsory and continuing instruction as a progressive teaching schedule--especially to young people--in first aid and, integrated into this programme, the methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation."

Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in 7-month-old female Wistar rats. The diabetic rats received insulin, hPTH, insulin and hPTH, or hPTH vehicle for 4 weeks, starting 8 weeks after STZ injection. They were compared with baseline controls and normal controls that received STZ alone and STZ vehicle alone, respectively. The rats' proximal right tibias were processed to serve as undecalcified Villanueva-stained bone sections for histomorphometry. Changes in trabecular connectivity were determined through node-strut analysis. The decreased cancellous bone volume (BV/TV) and bone formation in diabetic rats improved in all the drug-treated groups compared with baseline controls. Furthermore, recovery of BV/TV was greater in rats that received the combination of insulin and hPTH than in those that received insulin or hPTH alone. In node-strut analysis, the node-related parameter (N.Nd/TV) significantly increased in rats that received the combination of insulin and hPTH, but did not increase in those that received insulin or hPTH alone. In addition to these results, the combination treatment significantly increased bone mineral density of the femur and bone strength in the femoral metaphysis compared with treatment with insulin or hPTH alone. These results indicate that the doses of insulin and hPTH employed in the combination treatment were more effective in improving not only bone mass but also trabecular connectivity and bone strength than treatment with insulin or hPTH alone in insulin-dependent diabetic rats."

In non-traumatic cardiac arrest, it is unlikely that intubation carries the same life saving benefit as early defibrillation and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In trauma and paediatric patients, the current evidence base provides no imperative to extend the practice of prehospital intubation in urban systems. It would be ethical and pertinent to initiate a large, high quality randomised trial comparing the efficacy of competently practised emergency intubation with basic bag-valve-mask manoeuvres (BVM) in urban adult out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest."

C-fiber activation also induces these effects. Although the mechanism by which chronic TS exposure induces airway dysfunction is not well understood, TS exposure may enhance C-fiber responsiveness. To investigate the effect of chronic TS exposure on C-fiber responsiveness to capsaicin and bradykinin, especially in atopic individuals, we exposed ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized guinea pigs to TS (5 mg/l air, 30 min/day for 7 days/wk) or to compressed air. Nonsensitized guinea pigs were also exposed to either compressed air or TS. Beginning after 120 days of exposure, C fibers and rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) were challenged with capsaicin and bradykinin. TS exposure enhanced sensory receptor and airway responsiveness to both intravenous capsaicin and bradykinin challenge. C-fiber, RAR, and airway responsiveness to capsaicin challenge was greatest in OA-sensitized guinea pigs exposed to TS. OA alone induced capsaicin hyperresponsiveness at 5 microg. Airway responsiveness to bradykinin was also greatest in OA-sensitized guinea pigs exposed to TS. OA alone enhanced C-fiber responsiveness to bradykinin at 5 and 10 microg. C-fiber activation by either agonist appeared direct, whereas RAR activation appeared indirect. Therefore, a mechanism of airway hyperirritability induced by the combination of OA sensitization and chronic TS exposure may include hyperirritability of lung C fibers."

            "abstract": "Ventilation is essential for oxygenation of the alveoli and arterial blood. Comatose humans have upper airway soft tissue obstruction unless the head is tilted backwards and sometimes, in addition, the jaw thrust forward. In 1960, measurements on comatose humans with or without cardiac arrest, with or without a tracheal tube, showed essentially no ventilation by sternal compressions alone. This led to combining step A (airway control), step B (mouth-to-mouth ventilation), and step C (sternal (cardiac) compressions) into basic life support. In animal models, sternal compressions alone can produce some ventilation with or without a tracheal tube, because the straight upper airways of animals do not obstruct in coma. In witnessed sudden cardiac death, the C-A-B sequence makes physiological sense, but other causes of sudden coma need the A-B-C sequence. Lay persons should continue to be taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation steps A-B-C."

            "abstract": "Background context:\n        \n      \n      In the quest for clinically functional artificial intervertebral discs (AIDs), multidisciplinary technologies have been employed. Existing solid mobile AIDs essentially consist of the superposition of solid plates and core materials; however, it is thought that an ideal surgical AID technology has not yet been developed. To overcome the limitation of these existing AIDs, we developed a unique flexible AID disc system on the basis of our original biomimetic concept. The AID is composed of a cubic three-dimensional fabric (3DF) with a triaxial fiber alignment, which offers biomimetic long-term dynamic mechanical behavior along with durability.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      This article substantiates the potential clinical use of the 3DF disc system that quite differs from existing ones.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      We designed the lumbar and cervical 3DF discs that improved the structural weaknesses caused by the collagenous fiber alignment of biological intervertebral disc. Bioresorbable hydroxyapatite particles were deposited on the surface layer of the 3DF disc to promote new bony ingrowth and to ensure secure binding at the interface of the contacting vertebral bodies. A stand-alone system was devised for surgical reliability in terms of both positioning and fixation, allowing tight press fitting with the vertebral bodies. Bioactive and bioresorbable pins were penetrated through the 3DF disc body and projected from the surface to allow ideal insertion and fixation to the disc space, preserving the precise position during dynamical movement. In vitro endurance of the 3DF disc was examined under long-term alternating stresses, and the in vivo animal tests were conducted in the intervertebral lumbar discs at L5-L6 excised from baboons and replaced with the lumbar 3DF disc.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The static mechanical endurance was assessed through a creep test. In vitro endurance of the 3DF disc under repetitive stresses including axial compressing, flexion-extension, torsional twisting, and lateral bending were applied to the 3DF disc for a long-term for up to 105 million stresses, which is roughly equivalent to exposure of natural biological movement for more than 50 years. In the animal test, eight baboons were euthanized 6 months postoperatively. To their extracted spines, six pure moments (flexion and extension, left and right lateral bending, and left and right torsion) were applied vertically to the superior end of the specimen and then values of range of motions (ROMs) were calculated. Histological analyses were conducted on 12 reticuloendothelial and systemic tissues.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 3DF disc retained its biomimetic \"J-shaped\" stress-strain behavior without generating wear debris for up to 105 million stresses. A 130-N loading for the creep test decreased the height of 0.3mm during 80 to 1,000 hours. In the biomechanical test, ROM values of axial rotation and flexion-extension showed no significant difference from the intact excluding that of lateral bending because the location of each pin to stand alone certainly controlled the bending behavior only. The histological analysis indicated no significant pathologic changes induced by the 3DF disc.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The 3DF disc system is clinically suitable for human disc replacement arthroplasty based on the findings of long-term durability with dynamic motion in vitro and effective animal tests in vivo. This system surely overcomes the limitations of existing solid AIDs, and the clinical potential of the biomimetic 3DF discs has been verified. This new biomaterial technology delivers most of the functions and characteristics required by a clinically available AID if applied correctly by surgeons."

A total of 1383 (83%) of all patients were declared dead on arrival at hospital or in the emergency department, 119 (7%) died in hospital and 174 (10%) were discharged alive. Of the 174 survivors, 87% were conscious and normal at discharge, 9% had moderate residual disability and 2% severe disability. Survival of patients discharged alive from hospital was 85% at 1 year. Defibrillation was undertaken in 71% of the reported cardiac arrests. Survival of bystander witnessed arrests was increased from 7 to 15% with bystander CPR (P < 0.005). If the cardiac arrest was witnessed by the ambulance crew and required defibrillation, survival to discharge was 39%. Of bystander witnessed arrests reached while still in VF (n = 643), 11% were discharged alive. Patients who were defibrillated within 4 min of arrest had a 43% survival rate to hospital discharge."

            "abstract": "The effect of excipient, drug, and osmotic agent loaded in the inner core tablet on the time-controlled disintegration of compression-coated tablet prepared by direct compression with micronized ethylcellulose was investigated. The excipients [spray-dried lactose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, different drugs (sodium diclofenac: model drug, salbutamol sulfate, and theophylline anhydrate) and osmotic agent (sodium chloride)] were used to formulate the composition of the inner core tablet. The result indicates that drug release from all the compression-coated tablets was characterized by a distinctive lag of time followed by a faster drug release, dependent on the types of excipient and drug, and osmotic agent used in the inner core tablet. Respectively, the lag of time was 8.5, 12.4, 14.6, or 15.8 h for spray-dried lactose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, or microcrystalline cellulose-loaded inner core tablet, as compared with 16.4 h for an inner core made of sodium diclofenac alone. The direct-compressible excipients such as spray-dried lactose, sodium starch glycolate, and microcrystalline cellulose seemed not to illustrate a marked disintegration function to rapidly rapture the outer coating layer. The lag of time was only slightly shortened from 16.4 to 14.6 h, >24 to 17.8 h, or >24 to 21.3 h for sodium diclofenac, theophylline anhydrate, or salbutamol sulfate incorporated with sodium starch glycolate into the inner core tablet, respectively, suggesting that sodium starch glycolate did not perform its superdisintegration. Once an osmotic agent of sodium chloride was incorporated into the inner core tablet, the lag of time for the compression-coated tablet was markedly shortened to <1 h, as compared with 16.4 h for drug alone. The more the amount of sodium chloride added, the less the time of lag obtained. Osmotic pressure did have a key role in controlling the drug dissolution. The present result implies that osmotic function is more suitable than superdisintegration function in designing a compression-coated tablet with time-controlled disintegration."

The objective of this study was to identify out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors resuscitated without defibrillation or advanced cardiac life support.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This observational cohort included all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause from phases I and II of the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Study. During the study period, the system provided a basic life support/defibrillation level of care but no advanced life support. CPR-only patients were patients determined to be without vital signs by EMS personnel who regained a palpable pulse in the field with precordial thump or CPR only and then were admitted alive to the hospital. Six members of a 7-member expert review panel had to rate the patient as either probably or definitely having an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and a rhythm strip consistent with a cardiac arrest rhythm had to be present to be considered a patient. Criteria considered were witness status, citizen or first responder CPR, CPR duration, arrest rhythm and rate, and performance of precordial thump.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From January 1, 1991, to June 30, 1997, 9,667 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated. The overall survival rate to hospital discharge was 4.6%. There were 97 apparent CPR-only patients admitted to the hospital. Application of the inclusion criteria yielded 24 CPR-only patients who had true out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 73 patients judged not to have cardiac arrest. Of the 24 true CPR-only patients admitted to the hospital, 15 patients were discharged alive, 10 patients were witnessed by bystanders, and 7 patients were witnessed by EMS personnel. The initial arrest rhythm was pulseless electrical activity in 9 patients, asystole in 12 patients, and ventricular tachycardia in 3 patients. One patient with ventricular tachycardia converted to sinus tachycardia with a single precordial thump.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      CPR-only survivors of true out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do exist; some victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of primary cardiac cause can survive after provision of out-of-hospital basic life support care only. However, many patients found to be pulseless by means of out-of-hospital evaluation likely did not have a true cardiac arrest. This has implications for the survival rates of most, if not all, previous cardiac arrest reports. Survival rates from cardiac arrest may actually be lower if one excludes survivors who never had a true arrest. The absence of vital signs by out-of-hospital assessment alone is not adequate to include patients in research reports or quality evaluations for cardiac arrest."

Additionally, the members of the family are united on the basis of stelar anatomy and the presence of sporangia. Neither of the latter characteristics, which are essential to the unequivocal assignment to the family, are preserved in Cervicornus.

In systems made of polymers in water, variations in hydration shell of polymeric chains determine changes of dispersions compressibility, and this phenomenon can be monitored by sound speed measurements. Four different polymers have been selected, namely PEG 6000, Carbopol 974, HPMC K4M, and Pectin 200/USP, all characterised by very different mucoadhesive properties. Samples made of each polymer alone (0.3-1.0% w/w) or in mixture with mucin (mucin fixed at 1.0% w/w) in water were investigated while using high-resolution ultrasonic spectrometer at two different frequencies (5.2 and 8.2 MHz). Polymer-mucin interaction was evaluated comparing experimental sound speed values of polymer-mucin samples with their theoretical values derived from the addition of sound speeds obtained while analysing each component alone. Results demonstrated the ability of the acoustic method to discriminate between mucoadhesive and no mucoadhesive polymer-mucin dispersions and allowed also the comparison between their mucoadhesive strengths. The study has therefore demonstrated the potential of using high-resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy to evaluate the polymers' mucoadhesiveness, with the great advantage of testing small amount of samples even if opaque."

Experimental adiabatic and isothermal compressibilities of FGF-10 alone and in the presence of polyanions are compared. Furthermore, the effect of polyanions on the coefficient of thermal expansion is compared. Measurements of density, heat capacity, compressibility, and expansibility were combined to calculate experimentally determined volume and enthalpy fluctuations. Global effects of polyanions on FGF-10 flexibility, thermodynamic fluctuations, and hydration vary depending on the size and charge density of the polyanion. Local effects of polyanions were investigated utilizing time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and red edge excitation spectroscopy (REES). Increased rigidity of the protein matrix or an increased solvent response surrounding the Trp residues is observed in the presence of polyanions. Similarly, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals increased ground state heterogeneity and increased dipole relaxation on the time scale of fluorescence for FGF-10 in the presence of polyanions. These polyanions increase heterogeneity, global flexibility, and fluctuations while increasing the melting temperature (Tm) of FGF-10."

The unit is staffed by an anesthesiologist as the emergency-care physician and specially trained health-care personnel. The success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was classified into three stages: (1) CPR with temporary cardiac output; (2) CPR primarily successful with spontaneous rhythm and a palpable pulse; (3) CPR, definitely successful resulting in the patient's discharge from the hospital without important neurological sequelae. All patients are grouped according to the disease underlying the CA. The performance of bystander CPR was recorded. The influence the factors sex, age, response time, cardiac rhythm, location of the collapse and period of investigation (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year) had on the outcome was analyzed. RESULTS. Eighty-nine patients (32.96%) had a temporary cardiac output; 56 patients (20.74%) were primarily successfully resuscitated; and 12 patients (4.44%) survived without important neurological sequelae. Most of the diseases underlying the CA were in the internal disease group. Only 16 cases of bystander CPR performance were recorded. In the group with primarily successful CPR, significantly important factors arose with the increasing CPR success rate due to the period of investigation (1st year: 10.00%, 2nd year: 19.61%, 3rd year: 30.77%) and due to cardiac rhythm \"ventricular fibrillation\" (34.62%) and \"asystole\" (11.88%). Furthermore, significantly important factors were found for definite CPR success when comparing males (1.72%) and females (10.64%) and comparing the location of the collapse \"in public places\" (9.80%) and \"at home\" (2.00%). CONCLUSION. Our study shows that in spite of installing a MICU, the outcome of CPR is poor without supplementary measures.

The public at large, including family members and bystander witnesses of cardiac arrest, must be expected to participate in this optimal response capability. The American Heart Association Chain of Survival defines the elements of a system capable of saving lives of victims of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Widespread dissemination of only the essential elements of life-saving steps, probably through media not yet used for this function, will be needed to reach the largest number of people possible. Emergency medical services systems need to devise innovative approaches to rapid provision of automated external defibrillation, in many cases no doubt outside the boundaries of traditional means of delivery of this intervention. Finally, it is likely that targeted responders among the public will be participants in a public access defibrillation approach to dealing with sudden cardiac death."

The accuracy of such methods determines how useful it is clinically and for retrospective analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      We wanted to identify if there is a potential of improving prediction accuracy by adding peri-arrest factors to an ECG-based prediction system, or constructing a prediction system that adapts to each patient. Therefore, we analysed shock outcome prediction data with a mixed effects logistic regression model to identify if there are random effects (unexplained variation between patients) influencing the prediction accuracy. We also added information about the patients' age, sex and presenting rhythm, ambulance response time and presence of bystander CPR to the model to try to improve it by reducing the random effects. For all the six predictive features analysed random effects where present, with p-values below 10(-3). The random effect size was 73-189% of the feature effect size. Adding the peri-arrest factors to the best ECG-based model gave no significant improvement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The presence of random effects shows that the shock outcome prediction accuracy can be improved by explaining more of the variation between patients, for example using the approaches outlined above, and that there is within-patient correlation between samples that should be accounted for when evaluating prediction accuracy. The specific peri-arrest factors tested here did not significantly improve prediction accuracy, but other factors should be explored."

            "abstract": "Osteoporosis is currently defined in terms of low bone mass. However, the source of fragility leading to fracture has not been adequately described. In particular, the contributions of bone tissue properties and architecture to the risk or incidence of fracture are poorly understood. In an earlier experimental study, it was found that the architectural anisotropy of cancellous bone from the femoral heads of fracture patients was significantly increased compared with age- and density-matched control material (Ciarelli et al., J Bone Miner Res 15:32-40; 2000). Using a combination of compression testing and micro-finite element analysis on a subset of cancellous bone specimens from that study, we calculated the hard tissue mechanical properties and the apparent (macroscopic) mechanical properties. The tissue modulus was 10.0 GPa (SD 2.2) for the control group and 10.8 GPa (SD 3.3) for the fracture group (not significant). There were no differences in either the apparent yield strains, percentages of highly strained tissue, or the relationship between apparent yield stress and apparent elastic modulus. Hence, a difference in the tissue yield properties is unlikely. At the apparent level, the fracture group had a significantly decreased transverse stiffness, resulting in increased mechanical anisotropy. These changes suggest that bone in the fracture group was \"overadapted\" to the primary load axis, at the cost of fragility in the transverse direction. We conclude that individuals with a history of osteoporotic fractures do not have weaker bone tissue. Architectural and mechanical anisotropy alone renders their bone weaker in the nonprimary loading direction."

            "abstract": "Since the introduction around 1960 of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) basic life support (BLS) without equipment, i.e. steps A (airway control)-B (mouth-to-mouth breathing)-C (chest (cardiac) compressions), training courses by instructors have been provided, first to medical personnel and later to some but not all lay persons. At present, fewer than 30% of out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts are initiated by lay bystanders. The numbers of lives saved have remained suboptimal, in part because of a weak or absent first link in the life support chain. This review concerns education research aimed at helping more lay persons to acquire high life supporting first aid (LSFA) skill levels and to use these skills. In the 1960s, Safar and Laerdal studied and promoted self-training in LSFA, which includes: call for the ambulance (without abandoning the patient) (now also call for an automatic external defibrillator); CPR-BLS steps A-B-C; external hemorrhage control; and positioning for shock and unconsciousness (coma). LSFA steps are psychomotor skills. Organizations like the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association have produced instructor-courses of many more first aid skills, or for cardiac arrest only-not of LSFA skills needed by all suddenly comatose victims. Self-training methods might help all people acquire LSFA skills. Implementation is still lacking. Variable proportions of lay trainees evaluated, ranging from school children to elderly persons, were found capable of performing LSFA skills on manikins. Audio-tape or video-tape coached self-practice on manikins was more effective than instructor-courses. Mere viewing of demonstrations (e.g. televised films) without practice has enabled more persons to perform some skills effectively compared to untrained control groups. The quality of LSFA performance in the field and its impact on outcome of patients remain to be evaluated. Psychological factors have been associated with skill acquisition and retention, and motivational factors with application. Manikin practice proved necessary for best skill acquisition of steps B and C. Simplicity and repetition proved important. Repetitive television spots and brief internet movies for motivating and demonstrating would reach all people. LSFA should be part of basic health education. LSFA self-learning laboratories should be set up and maintained in schools and drivers' license stations. The trauma-focused steps of LSFA are important for 'buddy help' in military combat casualty care, and natural mass disasters."

            "abstract": "Intravascular elastography is a new technique to obtain mechanical properties of the vessel wall and plaque. Mechanical information of vascular tissue is important for characterisation of different plaque components, detection of plaque vulnerability and thus choosing the proper interventional technique. The feasibility of the technique is investigated using phantoms and diseased human arteries. These studies demonstrated that elastography reveals information that is unavailable or inconclusive from the echogram alone. The technique is based on the principle that tissue strain is directly related to its mechanical properties. In intravascular elastography, the tissue is compressed using different intravascular pressures. The strain is determined using cross-correlation techniques of the radio frequency (r.f.) signals. Reliable strain estimates are only obtained when signals of corresponding tissue are correlated. Owing to catheter motion, off-centre position and non-uniform rotation of the intravascular transducer, the r.f. traces at low and at high pressure may be misaligned. Four algorithms are tested to track the corresponding ultrasound signals. Three methods (l1norm, l2norm and cross-correlation) are applied on the r.f. signal and one (l1norm) on the envelope (speckle tracking). Simulations are performed to obtain a data set with a priori knowledge of the scattering particles positions in the tissue at high and low pressure. Different positions of the catheter in the lumen, compression levels of the material and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are investigated. Finally, these findings are corroborated with a phantom experiment in a water tank. From the simulations, it can be concluded that the speckle tracking algorithm has the best performance, under all circumstances. The performance decreases with larger eccentricity of the catheter and larger compression of the material. The SNR is only of minor influence. The speckle tracking algorithm has also the best performance in the phantom experiment. The performance of the speckle tracking algorithm is better than the three r.f.-based algorithms. For intravascular elastography, implementation of this method may improve the quality of the elastogram."

However, the effect that the in vivo compressive preload generated during activities of daily living has on the construct is not fully understood.

The external compressive preload significantly affected the stabilization provided by the cages. The cages provided substantially more stabilization, both in flexion and in extension, at larger preloads than at smaller preloads.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      The study suggests that the segment treated with an anterior lumbar interbody fusion cage is relatively less stable under conditions of low external compressive preload. The magnitude of preload required to achieve stabilization with stand-alone cages may be only partially achieved by anular pretensioning. Since the magnitude of the preload across the disc space due to muscle activity can vary with activities of daily living, supplemental stabilization of the cage construct may provide a more predictably stable environment for lumbar spine fusion."

We tested the efficacy of a previously developed CPR message using a recording mannikin in a high stress, simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Community volunteers were unaware they would perform CPR until immediately before each trial. Performance of volunteers without prior CPR training (group A, n = 65) who received telephone instruction was compared with that of previously trained volunteers (group B, n = 43) who received the same message. Performances of both groups were also compared with a third group (group C, n = 43) composed of previously trained volunteers who did not receive the message. Quality of CPR was graded by three CPR instructors using explicit criteria. Printout strips from the recording mannikins were also analyzed. Evaluators were unaware of the training status of volunteers. The three groups were of comparable sex, race, and educational level, but group C was significantly younger than groups A and B (31.7 vs. 37.7 years, p less than 0.001). Because of the time required for telephone instruction, groups A and B started chest compressions a mean of 4.0 minutes after collapse compared with 1.2 minutes for group C (p less than 0.0001). We found that the previously untrained volunteers of group A performed CPR of an overall quality comparable to that performed by previously trained members of group C. Group A performed chest compressions significantly better than group C (p less than 0.02) but had greater problems performing effective ventilations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing may not be necessary during brief periods of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for ventricular fibrillation. In contrast to ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrests, it has been assumed that rescue breathing is essential for treatment of asphyxial cardiac arrests because the cardiac arrests result from inadequate ventilation. This review explores the role of mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing during bystander CPR for asphyxial cardiac arrests. Clinical data suggest that survival from apparent asphyxial cardiac arrest can occur after CPR consisting of chest compressions alone, without rescue breathing. Two randomized, controlled swine investigations using models of bystander CPR for asphyxial cardiac arrest establish the following: a) that prompt initiation of bystander CPR is a crucially important intervention; and b) that chest compressions plus mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing is markedly superior to either technique alone. One of these studies further demonstrates that early in the asphyxial pulseless arrest process doing something (mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing or chest compressions) is better than doing nothing."

            "abstract": "After failure of external defibrillation, return of cardiac activity with spontaneous circulation is contingent on rapid and effective reversal of myocardial ischemia. Closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) evolved about 30 years ago and was almost universally implemented by both professional providers and lay bystanders because of its technical simplicity and noninvasiveness. However, there is growing concern since the limited hemodynamic efficacy of precordial compression accounts for a disappointingly low success rate; especially so if there is a delay of more than 3 minutes before resuscitation is started. There is also increasing concern with the lack of objective hemodynamic measurements currently available for the assessment and quantitation of the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts. Accordingly, the resuscitation procedure proceeds without confirmation that it increases systemic and myocardial blood flows to levels that would be likely to restore spontaneous circulation. Continuous monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) now appears to be a practical measurement which provides a noninvasive quantitative indication of both systemic blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure. Consequently, PETCO2 predicts the likelihood of successful resuscitation and guides the operator who may modify the technique of precordial compression to improve systemic and myocardial perfusion. Among the large polypharmacy for cardiac resuscitation, only alpha-adrenergic agents (which increase coronary perfusion pressure) and especially epinephrine are of proven benefit. Neither buffer agents nor calcium salts appear to improve outcome except under unique conditions. To the contrary, there is increasing awareness of adverse effects of pharmacologic interventions such that they may hinder the return of viable myocardial and cerebral function. This has constrained the routine use of all drugs except for the use of alpha-adrenergic agonists. More invasive interventions by which blood flow is restored such as open-chest cardiac massage or extra-corporeal pump oxygenation (ECPO) are consistently more effective than conventional CPR. Experimentally, both methods promptly restore systemic and myocardial perfusion to viable levels and thereby increase the likelihood that spontaneous circulation is restored even after prolonged cardiac arrest or failure of conventional CPR."

            "abstract": "Axial compression on the spine could reach large values especially in lifting tasks which also involve large rotations. Experimental and numerical investigations on the spinal multi motion segments in presence of physiological compression loads cannot adequately be carried out due to the structural instability and artefact loads. To circumvent these problems, a novel wrapping cable element is used in a nonlinear finite element model of the lumbosacral spine (L1-S1) to investigate the role of moderate to large compression loads on the lumbar stiffness in flexion and axial moments/rotations. The compression loads up to 2,700 N was applied with no instability or artefact loads. The lumbar stiffness substantially increased under compression force, flexion moment, and axial torque when applied alone. The presence of compression preloads significantly stiffened the load-displacement response under flexion and axial moments/rotations. This stiffening effect was much more pronounced under larger preloads and smaller moments/rotations. Compression preloads also increased intradiscal pressure, facet contact forces, and maximum disc fibre strain at different levels. Forces in posterior ligaments were, however, diminished with compression preload. The significant increase in spinal stiffness, hence, should be considered in biomechanical studies for accurate investigation of the load partitioning, system stability, and fixation systems/disc prostheses."

At 4 minutes of chest compression alone, the corresponding values were 7.39 +/- 0.03, 24.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, and 93.9 +/- 3.0%, with an arterial pressure of 48.1 +/- 7.7/22.6 +/- 3.9 mm Hg. Mean minute ventilation during the fourth minute of CPR, measured with a face mask-pneumotachometer, was 5.2 +/- 1.1 L/min.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These data suggest that in the dog model of witnessed arrest, chest compression alone during CPR can maintain adequate gas exchange to sustain O2 saturation > 90% for > 4 minutes. The need for immediate ventilation during witnessed arrest should be reexamined."

            "abstract": "During the 2005 International Consensus Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science, a rigorous evidence-based evaluation process was conducted. The consensus reached during that Conference constituted the basis of the current CPR guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), published in December 2005. Those guidelines included many important changes, made on the basis of emerging evidence. For example, the compression-ventilation ratio for CPR in non-intubated patients was increased from 15:2 to 30:2 and a strong recommendation to minimize interruptions in chest compression was issued in order to maximise organ perfusion. Energy levels for monophasic defibrillation were increased and specific energy levels for biphasic defibrillation have been recommended, in order to maximise the efficacy of the first shock. New timing of defibrillation shocks is now advised: the three-stacked shock sequence has been replaced by high-energy single shocks followed by two-minute cycles of CPR, in order to reduce CPR interruptions. Timing for administration of drugs has been adapted to the new shock sequence and the advanced life support (ALS) universal algorithm has been modified. Some controversial topics are still a matter of investigation and debate, including the use of therapeutic hypothermia in non-shockable cardiac arrests, the efficacy of a period of CPR before defibrillation in long-lasting cardiac arrests, and the chest-compression-only CPR for first responders of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests."

            "abstract": "This discussion about advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) reflects disappointment with the over 50% of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts that fail to achieve restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hospital discharge rates are equally poor for in-hospital CPR attempts outside special care units. Early bystander CPR and early defibrillation (manual, semi-automatic or automatic) are the most effective methods for achieving ROSC from ventricular fibrillation (VF). Automated external defibrillation (AED), which is effective in the hands of first responders in the out-of-hospital setting, should also be used and evaluated in hospitals, inside and outside of special care units. The first countershock is most important. Biphasic waveforms seem to have advantages over monophasic ones. Tracheal intubation has obvious efficacy when the airway is threatened. Scientific documentation of specific types, doses, and timing of drug treatments (epinephrine, bicarbonate, lidocaine, bretylium) are weak. Clinical trials have failed so far to document anything statistically but a breakthrough effect. Interactions between catecholamines and buffers need further exploration. A major cause of unsuccessful attempts at ROSC is the underlying disease, which present ACLS guidelines do not consider adequately. Early thrombolysis and early coronary revascularization procedures should also be considered for selected victims of sudden cardiac death. Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) could be a breakthrough measure, but cannot be initiated rapidly enough in the field due to technical limitations. Open-chest CPR by ambulance physicians deserves further trials. In searches for causes of VF, neurocardiology gives clues for new directions. Fibrillation and defibrillation thresholds are influenced by the peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and impulses from the frontal cerebral cortex. CPR for cardiac arrest of the mother in advanced pregnancy requires modifications and outcome data. Until more recognizable critical factors for ROSC are identified, titrated sequencing of ACLS measures, based on physiologic rationale and sound judgement, rather than rigid standards, gives the best chance for achieving survival with good cerebral function."

Once the rigid protective covering of the skull is removed, the cerebral component of the cranial contents is vulnerable to rising extrinsic pressure. Intracranial pressure falls, brain compliance rises, and contralateral cerebral shift may occur by virtue of the craniectomy alone. However, if flaps filling the defect should compress by weight or swelling, even greater midline or craniocaudal shift of the brain may occur. We present three cases in which midline cerebral shift was documented by CT scan after flap reconstruction of lateral craniofacial/craniotemporal resection. Three other patients undergoing anterior craniofacial resection during the same time period for skin cancer (one patient) and esthesioneuroblastoma (two patients) had no shift in intracerebral contents. Symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial shift may occur soon after substantial craniectomy and soft-tissue flap reconstruction. Midline shift from lateral resection and reconstruction is more likely than anteroposterior shift from anterior craniofacial resection.

Three of these factors were here tested under conditions of compressive loading: (1) species differences in enamel structure, (2) abrasive particle size and (3) magnitude of force. Teeth of four species (Homo sapiens, Lemur fulvus, Ovis aries and Crocodylus rhombifer) were abraded in vitro using three sizes of abrasive silicon-carbide grit (average diameters 73, 23 and 14 microns), at two loads (50 and 100 kg). Microwear features were assessed by scanning electron microscopy of lightly etched enamel surfaces and epoxy replicas. Microwear pits (length:width < 4:1) were the predominant feature type. Factorial analysis of variance of rank-transformed, feature-area measurements demonstrated that, under conditions of compressive loading, the size of abrasive particles was the primary determinant of microwear size. These results contrast with previous experimental tests of abrasion by predominantly shearing loads, where feature size was influenced by interaction among experimental factors, including the microscopic orientation of enamel crystallites. Although magnitude of compressive force was not a factor in microwear size variation, it may be a critical factor in explaining the presence or absence of microwear on tooth surfaces. The relatively small compressive bite force generated during typical chewing may not consistently produce abrasive pitting. These experiments demonstrate that, as the same abrasive regime can produce both large and small pits, the mechanism by which wear features are formed (i.e. compression or adhesion) cannot be determined from the size of features alone. Nevertheless, the dependence of pit size on abrasive particle size demonstrates that metrical variation in wear features can elucidate important attributes of an animal's diet."

            "abstract": "Arthrodesis is a well-established procedure for the management of wrist deformity, instability, and arthritis resulting from various causes. Several techniques, with or without internal fixation or heterotopic bone grafting, have been described, but no single procedure has gained general acceptance. We present our results using a simple and reliable technique that employs a local bone graft and light internal fixation. From 1987 to 1996, eight consecutive patients with wrist lesions were treated using a modified Gill procedure for arthrodesis. The average age of patients was 62 years and the mean follow-up period was 4 years. A slab corticocancellous bone graft harvested from the dorsal aspect of the distal radius was turned about to cover the fusion mass from the distal radius to the third metacarpal bone. Kirschner wires and tension band wires were used to fix the wrist and compress the bone graft. A long arm cast was applied for 6 weeks, followed by a short arm cast until arthrodesis was achieved. The wrist position was well maintained by the tension band wire alone thereafter. Pain relief, grip strength, and assessment of daily activities were documented. Solid fusion was achieved smoothly in all cases and all patients were satisfied with the results. We recommend this simple and reliable technique for wrist arthrodesis."

There may be, however, an identifiable subgroup in which resuscitation efforts are futile. This study identified potential field criteria for predicting 100% nonsurvival when the presenting rhythm is asystole in a Basic Life Support-Defibrillation (BLS-D) system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This prospective cohort study, a component of Phases I and II of the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) Study, was conducted in 21 Ontario communities with BLS-D level of care, and included all adult arrests of presumed cardiac etiology according to the Utstein Style Guidelines.

Of 9529 cases with available rhythm strip recordings, initial arrest rhythms were asystole in 40.8%, pulseless electrical activity in 21.2% and ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in 38%. Of 3888 asystolic patients, 9 (0.2%) survived to discharge; 3 of these cases were unwitnessed arrests with no bystander CPR. There were no survivors if the CRI exceeded 8 minutes. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of survival to admission were \"CRI in minutes\" (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.98) and \"bystander-witnessed\" (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.4).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In a BLS-D system, there is a very low but measurable survival rate for prehospital asystolic cardiac arrest.

            "abstract": "Two-rescuer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is considered the best method for professional basic life support (BLS). However, in many prehospital cardiac arrest situations, one rescuer has to begin CPR alone while the other performs additional tasks. In theory, over-the-head CPR is a suitable alternative in this situation, with the added benefit of allowing the single rescuer to use a self-inflating bag for ventilation. In this trial, we compared standard single-rescuer CPR with over-the-head CPR in manikins. We planned this study using a crossover study design where each participant administered both CPR techniques in a randomized order. Ventilation and chest compression data were collected with analysis software during a 2-min CPR test for each technique. Sixty-seven emergency medical technician students participated in this trial. Over-the-head CPR allowed for superior ventilation compared to standard CPR (number of correct ventilations: 330 of 760 versus 279 of 779; P = 0.002). The quality of delivered chest compressions did not differ between the two groups (correct chest compressions: 4293 of 6304 versus 4313 of 6395; P = 0.44). In conclusion, our study has shown that over-the-head CPR may be an effective alternative BLS technique when a single professional rescuer has to perform CPR, likely offering superior ventilation and comparable chest compression quality compared with standard BLS."

            "abstract": "Hospitals and medical centers produce an enormous amount of digital medical images every day, especially in the form of image sequences, which requires considerable storage space. One solution could be the application of lossless compression. Among available methods, JPEG-LS has excellent coding performance. However, it only compresses a single picture with intracoding and does not utilize the interframe correlation among pictures. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that combines the JPEG-LS and an interframe coding with motion vectors to enhance the compression performance of using JPEG-LS alone. Since the interframe correlation between two adjacent images in a medical image sequence is usually not as high as that in a general video image sequence, the interframe coding is activated only when the interframe correlation is high enough. With six capsule endoscope image sequences under test, the proposed method achieves average compression gains of 13.3% and 26.3% over the methods of using JPEG-LS and JPEG2000 alone, respectively. Similarly, for an MRI image sequence, coding gains of 77.5% and 86.5% are correspondingly obtained."

Performance was evaluated during standardised 10 min cardiac arrest simulations using a video recording and data from a laptop computer connected to the training manikin. A number of subjects in both groups did not open the airway. More than 75% in the Standard tel. group failed to deliver two effective initial rescue breaths, and only 17% provided an adequate inflation volume for subsequent breaths, delivering a median of only five inflations during the entire scenario. Most subjects in both groups gave chest compressions that were too shallow and at an inappropriately rapid rate. Hand position was also poor, but was worse in the group given simplified instructions. There was a significant delay to first compression in both groups, although this interval was shortened by over a minute when ventilations were eliminated from the telephone instruction algorithm (245 vs. 184 s, P<0.001). Over two-and-a-half times as many chest compressions were delivered during an average ambulance response time with compression-only telephone directions compared with standard CPR (461 vs. 186, P<0.001). These variables may be critical in predicting survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further research is necessary to establish if modifications to scripted telephone instructions can remedy the identified performance deficiencies. Eliminating instructions for rescue breaths from scripted telephone directions will have little impact on the ventilation of most patients. Research is required to determine if the consequent reduction in the delay to starting chest compressions and the significant increase in the number of compressions delivered can increase survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."

Factors that potentially contributed to the improved survival rate were an increase in emergency medical crew-witnessed cases from 9% in 1992 to 15% in 2005 (P for trend <0.0001) and, to a lesser degree, an increase in bystander CPR from 31% in 1992 to 50% in 2005 (P for trend <0.0001). After adjustment for potential risk factors, the increase in survival remained significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found a significant increase in survival after OHCA in Sweden over the last 14 years. The increase was particularly marked among patients found with a shockable rhythm and was associated with an increase in the proportion of crew-witnessed cases and, to a lesser degree, an increase in the performance of bystander CPR."

The prediction error was encoded with a classified vector quantizer (CVQ) based on human visual perception characteristics. Interframe redundancy is exploited by a displacement estimated interslice (DEI) algorithm that encodes the differences between reference subimages from adjacent slices. This combined DEI/CVQ method was subjectively evaluated by 13 radiologists under a blinded protocol, and was compared to the CVQ method alone, the DEI method alone, the original images, and to a standard intraframe discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Only the combined DEI/CVQ method at 10:1 compression was not scored significantly different from the original images.

            "abstract": "Increased fracture risk has been reported for the adjacent vertebral bodies after vertebroplasty. This increase has been partly attributed to the high Young's modulus of commonly used polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Therefore, a compliant bone cement of PMMA with a bulk modulus closer to the apparent modulus of cancellous bone has been produced. This compliant bone cement was achieved by introducing pores in the cement. Due to the reduced failure strength of that porous PMMA cement, cancellous bone augmented with such cement could deteriorate under dynamic loading. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of acute failure, particle generation and mechanical properties of cancellous bone augmented with this compliant cement in comparison to regular cement. For this purpose, vertebral biopsies were augmented with porous- and regular PMMA bone cement, submitted to dynamic tests and compression to failure. Changes in Young's modulus and height due to dynamic loading were determined. Afterwards, yield strength and Young's modulus were determined by compressive tests to failure and compared to the individual composite materials. No failure occurred and no particle generation could be observed during dynamical testing for both groups. Height loss was significantly higher for the porous cement composite (0.53+/-0.21%) in comparison to the biopsies augmented with regular cement (0.16+/-0.1%). Young's modulus of biopsies augmented with porous PMMA was comparable to cancellous bone or porous cement alone (200-700 MPa). The yield strength of those biopsies (21.1+/-4.1 MPa) was around two times higher than for porous cement alone (11.6+/-3.3 MPa)."

            "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the mountains usually has to be performed under difficult and hostile circumstances and sometimes for extended periods of time. Therefore, mountain rescuers should have the ability and the appropriate equipment to perform prolonged, efficient, and safe ventilation. Members of the International Commission for Mountain Emergency Medicine (ICAR MEDCOM) discussed the results of a literature review, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of common ventilation techniques in basic life support and their training methods with specific respect to use in mountain rescue, and recommendations were proposed. Bystanders fear the potential risk of infection and lack the willingness to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, though the risk of infection is low. Mouth-to-mouth ventilation remains the standard technique for bystander ventilation and, in the absence of a barrier device, bystanders should not hesitate to ventilate a patient by this technique. For mountain rescue teams, we encourage the use of a barrier device for artificial ventilation. Mouth-to-mask ventilation devices are most likely to fulfill the requirements of being safe, simple, and efficient in the hands of a basic-trained rescuer. The use of a mouth-to-mask ventilation device is recommended for out-of-hospital ventilation in the mountains and should be part of the mountain rescuer's standard equipment. Bag-valve-mask ventilation is efficient, if performed by well-trained rescuers, but it leads to a low ventilation quality in the hands of a less experienced rescuer. It should be emphasized that regular training every 6 to 12 months is necessary to perform proper ventilation."

Various types and amounts of solvents were employed for granulation and cOAting. APAP and other excipients were mixed and were then wet-granulated in a high-speed mixer. The dried granules were then directly compressed and film-coated with low viscosity grade HPMC. As the amount of water increased, the size of granules also increased, showing more spherical and regular shape. However, manufacturing problems such as capping and lamination in tableting occurred when water was used alone as a granulating solvent. The physical properties of HPMC matrix granules were not affected by the batch size. The initial release rate as well as the amount of APAP dissolved had a tendency to decrease as the water level increased. Addition of nonaqueous solvent like ethanol to water resulted in good physical properties of granules. When compared to water/ethanol as a coating solvent, the release rate of film-coated HPMC matrix tablets was more sensitive to the conditions of coating and drying in methylene chloride/ethanol. Most of all, monolithic HPMC matrix tablet when granulated in ethanol/water showed dual release with about 50% drug release immediately within few minutes followed by extended release. It was evident that the type and amount of solvents (mainly water and ethanol) were very important for wet granulation and film-coating of monolithic HPMC matrix tablet, because the plastic deforming and fragmenting properties of material were changed by the different strengths of the different solvents."

At the cellular level, it appears that cells do not actually die during ischemia, but rather during reperfusion or resuscitation. Free radicals are implicated because antioxidants reduce cell death from ischemia/reperfusion, but typically fail to protect when only given during reperfusion. In preliminary work, two synergistic antioxidants were seen to offer significant protection even if used only during reperfusion. These findings suggest some cell death may be treatable at reperfusion and antioxidants targeted specifically at radical generation hold promise as a future therapy. On the organism level, blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be improved with a new manual device that combines the advantages of active-decompression CPR with interposed-abdominal-compression CPR; preliminary hemodynamic data in animals are encouraging. Possible worsening of injury in the postarrest period may occur from overuse of beta-agonists, excessive defibrillation energy, untreated hypotension, and lack of attention to intensive care principals. At the societal level, we have failed to provide simple treatments that are known to save lives, particularly basic CPR and early defibrillation. Bystander CPR suffers from poor quality of performance and from lack of initiation due to concern over disease transmission. The technology for rapid public defibrillation exists, yet is not commonly employed. Collectively, survival likelihood may be predicted with a multifactor equation which may be useful as we develop future therapies."

The epinephrine dosage required to achieve ROSC increased with prolongation of cardiac arrest interval (1989-1994; patients with ROSC selected, n = 263; r = 0.2276; p = 0.0002). Resuscitation success, however, decreased with increasing, dosage of epinephrine (1989-1992; n = 345; ROSC: r = -0.2643; p < 0.001; survival > 24 h: r = -0.3393; p < 0.001; discharge: r = -0.1677; p = 0.0018; survival > 1 year: r = -0.2685; p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Based on these data, we recommend an escalating epinephrine dosage concept, which facilitates titration of the drug to an effective level and meets the needs of the individual patient. This concept avoids overdosage in patients who had just collapsed shortly before initiation of CPR, attains higher levels of epinephrine in patients suffering from prolonged cardiac arrest, and takes into consideration that the effective epinephrine dose varies individually and increases with prolongation of the cardiac arrest interval."

            "abstract": "Patients with injuries severe enough to require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have a dismal prognosis. Time to surgical intervention is a major determinant of outcome in moribund trauma patients who have a potential for survival. With the exception of endotracheal intubation during evacuation to surgical intervention, no other usual prehospital procedures have been validated to affect outcome in such cases of extremis. This is a report of a case in which resuscitative surgical techniques were extended successfully to the prehospital environment. The patient was a 30-year-old man in extremis after a stab wound to the left chest. Estimating a transport time of 15 minutes, a physician riding with the emergency medical service (EMS) crews elected to perform a resuscitative thoracotomy. Following digital aortic compression, the patient regained both blood pressure and consciousness by the time of arrival at the trauma center. A left lower lobectomy was then performed in the operating room. The patient recovered fully and was discharged home in 21 days, neurologically intact. Four years later, the patient was alive, healthy, and working. This report demonstrates the feasibility of prehospital thoracotomy and raises provocative issues regarding future intense surgical involvement in prehospital care."

None of the patients received electrical defibrillation before arriving at hospital because emergency personnel were not authorized to perform advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in Southern Taiwan during the study period. Factors that predicted survival to hospital discharge included a short interval between the cardiac arrest and arrival at the ED, initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), lower atropine dose, higher level of hemoglobin, less multiple organ failure, and shorter duration of resuscitation in the ED. Nine of the 32 patients (28%) with VT/VF survived compared with 5 of 49 (10%) with pulseless electrical activity and only 12 of 231 (5%) with asystole.

After removal of the bone tamps, the specimen was compressed using bilateral loading cables until a fracture was observed with anterior vertebral body height loss of >/=25%. Fracture reduction was performed under a compressive preload of 250 N first under the application of extension moments, and then using inflatable bone tamps. The vertebral body heights, kyphotic deformity of the fractured vertebra and adjacent segments and location of compressive load (cable) path in the fractured and adjacent vertebral bodies were measured on video-fluoroscopic images.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The VCF caused anterior wall height loss of 37+/-15%, middle-height loss of 34+/-16%, segmental kyphosis increase of 14+/-7.0 degrees and vertebral kyphosis increase of 13+/-5.5 degrees (p<.05). The compressive load path shifted anteriorly by about 20% of anteroposterior end plate width in the fractured and adjacent vertebrae (p=.008). Bone tamp inflation restored the anterior wall height to 91+/-8.9%, middle-height to 91+/-14% and segmental kyphosis to within 5.6+/-5.9 degrees of prefracture values. The compressive load path returned posteriorly relative to the postfracture location in all three vertebrae (p=.004): the load path remained anterior to the prefracture location by about 9% to 11% of the anteroposterior end plate width. With application of extension moment (6.3+/-2.2 Nm) until segmental kyphosis and compressive load path were fully restored, anterior vertebral body heights were improved to 85+/-8.6% of prefracture values. However, the middle vertebral body height was not restored and vertebral kyphotic deformity remained significantly larger than the prefracture values (p<.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The anterior shift of the compressive load path in vertebral bodies adjacent to VCF can induce additional flexion moments on these vertebrae. This eccentric loading may contribute to the increased risk of new fractures in osteoporotic vertebrae adjacent to an uncorrected VCF deformity. Bone tamp inflation under a physiologic preload significantly reduced the VCF deformity (anterior and middle vertebral body heights, segmental and vertebral kyphosis) and returned the compressive load path posteriorly, approaching the prefracture alignment. Application of extension moments also was effective in restoring the prefracture geometric and loading alignment of adjacent segments, but the middle height of the fractured vertebra and vertebral kyphotic deformity were not restored with spinal extension alone."

Millions of people have learned the technique. However, the frequency of bystander initiated CPR prior to emergency medicine service (EMS) arrival is still very low.

So far, CPR training has been skills oriented and has assumed that a bystander competent in CPR will intervene when required. However, this does not seem to be the case, as there are indications in recent research, for example, that the will to help and the courage to intervene are also needed. Bystanders who intervene in a cardiac arrest event improve the victim's chance of survival.

            "title": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a promise as yet largely unfulfilled.",
            "abstract": "After failure of initial external defibrillation, restoration of spontaneous circulation is largely contingent on rapid and effective reversal of myocardial ischemia by both mechanical and pharmacologic means. Despite the introduction of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) more than 35 years ago, its universal acceptance, and its wide implementation, no improvements in outcome excepting early defibrillation have been documented over these many years. The science of CPR therefore is still in its infancy. It was incorrectly assumed that all that needs to be known is known and that the need for scientific research was therefore not apparent. Accordingly, serious resuscitation research was neither encouraged nor equitably supported. The ABCs of CPR currently provide for the establishment of a patent airway (A) and intermittent positive pressure ventilation, preferably with oxygen-enriched air (B). These are to be immediately followed with precordial compression (C). This ordering of priorities, however, is based on consensus rather than objective outcome measurements. The ABCs recently have been seriously challenged on the basis of results of both experimental and clinical studies. Conventional external precordial compression restores systemic blood flow. It may be used by both professional and nonprofessional CPR providers, especially bystanders, because of its apparent simplicity and noninvasiveness. However, manual or mechanical external precordial compression typically generates cardiac outputs that represent less than 30% of normal values. Coronary blood flow, which is critical for restoration of spontaneous circulation, is correspondingly reduced. Accordingly, several alternatives to conventional precordial compression have been proposed with the intent of increasing cardiac output and both coronary and cerebral blood flows. Among the large number of pharmaceutical agents initially recommended for cardiac resuscitation, only agents that produce peripheral vasoconstriction are of proved benefit. Epinephrine has been the preferred vasopressor agent for the management of cardiac arrest for more than 35 years because of its alpha-adrenergic effects. However, the potentially adverse effects of epinephrine are related to its beta-adrenergic inotropic actions. The beta-adrenergic actions account for disproportionate increases in myocardial oxygen consumption with increased severity of myocardial ischemic injury and provocation of ectopic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Nevertheless, epinephrine remains the drug of choice, although adrenergic drugs with selective alpha-adrenergic actions or nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs are likely to emerge as useful alternatives. Experimental and clinical observations have led to identification of continuous monitoring of both end-tidal carbon dioxide and ventricular fibrillation waveforms as practical noninvasive guides because they are highly correlated with both cardiac output and coronary blood flow. Both end-tidal carbon dioxide and ventricular fibrillation waveforms now serve as predictors of the likelihood of successful resuscitation. These two measurements may now be used to guide interventions and especially to assure optimal precordial compression. It is well established that sudden death among adults is predominantly due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation. Early defibrillation serves as an unequivocally effective immediate intervention. Minimally trained first responders and members of the general public are being enfranchised to use automated external defibrillators for very early defibrillation. Use of these devices by bystanders is the most promising new intervention since CPR was first proposed in the early 1960s. Postresuscitation ventricular dysrhythmias and heart failure are now called postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. This complication has been recognized as a leading cause of the high postresuscitation mor"

Thermal treatment increases the density and compressive strength of probes (both parameters go through maxima, with later decreases) and decreases the absorption of water. The densification is also revealed by the evolution of the ratio of decrease of volume/loss of mass. The maximum values of compressive strengths were obtained for 25% of illitic clay, montmorillonite and glass powder. Densification concerning probes with sludge ashes alone does not occur with kaolin. Experimental data were adjusted to exponential relationships between compressive strengths and densities for every composition, and also to a general equation for all probes. The apparent density obtained was adjusted to a non-linear dependence with temperature, leading to a maximum in density and permitting calculating the temperature of occurrence of this maximum. The adjustment was not possible for probes containing kaolin, requiring presumably higher temperatures to densify. Water absorption has low values for ashes or kaolin probes, intermediate values for illite and powdered flat glass probes and high values for montmorillonite probes.

Forty-eight per cent of the CA patients showed ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) on ambulance arrival. Patients with a prolonged ambulance delay showed a lower incidence of VT/VF than patients with a short delay. Patients in whom CPR had been initiated by bystanders showed a significantly higher incidence of VT/VF (67%) than unattended patients (45%). Bystander CPR was furthermore associated with an increased incidence of VT/VF in patients with prolonged ambulance delay. VT/VF was present at the time when the ambulance arrived in 86% of the CA patients who had received CPR from a bystander and were reached within 8 min by the ambulance."

            "abstract": "Biomechanical analyses under compression only, and for a combination of flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending were performed to evaluate the stress of the interarticular portion of the lumbar vertebra using a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element method. A detailed three-dimensional L4-L5 motion segment model was developed that took into consideration the material nonlinearities of ligaments and annular fibers and the contact nonlinearities of facet joints. For a more accurate examination, the separation of cortical bone and cancellous bone for both posterior and anterior elements were also considered. The stress in the pars interarticularis was weakest under compression alone, but stronger under compression with lateral bending loading, with flexion, with rotation, and with extension. Under each loading condition, the region of the stress concentration was consistent with the separated region of the spondylolysis observed in clinical situations. Since the stress in the pars interarticularis was high under extension and rotation in particular, those loadings were suggested to be relatively high risk factors leading to spondylolysis."

We also examined the effect of patient and system characteristics that may affect the provision of bystander CPR. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of these factors with two outcomes: the provision of bystander CPR with and without dispatcher assistance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-four percent (1,151/2,618) of cardiac arrest victims received bystander CPR. Four hundred fifty-seven people (17.5% of the entire study population, 39.7% of those who received any bystander CPR) received CPR without telephone instructions. A total of 694 people received dispatcher-assisted bystander CPR (25.6% of the entire population, 60.4% of those receiving any bystander CPR). After adjusting for demographic and care factors, we found a strong association between the tax-assessed value of the cardiac arrest location and increased odds of the provision of bystander CPR without dispatcher instructions and bystander CPR with dispatcher assistance compared with no bystander CPR.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that higher bystander SES is associated with increased rates of bystander CPR with and without dispatcher instructions.

            "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that chondrocyte differentiation can be stimulated by cyclic mechanical compression of chick limb bud cell-agarose constructs. This study reveals that medium collected from these compressed cultures promotes chondrocyte differentiation of non-compressed cells to approximately the same extent as compression alone. In micromass cultures of chick limb bud cells, incubation with medium from compressed cells significantly enhanced cell proliferation and the average rate of proteoglycan synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that the response of undifferentiated chick limb bud cells to mechanical loading involves the secretion of one or more soluble differentiation factors. The chondrogenic activity of the conditioned medium was substantially inhibited by passage through a filter with a nominal molecular-weight cutoff (MWCO) of 10 kDa but not inhibited when using a MWCO of 30 kDa, suggesting that at least one of these factors has a molecular mass between 10 and 30 kDa."

This distinction can often not be made with certainty with the help of chest CT alone, but frequently necessitates surgical biopsy or exploration. We prospectively studied the utility of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in this clinical circumstance.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and patients:\n        \n      \n      Between May 1999 and July 2000, 131 consecutive patients with central thoracic malignancies potentially involving the airways were enrolled into the study. Patients underwent chest CT followed by standard bronchoscopy together with EBUS and subsequent surgical evaluation. The bronchoscopists did not know the radiologist's interpretation of the chest CT before performing EBUS. The ability of chest CT and EBUS to distinguish between compression and infiltration was measured against the histologic results.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred five patients completed the trial by undergoing surgery.

Video-link instruction was associated with significantly higher median scores for all three outcome measurements (P < 0.05), whereas telephone instruction and previous CPR training were associated with higher scores on only one, namely ventilations (P < 0.05). Video-link instruction was comparable with direct observer instruction. There was no significant difference between previously trained subjects and the intervention groups.

            "abstract": "Using a realistic nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model, biomechanics of the entire lumbar spine L1-S1, risk of tissue injury, and required local lumbar muscle exertion in extended and flexed postures are investigated under moderate to relatively large compression loads as great as 2800 N as the lumbar lordosis is altered from the undeformed value of -46 degrees by + 15 degrees in extension or by as much as 38 degrees in flexion. To prevent the instability of the passive structure in compression, the changes in segmental rotations are prescribed and the required sagittal/lateral moments at each level calculated. The effect of load distribution is considered by applying the whole compression on the L1 vertebra alone or among all vertebral levels with 90% or 80% of the compression on the L1 and the remaining evenly shared by the rest. The results are markedly affected by the postural changes and load distributions. The primary global displacement responses are stiffened in the presence of combined loads. The axial compression load substantially increases the intradiscal pressure, facet loads, and disc fiber strains. The large facet loads at the caudal L5-S1 level causes large differential sagittal rotations at vertebral posterior and anterior bony structures, resulting in large stresses in the pedicles and pars interarticularis. The contribution of the passive structures in carrying the load is influenced by the lumbar lordosis and compression load magnitude. Slight flattening of the lumbar spine under large compression reduces the maximum disc fiber strains and required equilibrating moments without adversely affecting the disc pressure and ligament forces. During lifting tasks, the passive spinal structures are protected by slight to moderate flattening in the lumbar curvature, whereas larger flexion angles impose significantly higher risk by increasing the disc pressure, disc anulus fiber strains, ligamentous forces, and facet forces. Changes in lordosis also markedly affect the stabilizing sagittal moments; the required moments diminish in small flexion angles, thus requiring smaller forces in local lumbar muscles. Thus, the lumbar posture during heavy lifting could be adjusted to minimize the required moments generated by lumbar muscle exertions and the risk of tissue injury."

We hypothesized that the effect of increased body mass on bone structure would be accounted for by total and/or appendicular nonbone lean mass, and that once these trends were removed, fat mass would show no protective influence. To test this hypothesis, we examined body composition and geometric indices of proximal femur strength in an ethnically diverse (black, Hispanic, and white) sample of randomly selected men, 30-79 yr of age.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were obtained from N = 1171 community-dwelling subjects enrolled in the cross-sectional Boston Area Community Health/Bone study.

These measures included BMD, bone material in cross-sections (cross-sectional area), bending strength (section modulus), and propensity to buckle under compression (average buckling ratio). Analyses controlled for age, race/ethnicity, height, and physical activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In exploratory analyses, lean mass, fat mass, and BMI were each positively associated with hip strength. However, controlling for lean mass was sufficient to remove the positive, and induce a negative, association for fat mass or BMI. Associations between lean mass and hip strength were strongest and resistant to control for other measures. Lean mass alone was sufficient to account for a substantial proportion of racial/ethnic difference in hip strength measures, whereas fat mass exhibited no comparable explanatory power.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The positive association between relative weight and proximal femur strength is accounted for by lean mass, suggesting that, in men, the protective effect of BMI in preventing fracture is mediated not by adipose tissue but by the influence of increased muscle mass accompanying elevated BMI."

CPR self-training, which uses learner-operated virtual media rather than a live instructor, has not been assessed for its ability to influence learners' attitudes toward performing CPR in a real emergency. The aim of this study was to compare attitude effects associated with traditional, live instruction versus self-training or no instruction.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Data from 1069 lay learners were collected.

Compression tests revealed that ovariectomized controls also had the lowest modulus of elasticity of all groups.

The 305 patients had the following data: mean age 63.9 years; male 78.0%; paramedic-witnessed arrest 25.6%; bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 32.1%; initial rhythm ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia 86.9%, Cerebral Performance Category 1 267, Cerebral Performance Category 2 26, Cerebral Performance Category 3 12.

Compactibility in this study is restricted to tablet strength and friability alone. Nine mixtures with varying degrees of compactibility were tableted and the tensile strength and friability of the tablets were determined. The tableting indices of these mixtures were determined using an Instron Universal testing machine. An artificial neural network program was used to establish a quantitative relationship between indices and tablet strength and friability. Six new powders were used to validate the models describing the relationship between indices and tablet strength and friability. These powders were compressed into tablets and their strength and friability were determined. Their indices were also determined. The established models were used to predict tablet strength and friability from index values. The predicted values were compared with the experimentally determined values. There was little correlation between the predicted and experimentally determined values for tablet strength and friability. It was also found that materials or mixtures having almost similar indices had remarkably different compactibilities. It was concluded that models created to predict compactibility using one set of materials may not be able to successfully predict the compactibility of a new material. This calls into question the practicality of indices."

These four cases were observed over the course of one year and represent 5% of all unilateral traumatic cerebral lesion observed in our department during that period. The clinical situation presumptive of tentorial herniation included: partial (2 patients) or total (2 patients) secondary third nerve palsy, homolateral to the cerebral lesion; noncomatose state with initial Glasgow verbal score of 3 or greater; slight or no contralateral deficit. The anatomic lesions are unilateral and included 2 cases of temporal hematoma, one case of hemispheric swelling with acute subdural hematoma, and one case of general brain edema with temporal hematoma; In all 4 cases the clinical course was favorable with medical treatment alone. Based on the clinical information (non comatose state) and CT-scans (basal cisterns present or slight compressed in 3 of 4 cases), the authors believe that there was no tentorial herniation; third nerve palsy occurred without axial compression. The authors analysed several of the accepted criteria for severe head injuries (GCS, CT-scan, and ICP) and referred to the literature in order to determine optimal patient management in such reversible situations that posed a danger of tentorial herniation. Repeated clinical examination and CT-scan for visualization of basal cisterns appeared to be the best criteria for therapeutic decision."

These are similar to the structures formed by calcium in glass-ionomer cements, but are different from typical monomeric strontium carboxylates, which tend to be purely ionic. Strontium oxide powder introduced in two types of glass-ionomer cements, slowed down the setting reaction at both 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C, but at low levels (5 wt %), increased the compressive strength in both cement formulations studied. However, at higher levels, it was found to decrease the compressive strength. This study confirms the view that strontium is a cement-forming ion; but concludes that, except at very low levels, strontium oxide powder does not improve the properties of glass-ionomer cements."

All patients began walking by the third postoperative day. One hundred and ninety-six patients who had 217 total hip arthroplasties were included. Twenty-eight per cent of the procedures were revisions of a previous total hip replacement or of an endoprosthesis, and the remainder were primary arthroplasties. Patients were randomized as to the type of prophylaxis that they received: intermittent pneumatic compression alone, seventy-six hips; intermittent pneumatic compression and aspirin, seventy-two hips; or intermittent pneumatic compression and low-dose warfarin, sixty-nine hips. Before discharge from the hospital, and at an average of seven days after the operation, all patients were evaluated for the presence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis with either venography on the side of the operation or with bilateral venous ultrasonography. The relative frequency with which thrombosis occurred in a proximal vein was not significantly different in the three groups; the over-all relative frequency was 10 per cent. Intermittent compression during and after the operation effectively reduces the rate of proximal-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. With the number of patients in our study, the effectiveness of this technique could not be shown to be augmented by oral administration of either aspirin or low-dose warfarin."

More knowledge of the anatomic injuries produced by known trauma may yield practical information regarding injury mechanisms and treatment alternatives. In this experiment, 16 porcine cervical spine three-vertebrae segments were subjected to flexion-compression, extension-compression, and compression-alone trauma modes. The resultant injuries were scored by anatomic dissection. The results were analyzed for variance with trauma mode using nonparametric analysis. The three modes of trauma were found to have statistically significant differences in the degree of injury to the spine and its structural components. Extension-compression trauma produced the greatest injury scores to the whole spine and to the anterior structures. Flexion-compression trauma produced the highest posterior element injury scores. Compression trauma alone produced the lowest injury scores and no definitive pattern of anatomic injuries. The severity of anatomic injuries in this model relates most to the addition of bending moments to high-speed axial compression of the spine segment."

            "abstract": "\"Bystanders\" or lay persons are typically the first caregivers to attend to a victim of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. Astronaut crew medical officers (CMO) play a similar role to bystanders aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Studies have demonstrated the importance of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) for patient survival before the arrival of emergency medical care. Recent apprehension from bystanders about the threat of contracting communicable diseases during BCPR, however, has led to the consideration of other ventilation systems such as the bag-valve mask (BVM) and automatic transport ventilators (ATV). BVM use is called for during CPR aboard the ISS. This study evaluated the ventilation and compression performance of 40 basic CPR-trained bystanders using either a BVM (adult-sized self-inflating bag with face mask) or an ATV (Model 730 ventilator (M730), Impact Instrumentation, Inc., West Caldwell, NJ). Each two-bystander team gave BCPR to a simulated cardiopulmonary arrest victim using the 2-breath/15-compression cycle for 4 min and then switched roles for another 4-min interval. Compared to BVM use, the M730 led to significantly (p<0.05) lower number of breaths, smaller tidal volumes, airway flows, airway pressures, volume of gas entering the stomach per breath and chest compressions for the 4-min period. The M730 also enabled a bystander to meet the recommendation of 4-breath and compression cycles per minute as per Guidelines 2000. Lastly, ease-of-use scores were significantly higher for the M730 compared to the BVM. Overall, the data suggest that the M730 improves the quality of performance for a bystander performing BCPR."

In all, 488 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of which 262 (54%) died during initial hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis including age, sex, history of cardiovascular disease, chronic medication prior to arrest and circumstances at the time of arrest, the following appeared as independent predictors of hospital mortality: (1) interval between collapse and first defibrillation (P < 0.001); (2) on chronic medication with diuretics (P < 0.01); (3) age (P < 0.01); (4) bystander initiated CPR (P < 0.05); and (5) a history of diabetes (P < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis considering various aspects of status on admission to hospital, the following were independently associated with death: (1) degree of consciousness (P < 0.001) and (2) systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). In conclusion, among patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest found in ventricular fibrillation and being hospitalised alive, 54% died in hospital.

We report on two boys, aged 18 and 17 years, one with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and one with Uhl's anomaly. Both had implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for the prevention of sudden death (SD), but were not considered urgent heart transplant candidates due to the absence of heart failure symptoms. A ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiac collapse occurred at school in the Uhl patient and in hospital in the ARVC patient. In both patients, ICD shocks intermittently restored sinus rhythm but with inadequate circulation. Only the ARVC patient received early chest compressions and was saved to heart transplantation. Due to RV failure, both patients had evidence of Fontan-type physiology, in whom pulmonary blood flow is passive and propelled by the transpulmonary pressure gradient and intrathoracic pressure alterations produced by breathing. In these cases, at resuscitation, systemic circulation is not established until after pulmonary blood flow is restored by breathing or chest compressions. An ICD alone is therefore not sufficient for the prevention of SD. When invasive data show evidence of Fontan-type circulation, the patient may be considered for heart transplantation."

            "abstract": "A novel technique is presented to compress medical data employing two or more mutually nonorthogonal transforms. Both lossy and lossless compression implementations are considered. The signal is first resolved into subsignals such that each subsignal is compactly represented in a particular transform domain. An efficient lossy representation of the signal is achieved by superimposing the dominant coefficients corresponding to each subsignal. The residual error, which is the difference between the original signal and the reconstructed signal is properly formulated. Adaptive algorithms in conjunction with an optimization strategy are developed to minimize this error. Both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) approaches for the technique are developed. It is shown that for a given number of retained coefficients, the discrete cosine transform (DCT)-Walsh mixed transform representation yields a more compact representation than using DCT or Walsh alone. This lossy technique is further extended for the lossless case. The coefficients are quantized and the signal is reconstructed. The resulting reconstructed signal samples are rounded to the nearest integer and the modified residual error is computed. This error is transmitted employing a lossless technique such as the Huffman coding. It is shown that for a given number of retained coefficients, the mixed transforms again produces the smaller rms-modified residual error. The first-order entropy of the error is also smaller for the mixed-transforms technique than for the DCT, thus resulting in smaller length Huffman codes."

According to the \"Utstein Style\" we report the demographic and clinical features of the patients (pts) suffering Cardiac Arrest (CA) and the impact of SECT on out-of-hospital CA. During 26 months of activity, SECT performed 3,648 missions (most important among these: 457 acute myocardial infarction, 723 angina, 523 arrhythmias, 270 acute heart failure, 154 cardiac arrest), and managed 207 confirmed CA (154 calls for CA, 53 CA occurred after team arrival because of other symptoms). Resuscitation was attempted in 135 pts, in 72 pts medical personnel accerted an irreversible death state. 86% of CA occurred at home. In all cases a cardiac etiology was presumed. All CA were witnessed: 53 by EMS personnel, 82 by lay bystander. In 53 EMS witnessed CA, ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was showed in 47.2%, asystole in 43.4%, other rhythms (Oth) in 9.4%. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained in 52.8% pts, 76% in VT/VF Group. 43.4% were admitted alive to intensive care unit (ICU), 68% in VT/VF Group. 37.7% were discharged alive, 64% in VT/VF Group. In 82 lay witnessed CA initial rhythm was VT/VF in 31.7%, asystole in 59.7%, Oth. In 8.6%. CPR was attempted by lay bystander in 28% of cases. ROSC was obtained in 18.3%. CPR was attempted by lay bystander in 28% of cases. ROSC was obtained in 18.3% pts, 42.3% in VT/VF Group. 15.8% were admitted alive to ICU, 34.6% in VT/VF Group. 9.7% pts were discharged alive, 23% in VT/VF Group. Discharged alive rate in lay attempted CPR cases was 17.4%. The collapse-EMS CPR interval was 16 +/- 6.13 min (range 4-29), with a collapse-call receipt interval of 8.57 +/- 5.75 min (range 1-23) and a call receipt-EMS CPR interval of 8.06 +/- 3.56 min (range 2-19). The same intervals are significantly longer in not attempted CPR cases: respectively 26.53 +/- 10.73 min (range 10-65) -p < 0.001-, 19.29 +/- 11.3 min (range 5-60) -p < 0.001- and 8.26 +/- 3.96 (range 3-25) -p = NS-. Although far from the international effectiveness standards, SECT seemed to improve the out-of-hospital CA prognosis. High rate of CA occurred at home, time delay in early access link, better trend in survival in lay bystander attempted CPR cases and lack in early defibrillation lead to strategies for system improvement through targeted CPR training as well as semiautomatic external defibrillators introduction."

An underdamped, counterbalanced beam applied a sudden compressive force to a full-thickness cylindrical specimen of articular cartilage. The initial oscillatory response decayed to steady state creep after approximately 10 cycles of oscillation. The results were consistent with a Voigt phenomenological model with linear stiffness and damping terms. Standard dynamics analysis of the transient oscillatory response enabled the elastic stiffness to be determined from the frequency and the damping coefficient to be derived from the logarithmic decrement of the decay of the oscillations. The relationship between the mechanical properties and structure of cartilage was determined by treating specimens with two specific proteolytic enzymes. Digestion and removal of proteoglycans alone with cathepsin D caused the damping coefficient to decrease with no change in elastic stiffness. The action of leukocyte elastase on collagen caused a decrease in both damping coefficient and elastic stiffness. It was concluded that the collagen fibrils in cartilage largely control the elastic response while the viscous response is controlled largely by the hydrated proteoglycans. The effects of cartilage thickness was also examined and found to be inversely proportional to the elastic stiffness. It is suggested that this method could be used to uncouple elastic and viscous properties of other viscoelastic materials."

The results suggest that the SDL kit yields learning outcomes comparable to those obtained with traditional instructor-led courses and is a more time-efficient tool for CPR-AED training.

In all unwitnessed arrests, crews undertook CPR and manually ventilated the lungs via a mask or an endotracheal tube with a bag and valve or a mechanical resuscitator using an FIO2 of 1 or 0.21 for at least 2 min before defibrillation was attempted. There were 3403 diagnosed cardiac arrests but, in these, the diagnosis was not certain. CPR and advanced life support (ALS) were applied in 3380 patients and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained in 554, giving a success rate of 16.4%. A total of 364 patients were accepted into hospital, 90 patients died in A&E but 274 patients were admitted to ICU/CCU. Seventy died within 24 h, 69 died after 24 h and 135 were discharged alive and well without cerebral damage. The final success to discharge rate was 49.27%. Of those discharged, 69 had a circulatory arrest period of more than 4 min but in only 10 was a bystander available to start CPR. The European Resuscitation Council Guidelines recommending immediate defibrillation for unwitnessed arrests are not supported by these results. The apparent lack of cerebral damage and the percentage success suggests that resuscitation considerations should be as brain orientated as they are heart orientated.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Since 2005 when we became aware of pectoralis minor syndrome (PMS), more than 75% of patients diagnosed with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) also have neurogenic PMS (NPMS), and about 30% have only NPMS, without NTOS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Diagnosis was made based on history, physical examination, pectoralis minor (PM), and scalene muscle blocks with lidocaine. Pectoralis minor tenotomy was performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia with heavy sedation through a 5-7 cm transaxillary incision.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The clinical picture included pain or tenderness in the anterior chest wall and axilla, together with physical findings of tenderness over the pectoralis minor tendon. Other symptoms were extremity pain, weakness, and paresthesia, similar to symptoms of NTOS. In 76 patients, 100 operations were performed: 48 for NPMS combined with NTOS and 52 for NPMS-alone. Features distinguishing the PM-alone group were fewer and milder occipital headaches, less neck pain, and fewer positive physical findings. Preoperatively, 85% of the of the PM-alone group were still employed compared to only 57% of the combined group (p=0.01). Success rates with 1-3-year follow-up for the PM-alone group were 90% good-excellent, 2% fair, and 8% failed; for the combined group success rates were 35% good-excellent, 19% fair, and 46% failed. All but one of the failures was immediate, only one was late. The only complication was 3 wound infections. Most patients returned to work within a few days. In the combined PMS/TOS group, most of the failed patients subsequently had thoracic outlet operations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      PMS commonly accompanies NTOS and frequently exists alone. Its recognition is important as many patients with suspected NTOS can be treated successfully with a simple, essentially risk-free PM tenotomy. Should this fail, thoracic outlet decompression can always be performed at a later date."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Hands-Only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recommended for use on adult victims of witnessed out-of-hospital (OOH) sudden cardiac arrest or in instances where rescuers cannot perform ventilations while maintaining minimally interrupted quality compressions. Promotion of Hands-Only CPR should improve the incidence of bystander CPR and, subsequently, survival from OOH cardiac arrest; but, little is known about a rescuer's ability to deliver continuous chest compressions of adequate rate and depth for periods typical of emergency services response time. This study evaluated chest compression rate and depth as subjects performed Hands-Only CPR for 10 minutes. For comparison purposes, each also performed chest compressions with ventilations (30:2) CPR. It also evaluated fatigue and changes in body biomechanics associated with each type of CPR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty healthy female volunteers certified in basic life support performed Hands-Only CPR and 30:2 CPR on a manikin. A mixed model repeated measures cross-over design evaluated chest compression rate and depth, changes in fatigue (chest compression force, perceived exertion, and blood lactate level), and changes in electromyography and joint kinetics and kinematics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All subjects completed 10 minutes of 30:2 CPR; but, only 17 completed 10 minutes of Hands-Only CPR. Rate, average depth, percentage at least 38 millimeters deep, and force of compressions were significantly lower in Hands-Only CPR than in 30:2 CPR. Rates were maintained; but, compression depth and force declined significantly from beginning to end CPR with most decrement occurring in the first two minutes. Perceived effort and joint torque changes were significantly greater in Hands-Only CPR. Performance was not influenced by age.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Hands-Only CPR required greater effort and was harder to sustain than 30:2 CPR. It is not known whether the observed greater decrement in chest compression depth associated with Hands-Only CPR would offset the potential physiological benefit of having fewer interruptions in compressions during an actual resuscitation. The dramatic decrease in compression depth in the first two minutes reinforces current recommendations that rescuers take turns performing compressions, switching every two minutes or less. Further study is recommended to determine the impact of real-time feedback and dispatcher coaching on rescuer performance."

Of these, 112 (5%) developed spinal epidural metastasis with spinal cord compression during the course of their disease process. Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression was caused most commonly by Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma, followed by osteogenic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, soft-tissue sarcoma, germ-cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, and (rarely) hepatoma. There was no significant difference in outcome between patients with small-cell tumors (neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, and germ-cell tumors) who received only chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and the patients with similar lesions who received a decompressive laminectomy alone or prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Patients with spinal cord compression from metastatic sarcoma (Ewing's sarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma) showed a significant improvement with decompressive laminectomy alone or before medical therapy, compared to those who received radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy without posterior decompression. Pediatric tumors invade the spinal canal via the neural foramen, compressing the spinal cord in a circumferential manner, allowing decompressive laminectomy (posterior approach) to be an effective surgical approach. Sixty-six percent of children who had no evidence of motor or sensory function below the level of the compression became ambulatory after surgical decompression and medical treatment, regardless of tumor type."

A 25-year-old inebriated man rescued from drowning in a swimming pool was apnoeic and pulseless after being pulled out of the water. Successful CPR was provided by untrained bystanders, including abdominal thrusts thought to remove water from the airways and chest compressions to provide haemodynamic support. As the patient progressively improved during his subsequent hospital stay, he complained of right upper abdominal and thoracic pain. A computed tomographic scan showed a 11 cm subcapsular haematoma contiguous to the right hepatic lobe. A favourable outcome was obtained after conservative, non-operative treatment.

Although a quality of performance somewhat below AHA standards may still improve a patient's prognosis, the need for regular retraining must be emphasized. Thirdly, this need is underlined when looking at factors influencing the superior complex of competence: frequent and regular participation in qualified training increases comprehensive competence, which is a pre-condition for helping behaviour. Fourthly, awareness of the central telephone number to activate the EMS has to be promoted. And, fifthly, every single link of the chain of survival; efforts aimed at improving citizen CPR training must be accompanied by efforts aimed at early access and the quality of EMS service, tailored to regional or local structures."

Compression tests were conducted on cartilage alone and cartilage-on-bone at strain-rates ranging from 10(-5)sec-1 to 10(3)sec-1 and it was established that matrix stiffness increased progressively in the \"low\" and \"medium\" strain-rate regimens and assumes a limiting value at \"high\" rates of loading up to impact. Analysis of the strain field characteristics associated with the compression process, both at low and high velocities, suggests that two fundamentally different mechanisms of deformation control the development of cartilage matrix stiffness. At low strain-rates a consolidation-dependent stiffness occurs while at high strain rates the high stiffness results from a classical elastic deformation process. This bifurcation in the tissue's response to loading is likely to affect the redistribution of joint contact stresses being transmitted into the subchondral bone."

            "abstract": "Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest continue to be low despite periodic updates in the Guidelines for Emergency Medical Services and periodic improvements such as the addition of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs). The low incidence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), substantial time without chest compressions throughout the resuscitation effort, and a lack of response to initial defibrillation after prolonged ventricular fibrillation contribute to these unacceptably poor results. Resuscitation guidelines are only revised every 5 to 7 years and can be difficult to change because of the lack of randomized controlled trials in humans. Such trials are rare because of a number of logistical difficulties, including the problem of obtaining informed consent. An alternative approach to advancing resuscitation science is for evidence-based demonstration projects in areas that have adequate records, so that one may determine whether the new approach improves survival. This is reasonable because the current guidelines make provisions for deviations under certain local circumstances or as directed by the emergency medical services medical director. A wealth of experimental evidence indicates that interruption of chest compressions for any reason in patients with cardiac arrest is deleterious. Accordingly, a new approach to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest called cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) was developed that places more emphasis on chest compressions for witnessed cardiac arrest in adults and de-emphasizes ventilation. There is also emphasis on chest compressions before defibrillation in circulatory phase of cardiac arrest. CCR was initiated in Tucson, Arizona, in November 2003, and in two rural Wisconsin counties in early 2004."

            "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were studied in Israel from 1984 to 1985. More than 3,500 patients in cardiac arrest received paramedic care. Eighty-three percent of cases were caused by underlying heart disease. Overall, 17% of patients with arrest caused by heart disease were admitted and 7% were discharged from the hospital. There was a wide variation in the percent discharged among the 15 paramedic service areas, ranging from 0% to 13%. Factors associated with successful resuscitation included witnessed collapse, rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, short interval from collapse to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and delivery of advanced cardiac life support, collapse at public location, and bystander initiation of CPR. Improvements in survival are likely to result if CPR is more frequently and promptly initiated and the time to arrival of definitive paramedic care can be improved."

            "abstract": "Little attention has been given to superficial thrombophlebitis and particularly to lesser saphenous vein thrombophlebitis (LSVT) by vascular surgeons. A prospective nonrandomized study was conducted to assess LSVT's potential association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as well as its natural history. Between January 1994 and December 1995, the authors reviewed 33 cases of LSVT detected by duplex scanning in 32 patients at their institution's vascular laboratory. Combined LSVT/DVT was treated with heparin and warfarin. LSVT alone or LSVT plus greater saphenous vein thrombophlebitis (GSVT) were treated with local warm compresses and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Follow-up scans were obtained in 23 of the 32 patients and ranged from 2 weeks to 18 months after diagnosis of LSVT. Thirty-one patients had unilateral LSVT and 1 patient had bilateral LSVT. Isolated LSVT was found in 9 patients (28%), LSVT combined with DVT occurred in 21 patients (65.6%), and 2 patients had LSVT/GSVT. LSVT was contiguous with DVT in 15 patients, and in 5 patients it was noncontiguous. Within 3 months, 9 of 16 patients (56%) with LSVT/DVT had complete or partial resolution of their LSVT, and 1 (14%) of the 7 patients with LSVT and LSVT/GSVT had improved. Within 18 months, 13 of 16 patients (81%) with LSVT/DVT had complete resolution of their thrombus while only 3 of 7 patients (43%) with LSVT and LSVT/GSVT had resolved. These data show that LSVT is more often associated with DVT (65.6%) than previously believed. While most LSVT will improve in 18 months, those associated with DVT will resolve sooner. Whether anticoagulation accounted for this difference remains to be proven."

            "abstract": "Basic life support (BLS) refers to maintaining airway patency and supporting breathing and the circulation, without the use of equipment other than infection protection measures. The scientific advisory committee of the American Heart Association (AHA) published recommendations (online-first) on March 31 2008, which promote a call to action for bystanders who are not or not sufficiently trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and witness an adult out-of-hospital sudden collapse probably of cardiac origin. These bystanders should provide chest compression without ventilation (so-called compression-only CPR). If bystanders were previously trained and thus confident with CPR, they should decide between conventional CPR (chest compression plus ventilation at a ratio of 30:2) and chest compression alone. However, considering current evidence-based medicine and latest scientific data both the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the German Resuscitation Council (GRC) do not at present intend to change or supplement the current resuscitation guidelines \"Basic life support for adults\". Both organisations do not see any need for change or amendments in central European practice and continue to recommend that only those lay rescuers that are not willing or unable to give mouth-to-mouth ventilation should provide CPR solely by uninterrupted chest compressions until professional help arrives. It is also stressed that the training of young people especially teenagers as lay rescuers should be promoted and the establishment of training programs through emergency medical organizations and in schools should be encouraged."

            "abstract": "The first link in the \"chain of survival\" concept is the activation of the emergency medical system (EMS) by a bystander after recognition of cardiac arrest (CA) or its immediate prodrome. Our ongoing study is aimed at evaluating the current effectiveness of bystander EMS activation for all cases of CA in the city and area of Mainz. Methods. Starting February 1991, we began to prospectively examine collapse-intervention intervals in all cases of CA treated by our physician-manned ambulance. Precision voice recorders carried by the ambulance crews are activated and linked to the EMS dispatcher to time the arrival of the ambulance vehicle. Time intervals starting from the time of collapse are then reconstructed from the dispatcher's time and the tapes. The emergency phone number dialled initially by the bystander and the time of collapse in witnessed cardiac arrests are identified. RESULTS. Sixty-six CAs were witnessed and included in this study. In 20% of those cases, the number dialled initially by the bystander was 19222 (EMS dispatcher), in 38% 110 (police), and in 42% other numbers (family practitioners or their on-call service, fire department). The time interval, as median (25th percentile; 75th percentile), between collapse and receipt call by the emergency dispatchers was 4 min (2; 8) for all patients (n = 66), and 6.5 min (3; 12) whenever numbers other than emergency phone numbers were dialled. All following time intervals (start of BLS or ACLS procedures) showed differences (P less than 0.05) between the 110 or 19222 group [BLS: 8.5 min (4.8; 13.1) or 10 min (7.35; 12.1); ACLS: 11.3 min (9.1; 13.45) or 12.9 min (10.6; 21.5)] vs the group, in which other phone numbers were initially dialled [BLS: 15.25 min (9.25; 19.4); ACLS: 20.11 min (12.6; 28.3)]. The first ECG rhythm showed VF in 56% and 54% in case 110 and 19222 were dialled, but only in 32% in the other group. CONCLUSION. Even one single weak link in the \"chain of survival\" can lower overall survival rates. An indispensable, but apparently underrated component of an effective EMS includes an informed citizenry able to call swiftly for help. Lack of an unequivocal emergency number, well known and accepted by the citizens, produces confusion and delays. In our systems, the correct medical emergency phone number (19222) was dialled in 20% of the cases only, thus demonstrating clearly the lack of public awareness of this 5-digit number. In a higher percentage, the three-digit police number (110) was dialled. In cases where numbers other than emergency numbers were dialled (42%), the longest time intervals between collapse and receipt of call by the dispatchers occurred, associated with the longest time intervals until initiation of CPR and the lowest percentage of patients found in ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that establishment of a simple three-digit EMS phone number, preferentially Europe-wide, in combination with an intensification of public awareness, could be a vital step not only to reduce time intervals between collapse and CPR in our EMS system but also to improve survival."

Biomechanical studies suggest that under conditions of low preloads, the motion segment treated with stand-alone cages might be less stable, particularly in extension. METHODS.: Eight human lumbar spine specimens (from L1 to sacrum) were tested intact, after insertion of 2 threaded cylindrical cages (BAK) at L5-S1 and after supplemental translaminar facet screw fixation. They were subjected to flexion and extension moments under progressively increasing magnitude of externally applied compressive follower preload from 0 to 1200 N. The range of angular motion in flexion-extension at L5-S1 was analyzed to assess the effect of translaminar facet screws on the stability of the cage construct for different compressive preloads.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In flexion, over 0 to 400 N preload, the supplemental translaminar facet screw fixation reduced the L5-S1 angular motion relative to intact by 71% to 74% as compared to 40% to 44% for the cages alone. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In extension at 0 N preload, the cages allowed more angular motion than the intact segment, whereas with translaminar facet screw fixation, the motion was reduced to the level of the intact segment. At 400 N preload, supplemental TLFS fixation significantly increased the stability of the cages, reducing the extension angular motion by 60% of intact (P = 0.04). Supplemental translaminar facet screw fixation did not significantly increase the stability provided by the cages in flexion or extension at the 1200 N preload magnitude.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In vivo during activities of daily living, interbody cage constructs are subject to varying compressive preloads due to external loads generated by paraspinal musculature, and our results suggest that the stability created by the cage (reduction in segmental angular motion) is not constant. The cage construct is likely to be least stable in extension during activities that impart low compressive preloads to the lumbar spine. Supplemental translaminar facet screw fixation will enhance stability of the motion segment treated with threaded cages, particularly during conditions of low compressive preloads, the very condition in which the cage alone is least effective in providing stability."

The recoverability was better following short (3-day) than long (1- or 3-month) periods of compression. The loss of dendritic spines nevertheless persisted. An intraventricular infusion of NGF was performed after decompressing the lesions following 3 days of cortical compression, and this increased the recovery of the spines but not the dendritic length of the cortical pyramidal neurons, nor did it alter the recovery of the cortical thickness. NGF also promoted the increase of the dendritic spines, but not the dendritic length of the cortical pyramidal neurons of normal animals. In short, the data show that a few days of compression alone can cause permanent cortical damage. Exogenous NGF, if applied topically, may restore the dendritic spine density of cortical neurons subjected to compression."

            "abstract": "The results of three patients with difficult to manage leg and trunk lymphedema are reported. Patients were treated with the current standard of care: combined decongestive therapy. All three patients met obstacles in achieving independent self-care, which impeded their discharge to home care. The use of two currently available programmable pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) was investigated to determine if these devices could enable these difficult-to-manage patients to meet their discharge goals. Results indicate that programmable PCDs can be effective in managing complicated cases of leg and trunk lymphedema, and that differences may exist between devices. In this trial, the device with lower applied pressures and smaller pneumatic chambers provided better tolerated treatment and overall better patient outcomes. These three case reports show that in-home use of an appropriate PCD can help patients with stage 3 and advanced stage 2 lymphedema achieve stable limb volumes with no exacerbation of lymphedema-related symptoms. Results also demonstrate the ability of patients to consistently use programmable PCDs in a home environment. The results are presented in a structured decision-making framework to aid the therapist and physician in selecting appropriate patients for home PCD lymphedema therapy, and in the selection of an appropriate PCD."

To explore reasons for this low response rate we analysed bystander perceptions during the victim's collapse, and methods used to assess cardiac arrest.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Over a 12-month period we prospectively investigated all dispatches for witnessed cardiac arrest of two physician-staffed emergency medical service (EMS) units within a western European metropolitan area (Berlin, Germany).

Furthermore, there are a number of similarities that suggest the possibility of a unification of both theories. Earlier in this respect we have studied consistency between the internal energy and free energy routes. As a next step toward this goal we here consider consistency with the compressibility route too, but we restrict explicit evaluations to a model whose exact solution is known showing that a unification works in that case. The model in question is the mean spherical model (MSM) which we here extend to a generalized MSM. For this case, we show that the correct solutions can be recovered from suitable boundary conditions through either SCOZA or HRT alone as well as by the combined theory. Furthermore, the relation between the HRT-SCOZA equations and those of SCOZA and HRT becomes transparent."

This is somewhat surprising given their importance and the length of time spent using them. This study considers some ergonomic aspects of their design, including body contact pressure and subjective ratings of comfort. Subjects (12 females) found all of the mattresses tested to be significantly more comfortable than an incompressible wooden reference surface. However, no significant differences were found between mattress types, which included orthopaedic and normal designs. Analysis of body contact pressures (measured at the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee and ankle) found few significant differences between experimental conditions. It is argued that limitations in the methodology may not take account of the change in surface area and anatomical sites of contact under different conditions of mattress compressibility. No significant associations were found between comfort ratings and peak body contact pressures. It seems likely that subjective ratings of mattress comfort are dependent on a wider set of factors than contact pressure alone, a finding reported elsewhere in studies of seating."

This will allow doctor to remotely meet face-to-face with a medical specialist or patients to interview, conduct physical examinations, review records, and prescribe treatments. Bonding multiple ISDN lines will further improve video quality that enables remote surgery. Surgeon can perform an operation on internal organ by projecting motion video from Endoscope's CCD camera to large display monitor. Also, PictureTel provides advanced technologies of eliminating background noise generated by surgical knives or scalpels during surgery. This will allow sound of the breath or heartbeat be clearly transmitted to the remote site. Thus, Multimedia eliminates the barrier of distance, enabling people to be just at home, to be anywhere in the world, to undergo up-to-date medical treatment by expertise.

            "abstract": "The effect of sodium caprate (a fatty acid salt) on the formation of beta-lactoglobulin A gels was studied at constant temperature (30 or 35 degrees C) using ultrasonic spectroscopy. During incubation at these temperatures, ultrasonic attenuation increased with the addition of sodium caprate, and reached a plateau after 5-7 h of incubation. Comparing beta-lactoglobulin A with and without sodium caprate, a decrease in net ultrasonic velocity was observed. These results suggested that aggregation occurred during incubation with sodium caprate, and the sample showed an increase in compressibility. Transmission electron microscopy with negative staining showed the formation of filamentous aggregates of beta-lactoglobulin A at around 3-4.5 h of incubation with sodium caprate. These results demonstrated that sodium caprate induced the formation of structures with unique gel properties compared to those formed by heating beta-lactoglobulin in the presence of NaCl alone."

            "abstract": "Aggrecan, a large biological polyelectrolyte molecule with a bottlebrush shape, forms complexes with hyaluronic acid (HA) that provide compressive resistance in cartilage. In solutions of aggrecan alone, the concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure Pi is marked by self-assembly of the molecules into aggregates. When HA is added to the solution at low aggrecan concentration c, the osmotic pressure is reduced, but in the physiological concentration range this trend is reversed. The osmotic modulus c partial differentialPi partial differentialc, which determines load bearing resistance, is enhanced in the HA-containing solutions. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements show that the aggregates behave like microgels and that they become denser as the aggrecan concentration increases. The degree of densification is greatest at large distance scales in the microgels, but decreases at short distance scales. Measurements at higher resolution, involving small angle neutron scattering and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), confirm that at length scales shorter than 1000 angstroms, the density is independent of the concentration and that the individual bottlebrushes in the microgels retain their identity. The absence of collective diffusion modes in the relaxation spectrum, measured by DLS and neutron spin echo, corroborates the lack of interpenetration among the aggrecan subunits in the microgel. Complexation with HA modifies the long-range spatial organization of the microgels. Comparison of the scattering pattern of the individual aggrecan molecules obtained from SAXS measurements with that of the complexes measured by DLS shows that the aggrecan-HA structure is denser and is more uniform than the random microgels. This enhanced space-filling property allows higher packing densities to be attained, thus, optimizing resistance to osmotic compression."

The use of bone allograft in reconstructive orthopedic surgeries is increasing, yet severe complications, including death, can result if the transplanted tissues transmit a communicable disease to the tissue recipient. The BioCleanse tissue sterilization process is a fully automated, low-temperature chemical sterilization process that renders allograft tissue sterile. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a chemical tissue sterilization process on the mechanical strength of cortical bone allografts prior to implantation. Cylindrical cortical bone specimens were harvested from seven human cadaver donors and treated either by: chemical sterilization alone; chemical sterilization and terminal sterilization by gamma irradiation; chemical sterilization, lyophilization, terminal sterilization by STERRAD and rehydration; or untreated. The specimens were tested to failure in axial compression, diametral compression, shear, or bending. There were no significant differences in ultimate stress, strain, or fracture energy between the chemically sterilized and control groups in any of the testing modes."

The aim of this study was to define the factors associated with an increased chance of survival after cardiac arrest witnessed out-of-hospital and secondary to ventricular fibrillation. The study group comprises all patients with cardiac arrest witnessed outside hospital in Göteborg between 1980 and 1992, in whom CPR was initiated by our EMS and ventricular fibrillation observed at the first ECG recording. In a multivariate analysis of age, sex, time of collapse, interval between collapse and first defibrillation, bystander-initiated CPR, the following factors were associated with an increased chance of being discharged from hospital: (1) Short interval between collapse and first defibrillation (P < 0.001); (2) Bystander-initiated CPR (P < 0.001); and (3) Age (P < 0.05). Among patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were found by the EMS personnel to have ventricular fibrillation, the predictors of survival were: interval between collapse and defibrillation, bystander-initiated CPR and age."

However, the relative roles of hypoxia (HO), hypercapnia (HC), gas stress and vigilance on the cardiovascular changes have not yet been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute haemodynamic changes observed during the repetitive inhalation of various gas mixtures in rats for HO alone and HO+HC, and to analyse the effects of vigilance and of the stress of gas administration. We studied 6 unanaesthetized Wistar rats chronically instrumented with an aortic catheter. Nitrogen, nitrogen+CO2 mixtures and compressed air were randomly administered in a Plexiglass chamber for 10 s and then flushed by compressed air for 20 s. Two cycles were repeated every min for 10 to 12 min. The inhaled gas fractions (FI,O2,FI,CO2) were monitored by O2 and CO2 analysers. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by a P23XL transducer. The blood gases were analysed by a 1306 IL meter. In control experiments, with compressed air alone, there were no significant acute changes in heart rate (HR) and BP. During HO there were no changes in HR or BP at FI,O2 values from 0.05-0.14, whilst at FI,O2 values from 0-0.05 systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose significantly (+25.3 +/- 25.7 (SD) mmHg) and HR decreased (-93.8 +/- 124.1 bpm). During HOHC, SBP rose (+35.1 +/- 26.4 mmHg) and HR decreased (-139.3 +/- 75.7 bpm), significantly more than in HO alone. SBP was linearly correlated with Pa,O2 during HO (r = 0.53) and also during HOHC (r = 0.44) and was not directly related to Pa,CO2 which has, nevertheless, an additive effect to HO. SBP rose with each challenge significantly more when the rats were awake than when asleep (behavioural sleep). We conclude that in this acute repetitive inhalation model, the rise in SBP is not related to gas stress or to Pa,CO2 but to a decrease in Pa,O2 and is enhanced by wakefulness."

            "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is the most disabling and serious manifestation of adrenergic failure, occurring in the autonomic neuropathies, pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). No specific treatment is currently available for most etiologies of OH. A reduction in venous capacity, secondary to some physical counter maneuvers (e.g., squatting or leg crossing), or the use of compressive garments, can ameliorate OH. However, there is little information on the differential efficacy, or the mechanisms of improvement, engendered by compression of specific capacitance beds. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of compression of specific compartments (calves, thighs, low abdomen, calves and thighs, and all compartments combined), using a modified antigravity suit, on the end-points of orthostatic blood pressure, and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Fourteen patients (PAF, n = 9; MSA, n = 3; diabetic autonomic neuropathy, n = 2; five males and nine females) with clinical OH were studied. The mean age was 62 years (range 31-78). The mean +/- SEM orthostatic systolic blood pressure when all compartments were compressed was 115.9 +/- 7.4 mmHg, significantly improved (p < 0.001) over the head-up tilt value without compression of 89.6 +/- 7.0 mmHg. The abdomen was the only single compartment whose compression significantly reduced OH (p < 0.005). There was a significant increase of peripheral resistance index (PRI) with compression of abdomen (p < 0.001) or all compartments (p < 0.001); end-diastolic index and cardiac index did not change. We conclude that denervation increases vascular capacity, and that venous compression improves OH by reducing this capacity and increasing PRI. Compression of all compartments is the most efficacious, followed by abdominal compression, whereas leg compression alone was less effective, presumably reflecting the large capacity of the abdomen relative to the legs."

In 10 dogs measurements were made of CSF dynamics, brain elastic behavior, cerebral perfusion pressure, local cerebral blood flow, and suprainfratentorial intracranial pressure (ICP) during the incremental expansion of a supratentorial extradural balloon. PVI appeared more as a measure of the compressibility of the cerebral vascular compartment than of intracranial bulk compliance. Reciprocal changes in CSF dynamics behaved as expected when the balloon expanded predominantly supratentorially causing a moderate increase in ICP. A significant increase in ICP, however, caused a rise in PVI and a decrease in compliance. Under these conditions PVI alone could not differentiate between a falling cerebral perfusion pressure and an increasing suprainfratentorial ICP gradient. In contrast, the compliance decreased with balloon expansion while the outflow resistance showed an inverse correlation with compliance and a linear correlation with baseline ICP; Go, an elastic response parameter, consistently decreased, implying that C, Ro, and Go can be used as a trend of intracranial compensatory reserve during intracranial mass expansion."

Finite element models derived from quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans overcome such limitations. The overall goal of this study was to establish that QCT-based \"voxel\" finite element models are better predictors of vertebral compressive strength than QCT measures of bone mineral density with or without measures of cross-sectional area. QCT scans were taken of 13 vertebral bodies excised from 13 cadavers (L1-L4; age: 37-87 years; M = 6, F = 7) and used to calculate bone mineral density (BMD(QCT)). The QCT voxel data were converted into linearly elastic finite element models of each vertebra, from which measures of vertebral stiffness and strength were computed. The vertebrae were biomechanically tested in compression to measure strength. Vertebral strength was positively correlated with the finite element measures of strength (r(2) = 0.86, P < 0.0001) and stiffness (r(2) = 0.82, P < 0.0001), the product of BMD(QCT) and vertebral minimum cross-sectional area (r(2) = 0.65, P = 0.0008), and BMD(QCT) alone (r(2) = 0.53, P = 0.005).

There were no survivors that were discharged in overall performance category (OPC) 1-2 after a bystander-witnessed arrest (excluding cases of hypothermia and/or near-drowning) with first responding unit (FRU)-delay over 14 min, or that were resuscitated for more than 20 min. There were no survivors who were discharged in OPC 1-2 after an unwitnessed arrest with the duration of advanced life support (ALS) exceeding 5.5 min.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of adrenaline during resuscitation was the only significant factor which was found to decrease the long-term survival. Among admitted patients, short delay to ROSC was the only factor associated with increased survival. Bystander-CPR and delays to the arrival of the FRU or to the initiation of ALS were not associated with survival. Therefore, it seems difficult to increase survival rates of PEA by improving the chain of survival. More effort should be put to education of the public to call for an ambulance before the cardiac arrest occurs."

Only HCW treatment produced glucose less than 5 weight percent (wt.%) in Douglas fir in a temperature range of 140-180 degrees C by enzymatic hydrolysis. Glucose production yields of 18 and 26 wt.% were obtained by HCW treatment at 170 and 180 degrees C, respectively, in Eucalyptus. Use of extrusion after HCW treatment drastically improved monosaccharide production yield in both woods. In the case of Douglas fir, the obtained values were 5 times higher than those obtained by HCW treatment alone. Total monosaccharide production yields were higher in Eucalyptus than in Douglas fir. The extruded production had a fine fibrous morphology on a sub-micro/nanoscopic scale.

Seventy percent of all refibrillations occurred less than six minutes after the defibrillator was turned on, and 23% occurred after more than ten minutes. The proportion of stable conversions decreased from 30% on first conversion to 2% on fourth conversion. With each successive conversion the interval to refibrillation grew shorter, and development of a pulse or blood pressure became less likely. Presence of blood pressure or pulse after conversion had a sensitivity for hospital discharge of 54% and a specificity of 98%. Maximum VF amplitude before countershock was highly predictive of postshock rhythm, stable conversion in the field, time interval before refibrillation, inpatient admission, and hospital discharge. VF amplitude was unrelated to response interval or interval to defibrillation but was positively related to bystander CPR. Logistic regression identified VF amplitude as the most important predictor of hospital discharge; traditional variables such as response interval and bystander CPR were not predictive once amplitude had been accounted for. Changes in VF amplitude during the course of resuscitation efforts were frequent and also predictive of outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients in VF who were treated by early countershock refibrillated much more frequently than previously reported.

            "abstract": "Despite well developed emergency medical services with rapid response advanced life support capabilities, survival rates following out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) have remained bleak in many venues. Generally, these poor resuscitation rates are attributed to delays in the performance of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders or delays in defibrillation, but recent laboratory data suggest that the current standard of immediately providing a countershock as the first therapeutic intervention may be detrimental when VF is prolonged beyond several minutes. Several studies now suggest that when myocardial energy supplies begin to dwindle following more prolonged periods of VF, improvements in coronary artery perfusion must first be achieved in order to prime the heart for successful return of spontaneous circulation after defibrillation. Therefore, before countershocks, certain pharmacologic and/or mechanical interventions might take precedence during resuscitative efforts. This evolving concept has been substantiated recently by clinical studies, including a controlled clinical trial, demonstrating a significant improvement in survival when basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation is provided for several minutes before the initial countershock. Although this evolving concept differs from current standards and may pose a potential problem for automated defibrillator initiatives (e.g. public access defibrillation), successful defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation have been rendered more predictable by evolving technologies that can score the VF waveform signal and differentiate between those who can be shocked immediately and those who should receive other interventions first."

Relatively little is known about the performance characteristics of a two-tiered emergency medical services (EMS) system split between fire-based basic life support (BLS) dispersed from fixed locations and hospital-based advanced life support (ALS) dispersed from nonfixed locations. The objectives of this study were to describe the incidence of OOHCA in Denver, Colorado, and to define the prevalence of survival with good neurologic function in the context of this particular EMS system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a retrospective cohort study using standardized abstraction methodology. A two-tiered hospital-based EMS system for the County of Denver and 10 receiving hospitals were studied. Consecutive adult patients who experienced nontraumatic OOHCA from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004, were enrolled. Demographic, prehospital arrest characteristics, treatment data, and survival data using the Utstein template were collected. Good neurologic survival was defined by a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, 1,985 arrests occurred. Of these, 715 (36%) had attempted resuscitation by paramedics and constitute our study sample. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range = 52-78 years), 69% were male, 41% had witnessed arrest, 25% had bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed, and 30% had ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) as their initial rhythm. Of the 715 patients, 545 (76%) were transported to a hospital, 223 (31%) had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 175 (25%) survived to hospital admission, 58 (8%) survived to hospital discharge, and 42 (6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4% to 8%) had a good neurologic outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival in Denver, Colorado, is similar to that of other United States communities. This finding provides the basis for future epidemiologic and health services research in the out-of-hospital and ED settings in our community."

Chest compression may produce passive tidal volumes large enough to provide adequate ventilation in animal studies, but no recent clinical studies have examined this phenomenon.

Median tidal volume per compression was 41.5 ml (range 33.0-62.1 ml), being considerably less than measured deadspace in all patients. Maximum end-tidal CO2 was 0.93 kPa (range 0.0-4.6 kPa). Minute volume CO2 was 19.5 ml (range 15.9-33.8; normal range 150-180 ml).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At an advanced stage of cardiac arrest, passive ventilation during compression-only CPR is limited in its ability to maintain adequate gas exchange, with gas transport mechanisms associated with high frequency ventilation perhaps generating a very limited gas exchange.

            "abstract": "Acoustically-evoked escape behaviors were compared between goldfish (Carassius auratus), a hearing specialist, and the cichlid Haplochromis burtoni, a hearing nonspecialist. Fish were startled with compressive and rarefying, stimuli presented alone or together, and with compressive pulses preceded by a visual cue or after exposure to cobalt, an inhibitor of lateral line-innervated neuromast hair cells. These acoustic startle stimuli can evoke Mauthner neuron firing and are similar to but weaker than those produced by a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) feeding on guppies. When sound stimuli were presented alone, both species avoided the direction of either the compressive or rarefying stimulus. If a light preceded and was contralateral to the compressive sound pulse, goldfish continued to avoid the sound source; cichlids avoided the visual cue and turned toward the sound. Goldfish performance improved significantly when the visual cue was in the same direction as the sound source. Goldfish performance also improved significantly after exposure to 0.1 mmol l-1 cobalt solution for 24 hours before testing, but cichlids would not startle after cobalt acclimation. A compressive pulse presented to one side of a fish simultaneously with a rarefying pulse on the other side causes the entire fish to accelerate with the water current. This strongly and directly accelerates the ear but tends to reduce both the pressure changes transduced by the swimbladder and activation of the mechanosensory lateral line. In this test, goldfish reliably avoided the compressive pulse. Cichlids, however, randomly avoided either speaker polarity but significantly avoided the speaker which had a faster onset. With more closely matched speakers, cichlids also preferentially avoided the compressive stimulus. Thus, the primitive sensory condition for auditory activation and guidance of Mauthner-neuron-initiated escape responses may have evolved to detect the initially compressive sounds associated with ram-type predators."

A total of 4548 cardiac arrests have been registered, 3083 happened outside and 1465 inside the hospital. Evaluation of the methods used for assessment of quality of the CPR techniques revealed that this approach was biased both by the status of the health care provider and by the outcome of the patient. Nevertheless, it was evident that the well-accepted standards and guidelines for CPR and emergency cardiac care (American Heart Association and Safar) are poorly applied. This seems to be influenced by the qualification, the experience and the training level of the health care provider. In 998 of 3053 studies out-of-hospital arrests (33%) CPR was initiated by bystanders. Of these, 59% were bystanding health care workers. They performed external chest compression (ECC) more frequently than mouth-to-mouth insufflation (MOMO) (poor technique: 16-19%). In 18% the rescuers were family members who applied more MOMO than ECC (poor technique: +/- 50%). Laymen (23%) performed more ECC than MOMO (poor technique: +/- 33%). EMT and ward nurses apply mainly the bag-valve-mask technique. The bag-valve-tube technique is more frequently used by nurses of a tiered system.

Sonotomography alone or associated with the pulsed Doppler were selected for this study. The action of the various components (bone, muscle, tendon, vessels and nodes) on the venous system is each region, was analyzed. The overall results have demonstrated two types of compression: a) intermittent, b) permanent. The former is considered as a hemokinetic mechanism, especially at the level of the solar arch and the vena cava ring of the diaphragm. They represent a major element of the pump and the vis-a front respectively. The permanent compression was considered as pathological, and could be related to a venous displacement occurring as an adaptation mechanism to the extrinsic compression. The data obtained in all four regions, have demonstrated that their various components are in a precarious balance, but they do not constitute a true obstacle to the venous return, even if in some postures or respiratory movements they may cause an intermittent venous compression."

Experimental data continue to accumulate indicating that most important within this triad is circulation. Adequate oxygen exists within the blood during at least the first 10 mins of cardiac arrest. If circulation is provided to distribute such oxygen, no survival disadvantage results with chest compression-only basic life support (BLS) efforts. Even a totally occluded airway during the first 6 mins of cardiac arrest does not compromise survival if reasonable circulation is provided with chest compressions. Clinical studies support the same conclusion that what most influences survival in any BLS effort is circulation, not ventilation. Belgium investigators have shown equal survival rates among those treated with chest compressions plus ventilation and those who received chest compressions alone. Telephone dispatcher-guided BLS cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has likewise shown no survival disadvantage to chest compression-only CPR when compared with telephone-guided standard BLS CPR. Based on this reasoning, a new simplified BLS method has been proposed. \"Staged\" CPR consists of a strategy to initially teach laypersons a simplified approach to BLS, which requires only chest compressions and not mouth-to-mouth breathing. \"Bronze\" CPR, in which chest compression-only BLS is taught, was compared with the standard European Resuscitation Council BLS course for laypersons. Manikin \"exit testing\" at course completion has revealed significant advantages of the simplified approach compared with standard CPR courses for the lay public."

            "abstract": "It is unclear why some victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are severely acidotic on arrival to the emergency department (ED), whereas others have a pH within normal limits. To explain the difference among patients, the authors collected data on 119 consecutive out-of-hospital adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest victims brought to the University of Nebraska Medical Center by paramedic rescue squad between December 1982 and January 1984. Patients who experienced restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the field had a normal pH (7.40 +/- 0.13) as compared with the pH of patients still receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on arrival at the ED (7.18 +/- 0.20). A rapid paramedic response time was the best determinant of ROSC and a normal pH on arrival at the ED. Bystander CPR neither significantly increased the number of patients with ROSC in the field nor protected against the development of acidosis, but did improve the neurological outcome of survivors. The presence of acidosis in patients still receiving CPR on arrival in the ED could not be predicted on the basis of paramedic response time, amount of sodium bicarbonate given in the field, whether or not the collapse was witnessed, or whether or not bystander CPR had been performed. Patients who were acidotic had a significantly higher (P less than 0.001) Paco2 (101 +/- 33 mm Hg) and a lower Pao2 (41 +/- 69 mm Hg) than patients with a normal pH (Paco2 37 +/- 10 mm Hg, Pao2 134 +/- 107 mm Hg).

They were allocated to four groups by means of resuscitation. Group A was treated with only precordial compression without the other treatments. In group B with tracheotomy and precordial compression. In group C was performed tracheotomy, oxygenation, and precordial compression. The animals in group D were treated with tracheotomy, oxygen administration, artificial ventilation, and precordial compression. Four minutes after cardiac arrest, the resuscitation was started and continued for 20 min. PaCO(2) in the group without mechanical ventilation increased significantly after the start of the resuscitation. All animals were sacrificed after resuscitation procedure.

A substantial number of humans, however, are struck by this event too early in life with tragic consequences including financial problems for both family and society. A recent review of in-hospital cardiac arrests found a wide variation in the reported survival to discharge ranging from 0% to 28.9% with a mean of 14%1. This is largely explained by underlying diseases. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrests the survival to discharge is similar2, 3. fewer than 3% of cardiac arrest victims leave the hospital alive and return to productive lives. The reasons for these depressing results are multifactorial including rapidity and sequence with which the resuscitation interventions are delivered. Bystander CPR is an important link in \"the chain of survival\" before more advanced interventions will be available at the scene. 4 CPR training programmes for lay people have been organised in many countries with millions of people trained in basic CPR. It is important to continue this education of lay people since at the moment early bystander CPR, besides defibrillation, is probably the single most important intervention. The concept of early activation of the emergency medical System, early basic life support (BLS), including precordial compression and artificial ventilation, early defibrillation, and early advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), could achieve 25-40% survival rates.3 These concepts for emergency cardiac care have been supported by the American Heart Association5 as well as the European Resuscitation Counil.6 Advanced cardiac life support protocols combine pharmacological and mechanical interventions to restore spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and is based on four components: early defibrillation, administration of drugs, ventilation (oxygenation), and circulatory support."

            "abstract": "To determine if hydrophobic surfactant proteins affect the stability of pulmonary surfactant monolayers at an air/water interface, the studies reported here compared the kinetics of collapse for the complete set of lipids in calf surfactant with and without the proteins. Monomolecular films spread at the surface of captive bubbles were compressed at 37 degrees C to surface pressures above 46 mN/m, at which collapse first occurred. The rate of area-compression required to maintain a constant surface pressure was measured to directly determine the rate of collapse. For films with and without the proteins, higher surface pressures initially produced faster collapse, but the rates then reached a maximum and decreased to values <0.04 min(-1) above 53 mN/m. The maximum rate for the lipids with the proteins (1.22 +/- 0.28 min(-1)) was almost twice the value for the lipids alone (0.71 +/- 0.15 min(-1)). Because small increments in surface pressure produced large shifts in the rate close to the fastest collapse, compressions at a series of constant speeds also established the threshold rate required to achieve high surface pressure as an indirect indication of the fastest collapse. Both samples produced a sharply defined threshold that occurred at slightly faster compression with the proteins present, supporting the conclusion of the direct measurements that the proteins produce a faster maximum rate of collapse. Our results indicate that at 47-53 mN/m, the hydrophobic surfactant proteins destabilize the compressed monolayers and tend to limit access to the higher surface pressures at which the lipid films become metastable."

However, direct measurements of intradiscal pressure are too invasive, and force plates too cumbersome for use in the workplace. Electromyographic techniques are noninvasive and portable, but ignore certain inertial forces.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eight men lifted boxes weighing 6.7 and 15.7 kg from the ground, while joint moments acting about L5-S1 were quantified 1) by using a linked-segment model to analyze data from Kistler force plates and a Vicon movement-analysis system, and 2) by measuring the electromyographic activity of the erector spinae muscles, correcting it for contraction speed and comparing it to moment generation during static contractions. The linked-segment model was used to calculate the \"axial thrust,\" defined as the component of the L5-S1 reaction force that acts along the axis of the spine and that is unrelated to trunk muscle activity or static body weight.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Peak extensor moments predicted by the two techniques were similar and equivalent to spinal compressive forces of 2.9-4.8 kN. The axial thrust \"hidden\" from the electromyographic technique was negligible during slow lifts, and remained below 4% of peak spinal compression even during fast heavy lifts. Peak axial thrust was proportional to the peak vertical ground reaction (R2 = 0.74).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Electromyographic techniques can measure dynamic spinal loading, but additional force-plate data would improve accuracy slightly during lifts requiring a vigorous upward thrust from the legs."

Twenty-three mentioned that they frequently were not being appreciated as health care professionals by other health care personnel. Other aspects mentioned were the relationship with colleagues, debriefing, exhaustion, burnout and little management support. Emotions were frequently exposed during the interviews, but emotions and the importance of caring for relatives (defined by the paramedics as the most important part of their work), were not recognized by the organization, which appeared to have a male 'I can cope with everything' culture. This might partly be due to a lack of appreciation by others and partly a way of coping with the stress of their job.

The spine is the second most commonly affected site with PD. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia, when blood is diverted by the so-called \"arterial steal syndrome\". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Since, in the majority of cases with pagetic spinal involvement, there are also coexisting osteoarthritic changes, antipagetic medical treatment alone may be disappointing. Therefore, one must be careful before attributing low back pain to PD alone. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD: bisphosphonates, calcitonins, mithramycin (plicamycin), gallium nitrate, and ipriflavone. Bisphosphonates are the most popular, and several forms have been investigated, but only the following forms have been approved for clinical use: disodium etidronate, clodronate, aledronate, risedronate, neridronate, pamidronate, tiludronate, ibadronate, aminohydroxylbutylidene bisphosphonate, olpadronate, and zoledronate.

Binary monolayers of SP-A plus dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) showed positive deviations from ideal behavior of the mean areas in the films consistent with partial miscibility and interaction between the protein and lipid. During compression of SP-A/DPPC films which contained > or = 5 wt % SP-A, properties were displayed which were consistent with the protein being partially squeezed out at surface pressures of about 30 mN/m. Some protein appeared to remain in the monolayers even when they were compressed to high surface pressures of about 65-70 mN/m, and it was possibly included in the collapse phase(s) that was (were) formed at 72 mN/m. During dynamic cyclic compression-expansion of SP-A/DPPC monolayers initially formed at low surface pressures, SP-A enhanced the respreading of the films compressed beyond collapse compared to the respreading after collapse of films containing DPPC alone. Spread monolayers of SP-A plus either dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) or a mixture of DPPC plus DPPG (7:3, mol/mol) displayed additivity of the mean areas in the films, consistent with complete immiscibility (or ideal miscibility, an unlikely effect) between the protein and lipid components. Electrostatic repulsion between SP-A and DPPG, both negatively charged at physiological pH, possibly governed the behavior of these lipid-protein films. Calcium ions in the subphase did not alter the properties of SP-A/DPPC films, whereas they improved the ability of SP-A to mix with DPPG and DPPC/DPPG. Binding of calcium to the negatively charged DPPG and SP-A may account for association of the protein with DPPG and DPPC/DPPG in the monolayers in the presence of the divalent ions."

Participants' (N = 12) reaction times were longer when both amplitudes and endpoint locations differed than when they were the same. Intermanual amplitude correlations were reduced whenever 1 of the movement parameters differed for the 2 hands; only when cues were presented on the monitor was the amplitude correlation further reduced when both movement parameters were different.

            "abstract": "On a range of elastic and damped surfaces, human hoppers and runners adjust leg mechanics to maintain similar spring-like mechanics of the leg and surface combination. In a previous study of adaptations to damped surfaces, we changed surface damping and stiffness simultaneously to maintain constant surface compression. The current study investigated whether hoppers maintain spring-like mechanics of the leg-surface combination when surface damping alone changes (elastic and 1000-4800 N s m(-1)). We found that hoppers adjusted leg mechanics to maintain similar spring-like mechanics of the leg-surface combination and center of mass dynamics on all surfaces. Over the range of surface damping, vertical stiffness of the leg-surface combination increased by only 12% and center of mass displacement decreased by only 6% despite up to 55% less compression of more heavily damped surfaces. In contrast, a simulation predicted a 44% decrease in vertical displacement with no adjustment to leg mechanics. To compensate for the smaller and slower compression of more heavily damped surfaces, the stance legs compressed by up to 4.1 +/- 0.2 cm further and reached peak compression sooner. To replace energy lost by damped surfaces, hoppers performed additional leg work by extending the legs during takeoff by up to 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm further than they compressed during landing. We conclude that humans simultaneously adjust leg compression magnitude and timing, as well as mechanical work output, to conserve center of mass dynamics on damped surfaces. Runners may use similar strategies on natural energy-dissipating surfaces such as sand, mud and snow."

Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, the use of combined modalities significantly reduced the incidence of DVT (from 4.21% to 0.65%; OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34) but the included studies were underpowered with regard to PE.

Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, combined modalities reduce significantly the incidence of DVT but the effect on PE is unknown. The results of the current review support, especially in high-risk patients, the use of combined modalities. More studies on their role in PE prevention, compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, are urgently needed."

The NSF also set standards for pre-hospital treatment and response times. To increase the flexibility of Utstein, an 'event tree' technique is proposed as an audit tool. Event trees consist of nodes and branches on which numbers, percentages or probability values are entered.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using the London Ambulance Service's (LAS) 1997 database on 3,759 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 2,772 arrests witnessed by lay bystanders or unwitnessed were analysed focusing on bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) and response times.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Utstein template showed that witnessed arrests in ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) who had received BCPR achieved a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the field significantly more often than non-BCPR recipients-26 versus 16% (P=0.006). But the likelihood of being admitted to a hospital bed, and discharged alive, was only marginally better for BCPR recipients. To examine the influence of BCPR on the presenting rhythm an event tree showed that in 48% of witnessed BCPR cases the presenting rhythm was VF/VT, whereas, for witnessed non-BCPR cases, 27% were in VF/VT (P<0.0001). With unwitnessed arrests, 31% of BCPR cases were in VF/VT compared with 18% for non-BCPR cases (P<0.0001). Call to scene time was less than 8 min for 66% of all VF/VT arrests.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The event trees, when combined with the Utstein template, demonstrated the importance of examining comprehensively datasets for both witnessed and unwitnessed cardiac arrests when monitoring performance standards.

Seventy-seven had single disc lesion, 57 had the two and 6 had three disc lesions. The most frequent involvement was of C 5/6 in 107 cases (51.2%). The next was of C 6/7 in 50 cases (23.9%) and the third was of C 4/5 in 36 (17.2%). Primarily herniated discs were classified into soft or hard disc. The soft discs were classified into medial, mediolateral and lateral type according to the direction of the protrusion of the disc. Each of the three types indicates that herniated disc compresses the median portion of the cord, lateral part of the cord and root simultaneously and root alone, respectively. The hard discs were classified into central, bilateral and unilateral types. The central type means the case in which the cord was compressed by the centromedian part of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. The unilateral and bilateral type indicate that lateral portion of the cord and root were simultaneously compressed by the disc unilaterally or bilaterally. The other one was combined type. The combined type is that which belongs neither of the types noted above. In the soft disc group there were 37 cases (17.7%) of medial type, 28 (12.4%) of mediolateral and 8 (3.8%) of lateral type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

According to the experimental data, samples of stone to plaster in the ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:4 gave an increased compressive strength of 10.3 MPa compared with the strength of plaster alone (8.3 MPa), possibly because of the low amounts of dental stone in the mix. The lowest amount of heat generated (lowest setting temperature) was recorded by the samples made with the ratio of stone/plaster equal to 1:1, which gave a setting temperature of 43 degrees C.

Most bystanders who admit such reluctance concede that fear of contagious disease from mouth-to-mouth contact is what keeps them from performing basic life support. Animal models of prehospital cardiac arrest indicates that 24-h survival is essentially as good with chest compression-only CPR as with chest compressions and assisted ventilation. This simpler technique is an attractive alternative strategy for encouraging more bystander participation. Such experimental studies have been criticized as irrelevant however secondary to differences between human and porcine airway mechanics. This study examined the effect of chest compression-only CPR under the worst possible circumstances where the airway was totally occluded. After 6 min of either standard CPR including ventilation with a patent airway or chest compressions-only with a totally occluded airway, no difference in 24 h survival was found (10/10 vs. 9/10). As anticipated arterial blood gases were not as good, but hemodynamics produced were better with chest compression-only CPR (P < 0.05). Chest compression-only CPR, even with a totally occluded airway, is as good as standard CPR for successful outcome following 6.5 min of cardiac arrest. Such a strategy for the first minutes of cardiac arrest, particularly before professional help arrives, has several advantages including increased acceptability to the lay public."

            "abstract": "The immediate delivery of bystander-administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), coupled with the rapid delivery of advanced cardiac life support, can significantly reduce mortality from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Because the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occur in the victim's home with family members present, family members of cardiac patients at high risk for sudden death are the logical focus of CPR training. However, previous research has shown that only a small minority of family members of cardiac patients actually learn CPR and that health care professionals have failed to recommend CPR training in this population, in part due to concerns about their ability to learn CPR. The purpose of this study was to describe learning capabilities in this population and to identify characteristics of unsuccessful learners. To this end, we taught CPR to 83 family members of cardiac patients who were at risk for sudden cardiac death. Subjects had no CPR training within the past two years. Eighty-one percent of the subjects successfully learned CPR. Of the demographic and psychological characteristics examined, only gender, age, and depression were significant in explaining differences in CPR skills attainment ability. The elderly, the depressed, and males were more likely to be unsuccessful in demonstrating adequate CPR skills. Our results suggest that the majority of family members of cardiac patients can learn CPR successfully. Specific training strategies may need to be developed and tested to enhance CPR training in those family members of cardiac patients predicted to have difficulty learning CPR."

Logistic regression revealed factors that were independently associated with survival: witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, method of CPR, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, and shorter EMS response time interval. There was no significant association between transport interval and outcome in either the overall study group (OR=1.2; 0.77, 1.8) or in the comatose, ROSC subgroup (OR 0.94; 0.51, 1.8).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Survival was not significantly impacted by transport interval.

The wound was cleaned topically and the patient was given antibacterial therapy. Five weeks later, in Canada, she presented with an ulcer at the injury site. An excisional biopsy showed copious broad, septate, melanized fungal filaments penetrating into tissue. Culture yielded a nonsporulating melanized mycelium. The isolate was strongly inhibited by cycloheximide and benomyl but grew at 37 degrees C. After 16 weeks cultivation on modified Leonian's agar at 25 degrees C, it developed pycnidia characteristic of Lasiodiplodia theobromae, a common tropical phytopathogen mainly known previously as a rare agent of keratitis and onychomycosis in humans. The patient was not given antifungal chemotherapy, and the ulcer, which had been broadly excised in the biopsy procedure, ultimately resolved after treatment with saline compresses. The six-month follow-up showed no sign of infection. This case, interpreted in light of previously reported cases, shows that on rare occasions L. theobromae is able to act as an agent of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis and that, when this occurs, debridement alone may be sufficient to eradicate it."

            "abstract": "Arm lymphedema after breast cancer therapy has been treated with various forms of conservative and surgical treatment during recent years. The clinical results usually have been modest or, in some instances, even disappointing. In a previous series of patients treated with the new liposuction technique combined with controlled compression therapy, we found, however, an overall edema reduction of 106 percent after 1 year. The purpose of this study was both to investigate how much the surgical procedure contributes to the outcome and to clarify the importance of controlled compression therapy. Twenty-eight patients were, therefore, prospectively matched into two groups. One group received liposuction combined with controlled compression therapy, and one group received the therapy alone. Additionally, the therapy group was compared with our complete group of patients treated thus far with liposuction combined with therapy (n = 30). The prospective study using matched pairs (n = 14) showed that liposuction combined with controlled compression therapy is significantly more effective than the therapy alone (p < 0.0001), with a mean difference of about 1000 ml during the entire 1-year observation period. The beneficial effect of liposuction was confirmed by the comparison between the controlled compression therapy group and our complete group of patients treated with liposuction combined with the therapy, as the edema reduction figures after 1 year were 47 percent and 104 percent, respectively (p < 0.0001). In six patients who had surgery and a complete reduction of the edema, the compression garments were removed for 1 week, 1 year postoperatively. A marked increase in the arm volume was observed, which was immediately remedied by reapplying the garments. We conclude that liposuction combined with controlled compression therapy reduces arm lymphedema more efficiently than the therapy alone. Continued use of compression garments is, however, important to maintain the primary surgical outcome."

A prospective international cohort study was performed that included 571 infants, children and adults (a) who experienced cardiac arrest requiring chest compressions or external defibrillation, (b) outside the hospital in the study communities and (c) upon whom resuscitation was attempted by EMS personnel. Cardiac arrest was defined as lack of responsiveness, breathing or movement in individuals for whom the EMS system is activated for whom an arrest record is completed. All data were collated via a secure and confidential web-based method by using automated forms processing software with appropriate variable range checks, logic checks and skip rules. Median number of missing responses for each variable was 0 (interquartile range 0, 0). Twenty-seven percent of the patients had a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, 60% had a witnessed arrest, and 34% received bystander CPR. Mean time from call to arrival on scene was 7.1+/-5.1 min. Six percent of the patients survived to hospital discharge. The resuscitation process was highly variable across centers, and survival and neurological outcome were also significantly and independently different across centers. This study shows that it is possible to collect data prospectively describing the structure, process and outcome associated with cardiac arrest in multiple international sites via the internet. Therefore, it is feasible to conduct adequately powered randomized trials of resuscitation therapies in international settings."

The sequential PDL-Nd:YAG laser seems to be an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of cutaneous venous malformations.

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to obtain an amorphous system with minimum unit operations that will prevent recrystallization of amorphous drugs since preparation, during processing (compression) and further storage. Amorphous celecoxib, solid dispersion (SD) of celecoxib with polyvinyl pyrrollidone (PVP) and co-precipitate with PVP and carrageenan (CAR) in different ratios were prepared by the spray drying technique and compressed into tablets. Saturation solubility and dissolution studies were performed to differentiate performance after processing. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder difraction revealed the amorphous form of celecoxib, whereas infrared spectroscopy revealed hydrogen bonding between celecoxib and PVP. The dissolution profile of the solid dispersion and co-precipitate improved compared to celecoxib and amorphous celecoxib. Amorphous celecoxib was not stable on storage whereas the solid dispersion and co-precipitate powders were stable for 3 months. Tablets of the solid dispersion of celecoxib with PVP and physical mixture with PVP and carrageenan showed better resistance to recrystallization than amorphous celecoxib during compression but recrystallized on storage. However, tablets of co-precipitate with PVP and carageenan showed no evidence of crystallinity during stability studies with comparable dissolution profiles. This extraordinary stability of spray-dried co-precipitate tablets may be attributed to the cushioning action provided by the viscoelastic polymer CAR and hydrogen bonding interaction between celecoxib and PVP. The present study demonstrates the synergistic effect of combining two types of stabilizers, PVP and CAR, on the stability of amorphous drug during compression and storage as compared to their effect when used alone."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the compression behaviour and tablet-forming ability of spray-dried amorphous two- and three-component composite particles. Particles of lactose alone, two-component particles of lactose and PVP, and three-component particles of lactose, PVP and a small amount of polysorbate 80 were prepared by spray-drying. Two qualities of PVP with different molecular weights were used for the preparation of both types of particles. The particles were characterised with respect to permeametry surface area, moisture content, particle and bulk density, glass transition and crystallisation temperature, and heat of crystallisation. The tablet tensile strength of the different particles formed at a series of applied pressures was determined and compression parameters were derived from the Heckel and Kawakita equations. The presence of PVP gave particles that were less prone to deform permanently during compression while the presence of surfactant gave particles that were less able to form tablets. In conclusion, the compression behaviour and tablet-forming ability of spray-dried amorphous lactose can be modulated by the addition of stabilising polymers or surfactants to the spray feed solution."

            "abstract": "The spiral structure of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis (Nordst.) Gomont was previously found to be altered by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm). However, how photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and UVR interact in regulating this morphological change remains unknown. Here, we show that the spiral structure of A. platensis (D-0083) was compressed under PAR alone at 30 degrees C, but that at 20 degrees C, the spirals compressed only when exposed to PAR with added UVR, and that UVR alone (the PAR was filtered out) did not tighten the spiral structure, although its presence accelerated morphological regulation by PAR. Their helix pitch decreased linearly as the cells received increased PAR doses, and was reversible when they were transferred back to low PAR levels. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a 52.0 kDa periplasmic protein was more abundant in tighter filaments, which may have been responsible for the spiral compression. This spiral change together with the increased abundance of the protein made the cells more resistant to high PAR as well as UVR, resulting in a higher photochemical yield."

Different bioreactor loading conditions were simulated within the scaffold. In vitro perfusion conditions were reproduced in the model. Dynamic compression was also reproduced in an uncoupled fluid-structure scheme: deformation level was studied analyzing the mechanical response of scaffold alone under static compression while strain rate was studied considering the fluid flow induced by compression through fixed scaffold. Results of the model show that during perfusion test an inlet velocity of 25 microm/s generates on scaffold surface a fluid flow shear stress which may stimulate osteogenesis. Dynamic compression of 5% applied on the PLA-Glass scaffold with a strain rate of 0.005 s(-1) has the benefit to generate mechanical stimuli based on both solid shear strain and fluid flow shear stress on large scaffold surface area. Values of perfusion inlet velocity or compression strain rate one order of magnitude lower may promote cell proliferation while values one order of magnitude higher may be detrimental for cells. FEM-CFD scaffold models may help to determine loading conditions promoting bone formation and to interpret experimental results from a mechanical point of view."

Treatment with Graftskin was more effective than compression alone as measured by time to complete wound closure and frequency of complete wound closure by 6 months. When applied to hard-to-heal wounds (> 1 year's duration), Graftskin was 3 times more effective than compression therapy alone in achieving complete wound closure at 8 weeks (32% vs 10%, P = .008) and 2 times more effective by 24 weeks (47% vs 19%, P = .002).

The benefits are generally assumed to relate to the immediate provision of limited coronary perfusion with protection or replenishment of myocardial metabolic reserves. In this paper we argue that the concept is inadequate to explain many experimental and clinical observations made during resuscitation attempts. We argue that changes in the size and shape of the ventricles are the most important reason for the narrow window of opportunity for defibrillation alone and for the value of compressions in extending this period. We also draw attention to the implication for clinical resuscitation and to one aspect of the current guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council that we believe to be inconsistent with the evidence that we review."

FSC alone provides algorithmic instruction. Random and Ordered Sequence Complexities lie at opposite ends of the same bi-directional sequence complexity vector. Randomness in sequence space is defined by a lack of Kolmogorov algorithmic compressibility. A sequence is compressible because it contains redundant order and patterns. Law-like cause-and-effect determinism produces highly compressible order. Such forced ordering precludes both information retention and freedom of selection so critical to algorithmic programming and control. Functional Sequence Complexity requires this added programming dimension of uncoerced selection at successive decision nodes in the string. Shannon information theory measures the relative degrees of RSC and OSC. Shannon information theory cannot measure FSC. FSC is invariably associated with all forms of complex biofunction, including biochemical pathways, cycles, positive and negative feedback regulation, and homeostatic metabolism. The algorithmic programming of FSC, not merely its aperiodicity, accounts for biological organization. No empirical evidence exists of either RSC of OSC ever having produced a single instance of sophisticated biological organization. Organization invariably manifests FSC rather than successive random events (RSC) or low-informational self-ordering phenomena (OSC)."

Many treatment methods have been applied alone or in combination, including surgical excision, steroid injection, compression, radiation, topical silicone application, and so on. Although each modality or combined therapy has its advantages and disadvantages, in the authors' opinion, compressive therapy combined with surgical excision is the most effective method in many respects. However, the peculiar shape of the earlobe does not allow for easy compression. Thus, many compressive devices have been developed that are not wholly satisfactory in terms of effectiveness, appearance, size, or convenience. The authors describe a newly developed method for the treatment of hypertrophic scarring of the earlobe that uses magnetic disks. They treated 47 patients (91 auricles) with a hypertrophic scar on the earlobe that underwent compressive therapy using magnetic disks after surgical excision from April to December 2002.

The overall average response time was 6.1 +/- 3.2 min. Sixty percent of the patients were witnessed arrests and 65% had bystander initiated CPR. Forty-six percent of the patients had a cardiac history: myocardial infarction 13%, CHF 11% and other 21%. Other pertinent past medical history included diabetes 15%, COPD 10% and seizures 3%. The average age was 69.8 +/- 13.7 years. Fifty-seven percent were male. Forty-three percent were on cardiac medication including: digoxin, 24%; nitroglycerin, 12%; potassium supplements, 9%; propranolol, 8%; isordil, 6%; quinidine, 3%; nitropaste, 3%; and other cardiac medications, 15%. One hundred forty-eight (29%) patients developed a pulse at some time during resuscitative efforts, of these 17 (3.4%) patients responded with a pulse immediately after intubation. The mean time of resuscitation to sustaining pulse was 20 +/- 11 min and the mean resuscitation time to sustaining pressure was 22 +/- 11 min. Nineteen percent were successfully resuscitated, defined as a conveyance of a patient with a pulse and a rhythm to an emergency department. Four point four percent were saved, defined as a patient discharged alive from the hospital. Approximately 53% of the successfully resuscitated patients and 45% of the save patients were determined to have a probable respiratory event as the primary etiology of their arrest. This study attempts to provide some insight into the demographic profile of the patients in EMD."

A structured telephone interview of adult cardiac-arrest bystanders was performed beginning two weeks after the incident. Elements gathered during interviews included bystander and patient demographics, identifying whether the bystander was CPR trained, when and by whom the CPR was performed, and describing the circumstances of the event. If CPR was not performed, we asked the bystanders why CPR was not performed. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with CPR performance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 868 cardiac arrests, 684 (78.1%) bystander interviews were completed. Of all bystanders interviewed, 69.6% were family members of the victims, 36.8% of the bystanders had more than a high-school education, and 54.1% had been taught CPR at some time. In 21.2% of patients, the bystander immediately started CPR, and in 33.6% of cases, someone started CPR before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS). Important overall predictors of CPR performance were the following: witnessed arrest (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.8); bystander was CPR trained (OR = 6.6; 95% CI = 3.5 to 12.5); bystander had more than a high-school education (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.1), or arrest occurred in a public location (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.7 to 5.8). These variables were significant predictors of CPR performance among CPR-trained bystanders, as was CPR training within five years (OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 2.8 to 7.3). Common reasons that the CPR-trained bystanders cited for not performing CPR were the following: 37.5% stated that they panicked, 9.1% perceived that they would not be able to do CPR correctly, and 1.1% thought that they would hurt the patient. Surprisingly, only 1.1% objected to performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A minority of CPR-trained bystanders performed CPR. CPR provision was more common in CPR-trained bystanders with more than a high-school education and when CPR training had been within five years. Previously espoused reasons for not doing CPR (mouth-to-mouth, infectious-disease risk) were not the reasons that bystanders cited for not doing CPR. Further work is needed to maximize CPR provision after CPR training."

However, due to their different physiology, it is unclear if all elders, or any subsets of elders who are OHCA victims, would benefit from the CCR protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objectives of this analysis were to compare survival by age group for patients receiving CCR and ALS, to evaluate their neurologic outcome, and to determine what other factors affect survival in the subset of patients who do receive CCR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An analysis was performed of 3,515 OHCAs occurring between January 2005 and September 2008 in the Save Hearts in Arizona Registry. A total of 1,024 of these patients received CCR. Pediatric patients and arrests due to drowning, respiratory, or traumatic causes were excluded. The registry included data from 62 EMS agencies, some of which instituted CCR. Outcome measures included survival to hospital discharge and cerebral performance category (CPC) scores. Logistic regression evaluated outcomes in patients who received CCR versus standard ALS across age groups, adjusted for known potential confounders, including bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), witnessed arrest, EMS dispatch-to-arrival time, ventricular fibrillation (Vfib), and agonal respirations on EMS arrival. Predictors of survival evaluated included age, sex, location, bystander CPR, witnessed arrest, Vfib/ventricular tachycardia (Vtach), response time, and agonal breathing, based on bivariate results. Backward stepwise selection was used to confirm predictors of survival. These predictors were then analyzed with logistic regression by age category per 10 years of age.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Individuals who received CCR had better outcomes across age groups. The increase in survival for the subgroup with a witnessed Vfib was most prominent on those<40 years of age (3.7% for standard ALS patients vs. 19% for CCR patients, odds ratio [OR]=5.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.82 to 19.26). This mortality benefit declined with age until the >or=80 years age group, which regained the benefit (1.8% vs. 4.6%, OR=2.56, 95% CI=1.10 to 5.97). Neurologic outcomes were also better in the patients who received CCR (OR=6.64, 95% CI=1.31 to 32.8). Within the subgroup that received CCR, the factors most predictive of improved survival included witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of Vfib/Vtach, agonal respirations upon arrival, EMS response time, and age. Neurologic outcome was not adversely affected by age.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cardiocerebral resuscitation is associated with better survival from OHCA in most age groups. The majority of patients in all age groups who survived to hospital discharge and who could be reached for follow-up had good neurologic outcome.

            "abstract": "Neurologic compression is a disastrous consequence for the patients with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the spine, and such a condition has not been carefully taken into account in the treatment guidelines. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone or combined with surgical decompression on primary NHL of the spine with neurologic compression. Sixteen patients with primary NHL in the vertebrae of the spine were treated between 1994 and 2006. Thirteen patients had neurologic compression. The neurologic deficits in 11 patients involved soft tissue extension from the vertebral tumors and 3 had vertebral fractures with motor signs and 5 had radicular pain. Five patients were treated by radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone while 8 were combined with surgical decompression. The decompression operation for tumors resulted in neurologic recovery in 6 patients. Five patients were not operated on but three received emergent radiotherapy before chemotherapy, 4 of whom had complete recovery in their neurologic symptoms. Of all patients, 3 relapsed. At average follow-up of 61.5 months (range 2-156 months), 4 patients had died after an average interval of 23.3 months from treatment (range 3-71 months). The 5-year overall survival rate was 82% with 60% for the patients in the surgical group, 100% for the patients in the non-surgical group. There was no difference between the groups (chi(2)=3.559, P=0.059). The 5-year overall survival was 100% for the 8 patients who completed CHOP chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It appears that optimum treatment in these patients depends on the cause of the neurologic deficits, whereas the survival is not influenced by the surgical or non-surgical treatment. The results suggest that chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone is the ideal treatment for these patients whose neurologic compression was only due to soft tissue extension. The authors emphasize the importance of chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgical decompression depending on individual priorities in the indications for operation on primary NHL of spine with neurologic compression."

There were numerous interactions between these variables. Being conscious at the time of the arrival of the ambulance crew and subsequently having cardiac arrest strongly predicted survival, as did both the presence of a witness to the arrest and the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by a bystander; this latter effect was a marker for early CPR.

The first was a retrospective analysis of consecutive confirmed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests from the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center text files to determine the presence of gasping soon after collapse. The second was a retrospective analysis of 1218 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Arizona documented by emergency medical system (EMS) first-care reports to determine the incidence of gasping after arrest in relation to the various EMS arrival times. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. An analysis of the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center records of witnessed and unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with attempted resuscitation found that 44 of 113 (39%) of all arrested patients had gasping. An analysis of 1218 EMS-attended, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests demonstrated that the presence or absence of gasping correlated with EMS arrival time. Gasping was present in 39 of 119 patients (33%) who arrested after EMS arrival, in 73 of 363 (20%) when EMS arrival was <7 minutes, in 50 of 360 (14%) when EMS arrival time was 7 to 9 minutes, and in 25 of 338 (7%) when EMS arrival time was >9 minutes.

            "abstract": "Bipolar vessel sealing is pivotal in laparoscopic hemostasis. However, major coaptive desiccation parameters have yet to be investigated in detail. The current investigation aims to study the impact of compressive pressure, thermal conduction, and electrical current effects on seal quality in a randomized, controlled experimental trial in an in vitro porcine model of vessel sealing. A total of 106 porcine vessels were sealed with either bipolar current or thermal conduction. Compressive pressure on the sealing site and maximum temperature were varied and monitored. Additionally, the longitudinal vessel tension was measured. The burst pressure of the resulting seal was determined as an indicator of seal quality. In bipolar coaptation, seal quality depends on the compressive pressure applied to the coagulation site in both arteries and veins. The optimal pressure interval was around 270 mN/mm2 for arteries and 200 mN/mm2 for veins. Deviation from these optimal pressures towards low and high extremes led to significantly fewer successful seals. We also found that both maximum coaptation temperature and vessel shrinking correlated with the seal quality. This correlation was reciprocal in arteries and veins. Thermal conduction alone was less successful than sealing by bipolar current. Therefore, compressive pressure during coaptation determines the seal quality. Upper and lower pressure boundaries for safe coaptation exist for both arteries and veins. Vessel sealing by thermal conduction without electrical current effects is possible but represents a less effective method for coaptation. These findings have implications for the rational design of new electrosurgical instruments."

The suitable agitator speed, temperature, and mixing time were found to be 1,500 rpm, 25 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C, and 20 min, respectively. In addition, suitable stirring time when the phase partition process of IPs began was 15 min. IPs obtained from these conditions were small and round, approximately 1 mm; surface determination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the IPs were composed of drug microcrystals rearranged on the surface. For the dissolution, IPs showed lower drug release when compared with pure ibuprofen crystal (IC) (f2 analysis). An attempt to modify the dissolution property of IP by incorporating various concentrations of Aerosil and Tween 80 in the binding solvent was made. Microscopic appearance showed that both Aerosil and Tween 80 gave less spherical pellets when compared with the use of binding solvent alone. For both the Aerosil and Tween 80 employed, the results indicated a change in rearrangement of drug microcrystals and a change in crystal habit. However, Tween 80 gave more change of the crystallographic direction of drug microcrystals than Aerosil. In term of dissolution, the results showed that employing Tween 80 at 1.2% gave the highest drug release compared to the use of Aerosil and IC alone (f2 analysis). These pellets had a good flow property, as indicated by Carr's compressibility, flow rate, and angle of repose, and they can be compressed into a tablet, encapsulated by suitable polymer, or pulverized to obtain micronized crystals.

            "title": "Motion sharpening and contrast: gain control precedes compressive non-linearity?",
            "abstract": "Blurred edges appear sharper in motion than when they are stationary. We (Vision Research 38 (1998) 2108) have previously shown how such distortions in perceived edge blur may be accounted for by a model which assumes that luminance contrast is encoded by a local contrast transducer whose response becomes progressively more compressive as speed increases. If the form of the transducer is fixed (independent of contrast) for a given speed, then a strong prediction of the model is that motion sharpening should increase with increasing contrast. We measured the sharpening of periodic patterns over a large range of contrasts, blur widths and speeds. The results indicate that whilst sharpening increases with speed it is practically invariant with contrast. The contrast invariance of motion sharpening is not explained by an early, static compressive non-linearity alone. However, several alternative explanations are also inconsistent with these results. We show that if a dynamic contrast gain control precedes the static non-linear transducer then motion sharpening, its speed dependence, and its invariance with contrast, can be predicted with reasonable accuracy."

Few large studies have described the occurrence, mechanism, resuscitation viability and outcome of this substantial subset of the cardiac arrest population. By documenting over 3000 cardiac arrests in young people we sought to improve understanding, awareness and ultimately survival of a condition notorious for high mortality rates.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Data were analysed for 3084 young cardiac arrest patients and reported retrospectively. Patients were categorised by age, gender, aetiology and whether or not resuscitation attempts were made. Over 75% of patients were aged 18-35 years. There were significantly more males in this age group (p<0.001) compared to those aged 17 years or less. The most common cause of cardiac arrest was an underlying cardiac cause (44.9%). Overdoses, hanging and other suicides were found to be major causes of cardiac arrests of non-cardiac origin in young adult males. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was the most common known cause of death in infants aged less than 1 year. This age group received bystander CPR most often. 5.6% of young cardiac arrest patients who were taken to hospital survived to hospital discharge.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Mortality in young cardiac arrest patients remains high.

Verapamil hydrochloride 1-layer matrix tablets containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, tragacanth, and acacia either alone or mixed were prepared by direct compression technique. 3-layer matrix tablets were prepared by compressing the polymers as release retardant layers on both sides of the core containing the drug. The prepared tablets were subjected to in vitro drug release studies. Tragacanth when used as the carrier in the formulation of 1- and 3-layer matrices produced satisfactory release prolongation either alone or in combination with the other 2 polymers. On the other hand, acacia did not show enough prolonging efficiency in 1- and 3-layer matrix tablets. The results also showed that the location of the polymers in the 3-layer tablets has a pronounced effect on the drug release. Kinetic analysis of drug release from matrices exhibiting sustained release indicated that release was predominantly attributable to the contribution made by Fickian diffusion, while the erosion/relaxation mechanisms had a minor role in the release."

We have calculated such effects for spectrally simple model systems and also, to the extent possible, for real systems such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and nitrocellulose (NC). We have utilized angle-dependent infrared (IR) reflectometry to obtain the ambient spectral complex index for PMMA and NC for use in the calculations and to interpret experiments. A number of counter-intuitive spectral effects are observed versus film thickness and during uniaxial shock compression: absorption band shifts, changes of shape, and changes in both absolute and relative peak intensities. The film thickness effects can be predicted by thin film interference alone, while additional assumptions are required to predict the effects due to shock compression. Since it is very difficult to obtain the complex index in the shock state, we made very simple assumptions regarding the change in vibrational spectra upon shock load-ing. We illustrate general thin film interference effects that could be expected and compare them to experimental results for the antisymmetric NO2 stretch mode of NC."

            "abstract": "Every year more than a million cardiac arrests are documented in the industrialised nations of the world, with the majority occurring in settings outside hospital. A major factor in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is early institution of bystander resuscitation efforts. Sadly, the majority of OHCAs do not receive bystander resuscitation for a variety of reasons. One of them is the requirement for mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. The 2008 American Heart Association recommendation for \"hands only\" or continuous chest compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for untrained lay people was a welcome change. However, evidence indicates that MTM and other forms of positive pressure ventilation should be eliminated for all bystanders responding to primary cardiac arrest (unexpected witnessed collapse in an unresponsive person). The requirement for MTM ventilation may well be indicated for patients with respiratory arrest but is detrimental during early resuscitation efforts by anyone providing CPR to patients with primary cardiac arrest. This article provides rationale for continuous chest compression CPR by all bystanders."

Upon decision to treat, patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were allocated to ACD CPR (CardioPump) or standard CPR by drawing a random number tag. Outcome in each patient was determined on a 5 point ordinal scale (no clinical improvement = 1, survival to discharge = 5). In 4 years, CPR was attempted in a total of 431 cardiac arrests, 54 patients (13%) survived to discharge; 302 patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomised. The prevalence of bystander CPR was 57% and the median call-arrival interval 9 min. By intention to treat, the mean score in the standard CPR group was 2.51 and 17/145 patients (12%) survived.

Because of the rapid demise of the majority of cancer patients with metastatic disease, oncology drug development must follow a much different paradigm than therapeutic candidates for less onerous diseases. The majority of drug candidates in development today are targeted at cancer therapy. Many of these candidate chemotherapeutic agents are active against novel targets, often presenting unique toxicological profiles. Since many of these novel targets are not unique to cancer cells, therapeutic margins may not exist. Decision making, in this event, is among the most challenging that any pharmaceutical toxicologist/pathologist or regulator will face. Nonclinical development scientists must compress timelines to present therapeutic options for cancer patients who have failed conventional therapy. In support of this goal, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration has created an oncology-specific paradigm for nonclinical testing and has introduced strategies to accelerate development and approval of successful candidates. Pharmaceutical toxicology testing strategies must not only satisfy regulation as the minimal expectation, but also attempt to reduce the current high attrition rates for oncologic candidates. A successful toxicology testing strategy represents the substance of this treatise."

Solar UVR broke the spiral filaments of A. platensis exposed to full solar radiation in short-term low-cell-density cultures. This breakage was observed after 2 h for the indoor strain but after 4 to 6 h for the outdoor strain. Filament breakage also occurred in the cultures exposed to PAR alone; however, the extent of breakage was less than that observed for filaments exposed to full solar radiation. The spiral filaments broke and compressed when high-cell-density cultures were exposed to full solar radiation during long-term experiments. When UV-B was screened off, the filaments initially broke, but they elongated and became loosely arranged later (i.e., there were fewer spirals per unit of filament length). When UVR was filtered out, the spiral structure hardly broke or became looser. Photosynthetic O(2) evolution in the presence of UVR was significantly suppressed in the indoor strain compared to the outdoor strain. UVR-induced inhibition increased with exposure time, and it was significantly lower in the outdoor strain. The concentration of UV-absorbing compounds was low in both strains, and there was no significant change in the amount regardless of the radiation treatment, suggesting that these compounds were not effectively used as protection against solar UVR. Self-shading, on the other hand, produced by compression of the spirals over adaptive time scales, seems to play an important role in protecting this species against deleterious UVR. Our findings suggest that the increase in UV-B irradiance due to ozone depletion not only might affect photosynthesis but also might alter the morphological development of filamentous cyanobacteria during acclimation or over adaptive time scales."

Isothermal compression can reduce the translational order of fluids that exhibit anomalous waterlike trends in their thermodynamic and transport properties, while isochoric cooling (or strengthening of attractive interactions) can have a similar effect on fluids of particles with short-range attractions. Recent simulation studies by Yan [Phys. Rev. E 76, 051201 (2007)] on the former type of system and Krekelberg [J. Chem.

Here, we confirm the generality of this microscopic picture through analysis, via molecular simulation and integral equation theory, of coordination shell contributions to the two-body excess entropy for several related model fluids which incorporate different levels of molecular resolution. The results suggest that integral equation theory can be an effective and computationally inexpensive tool for assessing, based on the pair potential alone, whether new model systems are good candidates for exhibiting structural (and hence thermodynamic and transport) anomalies."

In concordance with the MIS principles, the new implants, such as the locking compression plate, and the less invasive stabilization system were well designed and put into clinical practice so as to provide effective therapeutic results in treating osteoporotic fractures and complicated articular and/or metaphyseal fractures. In treatment of the delayed union or non-union of fractures, more effective techniques were employed, including the application of bone substitutes, which are degradable and have properties of bone conduction and induction. In the repair of segmental defects of the long tubular bone, the bone transport and the vascularized bone grafts could work well. The investigation of the bone engineering revealed its great potentiality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Fracture of the extremities is a common problem and its management should emphasize the recovery of the extremity function of the patient in addition to emphasis on the replacement and fixation of the biological structures. The combination of bone engineering and microsurgery represents the development tendency in this field."

            "abstract": "Current Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines and emergency medical services (EMS) clinical protocols usually recommend immediate defibrillation for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who have ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, animal studies and results from a small number of clinical investigations now suggest that a short period of chest compressions or ACLS procedures delivered before defibrillation may improve the outcome of patients with prolonged VF. Although the basic science and clinical data supporting a chest-compression-first procedure are compelling, large, multicenter randomized trials are still necessary to determine whether such protocols do indeed improve outcome. In current EMS dispatch practice, traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructions are given when needed to bystanders who report a possible cardiac arrest. Recent literature has shown that in certain circumstances, CPR instructions involving chest compressions alone may be given more quickly and can yield an equivalent, if not better, chance of survival. Although this practice is controversial, the general consensus is that any CPR is better than none at all. Therefore, telephone CPR protocols that recommend the immediate initiation of chest compressions may be preferred, particularly for callers who have no previous training in CPR."

Exclusion criteria were prior CPR training or physical incapacity. A cardiac arrest scenario was presented to subjects who were then provided with one of two sets of telephone CPR instructions by a mock 911 dispatcher. One group received traditional CPR instructions (TCPR) and the second group received compression only CPR instructions (COCPR). Subjects performed CPR on a Laerdal Resusci-Anne CPR manikin and recording strips were analyzed for frequency and quality measures. Pre-and post-test questionnaires assessed subject fatigue and telephone instruction understanding. The primary outcome was the time interval from 911 call to initiation of chest compressions.

In this study, the origin of stereocomplexation in a polylactide enantiomeric monolayer at the air-water interface was investigated using PA-IRRAS. PA-IRRAS was used as a probe to follow the real-time conformational changes associated with intermolecular interactions of polymer chains during the compression of the monolayers. It was found that a mixture of poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) and poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) (D/L) formed a stereocomplex when the two-dimensional monolayer developed at the air-water interface before film compression, indicating that there is no direct correlation between film compression and stereocomplexation. PA-IRRAS spectra of the stereocomplex exhibited distinct band shifts in crystalline sensitive components, e.g., the vas(C-O-C, h) mode, as well as amorphous-dependent components, e.g., the vs(C-O-C) mode, when compared with the spectra of PLLA alone. On the other hand, time-resolved PA-IRRAS spectra, which were obtained as the films were being compressed, revealed that both monolayers of PLLA and mixed PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex were crystallized into a 10(3)-helix and a 3(1)-helix, respectively, with a distinct band shift in crystalline sensitive components only. Fourier self-deconvolution of the spectra demonstrated that the band shift in crystalline sensitive components is correlated with the intermolecular interaction of polymer chains."

Cases with the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were followed up until discharged from hospital. The information gathered included age, sex, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, response time (time elapsed from receiving the call to arrival on the scene), advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) time (time elapsed from receiving the call to arrival at the ED), initial cardiac rhythm in the ED, ROSC, survival to discharge from the hospital, underlying disease, past history, personal history, and neurological outcome at discharge. Of 638 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 554 (86.7%) were nontraumatic. Response time, ACLS time, ROSC rates, and survival rates were 7.4 minutes, 21.6 minutes, 15.8%, and 1.4%, respectively. In comparing the trauma and nontrauma group, there were significant differences in age, sex, response time, and ACLS time. Between cases of patients who had ROSC and those who died, the data were statistically significant, P = .0143, showing that ACLS time was shorter in the ROSC group (19.5 v 21.9 minutes). In analysis of underlying disease, definite and probable cardiac-origin sudden deaths were found in only 120 patients, which may extend the annual sudden cardiac death rates to be 0.0053%. In conclusion, the low resuscitation and survival rates in this country were because of delayed initiation of both basic life support and ACLS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Osteoporosis is the most common contributing factor of spinal fractures, which characteristically are not generally known to produce spinal cord compression symptoms. Recently, an increasing number of medical reports have implicated osteoporotic fractures as a cause of serious neurological deficit and painful disabling spinal deformities. This has been corroborated by the present authors as well. These complications are only amenable to surgical management, requiring instrumentation. Instrumenting an osteoporotic spine, although a challenging task, can be accomplished if certain guidelines for surgical techniques are respected. Neurological deficits respond equally well to an anterior or posterior decompression, provided this is coupled with multisegmental fixation of the construct. With the steady increase in the elderly population, it is anticipated that the spine surgeon will face serious complications of osteoporotic spines more frequently. With regard to surgery, however, excellent correction of deformities can be achieved, by combining anterior and posterior approaches. Paget's disease of bone (PD) is a non-hormonal osteometabolic disorder and the spine is the second most commonly affected site. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients, back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. In this context, one must be certain before attributing low back pain to PD exclusively, and antipagetic medical treatment alone may be ineffective. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia when blood is diverted by the so-called \"arterial steal syndrome\". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD. Bisphosphonates are the most popular antipagetic drug and several forms have been investigated."

Recent developments in defibrillator technology enable recording of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality, and have shown quality of professional cardiopulmonary resuscitation far from guidelines' levels for factors such as chest compression depth and rate, ventilation rate, and pauses in chest compressions. The effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality factors on patient survival are presently under scrutiny.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Factors such as depth of and pauses in chest compressions immediately before defibrillation attempts affect outcome. Both immediate automated feedback on cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality and use of the same quality data during postevent debriefing improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality, and the combination appears to improve outcome. The increased awareness of quality problems, particularly unwanted pauses in chest compressions, has caused more emphasis on chest compressions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocols including the 2005 Guidelines. There is a growing number of reports of increased survival with these new protocols.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality affects survival after cardiac arrest.

We chose to investigate what actually occurs during a CPR course, and gained the following insights: despite clearly defined curricula, we found that instructors did not teach in a standardized way. Practice time was limited and errors in performance were not corrected. Instructors consistently rated the students' overall performance as acceptable; at the same time, using the same checklist, we consistently rated performance as unacceptable. The checklist is an inaccurate tool for evaluating CPR performance. Despite the poor performance that we documented, students and instructors were satisfied with the courses and believed that the level of performance was high. As a result of these studies, we discovered that the problem of poor retention of CPR skills may lie not with the learner or the curriculum, but with the instructor. But, since lives are being saved with bystander CPR, does this documented poor retention matter? Perhaps the solution is not only to improve instructor training to make certain that students receive adequate practice time and accurate skill evaluation, but also to modify the criteria for correct performance when testing for retention. These criteria should be based on the minimum CPR skills that are required to sustain life for the critical 4-8 min before defibrillation and other advanced cardiac life support are delivered."

Mega sessions of only one to three hair grafts either by slit or laser produce a natural but thin result, while the more traditional circular punch grafting can produce a thicker but unnatural result.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To introduce a new type of recipient site that has the width of a micro graft but can vary in length. When linear grafts are placed into these new recipient sites, they produce strips of hairs that heal quickly and naturally. When using the multiblade knife for donor strip harvesting, the shape of grafts change from the traditional round grafts to a narrow linear strip of hair. Current methods of slit receptor sites accommodate these grafts better than circular punch sites when grafts with a small numbers of hairs are used. Unfortunately, with either larger slit grafts or later densification, slit grafts often tend to compress creating a pitted or tufted appearance. It is the authors' opinion that by creating a slot incision and removing some tissue, a more dense, natural appearance can be created for the patient obviating the problems with slits, lasers, or circular punch grafting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One-year study on 100 hair transplant patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The linear punch creates recipient sites that avoid compression and allows for more hairs per graft without compromising naturalness. Healing is comparable to micrografts alone. It is the authors' opinion that a linear or elongated slot incision accommodates grafts created from donor strip harvesting more naturally than slits, small round incisions or punctures. The linear graft created is the precise size and shape to the recipient slot incision to which it is placed. This technique helps us avoid the old adage, \"Trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\" As stated by Unger, a slot incision created by a Ultrapulse laser produces superior results to those seen with conventional slit grafting (Dermatol Surg 1995;21:759-65).

The variables measured included age, gender, witnessed arrest, response intervals, location of arrest, documented bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and initial rhythms. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Results are reported using analysis of variance, chi square, and adjusted odds ratios from a logistic regression model. Age group 50-59 served as the reference group for the regression model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 2,608 total presumed cardiac arrests, the overall survival rate to hospital discharge was 7.25%. Patients in age groups 40-49 and 50-59 experienced the best rate of successful resuscitation (10%). Each subsequent decade had a steady decline in successful outcome: 8.1% for ages 60-69; 7.1% for ages 70-79; and 3.3% for age 80+. In a post-hoc analysis, further separation of the older age group revealed a successful outcome in 3.9% of patients ages 80-89 and 1% in patients 90 and older. Patients aged 80 years or more were more likely to arrest at home, were more likely to have an initial bradyasystolic rhythm, yet had a similar rate of resuscitation to hospital admission. In the regression model, age 80 or older was associated with a significantly worse survival to hospital discharge (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.82).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was a twofold decrease in survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to discharge in patients aged 80 or more when compared with the reference group in this suburban county setting. However, resuscitation for community-dwelling elders aged 65-89 is not futile. These data support that out-of-hospital resuscitation of elders up to age 90 years is not associated with a universal dismal outcome."

We investigated the effects of various factors on outcome in OHCA, especially partial end-tidal CO2 pressure (petCO2), efficacy of bystander CPR and their elementary knowledge of basic life support (BLS). We also examined motivation among potential bystanders and possible implementation for BLS education in our community.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      OHCA was confirmed in 592 patients. Advanced cardiac life support was initiated in 389 patients, of which 277 were of cardiac aetiology. In 287 patients the event was bystanders witnessed and lay-bystander basic life support was performed only in 83 (23%). After treating OHCA by a physician-based prehospital medical team ROSC was obtained in 61%, the ROSC on admission was 50% and the overall survival to discharge was 21%. Initial petCO2 (OR: 22.04; 95%CI: 11.41-42.55), ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia as initial rhythm (OR: 2.13; 95%CI: 1.17-4.22), bystander CPR (OR: 2.55; 95%CI: 1.13-5.73), female sex (OR: 3.08; 95%CI: 1.49-6.38) and arrival time (OR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.11-1.82) were associated with improved ROSC when using multivariate analysis. Using the same method we found that bystander CPR (OR: 5.05; 95%CI: 2.24-11.39), witnessed arrest (OR: 9.98; 95%CI: 2.89-34.44), final petCO2 (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.67-3.37), initial petCO2 (OR: 1.61; 95%CI: 1.28-2.64) and arrival time (OR: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.33-1.60) were associated with improved survival. A questionnaire to potential bystanders has revealed disappointing knowledge about BLS fundamentals. On the other side, there is a welcomed willingness of potential bystanders to take BLS training and to follow dispatchers instructions by telephone on how to perform CPR.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      After OHCA in a physician-based prehospital setting in our region, the overall survival to discharge was 21%. The potential bystander in our community is generally poorly educated in performing CPR, but willing to gain knowledge and skills in BLS and to follow dispatchers instructions. Arrival time, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, initial petCO2 and final petCO2 were significantly positively related with ROSC on admission and with survival. Prehospital data from this and previous studies provide strong support for a petCO2 of 1.33 kPa to be a resuscitation threshold in the field. In our opinion the initial value of petCO2 should be included in every Utstein style analysis."

            "abstract": "Bystanders are reluctant to perform basic life support (BLS) because of fear of failure and of infection, especially with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (MTM). A possibility to enhance willingness could be the giving of MTM or BLS instructions at a very early age to the potential rescuers. The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of MTM with respect to ventilation and the time needed for performing 5 ventilations. In this study, MTM was performed on a mannequin by 57 children and adolescents aged 10 and 14 years. This study showed that 14-year-olds effectively perform MTM, reaching the recommended tidal volumes. Ten-year-old children have already developed sufficient motor skills for MTM with no significant time differences compared with the 14-year-olds. However, physical demands may be rather high at this age. Further long-term studies are needed to investigate clinical benefits of early teaching of MTM or BLS that may lead to international guidelines with low age limits."

            "abstract": "Pressure is often assumed to have a negligible influence on solute retention in liquid chromatography because of the small compressibility of the mobile and stationary phases. The range of pressures commonly encountered in reversed-phase separations is considerable, however, and may give rise to significant changes in solute capacity factor. In this study, the retention of model solutes is measured directly along the chromatographic column as a function of the local pressure. The model solutes, a homologous series of derivatized fatty acids, exhibit a significant increase in capacity factor ranging from +9.3% for n-C(10) to +24.4% for n-C(20) for inlet pressures from 1500 to 5000 psi. These experimental results are compared with a thermodynamic model derived from regular solution theory. This model suggests that state effects alone are not sufficient to describe the measured change in solute retention and that variations in interaction energy with density must also be considered. By using the simple relationship of van der Waals for the interaction energy (E ∝ 1/V), the change in capacity factor with density is slightly underestimated. However, by using an extended relationship that better describes polar fluids (E ∝ 1/V(2)), good agreement is observed. Finally, the correlation of experimental results with this thermodynamic model reveals that all components in the chromatographic system, including the solute, mobile phase, and stationary phase, must be considered compressible. The results of this study have clear implications for the determination of fundamental physicochemical parameters, as well as for the everyday practice of liquid chromatography."

From 1991-1996 there were 361 attempted resuscitations by the emergency crew. Fifty-three cardiac arrests were secondary to trauma, suicide, drowning, drug overdose and sudden infantile death. In 308 cases of sudden cardiorespiratory arrest cardiac diseases were the presumed cause in accordance with the Utstein protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the 308 cases the mean age was 67.2 years and the male/female ratio was 233:75. The mean response time was 4.6 min. Patients admitted to the intensive or cardiac care units were 98 (31%) and 51 (17%) were discharged from the hospital. Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia were the most common initial rhythms seen in 176 (57%) patients, asystole in 91 (30%) and other arrhythmias (EMD, agonal) in 41 (13%). Fourty-six patients (26%) with ventricular fibrillation on the first rhythm strip survived to be discharged from the hospital, three (3%) patients with asystole and two (5%) with other arrhythmias. Bystanders were present in 211 (68%) of cases and it fourfoulded the likelihood of discharge (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.5-10.4; p=0.0025). There is no statistical difference in mean response time and survival rates between this study and previous studies from 1982-1986 and 1987-1990.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      When sudden cardiorespiratory arrest is witnessed the probability of survival is multiplied. We conclude that the results of ACLS outside the hospital in Reykjavik and surrounding area continue to be among the best. Changes in ACLS guidelines do not appear to have increased survival."

There have been arguments for and against the benefits of advanced life support (ALS) over basic life support with defibrillator (BLS-D) for treating OHCA.\n    \n\n\n          Aims of the study:\n        \n      \n      The study was conducted to characterise the outcomes of cardiac arrest victims in an Asian metropolitan city; to evaluate the impacts of ALS versus BLS-D services; and to explore the possible patient and arrest factors that may be associated with the observed differences in the outcomes between the two pre-hospital care models.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Taipei is an Asian metropolitan city with an area of 272 km(2) and a population of 2.65 million. The fire-based BLS-D EMS system was in the process of phasing in ALS capability. While there were 40 BLS-D teams in the 12 city districts, two ALS teams were set up in the central part of the city. In this prospective study, all adult non-traumatic OHCA from September 2003 to August 2004 were included.

Compared to BLS-D, ALS patients had similar age, sex, witness status, the rate of bystander CPR, and response timeliness but more patients in asystole (84% versus 72%, p=0.005). Patients treated by ALS were more likely to result in significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (29% versus 21%; OR=1.51 (95% CI 1.15-2.00); p=0.002) and survival to emergency department/intensive care unit admission (23% versus 15%; OR=1.66 (95% CI 1.22-2.24); p=0.001), but there was no difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge (7% versus 5%; OR=1.39 (95% CI 0.84-2.23); p=0.17).

            "abstract": "The ability of some fishes to inflate their compressible swimbladder with almost pure oxygen to maintain neutral buoyancy, even against the high hydrostatic pressure several thousand metres below the water surface, has fascinated physiologists for more than 200 years. This review shows how evolutionary reconstruction of the components of such a complex physiological system on a phylogenetic tree can generate new and important insights into the origin of complex phenotypes that are difficult to obtain with a purely mechanistic approach alone. Thus, it is shown that oxygen secretion first evolved in the eyes of fishes, presumably for improved oxygen supply to an avascular, metabolically active retina. Evolution of this system was facilitated by prior changes in the pH dependence of oxygen-binding characteristics of haemoglobin (the Root effect) and in the specific buffer value of haemoglobin. These changes predisposed teleost fishes for the later evolution of swimbladder oxygen secretion, which occurred at least four times independently and can be associated with increased auditory sensitivity and invasion of the deep sea in some groups. It is proposed that the increasing availability of molecular phylogenetic trees for evolutionary reconstructions may be as important for understanding physiological diversity in the postgenomic era as the increase of genomic sequence information in single model species."

In Brazil, in 1995-1996, the year of this study, life supporting first aid (LSFA), which includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) basic life support (BLS) was not taught in schools. With the population of 165 million, the only way to teach the adult population on a large scale would be by television (TV), that is widely viewed. This study compares two groups of factory employees - 86 controls without TV exposure to LSFA and 116 exposed to brief LSFA skill demonstrations on TV. Their ability to acquire eight LSFA skills was evaluated: external hemorrhage control; immobilization of a suspected forearm fracture; treatment of a skin burn by cold flush; body alignment after a fall; positioning for shock and coma; airway control by backward tilt of the head; and CPR (steps A-B-C). Simulated skill performance on the evaluating nurse or manikin was tested at 1 week, 1 month, and 13 months. In the control group, 1-31% performed individual skills correctly; as compared to 9-96% of the television group (P<0.001). There was excellent retention over 13 months. Over 50% of the television group performed correctly five of the eight skills, including positioning and hemorrhage control. Television viewing increased correct airway control performance from 5 to 25% of trainees, while it remained at 3% in the control group. CPR-ABC performance, however, was very poor in both groups. We conclude that a significant proportion of factory workers can acquire simple LSFA skills through television viewing alone, except for the skill acquisition of CPR steps B (mouth-to-mouth ventilation) and C (external chest compressions) which need coached manikin practice."

International resuscitation guidelines, with all their advantages for standardizing resuscitation therapeutic protocols, can be difficult to change. A formalized evidence-based process has been adopted by the International Liason Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) in formulating such guidelines. Currently, randomized clinical trials are considered optimal evidence, and very few major changes in the Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care are made without such. An alternative approach is to allow externally controlled clinical trials more weight in Guideline formulation and resuscitation protocol adoption. In Tucson, Arizona (USA), the Fire Department cardiac arrest database has revealed a number of resuscitation issues. These include a poor bystander CPR rate, a lack of response to initial defibrillation after prolonged ventricular fibrillation, and substantial time without chest compressions during the resuscitation effort. A local change in our previous resuscitation protocols had been instituted based upon this historical database information."

Liposuction combined with CCT reduced arm edema volume by (median) 115% (range 92-179%), whereas CCT alone decreased arm edema volume by only 54% (range 7-81%) (p = 0.008). Because liposuction in conjunction with CCT was not associated with further impairment to an already restricted lymph transport, we recommend this therapy (liposuction with external compression) for chronic arm lymphedema, as it reduces edema volume safely, rapidly, and more efficiently than external compression alone.

A full-torso manikin capable of generating a carotid pulse was connected to a computer to record number of ventilations, tidal volume, flow rate, number of compressions, and compression depth. Data were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U-test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Artificial ventilation performed in isolation provided more correct ventilations than during CPR or CPR+AED (25.7%, 14.2%, 13.7%, p=0.02). Fewer ventilations were delivered during CPR and CPR+AED (p=0.03). More compressions were delivered with CPR alone vs. CPR+AED (51.9, 35.7 min(-1), p=0.00). More correct compressions were delivered during CPR alone vs. CPR+AED (p=0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both the quality and quantity of BLS decreases as the number of procedures performed simultaneously increases. Further decrements might occur when ALS skills enter into resuscitation. These results suggest a need to automate and/or prompt the performance of BLS to optimize resuscitation."

Salvaging patients from circulatory collapse is a pivotal task, but it is unclear whether additional hypothermia can practically contribute to an improvement in the neurological outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Since December 2005, our hospital has been using hypothermia therapy. Forty-six comatose patients after recovery of spontaneous circulation were consecutively enrolled in the present study. Twenty-five of the enrolled patients received hypothermia therapy and 21 did not because they were treated prior to 2005. The time from collapse to spontaneous circulation (P=0.09), the rates of performance of bystander CPR (P=0.370) and presence of a witnessed collapse (P=0.067) were not significantly different between the recovery group (n=28) and the non-recovery group (n=18). The additional hypothermia therapy was an independent predictor of neurological recovery (P=0.005, OR 6.5, 95%CI 1.74-24.27). The recovery rate was significantly higher in patients who received hypothermia therapy (80%) compared to those who did not (38%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Hypothermia therapy is very useful for treating patients who have had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; it should be induced rapidly and smoothly."

Drug dissolution/system erosion/degradation studies were carried out in pH 1.2 and 6.8 buffers using a pectinolytic enzyme. The system was designed based on the gastrointestinal transit time concept, under the assumption of colon arrival times of 6 h. It was found that pectin alone was not sufficient to protect the core tablets and HPMC addition was required to control the solubility of pectin. The optimum HPMC concentration was 20% and such system would protect the cores up to 6 h that corresponded to 25-35% erosion and after that under the influence of pectinase the system would degrade faster and delivering 5-ASA to the colon. The pectin-HPMC envelope was found to be a promising drug delivery system for those drugs to be delivered to the colon."

The risk of bystander CPR for patients not in arrest is uncertain and has implications for how assertive dispatch is in instructing CPR.

            "abstract": "Articular cartilage is often characterized as an isotropic elastic material with no interstitial fluid flow during instantaneous and equilibrium conditions, and indentation testing commonly used to deduce material properties of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Since only one elastic parameter can be deduced from a single indentation test, some other test method is often used to allow separate measurement of both parameters. In this study, a new method is introduced by which the two material parameters can be obtained using indentation tests alone, without requiring a secondary different type of test. This feature makes the method more suitable for testing small samples in situ. The method takes advantages of the finite layer effect. By indenting the sample twice with different-sized indenters, a nonlinear equation with the Poisson's ratio as the only unknown can be formed and Poisson's ratio obtained by solving the nonlinear equation. The method was validated by comparing the predicted Poisson's ratio for urethane rubber with the manufacturer's supplied value, and comparing the predicted Young's modulus for urethane rubber and an elastic foam material with modulii measured by unconfined compression. Anisotropic and nonhomogeneous finite-element (FE) models of the indentation were developed to aid in data interpretation. Applying the method to bovine patellar cartilage, the tissue Young's modulus was found to be 1.79 +/- 0.59 MPa in instantaneous response and 0.45 +/- 0.26 MPa in equilibrium, and the Poisson's ratio 0.503 +/- 0.028 and 0.463 +/- 0.073 in instantaneous and equilibrium, respectively. The equilibrium Poisson's ratio obtained in our work was substantially higher than those derived from biphasic indentation theory and those optically measured in an unconfined compression test. The finite element model results and examination of viscoelastic-biphasic models suggest this could be due to viscoelastic, inhomogeneity, and anisotropy effects."

            "abstract": "The interfacial kinetic paradigm is adopted to model the kinetic behavior of pig pancreatic phospholipase A(2) (PLA2) at the monolayer interface. A short delay of about a minute to the onset of the steady state is observed under all monolayer reaction progress conditions, including the PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of didecanoylphosphatidyl-choline (PC10) and -glycerol (PG10) monolayers as analyzed in this paper. This delay is independent of enzyme concentration and surface pressure and is attributed to the equilibration time by stationary diffusion of the enzyme added to the stirred subphase to the monolayer through the intervening unstirred aqueous layer. The longer delays of up to several hours, seen with the PC10 monolayers at >15 mN/m, are influenced by surface pressure as well as enzyme concentration. Virtually all features of the monolayer reaction progress are consistent with the assumption that the product accumulates in the substrate monolayer, although the products alone do not spread as a compressible monolayer. These results rule out models that invoke slow \"activation\" of PLA2 on the monolayer. The observed steady-state rate on monolayers after the delays is <1% of the rate observed with micellar or vesicles substrates of comparable substrate. Together these results suggest that the monolayer steady-state rate includes contributions from steps other than those of the interfacial turnover cycle. Additional considerations that provide understanding of the pre-steady-state behaviors and other nonideal effects at the surface are also discussed."

            "abstract": "Emergency medicine is subjected worldwide to financial stringencies and organizational evaluations of cost-effectiveness. The various links in the chain of survival are affected differently. Bystander assistance or bystander CPR is available in only 30% of the emergencies, response intervals--if at all required by legislation--are observed to only a limited degree or are too extended for survival in cardiac arrest. A single emergency telephone number is lacking. Too many different phone numbers for emergency reporting result in confusion and delays. Organizational realities are not fully overcome and impair efficiency. The position of the emergency physician in the EMS System is inadequately defined, the qualification of too many emergency physicians are unsatisfactory. In spite of this, emergency physicians are frequently forced to answer out-of-hospital emergency calls. Conflicts between emergency physicians and EMTs may be overcome by providing both groups with comparable qualifications as well as by providing an explicit definition of emergency competence. A further source of conflict occurs at the juncture of prehospital and inhospital emergency care in the emergency department. Deficiencies on either side play a decisive role. At least in principle there are solutions to the deficiencies in the EMSS and in intensive care medicine. They are among others: Adequate financial compensation of emergency personnel, availability of sufficient numbers of highly qualified personnel, availability of a central receiving area with an adjacent emergency ward, constant information flow to the dispatch center on the number of available emergency beds, maintaining 5% of all beds as emergency beds, establishing intermediate care facilities. Efficiency of emergency physician activities can be demonstrated in polytraumatized patients or in patients with ventricular fibrillation or acute myocardial infarction, in patients with acute myocardial insufficiency and other emergency clinical pictures. Cost effectiveness is clearly in favor of emergency medicine. Future developments will be characterized by the consequences of new health care legislation and by effects of financial stringencies on the emergency medical services."

            "abstract": "Rate, depth, and duration of compression are the principal determinants of experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) severity. Since existing models do not allow independent control of these variables, the interaction of these factors has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to define the interactive relation of velocity (V) and compression (C) in SCI using a constrained stroke pneumatic impactor that allowed independent control of these variables. Computer simulation of previous weight-drop experiments using a lumped-mass model were compared with this series of impacts. After rigid stabilization of adjacent cervical vertebrae, the spinal cord (SC) in 48 male ferrets was compressed through the C6-C7 interspace. Maximum compression was 25%, 35%, 50%, or 65% of the SC diameter. Impacts were delivered at five velocities from 1.5 m/s to 6 m/s. Severity of injury was determined by pre and postinjury measurement of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and blinded quantitation of histopathologic findings. Twenty-three of 48 animals (48%) had measurable SEP at 4 hs. No animal recovered SEP at 65% compression at any velocity, or at a velocity of 6 m/s for any level of compression. Recovery of SEP and histologic severity score correlated better with velocity-compression product, or maximum viscous response (VC) than with either V or C alone. The mean histologic severity score was higher in animals exhibiting no recovery of SEP. Modeling the viscoelastic elements of the SC using existing force-time and force-deflection data suggests that estimates of compression from current weight-drop techniques may be inaccurate. At low contact velocity, functional and anatomic damage is best predicted by maximum SC compression. However, as velocity increases, SCI severity becomes a function of the viscous response (VC), demonstrating the rate sensitivity of spinal cord tissue. Tolerance to SC compression decreases as the rate of deformation increases. This helps to explain apparent discrepancies between compression and severity of experimental SCI."

After multivariate analysis, age, diagnosis and gender were found to be independent and significant predictors of survival. No significant difference in survival was found in patients who had been resuscitated by emergency personnel, physicians and bystanders. Patients who were still alive were sent a EuroQol-questionnaire. No differences in outcomes between the four groups were found. Since long-term prognosis after out-of-hospital resuscitation is satisfactory, learning programmes for resuscitation should be continued."

            "abstract": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is a condition caused by direct compression of the popliteal artery as it passes within or exits the popliteal fossa. It is surprisingly uncommon and usually affects young patients, typically men, and often presenting with symptoms of claudication, or more rarely acute limb ischemia, calf cramps, or a picture of compartment syndrome. The diagnosis should be considered early within the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with these problems in this age group. The key to management of this condition lies in a high index of suspicion. The treatment of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is surgical. When the condition is detected at an early stage surgery may be limited to release of the artery alone. However, if the artery has been compressed for some time the resulting intimal damage necessitates bypass of the affected segment. There are numerous reports of thrombectomy with simple vein patching, but the results are inferior to interpositional vein grafting. Reports have also been published of attempts made at endovascular treatment. At present, this mode of management adds little to the definitive treatment of affected limbs and appears limited to use as a bridging procedure in cases presenting with limb ischemia. Unfortunately, an effective clinical screening test does not exist and imaging remains the mainstay in the diagnosis of symptomatic limbs and the screening of asymptomatic limbs. The exact modality of imaging remains unclear, but for the moment duplex scanning, angiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging all appear to have their place."

A 1.3 x 1.3-cm cortical window was made in the lateral aspect of the proximal femur 2 cm distal from the tip of the greater trochanter. Cancellous bone evacuation was performed by curettage. The extent of harvest was mechanically limited by the medial wall of the trochanter and by curette impingement on the margins of the cortical window. The graft was quantitated after maximal digital compression in a 10-ml syringe and compared with cancellous graft obtained from the paired anterior iliac crest. The average compressed volume of cancellous bone harvested from the greater trochanter was 6.5 ml (range, 4.2-9.6 ml). The average iliac crest cancellous bone volume was 6.0 ml (range, 2.7-8.8 ml). Differences in graft volume between the anterior iliac crest and the trochanter were not statistically significant. The resulting defect in the proximal femur remained isolated to the trochanteric region. In this study, we demonstrate that cancellous bone is available from the greater trochanteric region in an amount similar to that available from the anterior iliac crest. We also show that it is obtainable in a reproducible manner. Our clinical experience of over 100 cases has demonstrated acceptable morbidity associated with this technique. The greater trochanteric region may be used as a secondary source of autogenous cancellous bone graft when specific procedures demand more bone graft than available from the iliac crest alone, or in patients who have had previous iliac crest graft harvest."

To evaluate the role of the skeletal muscle pump and vasodilatation on cardiovascular function during exercise, we determined leg and systemic haemodynamic responses in healthy men during (1) incremental one-legged knee-extensor exercise, (2) step-wise femoral artery ATP infusion at rest, (3) passive exercise (n=10), (4)femoral vein or artery ATP infusion (n=6), and (5) cyclic thigh compressions at rest and during passive and voluntary exercise (n=7). Incremental exercise resulted in progressive increases in leg blood flow (DeltaLBF 7.4 +/- 0.7 l min(-1)), cardiac output (Delta (.)Q 8.7 +/- 0.7 l min(-1)), mean arterial pressure (DeltaMAP 51 +/- 5 mmHg), and leg and systemic oxygen delivery and (.)VO2 . Arterial ATP infusion resulted in similar increases in (.)Q , LBF, and systemic and leg oxygen delivery, but central venous pressure and muscle metabolism remained unchanged and MAP was reduced. In contrast,femoral vein ATP infusion did not alter LBF, (.)Q or MAP. Passive exercise also increased blood flow (DeltaLBF 0.7 +/- 0.1 l min(-1)), yet the increase in muscle and systemic perfusion, unrelated to elevations in aerobic metabolism, accounted only for approximately 5% of peak exercise hyperaemia.Likewise, thigh compressions alone or in combination with passive exercise increased blood flow (DeltaLBF 0.5-0.7 l min(-1)) without altering (.)Q, MAP or (.)VO2. These findings suggest that the skeletal muscle pump is not obligatory for sustaining venous return, central venous pressure,stroke volume and (.)Q or maintaining muscle blood flow during one-legged exercise in humans.Further, its contribution to muscle and systemic peak exercise hyperaemia appears to be minimal in comparison to the effects of muscle vasodilatation."

Whether bone brittleness is due to irradiation alone, temperature during irradiation or to a synergetic effect of the freeze-drying-irradiation process was not yet assessed. Using a left-right femoral head symmetry model, 822 compression tests were performed to assess the influence of sequences of a 25 kGy irradiation with and without freeze-drying compared to the unprocessed counterpart. Irradiation of frozen bone did not cause any significant reduction in ultimate strength, stiffness and work to failure. The addition of the freeze-drying process before or after irradiation resulted in a mean drop of 35 and 31% in ultimate strength, 14 and 37% in stiffness and 46 and 37% in work to failure. Unlike irradiation at room temperature, irradiation under dry ice of solvent-detergent treated bone seemed to have no detrimental effect on mechanical properties of cancellous bone. Freeze-drying bone without irradiation had no influence on mechanical parameters, but the addition of irradiation to the freeze-drying step or the reverse sequence showed a detrimental effect and supports the idea of a negative synergetic effect of both procedures. These findings may have important implications for bone banking."

The consequence is that large quantities of insignificant data will be transmitted and reviewed. This carries an increased risk of overlooking vitally important transients. This paper describes a technique to provide an integrated solution based on a single algorithm for the efficient analysis, compression and remote display of long-term physiological signals with infrequent short duration, yet vital events, to effect a reduction in data transmission and display cluttering and to facilitate reliable data interpretation. The algorithm analyses data at the server end and flags significant events. It produces a compressed version of the signal at a lower resolution that can be satisfactorily viewed in a single screen width. This reduced set of data is initially transmitted together with a set of 'flags' indicating where significant events occur. Subsequent transmissions need only involve transmission of flagged data segments of interest at the required resolution. Efficient processing and code protection with decomposition alone is novel. The fixed transmission length method ensures clutter-less display, irrespective of the data length. The flagging of annotated events in arterial oxygen saturation, electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram illustrates the generic property of the algorithm. Data reduction of 87% to 99% and improved displays are demonstrated."

One hundred ninety-five arrests (65.4%) were witnessed, and 103 (34.6%) were unwitnessed. Twenty-five witnessed victims (12.8%) were discharged alive, whereas no unwitnessed victims survived (P less than .001). Patients suffering a witnessed episode of ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT) were more likely to survive (21.9%) than were other patients (2.0%, P less than .0001). Among witnessed patients, initiation of bystander CPR was associated with a significant improvement in survival (20.0%) compared with the no-bystander CPR group (9.2%, P less than .05). Bystander CPR was also associated with improved outcome when witnessed patients with successful prehospital resuscitation were evaluated as a group; 18 had bystander CPR, of whom 13 (72.2%) survived compared with only 12 of 38 patients with no bystander CPR (31.6%, P less than .01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our data revealed improved survival rates when bystander CPR was initiated on victims of witnessed cardiac arrest in an EMS system with short response times."

However, chest compressions alone or ventilation alone is not effective for complete asphyxial cardiac arrests (loss of aortic pulsations). The objective of this investigation was to determine whether these techniques can independently improve outcome at an earlier stage of the asphyxial process.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      After induction of anesthesia, 40 piglets (11.5+/-0.3 kg) underwent endotracheal tube clamping (6.8+/-0.3 minutes) until simulated pulselessness, defined as aortic systolic pressure <50 mm Hg. For the 8-minute \"bystander CPR\" period, animals were randomly assigned to chest compressions and assisted ventilation (CC+V), chest compressions only (CC), assisted ventilation only (V), or no bystander CPR (control group). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred during the first 2 minutes of bystander CPR in 10 of 10 CC+V piglets, 6 of 10 V piglets, 4 of 10 CC piglets, and none of the controls (CC+V or V versus controls, P<0.01; CC+V versus CC and V combined, P=0.01).

            "abstract": "Macroscopic structural damage to the cartilage articular surface can occur due to slicing in surgery, cracking in mechanical trauma, or fibrillation in early stage osteoarthrosis. These alterations may render cartilage matrix and chondrocytes susceptible to subsequent mechanical injury and contribute to progression of degenerative disease. To examine this hypothesis, single 300 microm deep vertical slices were introduced across a diameter of the articular surface of osteochondral explant disks on day 6 after dissection. Then a single uniaxial unconfined ramp compression at 7 x 10(-5) or 7 x 10(-2) s(-1) strain rate to a peak stress of 3.5 or 14 MPa was applied on day 13 during which mechanical behavior was monitored. Effects of slices alone and together with compression were measured in terms of explant swelling and cell viability on days 10 and 17. Slicing alone induced tissue swelling without significant cell death, while compression alone induced cell death without significant tissue swelling. Under low strain rate loading, no differences in the response to injurious compression were found between sliced and unsliced explants. Under high strain rate loading, slicing rendered cartilage more easily compressible and appeared to slightly reduce compression-induced cell and matrix injury. Findings highlight microphysical factors important to cartilage mechanical injury, and suggest ways that macroscopic structural damage may accelerate or, in certain cases, possibly slow the progression of cartilage degeneration."

            "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV-nodal reentry tachycardia with rapid ventricular response, atrial ectopic tachycardia, and preexcitation syndromes combined with atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachyarrhythmias are typical arrhythmias in intensive care patients. Most frequently, the diagnosis of the underlying arrhythmia is possible from the physical examination, the response to maneuvers or drugs, and the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. In all patients with unstable hemodynamics, immediate DC-cardioversion is indicated. Conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is possible using antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone has a conversion rate in atrial fibrillation of up to 80%. However, caution in the use of short-term administration of intravenous amiodarone in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation is absolutely necessary, and the duration of therapy should not exceed 24 to 48 hours. Ibutilide represents a relatively new class III antiarrhythmic agent that has been reported to have conversion rates of 50% to 70%; it seems that ibutilide is even successful when intravenous amiodarone failed to convert atrial fibrillation.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Newer studies compared the outcome of patients with atrial fibrillation and rhythm- or rate-control. Data from these studies (AFFIRM, RACE) clearly showed that rhythm control is not superior to rate control for the prevention of death and morbidity from cardiovascular causes. Therefore, rate-control may be an appropriate therapy in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation after DC-cardioversion. Acute therapy of atrial flutter in intensive care patients depends on the clinical presentation. Atrial flutter can most often be successfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm with energies less than 50 joules. Ibutilide trials showed efficacy rates of 38-76% for conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm compared with conversion rates of 5-13% when intravenous flecainide, propafenone, or verapamil was administered. In addition, a high dose (2 mg) of ibutilide was more effective than sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) in conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (70% versus 19%).\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      There is general agreement that bystander first aid, defibrillation, and advanced life support is essential for neurologic outcome in patients after cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The best survival rate from cardiac arrest can be achieved only when (1) recognition of early warning signs, (2) activation of the emergency medical services system, (3) basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, (4) defibrillation, (5) management of the airway and ventilation, and (6) intravenous administration of medications occurs as rapidly as possible. Public access defibrillation, which places automatic external defibrillators in the hands of trained laypersons, seems to be an ideal approach in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation. The use of automatic external defibrillators by basic life support ambulance providers or first responder in early defibrillation programs has been associated with a significant increase in survival rates. Drugs such as lidocaine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, or magnesium were recommended for treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in intensive care patients. Amiodarone is a highly efficacious antiarrhythmic agent for many cardiac arrhythmias, ranging from atrial fibrillation to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and seems to be superior to other antiarrhythmic agents."

The term cardiocerebral is used to stress that the issue is immediate and effective support of the central circulation. Cardiocerebral resuscitation consists of continuous chest compressions--without mouth-to-mouth ventilations--administered by bystanders, and a new algorithm for emergency medical services that consists of sets of 200 chest compressions before and immediately after electrocardiographic analysis and, if indicated, a single shock. Ventilation is initially provided by passive oxygen insufflation rather than with intubation or bag-mask ventilation. Early establishment of intravenous or intraosseous access for epinephrine is emphasized. Postresuscitation care for comatose patients includes early coronary intervention and 24 hours of mild hypothermia. Studies show marked improvement in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation who subsequently received specialized postresuscitation care."

In Sweden, CPR is initiated prior to emergency medical services (EMS) arrival in about 30% of cardiac arrests out-of-hospital, a figure which should be improved urgently. To do so, it is of interest to know more about the bystanders' perceptions of their intervention. A qualitative method inspired by the phenomenographic approach was applied to 19 bystanders who had performed CPR. In the analysis, five main categories and 14 subcategories emerged. The main categories were: to have a sense of humanity, to have competence, to feel an obligation, to have courage and to feel exposed. Interviews described how humanity and concern for another human being were the foundation of their intervention. CPR training offers the possibility to give appropriate help in this emergency. If the aim of CPR training was extended beyond teaching the skill of CPR to include preparation of the rescuer for the intervention and his/her reactions, this might increase the number of people able to take action in the cardiac arrest situation."

As a representative for mechanical properties, compression strength was measured in order to detect changes when mixing HAC with gentamicin. In the in vivo study, bone infection was induced according to the model of Norden by injection of 1 ml Na-morrhuat and 3 x 10(6)CFU Staphylococcus aureus. After 3 weeks, when chronic stage of infection was obtained, 17 animals were treated by debridement and filling the marrow either with HAC alone or HAC mixed with gentamicin (32 mg/g). Animals of the control groups were left untreated. After 6 weeks, all animals were sacrificed. Hematological, radiological, microbiological and histological examinations were carried out by covered investigation. Best evidence of the efficiency of treatment was observed in histopathological and microbiological findings. In all swabs of the control groups, taken 6 weeks following infection S. aureus were detected which were clonal to the strain used for induction of osteomyelitis. In HAC/gentamicin-treated animals, no growth was detectable after 7 days of culturing in BHI bouillon. In the HAC/gentamicin-treated group, there was no histopathological evidence of infection. In all other groups different stages of chronic osteomyelitis were found. No side effect was observed, neither locally nor systemically by HAC or gentamicin.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults in a metropolitan county who had had witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrest before emergency medical services were undertaken to investigate this 3-phase model with regard to bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We hypothesized that the survival benefit from bystander CPR depends on the collapse-to-shock interval, with the highest benefit occurring during the circulatory phase. The collapse-to-shock interval was a priori grouped into 4 categories: 1 to 5, 6 to 7, 8 to 10, and > or = 11 minutes. We used logistic regression analysis to assess whether the association between CPR and survival to hospital discharge depended on the collapse-to-shock interval category. Of the 2,193 events meeting the inclusion criteria, 67.0% had received bystander CPR. The average collapse-to-shock interval was 8.2 +/- 2.8 minutes. The survival rate was 33.4%. A higher likelihood of survival was associated with bystander CPR (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 1.73) and a shorter collapse-to-shock interval (OR -1.84, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.10, for each additional SD of 2.8 minutes less) after adjustment. The beneficial association of CPR increased as the collapse-to-shock interval increased (p = 0.05 for interaction). The bystander CPR was associated with an OR of survival of 0.96 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.46) for a 1- to 5-minute collapse-to shock interval, OR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.58) for a 6- to 7-minute interval, OR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.11) for an 8- to 10-minute interval, and OR of 2.11 (95% CI 1.32 to 3.37) for an > or = 11-minute interval. The results of this investigation support a phased model of ventricular fibrillation arrest.

Amongst those factors which contribute to survival there are fewer witnessed arrests, less bystander CPR and slower ambulance response times in those brought to GRI. There is a need to investigate the environment in which patients collapse, to train the public in CPR, and to review the efficiency and resourcing of the ambulance service."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Prehospital research has found little evidence in support of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, these studies generally examine city-based emergency medical services (EMS) systems. The training and experience of ACLS-skilled paramedics differs internationally, and this may also contribute to negative findings. Additionally, the frequency of negative outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest suggests that it is difficult to establish sufficient numbers to detect an effect.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To examine the effect of ACLS on cardiac arrest in Queensland, Australia. Queensland has a population of 3.8 million and an area of over 1.7 million km2, and is served by a statewide EMS system, which deploys resources using a two-tier model. Advanced treatments such as intubation and cardioactive drug administration are provided by extensively trained intensive care paramedics.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An observational, retrospective design was used to examine all cases of cardiac arrest attended by the Queensland Ambulance Service from January 2000 to December 2002. Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of the presence of an intensive care paramedic on survival to hospital discharge, adjusting for age, sex, initial rhythm, the presence of a witness and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The presence of an intensive care paramedic had a significant effect on survival (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.99).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Highly trained ACLS-skilled paramedics provide added survival benefit in EMS systems not optimised for early defibrillation. The reasons for this benefit are multifactorial, but may be the result of greater skill level and more informed use of the full range of prehospital interventions."

            "abstract": "It is well known that surgical obliteration of the cerebral veins with additional brain compression by retractors is dangerous. To evaluate the mechanism, we studied the change in cerebral microcirculation and parenchymal damage following brain compression with venous circulatory impairment using a rat model. The animals were divided into the following four groups (each n = 5) (1) a sham-operated control; (2) group A, one cortical vein occlusion; (3) group B, a 30 mmHg compression pressure; and (4) group C, one cortical vein occlusion with 30 mmHg compression. The cortical vein was occluded photochemically. Local cerebral blood flow (l-CBF) in the compressed area was measured by stationary laser-Doppler (LD) flowmetry and regional CBF (r-CBF) in the surrounding area was also measured by LD scanning technique for 120 min. l-CBF in the compressed area decreased significantly in groups B and C. A gradual and significant increase in group B and decrease in group C in r-CBF of the surrounding area were observed. Histologically, more extensive damage was observed in group C than in group A and B. The degree of hypoperfusion of the affected brain correlated well with the subsequent brain damage in the experiments. We demonstrated that, compared with vein occlusion or brain compression alone, the accumulated episode caused severe ischemia, then increased the vulnerability of the rat brain to tissue damage."

Post-CPR CK levels showed positive correlations with both the number of chest compressions given (p less than 0.001) and the number of joules administered during defibrillation (p less than 0.001). Post-CPR CK-MB levels also showed a positive correlation with the number of joules administered (p less than 0.005) and the number of chest compressions (p less than 0.02). Forty-three (68.3 percent) of the 63 patients developed rhabdomyolysis. Serum CK levels were higher (p less than 0.005) in the patients who received electrical countershock therapy as well as chest compressions when compared with patients who received chest compressions alone. There were no significant differences in electrolyte levels between patients with and without rhabdomyolysis. Thirty patients had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and 18 (60.0 percent) of these had a positive MB-fraction post-CPR while only ten of the 33 patients without known CAD had a positive MB-fraction post-CPR (30.3 percent, p less than 0.05). Patients with no known CAD but positive CK-MB fraction had significantly higher total CK levels, physical injury, and electrical injury compared with patients with negative CK-MB fraction. Twenty patients survived CPR and were discharged from the hospital without significant neurologic sequelae. The remaining 43 either died or suffered severe neurologic injury. The patients who survived CPR had a significantly shorter duration of CPR (p less than 0.01) compared with those who did not.

Patients who survive CPR without neurologic impairment appear to be those with a shorter duration of CPR. Elevated serum potassium, phosphate, and creatinine values may be related to an adverse effect on long-term survival."

            "abstract": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether abdominal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could be used instead of external cardiac massage either to protect the recent sternotomy or while chest compressions are not possible whilst a sternotomy is being performed. Altogether 386 papers were found using the reported search, of which 10 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Patients who arrest after cardiac surgery and require chest reopening will have a period of no external chest compression and therefore, no cerebral or coronary perfusion. In addition, if a patient arrests prior to cardiac surgery there will be a period of time performing the sternotomy during which there will be no external compressions. We found only one paper in a porcine model that looked at the effectiveness of abdominal only CPR although it did show that abdominal CPR was actually 60% better than chest CPR. Interposed abdominal and chest compressions has been much more extensively studied and has been shown to be significantly better in return of spontaneous circulation than chest compressions alone. We conclude that currently there is very little evidence to support abdominal only CPR although these studies may support the concept that it may potentially increase the coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure."

Newer clots have low echogenicity and are seen as large black areas in the gray-scale image. Older clots are more echogenic. The presence of enlarged venous collateral veins as well as absence of color flow and inability to compress the veins confirm the diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis.

Subjects were presented with a SCAS (adult mannequin, bystander available to assist, AED visible). Subjects' skills were rated in standardized fashion. For statistical analysis, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as appropriate. There were 51 subjects; 69% were female; mean age was 64 years; 86% were without disabilities. Pre-retirement professions included: medical (13.7%), office/sales (41.2%), and engineer/science (15.7%). Subjects had previous American Heart Association first-responder training (CPR and AED use) as follows: none (22%), within 0 to 6 months (47%), 7-12 months (4%), > 12 months (27%). During the SCAS, subjects performed inconsistently on the various links in the chain of survival.

With respect to AED skill performance, we noted the following: 94% (95% CI 84-99%) of subjects removed the patient's clothing, 90% (95% CI 79-97%) turned the device on, 94% delivered a shock as directed, and 82% continued CPR if \"no shock indicated\" by AED (95% CI 69-92%). Performance was less satisfactory for the following: only 39.2% (95% CI 26-54%) continued chest compressions after AED arrival, 60.8% (95% CI 46-74%) of subjects correctly attached electrodes, and 6% (95% CI 1-16%) verbalized \"clear\" in advance of shock.

            "abstract": "Multidirectional instability is not clearly understood. Excessive capsular laxity has been proposed as the key component. However, because ligaments fail to resist humeral head translation until they are tensioned, glenohumeral instability in the mid range of motion cannot be explained by capsuloligamentous pathology alone. Capsulolabral augmentation is designed to increase glenohumeral stability by 2 separate mechanisms: deepening the glenoid concavity and reducing capsular laxity. This is accomplished by shifting the capsule to buttress the glenoid labrum. Hence, the glenolabral concavity in which the humeral head is stabilized by compression throughout the entire range is enhanced. The purposes of this study were to examine glenolabral depth and glenohumeral stability before and after labral augmentation and to measure the effect of diminished capsular laxity on motion in clinically important positions. We compared glenolabral depth, resistance to humeral head displacement, and glenohumeral range of motion before and after capsulolabral augmentation. Glenolabral depth was measured as the lateral displacement of the center of the humeral head translating from the glenoid fossa. We recorded a mean increase in glenoid depth of 1.9 mm inferiorly, 2.0 mm posteroinferiorly, and 0.9 mm posteriorly (P <.02). Resistance to humeral head displacement was measured by use of the stability ratio, defined as the translatory force required to displace the humeral head divided by the force compressing the humeral head into the glenoid fossa. The mean stability ratio was increased by 0.24 inferiorly and 0.24 posteroinferiorly (P <.02). Motion was measured by achieving 30 degrees and 60 degrees elevation in the 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees planes of elevation and measuring the extent of possible internal rotation for each of these 8 positions when the capsule was tensioned to exert 1000 N-mm of torque. Reduction of internal rotation in these positions was a mean of 15 degrees at 1000 N-mm of torque. This study demonstrates that humeral head stability within the glenolabral fossa is increased by local capsular augmentation. A simultaneous reduction in capsular laxity is achieved, which partially limits glenohumeral motion. Understanding the biomechanical effect of this procedure helps the physician to establish surgical goals and to explain to patients the rationale of why this procedure may be clinically efficacious."

After CT scan, an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor was placed in 24, and 2 were taken to emergency surgery for subdural and intracerebral hemorrhage. ICP was elevated in 24 patients (mean, 54 mm Hg), and a ventriculostomy was placed in all 24. ICP was unresponsive in 12, and all suffered brain death. ICP lessened to < 25 mm Hg in 12, and all underwent angiography. All 12 had an aneurysm and underwent emergency surgical clipping. Time to surgery from SAH was < or = 11 hours in all 12 patients.

We also examined trends in OHCA survival over time.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane DSR, DARE, ACP Journal Club, and CCTR was conducted (January 1, 1950 to August 21, 2008) for studies reporting OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology in adults. Data were extracted from 79 studies involving 142 740 patients. The pooled survival rate to hospital admission was 23.8% (95% CI, 21.1 to 26.6) and to hospital discharge was 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.4). Stratified by baseline rates, survival to hospital discharge was more likely among those: witnessed by a bystander (6.4% to 13.5%), witnessed by EMS (4.9% to 18.2%), who received bystander CPR (3.9% to 16.1%), were found in ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (14.8% to 23.0%), or achieved return of spontaneous circulation (15.5% to 33.6%). Although 53% (95% CI, 45.0% to 59.9%) of events were witnessed by a bystander, only 32% (95% CI, 26.7% to 37.8%) received bystander CPR. The number needed to treat to save 1 life ranged from 16 to 23 for EMS-witnessed arrests, 17 to 71 for bystander-witnessed, and 24 to 36 for those receiving bystander CPR, depending on baseline survival rates.

Perhaps the most intensively studied distress vocalization is the ultrasonic vocalization of infant rats. Since its discovery, this vocalization has been interpreted both as a communicatory signal for the elicitation of maternal retrieval and as the manifestation of emotional distress. In contrast, the authors examined the cardiovascular causes and consequences of the vocalization, and on the basis of this work, they hypothesized that the vocalization is the acoustic by-product of the abdominal compression reaction (ACR), a maneuver that results in increased venous return to the heart.

Unilateral focal brain compression was induced by epidural implantation of an inverted hemisphere-shaped bead over the sensorimotor cortex. Microinjections of a total of 1mg chemoagent fluorouracil or the same volume of saline were made into the compressed cortex. Behavioral tests of forelimb sensorimotor function were conducted during 4 weeks' observation. Rats subjected to any of the three types of lesions, saline microinjection plus cortical compression, chemoagent microinjection alone, or chemoagent microinjection combined with cortical compression, demonstrated significant behavioral deficits in several sensorimotor tasks, compared with saline-microinjected control animals. In placing tests, behavioral deficits elicited by each single treatment were worsened by combined treatment with chemoagent microinjection and focal cortical compression. Concurrently, local delivery of chemoagent into the compressed cortex induced increased cortical tissue loss, necrosis and apoptosis. These data indicate that local chemotherapy exacerbates compression-induced neurological impairment, and a model of controlled focal cortical compression may provide a valuable means to improve anti-cancer therapeutic designs with reduced deterioration of brain function."

Drug release behaviour, swelling and erosion indices and strength of bioadhesion in vitro to a biological membrane were investigated. The interaction between nystatin and polymers was investigated by DSC and FT-IR. Tablets containing the different types of carbopol alone consistently showed an initial burst release of drug, whereas this was not observed for matrices containing xanthan or xanthan-carbopol. The presence of PEG in xanthan-containing formulations induced an increase in dissolution rate; however, in the absence of xanthan the amount of drug release from a PEG matrix was reduced to < 15% over 8 h dissolution. The presence of PVP increased the dissolution rate of nystatin due to the relative hydrophilicity of PVP. The presence of calcium ions induced a more rigid gel in the xanthan matrix as a result of interaction between the polymer and calcium ions. Xanthan can be used in potential mucoadhesive formulations containing nystatin to produce a controlled release of the drug and the outcomes of this work may provide a suitable strategy for matrix selection to provide more efficacious treatment alternatives for candidiasis and other disease processes for significant patient populations."

            "abstract": "In spite of the wealth of experience available in the pharmaceutical industry, tablet formulations are still largely developed on an empirical basis, and the scale-up from laboratory to production is a time-consuming and costly process. Using Ludipress greatly simplifies formulation development and the manufacturing process because only the active ingredient Ludipress and a lubricant need to be mixed briefly before being compressed into tablets. The studies described here were designed to investigate the scale-up of Ludipress-based formulations from laboratory to production scale, and to predict changes in tablet properties due to changes in format, compaction pressure, and the use of different tablet presses. It was found that the tensile strength of tablets made of Ludipress increased linearly with compaction pressures up to 300 MPa. It was also independent of the geometry of the tablets (diameter, thickness, shape). It is therefore possible to give an equation with which the compaction pressure required to achieve a given hardness can be calculated for a given tablet form. The equation has to be modified slightly to convert from a single-punch press to a rotary tableting machine. Tablets produced in the rotary machine at the same pressure have a slightly higher tensile strength. The rate of increase in pressure, and therefore the throughput, has no effect on the tensile strength of Ludipress tablets. It is thought that a certain minimum dwell time is responsible for this difference. The production of tablets based on Ludipress can be scaled up from one rotary press to another without problem if the powder mixtures are prepared with the same mixing energy. The tensile strength curve determined for tablets made with Ludipress alone can also be applied to tablets with a small quantity (< 10%) of an active ingredient."

After testing the reconstructed specimen, the TSRH rod was removed and the construct retested to evaluate the stability of the wedge alone reconstruction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Construct stiffness was calculated as the peak applied load (N or Nm) divided by the corresponding segmental displacement (mm or degrees) normalized to the intact specimen. Reconstruction static data are expressed as a percentage change from the intact condition. Statistical analysis included descriptives, a one-way analysis of variance, and the Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons among the reconstruction groups. Axial compression: under axial compressive loads, the stiffness of the wedge-rod construct was approximately equal to that of the intact group. The stiffness of the wedge alone construct was 56% less than that of the intact group except for extension and left lateral bending. For the other modes of loading (right rotation, left rotation, flexion, extension, right lateral bending, and left lateral bending), the wedge-rod construct was stiffer than that of the intact group. The stiffness of the wedge alone construct was consistently less than that of the intact group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on the results of this biomechanical comparison, the calf spines instrumented with the wedge-rod system for fusionless correction were significantly stiffer as compared to the intact calf spine. The wedges alone were not as stiff as the intact spine. This suggests that the theory of performing transverse osteotomies of vertebral bodies with fixation with wedge-rod construct for 8 to 12 weeks, followed by removal of the rod, could provide adequate fixation and correction of a scoliotic deformity without requiring fusion of motion segments."

            "abstract": "In animal models, vasopressin improves short-term outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for ventricular fibrillation compared to placebo, and improves myocardial and cerebral hemodynamics during CPR compared to epinephrine. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that vasopressin would improve 24-h neurologically intact survival compared to epinephrine. After a 2-min untreated ventricular fibrillation interval followed by 6 min of simulated bystander CPR, 35 domestic swine (weight, 25+/-1 kg) were randomly provided with a single dose of vasopressin (20 U or approximately 0.8 U kg(-1) intravenously) or with epinephrine (0.02 mg kg(-1) intravenously every 5 min). Ten minutes after initial medication administration (18 min after induction of ventricular fibrillation), standard advanced life support was provided, starting with defibrillation. Animals that were successfully resuscitated received 1 h of intensive care support and were observed for 24 h. Coronary perfusion pressures were higher in the vasopressin group 2 and 4 min after vasopressin administration (28+/-2 versus 18+/-1 mm Hg, P<0.01, and 26+/-3 versus 18+/-2 mm Hg, P<0.05, respectively). The vasopressin group tended to be successfully defibrillated on the first attempt more frequently (8/18 versus 3/17, P = 0.15). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was attained in 12/18 (67%) vasopressin-treated pigs versus 8/17 (47%) epinephrine-treated pigs, P = 0.24. Twenty-four hour neurologically normal survival occurred in 11/18 (61%) versus 7/17 (41%), respectively, P = 0.24.

            "abstract": "After trauma, articular cartilage often does not heal due to incomplete bonding of the fractured surfaces. In this study we investigated the ability of chemical cross-linkers to facilitate bonding of articular cartilage, either alone or in combination with a pre-treatment with surface-degrading agents. Articular cartilage blocks were harvested from the femoropatellar groove of bovine calves. Two cartilage blocks, either after pre-treatment or without, were assembled in a custom-designed chamber in partial apposition and subjected to cross-linking treatment. Subsequently, bonding of cartilage was measured as adhesive strength, that is, the maximum force at rupture of bonded cartilage blocks divided by the overlap area. In a first approach, bonding was investigated after treatment with cross-linking reagents only, employing glutaraldehyde, 1-ethyl-3-diaminopropyl-carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), genipin, or transglutaminase. Experiments were conducted with or without compression of the opposing surfaces. Compression during cross-linking strongly enhanced bonding, especially when applying EDC/NHS and glutaraldehyde. Therefore, all further experiments were performed under compressive conditions. Combinations of each of the four cross-linking agents with the degrading pre-treatments, pepsin, trypsin, and guanidine, led to distinct improvements in bonding compared to the use of cross-linkers alone. The highest values of adhesive strength were achieved employing combinations of pepsin or guanidine with EDC/NHS, and guanidine with glutaraldehyde. The release of extracellular matrix components, that is, glycosaminoglycans and total collagen, from cartilage blocks after pre-treatment was measured, but could not be directly correlated to the determined adhesive strength. Cytotoxicity was determined for all substances employed, that is, surface degrading agents and cross-linkers, using the resazurin assay. Taking the favourable cell vitality after treatment with pepsin and EDC/NHS and the cytotoxic effects of guanidine and glutaraldehyde into account, the combination of pepsin and EDC/NHS appeared to be the most advantageous treatment in this study. In conclusion, bonding of articular cartilage blocks was achieved by chemical fixation of their surface components using cross-linking reagents. Application of compressive forces and prior modulation of surface structures enhanced cartilage bonding significantly. Enzymatic treatment in combination with cross-linkers may represent a promising addition to current techniques for articular cartilage repair."

This study was conducted to determine significant predictors for survival after collapse-witnessed OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology to investigate the impact of bystander-initiated CPR. Logistic regression analysis of OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology was performed on retrospective data sets from three Japanese suburban communities. All arrest incidents were witnessed and occurred prior to the arrival of EMS personnel. Outcome measure was survival to discharge. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm (ventricular fibrillation (VF) or not), interval from collapse to CPR (within 5 min or not), and initial ECG rhythm/collapse-to-CPR interval interaction were significantly associated with survival. Patient age (70 years or less/over 70 years), interval from collapse to EMS response, and bystander-initiated CPR were significantly associated with VF in an initial ECG. The effectiveness of bystander-initiated CPR for OHCA can be successfully predicted based on the interval from collapse to CPR and initial ECG rhythm. The increase in the proportion of bystander-initiated CPR from the present level of 20-50% would be expected to rescue another 1800 victims of OHCA per year in Japan."

Synthetic C16:0 phosphonolipids all had improved adsorption and film respreading compared to dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, and SO(2)-lipid and DEPN-8 reached maximum surface pressures of 72mN/m (minimum surface tensions of <1mN/m) in compressed films on the Wilhelmy balance (23 degrees C).

These altered mechanical conditions were applied for 5 weeks. After 5 weeks, disc narrowing at the intervention levels was evident in micro-CT images. Average disc space loss as a percent of the initial values over the 5 weeks was 19%, 28%, 22% and 20% four groups listed above. Increased lateral bending stiffness relative to within-animal controls was also observed at all groups. The minimum stiffness was recorded at an angle close to the in vivo value, indicating that angulated discs had adapted to the imposed deformity. In the angulated and compressed discs there was a small difference in the amount of collagen crimping in the disc annuli between concave and convex sides. All experimental interventions produced substantial changes in the intervertebral discs of these growing animals. 'Reduced mobility' was present in all interventions, and the changes in the discs with reduced mobility alone were comparable with those in loaded and angulated discs. This suggests that imposed reduced mobility is the major source of disc changes, and may be a factor in disc degeneration in scoliosis. Further studies are in progress to characterize gene expression, matrix protein synthesis and composition in these discs."

The lambda1 radiation converts the photochromic material from an opaque to a transparent configuration, thereby enabling exposure of the photoresist, while the lambda2 radiation reverses the transformation. As a result of these competing effects, the point-spread function that exposes the resist is strongly compressed, resulting in higher photolithographic resolution and information density. We show by modeling that the point-spread-function compression achieved via AMOL depends only on the absorbance distribution in the photostationary state. In this respect, absorbance modulation represents an optical nonlinearity that depends on the intensity ratio of lambda1 and lambda2 and not on the absolute intensity of either one alone.

Hypogonadism and glucocorticoid excess both cause bone loss, but the cellular mechanisms responsible are distinct. Loss of gonadal steroids causes an increase in bone remodeling by up-regulating osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Glucocorticoid excess, conversely, suppresses remodeling by down-regulating osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Nonetheless, both conditions increase osteoblast apoptosis and decrease osteoclast apoptosis, and both cause bone loss due to an undersupply of osteoblasts relative to the need for cavity repair. To investigate their interactions, we compared the effects of orchidectomy, glucocorticoid excess, or both combined in mice. After 28 d, serum unbound testosterone concentration and seminal vesicle weight were not diminished when prednisolone was administered alone. Vertebral bone mineral density and compression strength decreased to the same extent in animals receiving prednisolone or after orchidectomy, but the changes were not additive. Orchidectomy induced the expected up-regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors, but these changes were prevented in orchidectomized mice simultaneously receiving glucocorticoids. Likewise, the increase in cancellous osteoid, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, bone formation, and activation frequency caused by orchidectomy were prevented by prednisolone. The prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis increased in the mice receiving prednisolone or after orchidectomy, but the increases were not additive. These data demonstrate that hypogonadism does not occur in or contribute to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and that the adverse skeletal effects of glucocorticoid excess override those of orchidectomy."

Several organizations have directed resources toward the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest through a paradigm that has come to be known as the \"chain of survival\"-prompt activation of emergency response by telephone 911, early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrillation, and timely advanced cardiac life support (Circulation 1991;83:1832-1847). The ready availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) has been advocated as a key component of this chain. Some authors have suggested a \"fire extinguisher model\" for AED deployment (Circulation 1998;98:2334-2351; Resuscitation 1995;30:151-156; Ann Intern Med 2001;135:990-998). In this model, AEDs are prominently displayed in public places for use by laypersons, much like fire extinguishers. For example, in Chicago's O'Hare Airport, AEDs are placed alongside fire extinguishers in the public concourse (N Engl J Med 2002;347:1242-1247). Advocates of this model suggest that advancing this practice would be a means to widely disbourse life-saving technology that is easy to use. Several experts have questioned this model, suggesting that the cost-effectiveness of distributing AEDs this widely would be prohibitive (BMJ 2002;325:515; Curr Opin Cardiol 2007;22:5-10; BMJ 2003;326:162; Int J Technol Assess Health Care 2007;23:362-367) and may not be more effective than more targeted distribution of AEDs. This literature review will examine the available data on both AEDs and fire extinguishers to determine if these comparisons are reasonable as a means of guiding public policy."

There is a growing trend to order urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar spine in any patient presenting with signs suspicious for CES.

            "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to compare the accuracy of color Doppler to compression sonography in the diagnosis of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Longitudinal color flow imaging was performed in 60 lower extremities in patients with clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The study was then repeated by a blinded examiner using transverse compression sonography. The results were then correlated. Thirty-five examinations were negative by both color flow and compression methods. Twenty thrombi were diagnosed on compression sonography, while only 13 were diagnosed by the color flow method. Thirty-five percent of thrombi were missed using color flow imaging alone. We conclude that compression sonography should remain an integral part of the assessment of lower extremity DVT, as a significant number of thrombi might be overlooked using longitudinal color flow imaging alone. This is especially true in non-occlusive thrombi that are adherent to the vessel wall."

A graphical technique called Spectramap has been used for the simultaneous perception of clinical relevance and statistical significance. The success of CPCR is determined to a large extent by pre-arrest conditions. Arrests occurring inside hospitals possess a far better prognosis than those observed outside. (Overall success rate inside hospitals is 18% vs. 7% outside). Site of arrest, time to call, time to CPR, and bystander intervention appear to be relevant and significant conditions outside the hospital. Age, underlying disease and degree of disability are shown to be relevant and significant inside hospitals. The Belgian CPCR-Registry, combined with Spectramap, also allows assessment of the efficiency of emergency services and the efficacy of life supporting treatments.

Articles that reported primary data on survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Utstein style were included. Forty-seven articles were identified using Medline. Fourteen studies met our criteria for inclusion. The number of patients in whom resuscitation was attempted varied between 78 and 3,243. The proportion of bystander-witnessed cases varied between 38% and 89%; bystander CPR was performed in 21% to 56% of the cases. Patients with a bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest of cardiac etiology were discharged alive in 2% to 49% of the cases. Even when data are reported in a uniform way as suggested by the Utstein template, there is a tremendous variability in outcome. This did not appear to be entirely explained by variability in the traditional risk factors for a low chance of survival. One cannot exclude the possibility of other factors being of ultimate importance for the outcome."

            "abstract": "Phased compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whereby the chest and abdomen are compressed sequentially, is a new approach to the classical cardiopulmonary resuscitation technique, which is based on the compression of the chest alone. Six dogs with cardiac arrest were treated by external chest and abdominal compression using a rigid plexiglas suit lined with flexible perithoracic and periabdominal bladders. Fast inflation and deflation of the two independent bladders, together with forced ventilation of the lung, generated phased pressure pulses. The physiological variables monitored throughout the experiment included central venous, left ventricular, and central arterial pressures, carotid blood flow, cardiac output, and acid base balance. The phased compression technique was performed with phased time lags of 0, 150, 300, 400, 600, 700, and 850 ms between the abdominal and thoracic pressure pulses. A random sequence of the different phased compression modes, each lasting for 3-10 minutes, was applied during the prolonged resuscitation procedure that lasted for up to 70 minutes. By starting the abdominal compression 300-400 ms before the thoracic compression the carotid flow index improved by 77% (from 13% with simultaneous compression to 23% with phased compression) and the cardiac output index increased by 65% (from 7.8% with simultaneous compression to 12.5%). The results provide insight into the chest pump concept and the role of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures in generating improved blood circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and show the advantages of phased compression over chest compression alone and simultaneous chest and abdominal compression."

It is composed of 3 components: 1) continuous chest compressions for bystander resuscitation; 2) a new emergency medical services (EMS) algorithm; and 3) aggressive post-resuscitation care. The first 2 components of CCR were first instituted in 2003 in Tucson, Arizona; in 2004 in the Rock and Walworth counties of Wisconsin; and in 2005 in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The CCR method has been shown to dramatically improve survival in the subset of patients most likely to survive: those with witnessed arrest and shockable rhythm on arrival of EMS. The CCR method advocates continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilations for witnessed cardiac arrest. It advocates either prompt or delayed defibrillation, based on the 3-phase time-sensitive model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) articulated by Weisfeldt and Becker. For bystanders with access to automated external defibrillators and EMS personnel who arrive during the electrical phase (i.e., the first 4 or 5 min of VF arrest), the delivery of prompt defibrillator shock is recommended. However, EMS personnel most often arrive after the electrical phase -- in the circulatory phase of VF arrest. During the circulatory phase of VF arrest, the fibrillating myocardium has used up much of its energy stores, and chest compressions that perfuse the heart are mandatory prior to and immediately after a defibrillator shock. Endotracheal intubation is delayed, excessive ventilations are avoided, and early-administration epinephrine is advocated."

            "abstract": "This short review explores the current status of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Malaysia and highlights some of the factors that have a negative impact on its rate of success. Absence of a unifying body such as a national resuscitation council results in non-uniformity in the practice and teaching of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the out-of-hospital setting, there is the lack of basic skills and knowledge in performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation as well as using an automated external defibrillator among the Malaysian public. The ambulance response time is also a significant negative factor. In the in-hospital setting, often times, resuscitation is first attended by junior doctors or nurses lacking in the skill and experience needed. Resuscitation trolleys were often inadequately equipped."

Data were collected from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring between 1 January, 1994 and 31 December, 1998 by applying the Utstein style. The main outcome measure was survival at 1 year after hospital discharge. The overall incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was 71.7/100 000 inhabitants/year. Resuscitations were attempted in 762 of 1118 patients with confirmed cardiac arrest. Of the 762 patients, 37 (4.86%) survived. The cause of cardiac arrest was presumed to be cardiac in 340 (44.6%). Of the 340 cardiac arrests, 180 (52.9%) were witnessed by bystanders. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was recorded as an initial rhythm in 56 (31.1%) of the 180 patients, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed by bystanders in 89 (49.4%). The survival rate was 39.2% (22/56) when cardiac arrest was bystander-witnessed and of cardiac origin with VF as an initial rhythm. VF as an initial rhythm, age of the patients and intervals of call-to-first CPR attempt and collapse-to-arrival at patient's side were major factors relating to survival in the witnessed cardiac arrests of cardiac origin. The age, and gender of the patients, place of collapse and intervals of collapse-to-first CPR and collapse-to-arrival at patient's side were representative factors affecting the incidence of VF as an initial rhythm. The survival rate in Akita-City from bystander-witnessed cardiac arrests of cardiac origin with VF as an initial rhythm was comparable to those in other regions with advanced EMS systems. However, the incidence of VF as an initial rhythm is extremely low. Reduction of intervals of call (collapse)-to-first CPR attempt and collapse-to-arrival at patient's side or authorization of use of automated external defibrillator in basic life support may increase the incidence of VF as an initial rhythm and improve the survival from witnessed cardiac arrests with cardiac origin."

New bone formed only in HA or coral implants soaked with marrow cells; fibrous tissue ingrowth alone was observed in the controls (without marrow). In the present study we examined the effect of tissue ingrowth on the mechanical properties of coral and HA implants obtained in a similar process to that used before. At 12 weeks the compressive strength of HA was higher in the marrow group than in the controls; it was also higher than that of the wet unimplanted material. The HA blocks did not show resorption. Coral resorbed quickly and lost its compressive strength, which was originally higher than in HA. At three weeks the marrow group was stronger than the control specimens. After six weeks only the marrow group, but not the controls, could be tested. Bone ingrowth seemed to maintain the strength of the coral implant even if it was dissolving.

Moreover, one patient had a posterior interbody fusion, four had laminotomies, and 10 had laminectomies. The causes of the spinal cord or cauda equina compression, as was determined at operation, were extradural abscess in eight patients, bony compressions in 11, arachnoiditis in two, and posterior neural arch tuberculosis in one patient. Neurological recovery began between 10 and 21 days postoperatively. The mean length of follow-up was 42.36 months (range 8-144 months). Fourteen patients were found to be functionally and neurologically normal at follow-up examinations (63%). Eighty-two percent recovered sufficiently to walk unaided. Two patients were left paralysed and unable to walk. Two patients were able to get about on crutches. The onset of objective improvement soon after surgical decompression suggests a causal effect.

Potential barriers to learning CPR included lack of information on CPR classes, perceived lack of intellectual and/or physical capability to learn CPR and concern about causing anxiety in the person at risk of cardiac arrest. Potential barriers to CPR provision included an unknown cardiac arrest victim and fear of infection. The ED provides an opportunity for increasing family and community capacity for bystander intervention through referral to appropriate training."

            "abstract": "A retrospective study of the results of treatment of 177 patients who had sustained a fracture of the proximal femur was undertaken. The social background, type of injury, operation performed, duration of stay after operation, mortality and morbidity were recorded and compared with the results published by other workers. It is concluded that the Pugh sliding nail system adequately fixes most fractures of the proximal femur. It allows early postoperative mobilization and discharge to the home environment for most patients. The overall mortality and morbidity compares favourably with results published for the dynamic compression screw. Treatment of the elderly patient with a displaced subcapital fracture of the femoral neck remains a problem, due to the high incidence of failure of fixation. It may be that for this group of patients a primary hemiarthroplasty is the treatment of choice. A prospective study to resolve this issue is required. The cost of a Pugh nail is considerably less than that of a dynamic compression screw."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of deferoxamine, an antioxidant, on recovery from ischemia/reperfusion injury after nerve compression. The sciatic nerves of male Sprague-Dawley rats, 370 to 430 g, were subjected to 24 hours of compression with Silastic tubing. The control group received intravenous saline solution at the time of decompression. The therapeutic group received intravenous deferoxamine (50 mg per kilogram) at the time of removal of the Silastic tubing. Nerve tissues within and distal to the compression site were assayed for malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and for growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression, as markers of ischemia/reperfusion injury and nerve regeneration, respectively. In the control group (injury alone), the MDA levels were three times higher than normal during the initial 10 days and returned to normal by 14 days. In contrast, the deferoxamine treatment group had MDA levels that were not significantly different from precompression levels. In the control group, enhanced GAP-43 expression persisted until late in the recovery period. In the deferoxamine treatment group, the increased GAP-43 expression subsided early. The results suggest that the treatment of compressed peripheral nerve with deferoxamine at the time of surgical decompression reduces ischemia/reperfusion injury."

These abnormal vascular structures may cause variable compression of the trachea and/or oesophagus with symptoms ranging from none to severe stridor, dyspnoea, dysphagia and cyanosis. Diagnosis and possible treatment of affected patients require multiple imaging modalities. In the majority of cases, the underlying malformation can be detected by chest radiography and barium oesophagography, visualizing the location of the aortic arch and the presence of anomalous compressions of the trachea and/or oesophagus. However, in most cases the exact configuration of the vascular abnormality cannot be fully defined with conventional radiology alone. MRI is fundamental for evaluation of the thoracic vessels. Not only is it non-invasive, but it can also provide large-field-of-view images in any number of planes with three-dimensional reconstruction, adding valuable information about exact vascular configuration, tracheobronchial compression and brachiocephalic vessel branching. The aim of this review is to describe the imaging findings in children affected with special emphasis on MRI."

Increasing use of percutaneous interventional cardiac procedures has created pseudoaneurysms with a large-caliber arterial defect, often in patients who are placed immediately on anticoagulation therapy. This report describes the prospectively collected information from our vascular laboratory regarding ultrasound-guided compression of these pseudoaneurysms after cardiac procedures, both interventional and diagnostic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Since March 1994 prospective data collection for patients who have undergone pseudoaneurysm compression in our vascular laboratory has recorded information including cardiac procedure, size of catheter or sheath, coagulation parameters, pseudoaneurysm size and location, and time to compression. Forty-one patients underwent attempted ultrasound-guided pseudoaneurysm compression after cardiac procedures: 19 after cardiac catheterization alone, seven after angioplasty, one after atherectomy, two after insertion and subsequent removal of an intraaortic balloon pump, and 12 after coronary stenting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Compression was successful overall in 88% of the patients (36 of 41).

A sheath size of 9F or greater was a significant factor in predicting unsuccessful compression (three of eight vs two of 33; p = 0.04).

The presence of abnormal coagulation parameters was not identified as a risk factor for compression failure and should not dissuade attempted compression. Stent placement was more likely to result in unsuccessful compression, and this appeared to be a result of the larger size of the arterial defect. Even in this setting, compression achieved obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm in more than half of the patients."

In nine such fractures, median nerve compression occurred in eight. Lack of recognition led to the delay in diagnosis and treatment of two patients. The volar fragment could always be seen on the first postreduction roentgenogram.

The proportion of survivors within a type of EMS provider system as well as response times were compared. This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical intervention trial enrolled 874 prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest patients encountered by prehospital urban, suburban, and rural regional EMS area. Population density (patients per square mile) calculation allowed classification into urban (>2000/mi2), suburban (>400/mi2), and rural (0-399/mi2) systems. This group underwent standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) intervention with or without early empiric administration of bicarbonate in a 1-mEq/kg dose. A group of demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic variables were analyzed for their effect on survival. Times were measured from collapse until onset of medical intervention and survival measured as the presence of ED vital signs on arrival. Data analysis used chi-squared with Pearson correlation for survivorship and Student t test comparisons for response times. The overall survival rate was approximately 13.9% (110 of 793), ranging from 9% rural, 14% for suburban, and 23% for urban sites for 372 patients (P=.007). Survival differences were associated with classification of arrest locale in this sample-best for urban, suburban, followed by rural sites. There was no difference in time to bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but medical response time (basic life support) was decreased for suburban or urban sites, and intervention (ACLS) and transport times were decreased for suburban sites alone. Although response times were differentiated by location, they were not necessarily predictive of survival. Factors other than response time such as patient population or resuscitation skill could influence survival from cardiac arrest occurring in diverse prehospital service areas."

Bystanders initiated CPR for 579 patients (bystander CPR); for the remaining 718 patients, CPR was delayed until the arrival of EMTs (delayed CPR). Survival was significantly better (P less than 0.05) in the bystander-CPR group (32%) than in the delayed-CPR group (22%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the superior survival in the bystander-CPR group was due almost entirely to the much earlier initiation of CPR (1.9 minutes for the Bystander-CPR group and 5.7 minutes for the delayed-CPR group; P less than 0.001). There were significantly more people with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the bystander-CPR group (80%) than in the delayed-CPR group (68%); and, for people in VF, the survival rate was significantly better if they had received bystander-CPR (37% versus 29%). The authors conclude that early initiation of CPR by bystanders significantly improves survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and they suggest that it may do so by prolonging the duration of VF after collapse and by increasing cardiac susceptibility to defibrillation. The benefit of this early CPR, however, appears to exist within a rather narrow window of effectiveness. It must be started within 4-6 minutes from the time of collapse and must be followed within 10-12 minutes of the collapse by advanced life support in order to be effective."

Since 1989, 5000 instructor-trainers have taught more than 50,000 instructors who have taught nearly 2 million of Sweden's 9 million inhabitants adult CPR. This is equivalent to one new rescuer per 100 inhabitants every year in Sweden. In addition, since 1989, there are 51,000 new rescuers in Advanced Life Support (ALS), since 1996, 41,000 new Basic Life Support (BLS) rescuers with Automated External Defibrillation (AED) training, and since 1998, there are 93,000 new rescuers in child CPR. As a result of this CPR training the number of bystander CPR attempts for OHCA in Sweden increased from 31% in 1992 to 55% in 2007.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      By using a cascade principle for CPR education nearly 2 million rescuers were educated in Sweden (9 million inhabitants) between 1989 and 2007.

There was an increase in survivors from 4%, prior to OH-DEFIB, to 9% of all cardiac arrests, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.3). However, long term survival amongst immediate survivors was associated with a statistically significant improvement following the introduction of OH-DEFIB (15 of 30 (50%) vs. 2 of 19 (10.5%), P < 0.01). Mean call-out, at-scene and transfer times did not significantly vary between survivors and non-survivors. A total of 155 (72%) had a known cardiac history, with the majority (74%) of arrests occurring at home. Of 134 witnessed arrests, only 46 (34%) underwent bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A programme in CPR aimed at relatives of known cardiac patients, and the adoption of a paramedic protocol which improves oxygenation at the time of arrest are recommended."

Temporal changes in expression following IGF-1 treatment were generally slower than that following compression. Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups within which the pairings, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-1 and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed, suggesting inherent regulation and feedback in chondrocyte gene expression.

            "abstract": "Survival rates following cardiopulmonary resuscitation differ widely with regard to the diverse rescue systems where the investigations were performed, and also with regard to the different patient populations. From 1981 to 1986, 1037 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were investigated in the city of Bonn. It was the purpose of this study to differentiate between various patient populations and to analyze factors which are responsible for CPR success. Survival rates following CPR could be increased from 8% in 1981 to 23% in 1984. Thereafter, a relatively stable survival rate of 20.1 +/- 1.7% with an initial CPR success rate of 62.5 +/- 8.1% was observed. Patients with ventricular fibrillation showed significantly higher survival rates (33.2 +/- 2.9%) when compared to asystolic victims (11.3 +/- 1.9%). The worst results were seen in these patients where CPR was initiated following trauma (8%) or in paediatric patients (8%). Factors which significantly determine survival following CPR are: initial ECG finding, therapeutic delay with regard to bystander-initiated basic life support, as well as advanced life support by emergency physicians. In addition, well standardized therapeutical strategies are of importance with early defibrillation, rapid endotracheal intubation and swift epinephrine application mostly by endobronchial administration."

Over an 8-week period, our EMS dispatchers were given new procedures to provide T-CPR. We then collected data on all non-traumatic cardiac arrests within our state (Vaud, Switzerland) for the following 12 months. For each event, the dispatchers had to record in writing the reason they either ruled out cardiac arrest (CA) or did not propose T-CPR in the event they did suspect CA. All emergency call recordings were reviewed by the medical director of the EMS.

The results in terms of T-CPR delivery rate and false positive are similar to those found in previous studies. We found our results satisfying the given short time frame of this study. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the quality of emergency services at moderate or even no additional costs and this should be of interest to all EMS that do not presently benefit from using T-CPR procedures. EMS that currently do not offer T-CPR should consider implementing this technique as soon as possible, and we expect our experience may provide answers to those planning to incorporate T-CPR in their daily practice."

There was an considerable increase of the relative numbers of both large and small fibres as well as changes in the proportions of the types of fibre. The most dramatic percentage change in type of fibre was in the semimembranosus when compressed at 350 mmHg, which showed an increase of the relative frequency of fibres with type 2AB staining characteristics from 10.2% to 18.0% (p < 0.001). Extreme changes in fibre area were found exclusively in semimembranosus and biceps femoris. Most fibres of abnormal size were of type 2, type 2B fibre areas being the most affected.

Experiment C: Part 1: C6 and C7 lateral mass screws (C6C7LM); then Part 2: retested after augmentation with triple wiring (C6C7LM+W). Thus, five different constructs were biomechanically compared in these three experiments.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      None of the lateral mass constructs demonstrated a significant increase in normalized stiffness when augmented with wiring in any mode of testing. In axial compression, the C7PS construct showed significantly higher (P < 0.001) normalized stiffness than any of the other four constructs. In extension, there were no significant differences among any of the five constructs. Inflexion, right/left lateral bending and right/left axial torsion, the C7PS construct again showed significantly higher normalized stiffness (P < 0.05) than lateral mass fixation at C7 alone. However, in these five modes of testing, the addition of a secondary point of lateral mass fixation at C6 (C6C7LM) produced a construct with a normalized stiffness similar to that of C7PS with no significant difference (P > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      C7 pedicle screw fixation provides the construct with the highest normalized stiffness for stabilizing the cervicothoracic junction. If C7 pedicle fixation is not possible, then performing two-level lateral mass fixation at C6 and C7 will achieve a construct with similar normalized stiffness except in axial compression. The addition of triple wiring to the spinous processes does not significantly increase lateral mass construct normalized stiffness."

Three polymers were prepared by reacting methyl 2,6-diisocyanato hexanoate functionalised D: -glucose as prepolymer A with either polycaprolactone triol alone or with addition of 10 mol% zwitterion as prepolymer B. All polymer compositions were mixed with 10 wt% hydrated gelatin beads. The cured polymers with the gelatin beads showed compression strengths that were still suitable for use in articular cartilage repair. The incorporation of zwitterions yielded more hydrophilic polymers that showed increased water absorption and increased porosity. After four months degradation in phosphate buffered saline, the polymers containing zwitterions had approximately 50% mass loss compared with 30% mass loss for that with polycaprolactone triol alone. All polymers were non-toxic in chondrocyte-based assays. Subcutaneous implantation of these polymers into rats confirmed that the polymers degraded slowly. Only a very mild inflammatory response was observed and the polymers were able to support new, well vascularised tissue formation."

            "abstract": "Sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses are blunted in the vascular beds of contracting muscle (functional sympatholysis), but the mechanism(s) have been difficult to elucidate. We tested the hypothesis that the mechanical effects of muscle contraction blunt sympathetic vasoconstriction in human muscle. We measured forearm blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and calculated the reductions in forearm vascular conductance (FVC) in response to reflex increases in sympathetic activity evoked via lower body negative pressure (LBNP). In protocol 1, eight young adults were studied under control resting conditions and during simulated muscle contractions using rhythmic forearm cuff inflations (20 inflations/min) with cuff pressures of 50 and 100 mmHg with the arm below heart level (BH), as well as 100 mmHg with the arm at heart level (HL). Forearm vasoconstrictor responses (%DeltaFVC) during LBNP were -26 +/- 2% during control conditions and were not blunted by simulated contractions (range = -31 +/- 3% to -43 +/- 6%). In protocol 2, eight subjects were studied under control conditions and during rhythmic handgrip exercise (20 contractions/min) using workloads of 15% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) at HL and BH (similar metabolic demand, greater mechanical muscle pump effect for the latter) and 5% MVC BH alone and in combination with superimposed forearm compressions of 100 mmHg (similar metabolic demand, greater mechanical component of contractions for the latter). The forearm vasoconstrictor responses during LBNP were blunted during 15% MVC exercise with the arm at HL (-1 +/- 3%) and BH (-2 +/- 3%) compared with control (-25 +/- 3%; both P < 0.005) but were intact during both 5% MVC alone (-24 +/- 4%) and with superimposed compressions (-23 +/- 4%). We conclude that mechanical effects of contraction per se do not cause functional sympatholysis in the human forearm and that this phenomenon appears to be coupled with the metabolic demand of contracting skeletal muscle."

He had suffered a heart attack 8 months previously, and was found unconscious with respiratory arrest in his garden one morning. Due to the proximity to the ambulance station, the paramedics were on the scene within three minutes. A chain-saw was lying beside him, but no external injuries were seen. The patient had no radial pulse, central cyanosis and respiratory gasps approximately every 30 seconds. Ventilation with bag and mask was given, and soon a femoral pulse could be palpated. Blood sugar was elevated and ECG (electrocardiogram) was normal. GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) was 3. Upon arrival of the physician staffed air ambulance, further examination revealed bilateral miosis of the pupils and continuing bradypnoea. Naloxone was given with an immediate effect and the patient woke up. The patient denied intake of narcotics, but additional information from the dispatch centre revealed that he was hepatitis C positive. After a few hours, the patient admitted to have obtained a fentanyl transdermal patch from an acquaintance, having chewed it before falling unconscious.

            "abstract": "In the present work, the load-bearing role of the facet joints in a lumbar I2-3 segment is quantitatively determined by means of a three dimensional nonlinear finite element program. The analysis accounts for both material and geometric nonlinearities and treats the facet articulation as a nonlinear moving contact problem. The disc nucleus is considered as an inviscid incompressible fluid and the annulus as a composite of collagenous fibres embedded in a matrix of ground substance. The spinal ligaments are modelled as a collection of nonlinear axial elements. The loadings consist of axial compression and sagittal plane shears and bending moments, acting alone or combined. The results show that in pure compression, the external axial force is transmitted primarily by the intervertebral disc. The facet joints carry only a small percentage of the force. However, the facet joints carry large forces in extension, whereas in small flexion they carry none. Addition of compression tends to increase these contact forces in extension while it has no effect on them in flexion. In extension, the forces on the facet joints are transmitted by both the articular surfaces and the capsular ligaments. Although in small flexion the facets carry no load, large contact forces are predicted to develop as the segment is flexed beyond 7-8 degrees. These forces are of the same magnitude as those computed under large extension rotation and are oriented nearly in the horizontal plane with negligible component in the axial direction. The horizontal components of the contact forces generated during articulation are often larger than the axial components which directly resist the applied compressive force. The axial components of the contact forces, therefore, grossly underestimate the total forces acting on the facets. The transfer of forces from one facet to the adjacent one occurs through distinct areas in flexion and in extension loadings. That is, on the superior articular surface, the contact area shifts from the upper tip in large flexion to the lower margin in extension. On the inferior articular surface, the contact area shifts from the upper and central regions in large flexion to the lower tip in extension."

The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment has been a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it is unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and which compression garment is the most effective.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials of the clinical effectiveness of compression bandage or stocking systems in the treatment of venous leg ulceration.Specific questions addressed by the review are:1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective?\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (14/10/08); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2008); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to October Week 1 2008); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 41) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to October Week 1 2008). No date or language restrictions were applied.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression hosiery were eligible for inclusion. Comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. Trials had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). Secondary outcomes of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of trials.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 39 RCTs reporting 47 comparisons were included.Review question 1: there was reasonable evidence from seven RCTs that venous ulcers heal more rapidly with compression than without.Review question 2: findings from six trials of single-component compression suggested that this strategy was less effective than multi-component compression. Evidence from compression systems with two components (3 trials) and three components (4 trials) suggested better outcomes when an elastic component was included. Different versions of compression with four-components (based on the Charing Cross four-layer bandage system) have similar effectiveness (3 trials). Compression with four components (variants of the Charing Cross four-layer bandage) is more effective than multi-component compression that includes a short-stretch bandage (6 trials). It is difficult to determine the relative effectiveness of the four-layer bandage compared with paste bandage systems because of differences in the paste systems (5 trials). There was no difference in effectiveness between the adjustable compression boot and compression bandages (2 trials) or between single-layer compression stockings and paste bandages (2 trials). Two-layer stockings appeared more effective than the short-stretch bandage (2 trials). The relative effectiveness of tubular compression when compared with compression bandages was not clear from current evidence (2 trials).Three trials reported ulcer recurrence; because of sparseness of data and trials not being primarily designed to assess this outcome, firm conclusions could not be drawn. Although several trials included cost data, only one reported a rigorously conducted cost-effectiveness analysis with findings suggesting that the four-layer bandage was more cost-effective than multi-component compression comprising a short-stretch bandage. Seven trials assessed health-related quality of life and none observed significant differences between treatment groups. Several trials evaluated pain either as a stand-alone outcome, or as part of the assessment of adverse events. In general, the data did not indicate clear differences between treatment groups. It is possible that stockings could be associated with less pain than bandages but in view of scarcity of available data this requires further evaluation. Many of the trials reported adverse events and / or withdrawals. Overall, these outcomes appeared similar across different treatment groups.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents."

Postsurgical cases, those with significant risk factors, or patients with chronic conditions are candidates for these procedures to assess evolving risk factors and detect life-threatening events. A small sensing device can be implanted subcutaneously to assess the ECG, transmitting status and alerts to local caregivers or a remote monitoring service. We and others have shown that a differential electrode pair with only 2- to 3-cm spacing can produce QRS amplitudes greater than 1 mV, sufficient to accurately identify asystole, tachyarrhythmias, and ST-segment changes. Medtronic's REVEAL and St Jude Medical's CONFIRM are implantable look recorders (ILRs) with a single pair of subcutaneous electrodes mounted on the surface of the case (6 × 2 × 0.7 cm). They store representative rhythm strips when the heart rate exceeds preset limits or when the patient presses a button on the accompanying actuator. These records may be transferred for physician review during a subsequent office visit. Transoma's SLEUTH is a similar ILR, except that one of the electrodes is at the end of a 6-cm lead tunneled under the skin and the wider separation may result in a larger ECG amplitude. Instead of storing the records, SLEUTH transmits them through the skin to a home base unit, which sends them via telephone to a monitoring service. Angel Medical's ALERT system also has a tunneled lead, but one that is introduced pervenously into the right ventricle hoping to detect ST changes in addition to rhythm abnormalities. Advanced multivector ILR devices with integrated event alerting are rapidly approaching commercialization. AJ Medical Devices' CARDIOALARM (4 × 4 × 0.6 cm) has 4 electrodes at the corners of the square package, arranged as 2 orthogonal recording pairs that can produce a robust signal that is relatively immune to signal fluctuations caused by changes in the direction of cardiac activation and patient's body position. This permits accurate identification of dramatic changes in the ECG pattern, such as those occurring in ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic tachycardia. Because of this feature, CARDIOALARM can detect cardiac arrest, and its external receiver can alert bystanders to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation and can automatically summon Emergency Medical Services. In the future, addition of other sensors, integration of data streams via body surface wireless networks, and real-time interpretive algorithms will allow enhanced monitoring systems to more generally assess evolving risks, the impacts of therapeutic interventions, and patient compliance with rehabilitative programs. When coupled to remote medical monitoring services, these devices have the potential to dramatically impact patient outcomes by lessening the diagnostic dependence on symptom recognition and decreasing event response times. Significant cost savings may also be realized through more efficient use of specialist resources, reduction in the number of office visits to physicians, and long-term improvements in patient health. Structural and behavior barriers to adoption need to be addressed for these methods to reach their full potential, addressing patient privacy concerns, adequate reimbursement, and integration into standard care protocols."

            "abstract": "Where pain of the musculoskeletal system is present, commonly, this pain is without objective evidence of disease, trauma, or disorder. Absence of an apparent cause for common pain prompts the consideration of mechanical stress as a contributing factor. The principal stress of the musculoskeletal system is postural. By posture it is usually meant the distribution of body mass with respect to gravity. Past efforts to predict chronic pain by postural analysis or to reduce such pain by strengthening, conscious control or splinting of posture has had marginal success. Past failure to relate posture to pain is attributable to (1) ubiquity of sub-optimal posture that precludes clinical comparison to those with optimal posture; (2) presupposition that the causal relation between posture and pain is of the observational class of causality rather than the manipulable kind; (3) a definition of posture that is too narrow to complete the picture; and (4) inadequate methods for reduction of postural asymmetry to an extent that is sufficient to elicit a significant and enduring effect on sub-optimal posture and related pain. Posture can be defined more broadly as the stance of the body performing within the boundaries of posture and which is mediated by the Postural Control System towards greatest stability (Fx. 1). The stance of the body is the arrangement of the body with respect to gravity and other accelerative forces. The postural boundaries are the set of forces that resist acceleration and thereby provide the limits within which one functions stably, and this resistance is currently approximated by six principal sources of resistance to acceleration: viscous, elastic, neuromuscular, rigid, viscoelastic, and inertial. The Postural Control System is located in the brainstem and modulates body stance to more economically and stably effect and resist acceleration. The rigid boundaries can be so with respect to compressive, tractive, or tensile qualities that permits three kinds of motion: translation, rotation and oscillation. An example of postural boundaries that are rigid with respect to compression and tensile character are the bones that bear weight. In contrast, ligaments provide a tractive rigidity and musculotendons a relatively elastic boundary. Joint surfaces are considered boundaries that are rigid but not perfectly so. Of fundamental importance are those joints that arc lowermost in a column of the musculoskeletal system namely: (1) the feet and ankles that support the entirety of the musculoskeletal system and; (2) the base of the sacrum that supports the vertebral spine. This broadened definition of posture leads to a greatly enhanced manipulability of posture in the upright stance and alleviation of more than two-thirds of common pain by the coherent combination of (1) manual manipulation to reduce somatic dysfunction; (2) foot orthotics to optimize the amplitude of the arches of the feet and vertically align the ankle; (3) a heel lift to level the sacral base; (4) and a group of therapeutic postures configured to minimize restriction of peripheral soft tissue reflective of the earlier posture, all aimed to optimize posture. Mediated by the postural control system, manipulation of postural boundaries accordingly modifies the structure and function of the entire musculoskeletal system. Typically, this relief is maintained by foot orthotic and heel lift alone without maintenance by manual manipulation, medication, or exercise."

We reviewed the Vienna emergency medical services dispatch centre tape recordings, ambulance run sheets and the hospital charts of 114 patients suffering from atraumatic cardiac arrest. Analysis showed that in 59 cases the arrest occurred in the victim's home. The telephone and the patient were either in the same or in adjoining rooms in 55% of the calls. We did not experience any technical or language difficulties. The caller and victim were related in 51 cases. The callers were completely calm in 77% and fairly calm in an additional 15%. Not one caller was distraught. Our data show that most objections to the feasibility of pre-arrival instructions can be refuted.

            "abstract": "Instrumented presses used in tabletting research and development are normally equipped to measure punch force and displacement. Die-wall monitoring is rare, probably because instrumentation and calibration are quite difficult. The authors critically examine the tenets of radial pressure measurement in compression physics. The theoretical background concerning axial to radial stress transmission during the different phases of the compression cycle is presented. The literature reporting on the use of radial stress measurement to assess the self-lubricating properties of materials or the effect of lubricants is reviewed. Examples of interpretation of radial pressure cycles to define the basic material behaviour are given. The influence of particle size and shape as well as that of process and formulation variables on die-wall response are also discussed. Substantial inconsistencies can be seen in the literature with respect to the interpretation of experimental data, often because of the poor reliability of results and mostly because powders are essentially not solid, isotropic bodies. There is also a distinct lack of complementary tabletting parameters that would help understanding their comparative benefits. For this reason, original data on 13 model compounds are presented together with a classification of the materials encountered in pharmaceutical tabletting, based on selected parameters. In conclusion, none of the determined parameters, including those derived from radial pressure measurement, is able, alone, to predict the material behaviour under compression. Although die-wall instrumentation contributes little to the development of improved tablet formulations, it is valuable for characterising the mechanical properties of the materials. This is particularly advantageous given that the mechanical properties account for variations in tabletting performance to a much greater extent than the magnitude of the interparticulate attractions. Nevertheless, because of the peculiar nature of powders compared to solid, isotropic bodies, there is a need to develop new models for analysing their behaviour and to put more emphasis on examination of time-dependent deformation in the later stage of the compression cycle."

This study assesses the feasibility, recanalization rate, and complications of the 2 techniques in an animal model.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty cranial vessels of 7 swine were occluded by injection of radiopaque thrombi. Fifteen vessel occlusions were treated by PTA alone and 15, by placement of a stent and postdilation. Recanalization was documented immediately after treatment and after 1, 2, and 3 hours. Thromboembolic events and dissections were documented.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PTA was significantly faster to perform (mean, 16.6 minutes versus 33.0 minutes for stent placement; P < .001), but the mean recanalization rate after 1 hour was significantly better after stent placement compared with PTA alone (67.5% versus 14.6%, P < .001). Due to the self-expanding force of the stent, vessel diameter further increased with time, whereas the recanalization result after PTA was prone to reocclusion. Besides thromboembolic events related to the passing maneuvers at the occlusion site, no thrombus fragmentation and embolization occurred during balloon inflation or stent deployment. Flow to side branches could also be restored at the occlusion site because it was possible to direct thrombus compression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Stent placement and postdilation proved to be much more efficient in terms of acute and short-term vessel recanalization compared with PTA alone."

Biphase-coded pulses were constructed to excite the transducer. Received signals were compressed with mismatched filters optimized by minimizing peak-sidelobe-level (PSL). Both simulation and experiments were carried out to demonstrate the advantage of this technique. The simulation results demonstrated a possible sidelobe reduction (<-90 dB) with a slightly decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio of less than 1 dB compared with the compression using matched filters alone. The experimental results showed about 14 dB SNR improvement as well as -40 dB sidelobe level when the Barker-13 code excitation with 3-cycle sinusoidal wave carrier was used."

            "abstract": "A paper published in various US journals on Emergency Medicine in 1997, has raised considerable concerns. The authors question if it is justified to continue to recommend initial ventilation as part of basic CPR when performed by lay-bystanders. A few aspects need to be discussed and some questions have to be answered before any changes in the current recommendations may even be considered: e.g. 1. How convincing does the available evidence support the following hypotheses: 1.1. Lay CPR without mouth-to-mouth-ventilation provides better outcome after cardiac arrest than lay CPR with mouth-to-mouth-ventilation. 1.2. Endotracheal intubation may be detrimental in patients suffering from hemodynamic compromises, particularly from VF. 2. Is it scientifically and ethically acceptable to design and perform prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of those components of BCLS and ACLS which have in accordance with AHA-, ERC Guidelines and ILCOR Statements in the past been applied in millions of cardiac arrest victims and have obviously enabled the patients to lead a meaningful life after survival; under conditions of the proposed study design patients of the study group would be left without the treatment option ventilation, thus diminishing their chances of survival. Ad 1: The arguments presented by the authors are hardly convincing. The authors themselves state elsewhere that reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth-ventilation should not represent a major problem because most cardiac arrests of cardiac etiology occur at home and in the presence of a relative or friend. Moreover, unreliable recommendations for mouth-to-mouth-ventilation (AHA), lack of training, retention of skills and knowledge, and a deficit in motivation include the main causes of the disappointingly low figures of bystander CPR worldwide. This situation cannot be improved simply by eliminating a lifesaving component of CPR-ventilation. Instead, the proposal to abandon the administration of unreasonably high ventilation volumes (800-1200 ml/breath) from the present guidelines and to recommend volumes ranging from 400-500 ml/breath recently made by the ERC should be given serious consideration. Furthermore, equipment and training manikins need to be adapted to these more reasonable volumes. Independently of the mechanisms of slow decreases in SaO2 after cardiac arrest (provided no compressions are performed) independently of gasping, ventilatory effects of standard compression or ACD-HCPR in the absence of mouth-to-mouth-ventilation, it is essential to realise that the patient's airways need to be maintained open at all times (this is unlike animal experiments where the airways are primarily kept open by the respective tissue structures): The minimum requirement of First Responder CPR is the guarantee that open airways are maintained. It may possibly be discussed if the present sequence of ABC might be changed to CAB, a practice adopted in the Netherlands many years ago, however, outcome trials an CAB have not been published to date. In addition, greater demands should be made of training requirements in BLS, attendance of refresher courses should be required, and other groups of the population should be included into these programmes than only relatives or friends of patients at risk of a cardiac arrest. The programmes need to be made mandatory for greater variety of groups and individuals to increase the efficacy and efficiency of bystander resuscitation. The hypotheses made by the above-mentioned authors are neither scientifically nor ethically acceptable. Ad 2: Pepe's argument regarding the efficacy of endotracheal intubation (ETI) in VF-patients has not been scientifically proven and lacks conclusive evidence. ETI serves to protect the airways and lungs against aspiration of regurgitated material and to facilitate artificial ventilation including PEEP, both under anaesthesia and resuscitation. The efficacy of ETI in the OR has long b"

            "abstract": "High-frequency airway clearance assist devices generate either positive or negative transrespiratory pressure excursions to produce high-frequency, small-volume oscillations in the airways. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation creates a positive transrespiratory pressure by injecting short, rapid inspiratory flow pulses into the airway opening and relies on chest wall elastic recoil for passive exhalation. High-frequency chest wall compression generates a negative transrespiratory pressure by compressing the chest externally to cause short, rapid expiratory flow pulses, and relies on chest wall elastic recoil to return the lungs to functional residual capacity. High-frequency chest wall oscillation uses a chest cuirass to generate biphasic changes in transrespiratory pressure. In any case (positive or negative pressure pulses or both), the general idea is get air behind secretions and move them toward the larger airways, where they can be coughed up and expectorated. These techniques have become ubiquitous enough to constitute a standard of care. Yet, despite over 20 years of research, clinical evidence of efficacy for them is still lacking. Indeed, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any single airway clearance technique, let alone judge any one of them superior. Aside from patient preference and capability, cost-effectiveness studies based on existing clinical data are necessary to determine when a given technique is most practical."

Small cylindrical specimens of cartilage, isolated from the femoral head of the hip joint and from the femoral condyles of the knee joint, were subjected to a suddenly applied compressive load using a test apparatus designed to yield a transient oscillatory response. From this response values of the elastic stiffness and the viscous damping coefficient were determined. Cathepsin D and cathepsin B1 were used to digest the proteoglycan in some specimens, while in other specimens leukocyte elastase was used to attack the non-helical terminal regions of the Type II tropocollagen molecules and possibly the Type IX collagen molecule and thereby disturb the integrity of the collagen mesh. The results showed that proteoglycan digestion alone reduced the viscous damping coefficient but it did not significantly alter the elastic stiffness as determined from the oscillatory response. In contrast, the action of elastase reduced both the damping coefficient and the elastic stiffness of the cartilage. The results demonstrated the role of proteoglycans in regulating fluid transport in cartilage and hence controlling the time-dependent viscous properties. The elastic stiffness was shown to be dependent on the integrity of the collagen fibre network and not on the proteoglycans."

Rats lived singly in test cages, where they were trained to repeatedly execute a flicker-frequency visual discrimination for food. After learning was complete, all rats were surgically prepared and then retested over the following 4-5 days to ensure recovery to presurgery levels of performance. Rats were then assigned to one of three groups [FPI + Hypoxia (IH), FPI + Normoxia (IN), or Sham Injury + Hypoxia (SH)] and were anesthetized with halothane delivered by compressed air. Immediately after injury or sham injury, rats in groups IH and SH were switched to a 13% O2 source to continue halothane anesthesia for 30 min before being returned to their test cages. Anesthesia for rats in group IN was maintained using compressed air for 30 min after injury. FPI significantly reduced visual discrimination accuracy and food intake, and increased incorrect choices. Thirty minutes of immediate posttraumatic hypoxemia significantly (1) exacerbated the FPI-induced reductions of visual discrimination accuracy and food intake, (2) further increased numbers of incorrect choices, and (3) delayed the progressive recovery of visual discrimination accuracy. Thionine stains of midbrain coronal sections revealed that, in addition to the loss of neurons seen in several thalamic nuclei following FPI, cell loss in the ipsilateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLG) was significantly greater after FPI and hypoxemia than after FPI alone. In contrast, neuropathological changes were not evident following hypoxemia alone. These results show that, although hypoxemia alone was without effect, posttraumatic hypoxemia exacerbates FPI-induced reductions in visual discrimination accuracy and secondary hypoxemia interferes with control of the rat's choices by flicker frequency, perhaps in part as a result of neuronal loss and fiber degeneration in the dLG. These results additionally confirm the utility of this visual discrimination procedure as a sensitive, noninvasive means of assessing behavioral function after experimental traumatic brain injury."

Luting composite shrinkage was simulated at a baseline temperature of 20 degrees C.

Compression intensity was related to geometry and ratio of thicknesses between the ceramic and luting composite (CER/CPR). Lower ratios produced higher compression forces in the ceramic. When thermal loads were combined to the composite shrinking forces, the stress pattern was significantly changed only for the experimental conditions with the lowest CER/CPR ratio. Temperature increase reduced compressive stresses and exacerbated tensile stresses. Thermal loads were simulated alone (situation of an \"ideal nonshrinking\" luting composite) and generated mainly tensile stresses in the ceramic, which intensity was again modulated by the CER/CPR ratio and the local geometry of composite and ceramic. Because of ceramic brittleness, these tensile forces were more detrimental than the high compression created by composite shrinkage alone. The stress pattern was not influenced by the incisal length of the veneer but rather by the facial thickness of ceramic. The worst record made with a shrinking luting agent (500 microm of luting composite, lowest CER/CPR ratio, 5 degrees C) was much less harmful than the worst record made with a hypothetical \"nonshrinking\" luting material.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The ratio of the thickness of cement and luting composite appears to have a relevant influence on the stress distribution in porcelain laminates.

BLS includes a sequence of steps or maneuvers that should be performed sequentially: ensuring the safety of rescuer and child, assessing unconsciousness, calling for help, positioning the victim, opening the airway, assessing breathing, ventilating, assessing signs of circulation and/or central arterial pulse, performing chest compressions, activating the emergency medical service system, and checking the results of resuscitation. The most important changes in the new guidelines are the compression: ventilation ratio and the algorithm for relieving foreign body airway obstruction.

Vascular decompression is an effective treatment for patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have vertebrobasilar compression of the trigeminal nerve.

Three prediction models of survival were developed from the perspective of the different contributors active in out-of-hospital resuscitation: model I, bystanders; model II, first responders; and model III, paramedics. Predictors for survival (with odds ratio) were: in model I (bystanders): emergency medical service (EMS) witnessed arrest (0.50), delay to basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (0.74/min) and delay to EMS arrival (0.87/min); in model II (first responders): initial recorded heart rhythm (0.02 for nonshockable rhythm), delay to basic CPR (0.71/min and 0.87/min for shockable and nonshockable rhythms) and to defibrillation (0.89/min), and in model III (paramedics): need for advanced CPR (4.74 for advanced CPR not-needed), initial recorded heart rhythm (0.05 for nonshockable rhythm), and delay to basic CPR (0.77/min and 0.72/min for shockable and nonshockable rhythms), to defibrillation and to advanced CPR for shockable rhythms (0.85/min), and to advanced CPR for nonshockable rhythm (0.85/min).

For the brush, the mean-field results agree with the Alexander-de Gennes scaling result at moderate compressions and also provide an analytical expression for the force without any unknown parameters.

It is based on 1- to 10 microm-sized gas microbubbles, which can cross the capillary beds of the lungs and are effective echo enhancers. It is known that high cell density, high transendothelial fluid exchange, and poorly functioning lymphatic circulation all provoke solid stress, which compresses vessels and drastically reduces tumor blood flow. Given their size, we supposed that the perfusion of microbubbles is affected by anatomic features of tumor vessels more than are contrast agents traditionally used in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Here, we compared dynamic information obtained from CEUS and DCE-MRI on two experimental tumor models exhibiting notable differences in vessel anatomy. We found that tumors with small, flattened vessels show a much higher resistance to microbubble perfusion than to MRI contrast agents, and appear scarcely vascularized at CEUS examination, despite vessel volume adequate for normal function. Thus, whereas CEUS alone could induce incorrect diagnosis when tumors have small or collapsed vessels, integrated analysis using CEUS and DCE-MRI allows in vivo identification of tumors with a vascular profile frequently associated with malignant phenotypes."

            "abstract": "Forty-three patients with renal-cell carcinoma underwent treatment for spinal cord compression over a 7-year period. Of these, 32 patients underwent surgery, while 11 patients underwent radiation alone. Before operation, 25 patients had relapsed following prior radiation, while seven others received postoperative radiation. A more aggressive surgical approach, tailored to the site of compression within the spinal canal, was used with the majority undergoing gross total tumor resection by an anterior approach. Immediate stability of the spine was achieved with methyl-methacrylate reconstruction of the resected segments. Preoperative spinal angiography with embolization of hypervascular tumors was carried out in eight patients. Patient parameters in the surgical and irradiated groups were comparable, except that a greater proportion of the radiation alone group had more than one organ system involved (64% v 44%). The median survival of the surgically treated patients was 13 months, compared with 3 months for those treated by radiation alone. In addition, a greater proportion of the surgically treated patients were benefitted neurologically (70%) compared with those treated by radiation (45%). With the development of effective surgical treatment for spinal metastases, early consideration for surgical treatment (before radiation) should be considered in selected patients. Preoperative spinal angiography and embolization are recommended whenever feasible to minimize intraoperative blood loss."

            "abstract": "Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium with accumulation of serous or fibrinous inflammatory products. In cattle, it is almost always attributable to a reticular foreign body that has penetrated the reticular wall, diaphragm and pericardial sac. The lead signs of pericarditis are tachycardia, muffled heart sounds, asynchronous abnormal heart sounds, distension of the jugular veins and submandibular, brisket and ventral abdominal oedema. The glutaraldehyde test is an important diagnostic tool because it is positive in >90% of affected cattle. Other common laboratory findings are leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenaemia (indicating inflammation), and elevation of liver enzyme activity (reflecting hepatic congestion). Radiographs of the thorax and reticulum often show a foreign body cranial to the reticulum. In the majority of cases, massive fibrinopurulent adhesions obscure the cardiophrenic angle, cardiac silhouette and ventral diaphragm. Ultrasonography is the method of choice for diagnosis and characterisation of pericardial effusion. Echogenic deposits and strands of fibrin are seen on the epicardium, and the ventricles are compressed by the effusion. Severe pleural effusion is usually evident. In cattle with distension of the jugular veins and tachycardia, the differential diagnosis includes right-sided cardiac insufficiency attributable to other causes. Distension of the jugular veins without signs of right-sided cardiac insufficiency may occur with obstruction or compression of the cranial vena cava. The prognosis is poor, and pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy are inadequate methods of treatment. Thus, prompt and humane euthanasia is indicated for cattle with traumatic reticuloperitonitis. Because a definitive diagnosis of traumatic reticuloperitonitis is not always possible based on clinical signs alone, radiography and ultrasonography of the thorax and reticulum are indicated in doubtful cases."

Each year bystanders initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) approximately 2000 times prior to arrival of emergency medical service (EMS). The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the bystanders psychological reactions to performing CPR. We mailed a questionnaire to all bystanders who reported performing CPR to the CPR Centre of Sweden from autumn 1992 to 1995. The study included 544 bystander reports. Nine factors were found to be associated with bystanders experience in a univariate analysis. Among these were victim outcome (p < 0.0001), CPR duration (p = 0.0009) and their experience of the attitude of the EMS personnel (p = 0.004). In a multivariate logistic regression model, lack of debriefing following the intervention (p = 0.0001) and fatal victim outcome (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of a negative bystander psychological reaction. The importance of having someone to talk to following an intervention and the EMS personnel concern for the rescuer should be emphasised. The goal should be that critical incident debriefing is available to every bystander following his or her CPR attempt."

It is recalled that the standard equation for osmotic pressure equilibrium, which involves pair correlations between colloids only, remains valid in the presence of long-range Coulombic interactions. The entropy of the counterions and the electric field generated by the spatial inhomogeneity are implicitly taken into account in the colloid structure factor through the compressibility equation and local electroneutrality conditions. Limiting the macroscopic analysis to the pure electric-field contribution or, equivalently, to the ideal ionic pressure, corresponds to the incorrect, bare Debye-Huckel approximation for the colloid-colloid correlations. A one-component description with reasonable Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek-type ion-averaged effective pair potential between colloids is sufficient to derive the sedimentation profile of highly charged, weakly screened colloidal suspensions. The macroscopic electric field is directly related to the microscopic electrostatic potential around the colloids."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis and to search for evidence that curcumin reduces bone mineral losses in a dose-dependent manner when endogenous estrogen levels are reduced. Bone mineral density was measured at the spine, femur and whole body before and at 2, 4 and 6 months after ovariectomy in each of 40 mature rats. Serum osteocalcin and C-telopeptide were measured as indicators of bone formation and resorption rates. Femoral compressive strength was measured at 6 months. Ovariectomy alone resulted in loss of mineral from the spine (p<0.005) and an increase in osteocalcin levels (p<0.05). At the same time, there was an increase in energy to fracture (p<0.01) due to an increased bone size. When ovariectomized animals were given etidronate there was no loss of mineral from the spine, the size of the femur increased (p<0.005), C-telopeptide levels were reduced (p<0.001) and femoral compressive strength increased (p<0.025). Administration of curcumin to ovariectomized animals resulted in changes that were intermediate between those produced by etidronate and by ovariectomy alone. The increase in femur size produced by the highest dose of curcumin was statistically significant (p< 0.01) and curcumin administration resulted in a significant, dose dependent, increase in energy to fracture. Curcumin produces beneficial changes in bone turnover and increases in bone strength using the ovariectomized mature rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis."

This study compares outcome of cardiac arrest victims presenting to an emergency department serving a mixed urban/rural area (Norfolk, UK) in 1991 with 1996.

The age distribution, proportion of witnessed arrests, and initial rhythms were similar for the 2 years. In 1996 EMS response time was significantly slower and the proportion of cases where the EMS arrived before arrest was significantly lower. Fewer patients who had a witnessed arrest received immediate bystander CPR in 1996. The number of patients discharged home decreased from 15 in 1991 to 11 in 1996, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The majority of survivors had restoration of spontaneous circulation prior to arrival in the emergency department (14 in 1991 and ten in 1996). Survival was greatest in those arresting in the presence of the EMS (ten in 1991 and nine in 1996). In conclusion changes in EMS provision have resulted in an increase in the response time.

The social status of the patient did not affect the decisions, and advanced age only when combined with important criteria such as arrest times or the relatives' wishes. The only apparent difference between paramedics and doctors was that the reputation of the EMS system influenced only the paramedics.

We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess the bone mineral parameters of 36 swine thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12) and 15 lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5) after removal of the posterior elements. The failure load, compressive stress, and the stored strain energy of these vertebral bodies were assessed by a uniaxial compressive test using an MTS 810 testing system. Multiple regression analysis showed a significantly negative effect of BA and significantly positive effect of BMC on the biomechanical competence (compressive stress, r2 = 0.67, P < 0.0001; failure load, r2 = 0.75, P < 0.0001). However, the stored strain energy was only related to the BMC (r2 = 0.35, P < 0.0001). The contributory effects of BMC and BA on the biomechanical competence were not equal. The effects of BMC was larger than BA in determining the failure load and stored strain energy, whereas the reverse was found for the compressive stress. Using the log-transformed parameters as the regressors resulted in similar results. These results suggested the differential effects of BA and BMC in determining the biomechanical competence of vertebral bodies.

Eight subjects with moderate to severe cochlear hearing loss were tested in a counter-balanced design. Subjects had at least 2 weeks experience with each system in everyday life before evaluation using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) test and measures of speech intelligibility in quiet (AB word lists at 50 and 80 dB SPL) and noise (adoptive sentence lists in speech-shaped noise, or that same noise amplitude modulated with the envelope of speech from a single talker).

However, if the rate of filtration is slow, mechanical dewatering can be expensive. In this study, the use of lignite to improve the sludge dewatering is investigated. The effectiveness of lignite conditioning of polyelectrolyte-flocculated sludge is examined using mechanical compression tests. Results show that lignite conditioning in conjunction with polyelectrolyte flocculation gives much better dewatering than the polyelectrolyte flocculation alone. Using Darcy's filtration theory, the specific cake resistance and permeability of the compressed cakes are obtained. Both of these parameters are significantly improved after lignite conditioning. Mercury porosimetry tests on compressed cakes show that the porosity of the lignite-conditioned sludge cake is much higher than that of the polyelectrolyte-flocculated sludge and it increases with increasing doses of lignite. The mercury porosimetry results show that the lignite pore volume of pores greater than 0.5 microm are reduced with increasing sludge ratio indicating that sludge is trapped within these pores, whereas smaller pores are unaffected. The yield stress curves for sludge, lignite and sludge-lignite mixtures show that the sludge filter cake is very compressible, but the lignite-conditioned cake has a range of compressibility which although more than lignite indicate that the cake is relatively incompressible at low pressures. Thus, lignite conditioning acts to maintain the permeability of the filter cake during compression dewatering by resisting cake compression. This leads to a trade-off between the rate of dewatering and the solids content of the compressed cake. With lignite conditioning, the dewatering rate can be increased by a factor of five for the same degree of water removal."

            "abstract": "The voluntary Swedish Cardiac Arrest Registry has collected and analyzed 14,065 standardised reports on cardiac arrests up until May 1995. The reports have been collected from approximately half of Sweden's ambulance districts, which cover 60% of the population. Resuscitation was attempted in 10,966 cases. The median age was 70 years. In 70.0% the arrest was witnessed, and in 43.3% the first recorded rhythm was VT/VF. Bystander-CPR was initiated in 32.3% of the cases. Most cardiac arrests took place at home (65.8%) and 67.1% were judged to be of cardiac origin. In 1692 cases (15.4%), the patient was admitted alive in hospital and 544 patients (5.0%) were alive after 1 month. Survival to 1 month in the subgroup which presented with VT/VF was 9.5%. We found no significant difference between survival in large cities and smaller communities. The survivors were analysed in relation to time to defibrillation and we found a strong correlation between a short time and increased survival."

            "abstract": "The stabilizing structures of the transverse carpal arch were studied utilizing an analytical model based on a rigid body spring model theory. This method was used to calculate the relative motion between carpal bones, the distribution of compressive forces in the intercarpal joints, and the tensions in the ligaments under simulated dorsopalmar compression. The contribution of each ligament against the effect of compression was determined by removing ligaments from the model. A multivariate analysis of variance disclosed that sectioning the flexor retinaculum alone does not significantly modify the distribution of forces in ligaments and joints (p = 0.33), and decreases dorsopalmar carpal stiffness by only 7.8%. In contrast, isolated removal of the palmar hamate-capitate ligament causes a pronounced weakening of the carpal structure, from an average of 232 to 131 N/mm (p less than 0.01). If the flexor retinaculum is removed in addition to releasing one palmar intercarpal ligament, a gross instability of the carpal arch is created."

Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC. Sixteen control patients continued with medical treatment alone. Outcomes were recorded at baseline, after one month, three months, and six months. The study examined changes in exercise tolerance using Initial Claudiacation Distance (ICD) and Absolute Claudiaction Distance (ACD) as well as ankle-brachial index at rest (ABI-r) and post-exercise (ABI-pe). All patients had stable claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and were already under best medical treatment (BMT). To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be between the ages of 50 and 75 years, had to have stable claudication with an absolute claudication distance >40 meters but <300 meters on a standardized treadmill stress test (3.8 km/h at a 10% grade), have a resting ABI in the affected limb <0.8 with a drop of at least 0.15 following exercise, in whom surgical intervention was not expected for at least three months. Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC consisting of compressions 65 mm Hg in amplitude, applied for three 3-second compressions/minute, two hours/day for three months.

            "abstract": "Although current cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance can increase the rates of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital admission, the discharge rates of patients remain disappointing. The high mortality rate is attributed to post-cardiac arrest brain injury. The discovery of the postconditioning phenomenon opens a door to endogenous neuroprotection. The protection mechanisms of postconditioning include attenuating mitochondrial calcium overload and reducing oxidative stress, recruiting the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, and preventing from the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening at the time of reperfusion. An advantage of postconditioning lies in the potentially clinical application in the unexpected ischemic situation. Prior laboratory researches indicate that postconditioning may lessen the reperfusion/ischemia-induced injury in unexpected coronary occlusion, acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Because cardiac arrest, stroke and acute myocardial infarction have a similar pathophysiological process, we hypothesize that postconditioning could be used in the clinical practice of CPR to treat patients with post-cardiac arrest brain injury. We propose a novel protocol of \"Postconditioning cardiocerebral resuscitation (Post-CCR)\". The Post-CCR includes applying three cycles of 18s chest compression and 10s interruption for ventilation first, and then executing chest compression only CPR until the patients return spontaneous circulation. Post-CCR can not only provide vital blood flow to the heart and brain but also activate endogenous protective mechanism to lessen post-cardiac arrest brain injury. We consider that it would become a feasible, safe and efficient cerebralprotective intervention in the prevention and alleviation of post-cardiac arrest brain injury, which would also improve the outcome after cardiac arrest."

The second viewpoint focuses on the external factors that can cause necrosis to human cells, such as ischemia and compression. The third viewpoint focuses on computational models of the human buttocks to calculate where stress concentrations occur. Each viewpoint contributes to the understanding of pressure ulcer etiology, but in combination they cover the multiple scales from cell to organism, and the combined insight can provide important information toward a full understanding of the phenomenon. It is concluded that the following three questions must be answered by future research. 1) Does compressive stress alone explain cell death, or is it necessary to consider the full three-dimensional strain tensor in the tissues? 2) How does the change in posture-induced load applied on the human buttocks change the stress distribution in the deep muscle tissue? 3) Is it possible to optimize the seated posture in a computational model to reduce the deeper tissue loads?"

Other significant predictors of survival were whether the arrest occurred in public (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19-1.85), whether a bystander administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68), and the interval between the 9-1-1 call and BLS arrival (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found that a shorter BLS-to-ALS arrival interval increased the likelihood of survival to hospital discharge after a witnessed, out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. We conclude that ALS interventions may provide additional benefits over BLS interventions alone when utilized in a well-established, two-tiered emergency medical services (EMS) system already optimized for rapid defibrillation. The highest priorities in any EMS system should still be early CPR and early defibrillation, but timely ALS services can supplement these crucial interventions."

            "abstract": "alpha-Phenyl-N-tert-butyl Nitrone (PBN) is a free radical scavenger which recently has proved to be neuroprotective in experimental studies on focal cerebral ischemia and infarction. We therefore studied the effect of this drug in a model of moderate compression injury to rat spinal cord at the midthoracic level. The compound was given intraperitoneally 0.5 h before (100 mg/kg b.w) and at 1.5 h (50 mg/kg b.w) and 3.5 h (50 mg/kg b.w) after compression. Treated animals and controls (vehicle alone) were allowed to survive for 1 or 9 days following trauma. The functional outcome was tested by the inclined plane method and the motor performance score. By using MAP2 immunostaining the number of nerve cell bodies in the ventral horn and the ratio of MAP2 immunostained area to area of whole section of the cord were assessed to detect loss of neurons and loss of dendrites in the compressed segment. beta APP and PGP9.5 immunostaining was used to demonstrate axonal lesions. Treated and control rats showed at day 1 when tested with the inclined plane method a marked reduction of the capacity angle. This abnormality recovered gradually over the following days and was normalized at day 9. The motor performance score showed a marked reduction at day 1 which almost normalized at day 9. There was no difference regarding the functional outcome between rats given PBN and controls in none one of these functional tests. The spinal cord of normal rats presented immunoreactivity to MAP2 in nerve cell bodies and dendrites but not in axons and other structures. Following compression there was at day 1 and 9 a marked loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in dendrites and nerve cell bodies. We could not detect any difference between the PBN and the control rats regarding the degree of cell loss or degree of reduction of dendrite staining. No difference between the two groups was seen with the axonal immunostainings (beta APP and PGP9.5). In conclusion, our study did not reveal any neuroprotective effect of PBN on the functional outcome and morphology (immunostaining to MAP2, beta APP and PGP9.5) in this model of moderate compression trauma to rat spinal cord."

            "abstract": "This study compared responses of bison calves to 10(10)CFU of Brucella abortus strain RB51 (SRB51) delivered by parenteral or ballistic methods. Two types of biobullet payloads were evaluated; compacted SRB51 pellets or SRB51 encapsulated in photopolymerized poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels. Bison were vaccinated with saline, parenteral SRB51 alone, or in combination with Spirovac, or ballistically with compressed SRB51 or hydrogel biobullets. Bison parenterally vaccinated with SRB51 had greater (P<0.05) immunologic responses when compared to control bison. Co-administration of Spirovac as an adjuvant did not influence immunologic responses. As compared to compressed SRB51 biobullets, ballistic vaccination with hydrogel biobullets increased cellular immune responses at some sampling times. Our data suggest that hydrogel formulations of SRB51 may be a superior alternative to compressed SRB51 tablets for ballistic vaccination of bison. Although preliminary, data suggests that immunologic responses of bison to SRB51 hydrogel bullets are similar to responses after parenteral vaccination with SRB51."

            "abstract": "Astronauts are exposed to both musculoskeletal disuse and heavy ion radiation in space. Disuse alters the magnitude and direction of forces placed upon the skeleton causing bone remodeling, while energy deposited by ionizing radiation causes free radical formation and can lead to DNA strand breaks and oxidative damage to tissues. Radiation and disuse each result in a net loss of mineralized tissue in the adult, although the combined effects, subsequent consequences for mechanical properties and potential for recovery may differ. First, we examined how a high dose (2 Gy) of heavy ion radiation ((56)Fe) causes loss of mineralized tissue in the lumbar vertebrae of skeletally mature (4 months old), male, C57BL/6 mice using microcomputed tomography and determined the influence of structural changes on mechanical properties using whole bone compression tests and finite element analyses. Next, we tested if a low dose (0.5 Gy) of heavy particle radiation prevents skeletal recovery from a 14-day period of hindlimb unloading. Irradiation with a high dose of (56)Fe (2 Gy) caused bone loss (-14%) in the cancellous-rich centrum of the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) 1 month later, increased trabecular stresses (+27%), increased the propensity for trabecular buckling and shifted stresses to the cortex. As expected, hindlimb unloading (14 days) alone adversely affected microarchitectural and mechanical stiffness of lumbar vertebrae, although the reduction in yield force was not statistically significant (-17%). Irradiation with a low dose of (56)Fe (0.5 Gy) did not affect vertebrae in normally loaded mice, but significantly reduced compressive yield force in vertebrae of unloaded mice relative to sham-irradiated controls (-24%). Irradiation did not impair the recovery of trabecular bone volume fraction that occurs after hindlimb unloaded mice are released to ambulate normally, although microarchitectural differences persisted 28 days later (96% increase in ratio of rod- to plate-like trabeculae). In summary, (56)Fe irradiation (0.5 Gy) of unloaded mice contributed to a reduction in compressive strength and partially prevented recovery of cancellous microarchitecture from adaptive responses of lumbar vertebrae to skeletal unloading. Thus, irradiation with heavy ions may accelerate or worsen the loss of skeletal integrity triggered by musculoskeletal disuse."

            "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated by a bystander prior to arrival of the ambulance increases the chance of survival 2-3 times. Unfortunately a majority of patients do not receive such treatment. One way to approach the problem is to let the dispatcher instruct the witness in CPR via telephone when a presumed cardiac arrest occurs. In a recently performed study in Seattle patients with a presumed cardiac arrest were randomized to receive either traditional CPR (mouth-to-mouth ventilation plus chest compressions) or only chest compressions. Treatment was given by a witness via telephone instruction by the dispatcher. Among patients who only received chest compressions 14.6% could be discharged from hospital compared with 10.4% among patients who received traditional CPR. The difference was not significant. The results indicate that telephone instruction in CPR when a presumed cardiac arrest occurs might in certain cases preferably be restricted to chest compressions. The results of the trial are, however, difficult to translate into Swedish conditions, since ambulance response times in Sweden are much longer than in Seattle."

One-hundred and forty patients with non-specific neuro-otologic symptoms were assessed using cranial and temporal MRI. Classification was performed according to four different types of anatomical relationship observed between the AICA and CVN. In type 1 (point compression), the AICA compresses only a limited portion of the CVN. In type 2 (longitudinal compression), the AICA approaches the CVN as both traverse parallel to each other. In type 3 (loop compression), the vascular loop of the AICA encircles the CVN. In type 4 (indentation), the AICA compresses the CVN so as to make an indentation in the nerve. The anatomical relationship between the CVN and AICA was encountered in 19 out of 140 (13.6%) patients (20 ears). The VCC was unilateral in 18 patients (94.7%) and bilateral in one patient (5.3%). There was no other vascular structure causing VCC to the CVN except for vertebral artery that was seen in 2 out of 140 patients (1.4%). These were unilateral cases.

There was no relationship between the cochleovestibular symptoms and type of compression (p>0.05). Neurovascular relationship between the CVN and AICA can be imaged properly using MR and MR based classification may help reporting this relationship in a standard way.

Among patients for whom EMS arrived within 4 minutes of collapse, 53% were found in ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia. There was a successive decline in occurrence of such arrhythmias with time. However, when the interval exceeded 20 minutes, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia was still observed in 27% of cases. Bystander CPR increased the occurrence of such arrhythmias regardless of the interval between collapse and EMS arrival."

            "title": "[Potency of CPR without artificial breathing].",
            "abstract": "Recent experimental studies reported by several independent groups demonstrated that in the initial interventions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), airway protection (A) and artificial breathing (B) are not essential for successful recovery from cardiac arrest. In this study, we reviewed and compared those reports to investigate individual effects of A and B on initial CPR. Airway protection: Spontaneous gasping during cardiac arrest is accompanied by upper airway protective reflexes such as head tilt and open mouth. Gasping promoted CO2 elimination from the nose in animals without A. Breathing: Gasping and precordial compression generated ventilation up to 150 and 100 ml.kg-1. min-1 respectively during cardiac arrest. Arterial blood gas analyses demonstrated that CPR without B developed hypercarbia, but maintained oxygen tensions in physiological levels. The frequency of chest compression is in the range of high frequency ventilation, which might allow for successful oxygenation regardless of limited tidal volumes. A series of experimental studies for CPR without A or B call for establishment of a simple CPR method for bystanders, namely \"Just compress the chest\"."

Evidence supporting the use of AEDs is based largely on the experience of one metropolitan area, with effect on survival in many systems not yet proved. We conducted this study to determine whether the addition of AEDs to an EMS system with a response time of 4 minutes for first-responder emergency medical technicians (FREMTs) and 10 minutes for paramedics would affect survival from cardiac arrest.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This prospective, controlled, crossover study (AED versus no AED) of consecutive cardiac arrests managed by 24 FREMT fire companies took place from 1992 to 1995 in Charlotte, North Carolina, a city of 455,000.

The data were collected from January 1st, 1989 to December 31st, 1992 by the Bonn-north ALS unit, which serves 240,000 residents. Fifty-six patients suffered from cardiac arrest of non-cardiac aetiology and were excluded; 464 patients were resuscitated after cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac aetiology (incidence of CPR attempts: 48.33 per year/100,000 population). The collapse was unwitnessed, bystander witnessed or EMS personnel witnessed in 178, 214 or 72 patients, respectively. In these subgroups discharge rates and 1-year survival accounted for 7.3% (4.5%), 22.9% (15.9%) and 16.7% (11.1%), respectively. Thirty-four patients were discharged without neurological deficits (cerebral performance category 1: CPC 1), 22 and nine patients scored CPC 2 or CPC 3, respectively. Nine patients were comatose (CPC 4) when they were discharged and remained in this state until they died. Of the 50 1-year survivors 35 lived without neurological deficit, eight demonstrated mild (CPC 2) and five severe (CPC 3) cerebral disability at 1-year after resuscitation, and, finally, two patients remained comatose for more than 1 year. The Utstein template recommends the selection of patients who were found in VF after bystander witnessed collapse. In our cohort 118 patients met these criteria. Of them 41 (35%) could be discharged from hospital and 28 (24%) lived more than 1 year. The comparison of our data with those from double-response EMS systems of other communities revealed that, in midsized urban and suburban communities the highest discharging rates could be achieved. Our study demonstrated that survival depends crucially on short response intervals and life support which will be performed by well-trained emergency technicians, paramedics and physicians."

Five teeth gave the same responses with gloved and ungloved hands. Only five teeth did not respond when gloves were worn, and all of these gave readings near the top of the EPT scale when tested without gloves.

In the study conducted by Fleishhackl and coworkers, students as young as 9 years were able to successfully and effectively learn basic CPR skills, including automated external defibrillator deployment, correct recovery position, and emergency calling. As in adults, physical strength may limit the depth of chest compressions and ventilation volumes given by younger individuals with low body mass index; however, skill retention is good. Training all persons across an entire community in CPR may have a logarithmic improvement in survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because bystanders, usually family members, are more likely to know CPR and can perform it immediately, when it is physiologically most effective. Training captured audiences of trainees, such as the entire work-force of the community or the local school system, are excellent mechanisms to help achieve that goal. In addition to better retention with new half hour training kits, a multiplier effect can be achieved through school children. In addition, early training not only sets the stage for subsequent training and better retention, but it also reinforces the concept of a social obligation to help others."

The rate of rise of the slope of the H-reflex recruitment curve (Hslp) was assessed using linear regression. Following manual cervical traction Hslp was significantly lower than pre-intervention trials. Manual cervical traction, therefore, reduced the excitability of the Flexor Carpi Radialis alpha-motoneuron pool. This effect was mediated by the central nervous system. There was no significant decrease in alpha-motoneuron excitability following the hands only intervention.

This study was designed to compare arterial and mixed venous blood gas changes and cerebral circulation and oxygen delivery with ventilation:compression ratios of 2:15, 2:50 and 5:50 in a model of basic CPR. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 12 anaesthetised pigs, and satisfactory recordings were obtained from 9 of them. A non-intervention interval of 3 min was followed by CPR with pauses in compressions for ventilation with 17% oxygen and 4% carbon dioxide in a randomised, cross-over design with each method being used for 5 min. Pulmonary gas exchange was clearly superior with a ventilation:compression ratio of 2:15. While the arterial oxygen saturation stayed above 80% throughout CPR for 2:15, it dropped below 40% during part of the ventilation:compression cycle for both the other two ratios. On the other hand, the ratio 2:50 produced 30% more chest compressions per minute than either of the two other methods. This resulted in a mean carotid flow that was significantly higher with the ratio of 2:50 than with 5:50 while 2:15 was not significantly different from either. The mean cerebrocortical microcirculation was approximately 37% of pre-VF levels during compression cycles alone with no significant differences between the methods. The oxygen delivery to the brain was higher for the ratio of 2:15 than for either 5:50 or 2:50. In parallel the central venous oxygenation, which gives some indication of tissue oxygenation, was higher for the ratio of 2:15 than for both 5:50 and 2:50. As the compressions were done with a mechanical device with only 2-3 s pauses per ventilation, the data cannot be extrapolated to laypersons who have great variations in quality of CPR. However, it might seem reasonable to suggest that basic CPR by professionals should continue with ratio of 2:15 at present if it can be shown that similar brief pauses for ventilation can be achieved in clinical practice."

            "title": "[Ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A literature study and analysis of ventilation strategies].",
            "abstract": "In a recently published German multicenter study, 25% of the patients with witnessed cardiac arrest outside the hospital were resuscitated successfully and discharged from the hospital. Approximately 100,000 people suffer a fatal cardiac arrest in Germany annually, which is approximately tenfold the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed by bystanders is an important part of the chain of survival to minimize the time interval without artificial circulation and ventilation in a cardiac arrest victim. This is especially important in areas with long response times of the emergency medical service (EMS). Early examples of ventilation have been described throughout history. References to mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MTMV) are found in the Bible, in a description of the resuscitation of a coal miner in 1744, and in an experiment in 1796 demonstrating that exhaled gas was safe for breathing. In 1954, Elam and colleagues described artificial respiration with the exhaled gas of a rescuer using a mouth-to-mask ventilation method. The modern CPR era started with the combination of MTMV and chest compressions 35 years ago. However, the value of MTMV is currently under discussion because of a widespread fear of transmission of infectious diseases. Healthcare professionals have stated in several studies that they may withhold MTMV when confronted with a cardiac arrest in a stranger. Although an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is more likely than one with HIV via MTMV, the fear of the public is understandable. An expert committee of the American Heart Association stated that MTMV may be omitted in the initial phase of cardiac arrest, and considered recommending chest compressions only if the EMS will arrive rapidly. In paralyzed volunteers, however, ventilation induced by chest compressions was not able to provide sufficient gas exchange, especially when the airway was not protected. Laboratory investigations studying ventilation during CPR showed controversial results; in one animal model of cardiac arrest with muscle paralysis, chest compressions were not sufficient for adequate gas exchange, but active compression-decompression CPR achieved reasonable ventilation. Animal models that prevented gasping during cardiac arrest required ventilation during CPR, whereas gasping animals seemed to be satisfactorily ventilated with chest compressions alone. The question whether spontaneous gasping after cardiac arrest in humans may be sufficient for oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination is debatable and remains unanswered at this time. When cardiac arrest is monitored, frequent coughing by the patient may maintain artificial ventilation and circulation for 30 s. The strategy to compress the thorax first and then maintain the airway and perform ventilation may only have an advantage for the first 30 s of CPR. Therefore, MTMV remains the therapy of choice to ventilate the victim of cardiac arrest. If a rescuer chooses to not perform MTMV, at least chest compressions should be administered. During ventilation with an unprotected airway, tidal volumes of 0.5 l instead 0.8-1.2 l may have an advantage. This strategy would decrease the inspiratory flow rate and, therefore, peak airway inflation pressure, which is associated with stomach inflation. Animal models indicate that lower esophageal sphincter pressure may decrease rapidly to 5 cm H2O during cardiac arrest, which may further increase the importance of a low peak airway pressure during ventilation with an unprotected airway. Gastric inflation may cause, besides regurgitation, aspiration, and pneumonia, an increased intragastric pressure, which may push up the diaphragm, decrease lung compliance, and induce a vicious circle of hypoventilation and stomach inflation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

Average interval from 911 call activation to EMS responder arrival was 6.4 minutes in Fresno and 4.0 minutes in San Francisco. In Fresno, there was no difference between the ACD group and standard CPR group in return of spontaneous circulation (17% vs 20%; P = .68), hospital admission (16% vs 20%; P = .56), hospital discharge (5% vs 7%; P = .64), or cerebral performance category score at discharge (1.5 vs 1.6; P = .90). Similarly, in San Francisco there was no difference between the ACD group and standard CPR group in return of spontaneous circulation (19% vs 21%; P = .65), hospital admission (13.5% vs 14.5%; P = .79), hospital discharge (4.7% vs 5.5%; P = .80), or cerebral performance category score at discharge (2.2 vs 2.6; P = .31). There was no increase in significant complications associated with the use of ACD CPR.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There was no improvement in outcome with ACD CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in these two cities. Differences in study design, demographics, EMS systems, response intervals, training, and technique performance may contribute to the lack of improvement in initial resuscitation with ACD CPR compared with previous studies. Future research needs to control these variables to determine the reason for these differences in outcome."

            "title": "Considerations of current methods for drug selection in treating malignant ventricular arrhythmias.",
            "abstract": "The current burgeoning interest in antiarrhythmic drugs derives in large measure from a growing concern with the enormous problem of sudden cardiac death. Until the latter half of the twentieth century, beyond a nodding acknowledgment of its massive prevalence, this syndrome received but scant attention from the medical profession. In the early 1960s a number of insights changed perceptions as well as practice. These related to 4 postulates: (1) sudden cardiac death, in the majority of victims, was due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias either initiated by or culminating rapidly in ventricular fibrillation; (2) the lethal arrhythmia was not the consequence of irreversible pathomorphologic impairment of the contractile apparatus, but rather the expression of an electrophysiologic derangement; (3) the triggering of ventricular fibrillation was the result of an electrical accident both reversible as well as preventable; (4) the potential victim was identifiable either by the presence of certain grades of ventricular ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias by electrophysiologic techniques. The innovations that have led to these insights and their consequences have been numerous and continuous. Among these are direct current defibrillation, cardioversion, coronary care units, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise stress testing for exposing ventricular arrhythmias, electrophysiologic provocative testing and mapping techniques, overdrive programmable pacemakers as well as implantable defibrillators and cardioverters, and surgical, electrical and laser techniques for ablating the nidus or interrupting the pathways of the arrhythmias."

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors related to poor prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in one local area of Japan. From May 1, 2002 to April 30, 2008, a total of 442 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest were transferred for resuscitation to the National Hospital Organization, Iwakuni Clinical Center. Of 325 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest of cardiac etiology, 126 patients were witnessed by a bystander. However, only 37 received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 13 had shockable cardiac rhythm, 3 survived 1 month, and 2 had a good neurological discharge. Multivariate analysis of overall cardiac arrest showed that 1-month survival and neurologically favorable discharge were associated with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P=0.049 and 0.013) and initial shockable cardiac rhythm (P=0.001 and 0.007). In this region, the survival rate for patients with cardiopulmonary arrest was lower than that reported in other areas, probably because fewer patients received bystander CPR or had shockable cardiac rhythm. This may result from CPR being less popularized in this region than in other areas, suggesting that raising the awareness of CPR would improve the survival rate."

A 47-year-old female was admitted with the complaint of a right gradually expanding and painful pre-auricular mass. Physical examination showed a round, tender and compressible tumor measuring 3 x 3 cm in the right pre-auricular region, and there was bruit on the mass. Pre- and Post-contrast CT scans showed a slightly enhanced extracranial mass in the right temporal subcutaneous region. MR imaging showed a flow void mass both on T1 and T2 weighted images. Selective external carotid angiogram revealed multiple feeders deriving from the superficial temporal artery (STA) and the abnormal vascular networks. And also the saccular aneurysm was detected in the main feeder of the STA. Under a diagnosis of scalp AVM, it was totally removed with the temporoparietal muscle, and the aneurysmal neck was ligated. Histopathological examination revealed AVM. She was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with no deficits. Based on our experience and a review of the literature, the treatment of choice is embolization for scalp AVM localized in the skin alone and surgical total removal for AVM embedded in the muscle."

Data collected included age, cause, and presence and type of CPR by bystander. The primary endpoint was favourable neurological outcome 1 month after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, defined as Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category 1 or 2.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      3675 (71%) children had arrests of non-cardiac causes and 1495 (29%) cardiac causes. 1551 (30%) received conventional CPR and 888 (17%) compression-only CPR. Data for type of CPR by bystander were not available for 12 children. Children who were given CPR by a bystander had a significantly higher rate of favourable neurological outcome than did those not given CPR (4.5% [110/2439] vs 1.9% [53/2719]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% CI 1.81-3.71).

            "abstract": "The efficacy of CPR has been questioned. A major criticism is that neurologic outcomes have not been adequately studied. For a 26-month period, 138 patients from six major receiving hospitals were discharged alive following prehospital cardiac arrests. For 65/138 (47.1%) patients, either the patient or a direct family member was contacted for information concerning neurologic outcome. For 63/138 (45.7%) patients, contact with patient or family was unsuccessful, consequently neurologic outcome at time of discharge was obtained from the medical record. For 10/138 (7.2%) patients, no data on neurologic outcome was obtainable. Neurologic outcome was rated by a 5-point Cerebral Performance Categories Scale (CPC); (1) Minimal Disability; (2) Moderate; (3) Severe; (4) Vegetative; and (5) Brain Dead. The bystander/first responder CPR group had 55.1% CPC-1; 24.4% CPC-2; 16.7% CPC-3; and 3.8% CPC-4 outcomes. The bystander/first responder NO CPR group had 58.0% CPC-1; 18.0% CPC-2; 16.0% CPC-3; and 8.0% CPC-4 outcomes. There was no significant difference at any CPC level (P not significant). Furthermore, there was no statistical difference between either group when compared for age, response time, resuscitation time, witnessing of arrest or distribution of presenting rhythms. In conclusion, no significant effect in neurologic outcome among saved cardiac arrest victims was found between bystander/first responder CPR and bystander/first responder NO CPR groups in the paramedic program studied."

The histories of 2 adult competent ICU patients 2 asked that vital intervention be forgone are presented, together with the discussion of problems posed by such a request and of possible solutions which respect patients' autonomy and bystanders needs. These patients were hospitalized in an Italian general 14 bed ICU. The patients' request were weighted against their prognosis and their view of life, in order to evaluate their reliability. Also the refusal of either treatment or outcome was evaluated, in order to effectively safeguard the patients' interests. The request of one patient was satisfied and he was allowed to die, after all the involved people had understood and accepted the final decision. The second patient, who was somehow forced to undergo intensive treatment, is alive and satisfied with having been cured. In Italy too, autonomy is an increasingly applied principle in end-of-life decisions in ICUs. It is usually tempered by a consideration about the patients' best interest as perceived by involved bystanders."

The largest group of cardiac arrest patients are men over the age of 60 in the home, and the most probable potential CPR provider is an older woman who is not likely to have received CPR training. One method to increase the percentage of bystander-initiated CPR in this setting is for CPR instruction to be provided by nurse dispatchers via telephone. Two male and 18 female volunteers with a median age of 78 years and no previous CPR experience performed 9 min of telephone assisted CPR on a manikin. They were randomised to receive telephone instructions in chest compressions alone or standard CPR including mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Variables were registered by a recording manikin, visual observations, and video and audiotape recordings. The median period from dispatcher contact until continuous CPR was significantly longer for standard instructions than for compression only, 4.9 versus 3.4 min, and fewer chest compressions were provided during the 9 min test period, median 124 versus 334 compressions. In both groups the overall CPR performance was of very poor quality, and unlikely to have affected outcome in a real situation. Other telephone assisted CPR scripts should be tested in this potential bystander group."
