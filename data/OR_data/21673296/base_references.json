            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To investigate retinal vascular characteristics using ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy in Parkinson disease (PD).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Individuals with an expert-confirmed clinical diagnosis of PD and controls with normal cognition without PD underwent Optos California UWF imaging. Patients with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma, dementia, other movement disorders, or known retinal or optic nerve pathology were excluded. Images were analyzed using Vasculature Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE-UWF) software, which describes retinal vessel width gradient and tortuosity, provides vascular network fractal dimensions, and conducts alpha-shape analysis to further characterize vascular morphology (complexity, Opαmin; spread, OpA).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the PD cohort, 53 eyes of 38 subjects were assessed; in the control cohort, 51 eyes of 33 subjects were assessed. Eyes with PD had more tortuous retinal arteries in the superotemporal quadrant (P = 0.043). In eyes with PD, alpha-shape analysis revealed decreased OpA, indicating less retinal vasculature spread compared to controls (P = 0.032). Opαmin was decreased in PD (P = 0.044), suggesting increased vascular network complexity. No differences were observed in fractal dimension in any region of interest.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pilot study suggests that retinal vasculature assessment on UWF images using alpha-shape analysis reveals differences in retinal vascular network spread and complexity in PD and may be a more sensitive metric compared to fractal dimension.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      Retinal vasculature assessment using these novel methods may be useful in understanding ocular manifestations of PD and the development of retinal biomarkers."

Our study aimed to determine its role in controlling corneal epithelial wound healing (CEWH).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Corneal epithelial (CE)-specific Sirt1 deletion mice were created using the Cre-lox system. CE debridement was used to create a CEWH model. Corneal epithelial cells (CECs) were collected with an Algerbrush. Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR were performed to determine protein and mRNA expression levels. SiRNA transfection technology knocked down SIRT1 and cortactin expression levels in human corneal epithelial cells. Scratch wound assay, MTS assay, and TUNEL assay determined cell migratory, proliferative, and apoptotic behavior, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation probed for SIRT1 and cortactin interaction. Immunofluorescence staining evaluated the location and expression levels of SIRT1, cortactin, acetylated-cortactin, and F-actin.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During CEWH, increases in SIRT1 mRNA and protein expression levels accompanied the downregulation of acetylated lysine in non-histone proteins. The loss of SIRT1 function reduced cell migration and, in turn, delayed CEWH. SIRT1 bound to and deacetylated cortactin in vitro and in vivo. Loss of either SIRT1 or cortactin suppressed wound edge lamellipodia formation, which is consistent with migration retardation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      During CEWH, SIRT1 upregulation and its modification of cortactin boost CEC migration by increasing the development of lamellipodia at the wound edge. Therefore SIRT1 may serve as a potential target to enhance CEWH."

Neither the mean t0 to t1 change (Δ) of DLCO nor the mean t0 to t1 FVCΔ predicted the appearance of ILD at t2. Investigating the possible role of baseline DLCO and FVC values in predicting ILD appearance after 24 (±4) months, we observed a moderate predictive capability of t0 DLCO < 80%, stronger than that of FVC < 80%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We suggest that an impaired baseline DLCO may be predictive of the appearance of ILD after 2 years of follow-up. This result advances the hypothesis that a reduction in gas exchange may be considered an early sign of lung involvement. However, further rigorous studies are warranted to understand the predictive role of DLCO evaluation in the course of SSc."

            "abstract": "Expositions and elementary proofs are given for the basic theorems of stable population theory: That a population subjected to vital rates (not necessarily constant over time) satisfying certain postulates will eventually \"forget\" its original age distribution and take on one (not necessarily constant over time) which depends only on its history of agespecific vital rates, a process called \"weak ergodicity.\" That consequently the subsequent birth, death, and growth rates (none of these necessarily constant over time) depend only on the history of age-specific vital rates and not on the original age distribution. And, in particular, that these results apply to the special case, herein called \"classic\" stable population theory, in which the age-specific vital rates are constant over time, and in which after the \"forgetting\" takes place the subsequent age distribution and birth, death, and growth rates all become constant. This formulation of the theory differs from previous ones in two respects: First, the postulates required are weaker, and hence the theorems more general, than previously; in particular, this formulation permits the highest age of childbearing to change from cohort to cohort, which is important for populations practicing contraception. Second, none of the advanced mathematics used in previous formulations is needed; only the manipulation of sums and inequalities from high school algebra and the concept of \"limit\" from freshman calculus are required."

Herein, we review the data that supports the all-or-none concept and the exceptions to this general rule. In the absence of further human evidence to the contrary, and given the many women exposed to medications or environmental agents before learning of their pregnancies, it would be prudent to continue to counsel pregnant women using the all-or-none hypothesis to avoid needless interruption of pregnancy out of unfounded fear of an adverse pregnancy outcome."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of locally delivered regulatory T cells (Tregs) on acute corneal wound healing after alkali burn.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After corneal alkali burn, the mice were injected subconjunctivally with regulatory T cells (Tregs) isolated from syngeneic mice. The wound healing process was monitored by clinical manifestation, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As amphiregulin (Areg) was significantly upregulated, its reparative function in injured corneas was suggested. The hypothesis was further verified via loss- and gain-of-function experiments by administrating the antibody of Areg (anti-Areg) and recombinant Areg (rmAreg).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Subconjunctivally injected Tregs rapidly migrated to injured corneas. The mice treated with Tregs showed prominently reduced corneal opacity, alleviated edema, and faster re-epithelialization compared with the control group. Mechanistically, Treg treatment led to suppressed infiltration of inflammatory cells, along with improved proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of corneal epithelial cells. Tregs expressed upregulated functional markers, including Areg. Expectantly, the levels of Areg in corneas were dramatically higher in the Treg injection group, in line with better corneal restoration. Additional experiments showed that the administration of anti-Areg blunted the reparative effect of Tregs, while exogenous Areg enhanced it. Treg-treated corneas also exhibited less neovascularization and fibrosis at a later reconstruction stage of corneal repair.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings showed that the subconjunctival injection of Tregs effectively promoted corneal wound healing by inhibiting excessive inflammation and enhancing epithelial regeneration, with an indispensable reparative role of Areg. Subsequent complications of corneal vascularization and fibrosis were therefore reduced."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4 are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs). Interpretation of ABCA4 variants is challenging, due to cis-modifying and hypomorphic variants. We have previously detected 10 missense variants of unknown significance (VUS) in patients with suspected ABCA4-retinal dystrophies (ABCA4-RDs) in Norway. In this study, we functionally characterized the VUS to aid interpretation of the variants and to determine if they are associated with the disease.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The ABCA4 VUS were expressed in HEK293T cells and the ABCA4 expression level and ATPase activity were determined and correlated with the patients' phenotype. The functional data further used for reclassification of the VUS following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 10 VUSs, 2 variants, Cys205Phe and Asn415Thr, were categorized as functionally severe. The age at presentation in the 2 patients carrying these variants was divergent and seemed to be driven by the patients' second pathogenic variants Gly1961Glu and c.5461-10T>C, respectively. Three variants, Val643Gly, Pro799Leu, and Val1433Ile were categorized as functionally moderate, and were found in patients with intermediate/late age at presentation. The remaining five variants were categorized as functionally normal/mild. Based on our data, c.614G>T p.(Cys205Phe), c.1244A>C p.(Asn415Thr), and c.2396C>T p.(Pro799Leu) were reclassified to (likely) pathogenic, while 4 of the functionally normal/mild variants could be reclassified to likely benign.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Functional analyses of ABCA4 variants are a helpful tool in variant classification and enable us to better predict the disease severity in patients with ABCA4-RDs."

This coordination is achieved in part through a shared set of genetic variants that regulate eye size. Poorly coordinated scaling of corneal curvature and axial length results in refractive error. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variants regulating eye size in emmetropic eyes are distinct from those conferring susceptibility to refractive error.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for corneal curvature in 22,180 adult emmetropic individuals was performed as a proxy for a GWAS for eye size. A polygenic score created using lead GWAS variants was tested for association with corneal curvature and axial length in an independent sample: 437 classified as emmetropic and 637 as ametropic. The genetic correlation between eye size and refractive error was calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression for approximately 1 million genetic variants.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The GWAS for corneal curvature in emmetropes identified 32 independent genetic variants (P < 5.0e-08). A polygenic score created using these 32 genetic markers explained 3.5% (P < 0.001) and 2.0% (P = 0.001) of the variance in corneal curvature and axial length, respectively, in the independent sample of emmetropic individuals but was not predictive of these traits in ametropic individuals. The genetic correlation between eye size and refractive error was close to zero (rg = 0.00; SE = 0.06; P = 0.95).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results support the hypothesis that genetic variants regulating eye size in emmetropic eyes do not overlap with those conferring susceptibility to myopia.

The robotic C-arm provides improved 2D image quality and is capable of large volume three-dimensional fluoroscopy (3DF) that can rapidly create multiplanar CT like images. Here we discuss on the technique, utility, potential benefits, pitfalls, and complications of using the hybrid suite with and without intra-arterial balloon occlusion for pelvic and acetabular fracture surgery. We also present a case series of patient who underwent pelvic fixation using the HOR. While not advocated for routine use in all pelvic and acetabular fractures; the hybrid suite can be an effective tool in the treatment of complex cases and may facilitate efficient care of the hemodynamically unstable patient. It should be considered when resuscitative stabilization, angioembolization, intra-arterial balloon occlusion, or life-threatening bleeding is anticipated. Additionally, use of the hybrid room allows access to 3D fluoroscopy, and the associated benefits, if a mobile 3D unit is otherwise unavailable. These benefits must be weighed against the cumbersome table, the potential pitfalls with patient size and positioning, and the increased cost to the hospital."

            "abstract": "In this study, we examined the association between sugar-sweetened drink, diet soda, and fruit juice consumption and surrogate measures of insulin resistance. Sugar-sweetened drink, diet soda, and fruit juice consumption was estimated using a semiquantitative FFQ in 2500 subjects at the fifth examination (1991-1995) of the Framingham Offspring Study. Surrogate markers of insulin resistance measured in this study included fasting insulin, fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI(0,120)). Sugar-sweetened drink consumption was positively associated with fasting insulin (none vs. > or = 2 servings/d, 188 vs. 206 pmol/L, P-trend <0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders. Sugar-sweetened drink consumption was not associated with fasting glucose or ISI(0,120). Fruit juice consumption was inversely associated with fasting glucose (none vs. > or = 2 servings/d, 5.28 vs. 5.18 mmol/L, P-trend = 0.006), but not with fasting insulin (none vs. > or = 2 servings/d, 200 vs. 188 pmol/L, P-trend = 0.37) or ISI(0,120) (none vs. > or = 2 servings/d, 26.0 vs. 27.0, P-trend = 0.19) in multivariate models. Diet soda consumption was not associated with any surrogate measures of insulin resistance after adjustment for potential confounders (insulin: none vs. > or = 2 servings/d, 195 vs. 193 pmol/L, P-trend = 0.59; glucose: 5.26 vs. 5.24 mmol/L, P-trend = 0.84; and ISI(0,120): 26.2 vs. 26.7, P-trend = 0.37). In these healthy adults, sugar-sweetened drink consumption appears to be unfavorably associated with surrogate measures reflecting hepatic more than peripheral insulin sensitivity. Studies of long-term beverage consumption using more direct measures of insulin sensitivity are clearly warranted."

            "abstract": "1. Single smooth muscle cells from the guinea-pig taenia caecum and the fundus of guinea-pig stomach were prepared by collagenase digestion under different, mild conditions. 2. Most of the cells either from taenia caecum or from the fundus of stomach responded repeatedly, showing an all-or-none response to acetylcholine (ACh). 3. The threshold concentrations of ACh were different for the cells of the two tissues. Although individual cells showed an all-or-none response to ACh, the average responses of all the cells were graded, like that of whole tissues. 4. Thus, isolated single smooth muscle cells from different tissues and under different conditions responded to ACh in an all-or-none manner such as the twitch observed in skeletal muscle. 5. These results suggest that the isolation of cells reveals the fundamental characteristics of smooth muscle cells as excitable."

            "abstract": "Preclinical data suggested that, in the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-3-altered activation, colorectal cancer cells may escape anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell death. HER-3 overexpression may then represent a key factor for resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer. The aim of our analysis was to investigate a possible correlation between HER-3 expression and clinical outcome in wild-type K-RAS advanced colorectal cancer patients receiving cetuximab and irinotecan. We retrospectively analyzed immunoreactivity for HER-3 in wild-type K-RAS advanced colorectal cancer patients receiving irinotecan and cetuximab. Eighty-four advanced wild-type K-RAS colorectal cancer patients were available for HER-3 analysis. Forty patients (48%) had a HER-3(-) colorectal tumor, whereas the remaining 44 cases (52%) were deemed HER-3(+). In patients with HER-3(-) and HER-3(+) tumors, we observed a partial response in 17 (42%) and eight (18%) patients respectively; progressive disease occurred in 11 (35%) and 26 (53%) patients with HER-3(-) and HER-3(+) tumors, respectively (p = .003). The median progression-free survival time was 6.3 months in patients with HER-3(-) tumors and 2.8 months for those who had HER-3-overexpressing tumors (p < .0001). The median overall survival time was 13.6 months in patients showing HER-3(-) tumors and 10.5 months for those who had HER-3-expressing tumors (p = .01). HER-3 proved to be a predictive factor for clinical outcome in wild-type K-RAS colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab. Combined HER-3 and K-RAS analysis may represent an effective strategy for better selection of responding colorectal cancer patients."

Digynic triploidy after intracytoplasmic sperm injection is characterized by nonextrusion of the second polar body and formation of three pronuclei. Digyny can also result from the fertilization of diploid giant oocytes. Depending on how maturation of these gametes proceeds, three or only two pronuclei will be observed.

A national patient experience survey was administered to 7,620 women veterans. Multivariable models of overall patient satisfaction with provider were compared with and without the proposed mediator. A structural equation model (SEM) of the mediation of the two provider characteristics was also evaluated. Without the mediator, associations of provider class and designation with overall patient satisfaction were significant. With the proposed mediator, these associations became nonsignificant. An SEM showed that the majority (>80%) of the positive associations between provider class and designation and the outcome were exerted through patient perception of enough time spent with provider. Higher ratings of overall satisfaction with provider exhibited by nurse practitioners and designated women's health providers were exerted through patient perception of enough time spent with provider.

The FAZRing area in individuals with mild DR was significantly higher than that in control subjects (P < 0.001). However, there is still a small amount of overlap data between the two groups. For the FAZ growth rate, the individuals with mild DR were also significantly larger than the control subjects (P < 0.001).

This study aimed to identify the contribution of OPN1LW to early-onset high myopia (eoHM) and the molecular basis underlying eoHM with or without colorblindness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Comparative analysis of exome sequencing data was conducted for 1226 families with eoHM and 9304 families with other eye conditions. OPN1LW variants detected by targeted or whole exome sequencing were confirmed by long-range amplification and Sanger sequencing, together with segregation analysis. The clinical data were thoroughly analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Unique haplotypes and truncation variants in OPN1LW were detected exclusively in 68 of 1226 families with eoHM but in none of the 9304 families with other visual diseases (P = 1.63 × 10-63). Four classes of variants were identified: haplotypes causing partial splicing defects in OPN1LW (LVAVA or LIVVA in 31 families), LVAVA in OPN1LW-OPN1MW hybrid gene (in 3 families), LIAVA in OPN1LW (in 29 families), and truncations in OPN1LW (in 5 families). The first class causes partial loss of red photopigments, whereas the latter three result in complete loss of red photopigments. This is different from the replacement of red with green owing to unequal re-arrangement causing red-green colorblindness alone. Of the 68 families, 42 affected male patients (31 families) with the first class of variants (LVAVA or LIVVA in OPN1LW) had eoHM alone, whereas 37 male patients with the latter 3 classes had eoHM with protanopia. Adaptive optics retinal imaging demonstrated reduced cone regularity and density in men with eoHM caused by OPN1LW variants compared to those patients with eoHM and without OPN1LW variants.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Based on the 68 families with unique variants in OPN1LW, our study provides firm evidence that the two different phenotypes (eoHM with or without colorblindness) are caused by two different classes of variants (partial splicing-effect haplotypes or complete splicing-effect haplotypes/truncation variants, respectively). The contribution of OPN1LW to eoHM (isolated and syndromic) was characterized by OPN1LW variants found in 5.5% (68/1226) of the eoHM families, making it the second most common cause of monogenic eoHM alone (2.4%) and a frequent cause of syndromic monogenic eoHM with colorblindness. Such haplotypes, in which each individual variant alone is considered a benign polymorphism, are potential candidates for other hereditary diseases with causes of missing genetic defects."

Extracellular recording and stimulation were performed in stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum of CA3, respectively. EGS activity was induced by exposure to low-Mg medium or by delivering repetitive stimulus trains in physiological Mg medium. After EGS activity had stabilized, the EGSs were tested for all-or-none behavior by varying the number of pulses in a train. An EGS was considered all-or-none if subthreshold stimulation produced no afterdischarge bursts, and if the EGS duration was largely independent of the number of suprathreshold stimulus pulses. According to this measure, EGSs in Mg-free + baclofen medium were all-or-none. EGSs evoked in physiological Mg medium were also all-or-none, although the threshold was higher, and the EGS duration lower, than in Mg-free medium. This all-or-none characteristic was observed whether the EGSs were induced by prior exposure to Mg-free medium or by repetitive stimulation, and in the presence and absence of baclofen. The all-or-none characteristic suggests that while the triggering mechanism for EGSs is strongly dependent on stimulus intensity, regenerative mechanisms--independent of stimulus intensity--are responsible for the maintenance of EGSs. EGSs are also terminated by mechanisms not dependent on stimulus intensity."

The loss of BMPR1B-mediated signaling leads to optic nerve coloboma, gliosis in the optic nerve head and ventral retina, defective optic nerve axons, and irregular retinal vessels. The ventral retinal gliosis is proliferative and hypertrophic, which is concomitant with neuronal delamination and the reduction of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); it is dominated by activated astrocytes overexpressing PAX2 and SOX2 but not PAX6, indicating that they may retain properties of gliogenic precursor cells.

Nail, distal phalanx bone, soft tissue measurements were performed in the counterlateral healthy toe of 34 patients that we operated due to the unilateral ingrowing nail and 34 randomized individuals with no ingrowing nail by lateral and anteroposterior toe x-rays. There were no significant differences for age, sex, the side of the ingrowing nail, postoperative mobilization period, and the follow-up period between 2 groups that the techniques were applied to. There was no statistically significant difference in WMR (8.1%, 4 toes) and LFAF (none) for the recurrence rate. But there was significant difference between WMR (36.7%, 18 toes) and LFAF (5.2%, 2 toes) for the spicule formation rates (P < 0.05), and there was significant difference between WMR (20.4%, 10 toes) and LFAF (none) for the reoperation (P < 0.03). It was observed that patient satisfaction in cosmetic view was better in patient group treated with LFAF (P < 0.05). Phalanx heads were wider in patient group with ingrowing nail at the results of the measurements (P < 0.01). The fact that granulation and scarred tissues are removed instead of performing the great soft tissue excisions is more correct for both recurrence and cosmetics.

Panel-based targeted exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from blood samples, containing coding regions of 792 IED-causative genes and their flanking exons. All participants underwent genetic testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All proband-parent trios were divided into 22 subgroups, the overall diagnostic yield was 48.67% (605/1243), ranging from 4% to 94.44% for each of the subgroups. A total of 108 IED-causative genes were identified, with the top 24 genes explaining 67% of the 605 genetically solved trios. The genetic etiology of 6.76% (84/1243) of the trio was attributed to disease-causative DNMs, and the top 3 subgroups with the highest incidence of DNM were aniridia (n = 40%), Marfan syndrome/ectopia lentis (n = 38.78%), and retinoblastoma (n = 37.04%). The top 10 genes have a diagnostic yield of DNM greater than 3.5% in their subgroups, including PAX6 (40.00%), FBN1 (38.78%), RB1 (37.04%), CRX (10.34%), CHM (9.09%), WFS1 (8.00%), RP1L1 (5.88%), RS1 (5.26%), PCDH15 (4.00%), and ABCA4 (3.51%).

CYP4V2 (cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily V member 2) is currently the only disease-causing gene for BCD. We aimed to generate a zebrafish model to explore the functional role of CYP4V2 in the development of BCD and identify potential therapeutic targets for future studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The cyp4v7 and cyp4v8 (homologous genes of CYP4V2) knockout zebrafish lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The morphology of photoreceptor and RPE cells and the accumulation of lipid droplets in RPE cells were investigated at a series of different developmental stages through histological analysis, immunofluorescence, and lipid staining.

We also observed the excessive accumulation of lipid droplets in RPE cells from three months after fertilization, which preceded the retinal degeneration by several months. Transcriptome analysis suggested that multiple metabolism pathways, especially the lipid metabolism pathways, were significantly changed in RPE cells.

This is partly due to the unique properties of stem cells that divide and differentiate from the specialized cells in the damaged tissue. Moreover, stem cells and none-stem cells, impose immunomodulatory properties affecting the diseases caused by immunological abnormalities such as rheumatic autoimmune disorders. In the present review, the efficacy of cell-based therapy with four main types of stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and human amniotic membrane cells, as well as none-stem cells, including regulatory T cells, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and tolerogenic dendritic cells will be evaluated.

The average in OCTA-measured TS of 1.60 ± 2.58 mm2 (range, 0.01-10.43) was congruent to the clinically assessed TS in 81.3% of cases (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). TS measured in SD-OCTA compared to SS-OCTA showed similar values and a high correlation (all P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, despite the similarities, a slight trend in SS-OCTA was observed whereby with increasing TS, an elevated TS was detected compared to SD-OCTA (3 × 3-mm2 scans: mean difference of 0.03 ± 0.04 mm2, 6 × 6-mm2 scans: 0.08 ± 0.19 mm2). However, within the same imaging technology method, TS values almost did not differ (SD-OCTA: mean difference of 0.01 ± 0.02 mm2, SS-OCTA: 0.001 ± 0.01 mm2).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      OCTA may serve as an additional tool for diagnosis and monitoring of RCHs. Nevertheless, due to the differences between the technologies, the values cannot be used interchangeably.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      SD-OCTA and SS-OCTA are suitable to detect and monitor RCHs and provide a more detailed assessment about the TS than this is clinically possible."

Phage therapy has been successful in a variety of antibiotic refractory infections and is of interest in treating LVAD infections. We performed a retrospective review of four patients that underwent five separate courses of intravenous (IV) phage therapy with concomitant antibiotic for treatment of endovascular Pseudomonas aeruginosa LVAD infection. We assessed phage susceptibility, bacterial strain sequencing, serum neutralization, biofilm activity, and shelf-life of phage preparations. Five treatments of one to four wild-type virulent phage(s) were administered for 14-51 days after informed consent and regulatory approval. There was no successful outcome. Breakthrough bacteremia occurred in four of five treatments. Two patients died from the underlying infection. We noted a variable decline in phage susceptibility following three of five treatments, four of four tested developed serum neutralization, and prophage presence was confirmed in isolates of two tested patients. Two phage preparations showed an initial titer drop. Phage biofilm activity was confirmed in two. Phage susceptibility alone was not predictive of clinical efficacy in P. aeruginosa endovascular LVAD infection. IV phage was associated with serum neutralization in most cases though lack of clinical effect may be multifactorial including presence of multiple bacterial isolates with varying phage susceptibility, presence of prophages, decline in phage titers, and possible lack of biofilm activity. Breakthrough bacteremia occurred frequently (while the organism remained susceptible to administered phage) and is an important safety consideration."

Whether the cortical mechanisms underlying categorization operate in an all-or-none or graded fashion remains unclear. In this study, we addressed this issue in the context of the face-specific N170. Specifically, we investigated whether N170 amplitudes grade with the amount of face information available in an image, or a full response is generated whenever a face is perceived. We employed linear mixed-effects modeling to inspect the dependency of N170 amplitudes on stimulus properties and duration, and their relationships to participants' subjective perception. Consistent with previous studies, we found a stronger N170 evoked by faces presented for longer durations. However, further analysis with equivalence tests revealed that this duration effect was eliminated when only faces perceived with high confidence were considered. Therefore, previous evidence supporting the graded hypothesis is more likely to be an artifact of mixing heterogeneous \"all\" and \"none\" trial types in signal averaging. These results support the hypothesis that the N170 is generated in an all-or-none manner and, by extension, suggest that categorization of faces may follow a similar pattern."

The objectives of this study were to describe sonographic characteristics of the fetal GI tract in the late gestation mare and identify changes that occur with progressing fetal maturity. Based on these characteristics, a grading scale modeled after the existing human and canine scoring system was developed. Weekly sonographic examination of the fetus by one observer beginning 2-3 weeks prior to a calculated due date of 330 days was performed. Fetal assessment included; presence of stomach rugae, bowel segment definition (uniform echogenic, some defined, clearly defined), bowel segment dilation (none, segmental dilation), intestinal contents (none, mixed echogenicity) and peristalsis (none, occasional, every 3 s, continuous). Based on these characteristics a phase was assigned to the GI tract (1-5). Phase 1 was defined as a uniform echogenic grey area caudal to the diaphragm. The differentiation of Phase 2-5 was based primarily on the frequency of peristalsis, with Phase 2 exhibiting no peristalsis, Phase 3 exhibiting occasional peristalsis, Phase 4 exhibiting peristalsis every 3 s and Phase 5 exhibiting continuous peristalsis. Only data from mares with a normal parturition and healthy foals were included in the statistics (N = 10). Associations amongst sonographic fetal GI characteristics and days prepartum were validated using a simulation-based bootstrap approach with 1000 replicates using Stata 14. Stomach rugae, peristalsis, intestinal contents, tail head relaxation and udder development were all highly correlated with days prepartum. Using a multiple linear regression model, tail head relaxation and peristalsis predicted days prepartum with a 95% CI ± 6 days. The same model predicted days prepartum with a 95% CI ± 4 days when day of gestation, tail head relaxation and peristalsis were included as variables. Based on these findings, characterization of the fetal GI tract could provide valuable information concerning the maturity of the equine fetus.

Submacular choroidal thickness (ChT), total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), and choriocapillaris flow deficit (CcFD) were estimated using images obtained from optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In this population, the mean ChT was 260.4 ± 63.3 µm, TCA was 1.56 ± 0.38 mm2, LA was 0.94 ± 0.25 mm2, and SA was 0.62 ± 0.15 mm2. The mean CVI was 60.25 ± 3.21% and CcFD was 11.95 ± 1.98%. Multivariable analyses showed that higher CVI and LA was associated with older age, thicker ChT, and shorter AL; and lower CcFD was associated with shorter AL. However, the associations were not uniformly rectilinear between CcFD and age. Specifically, CcFD was positively associated with age in subjects ≤19 years old and negatively associated with age in subjects >19 years old.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Development of the choroidal medium- and large-sized vascular layers and choriocapillaris was different across patients aged 8 to 30 years old. Greater axial length was associated with attenuated choroidal circulation. Choroidal thickness correlated well with choroidal vascularity, but not with choriocapillaris perfusion. Further comprehensive and longitudinal assessment of choroidal vasculature and choriocapillaris perfusion will help greatly to understand the physiological and pathological mechanisms responsible for myopia."

After treating EAU with upadacitinib, we analyzed immune cell gene expression and cell-cell communication by integrating scRNA data.

Upadacitinib effectively alleviated EAU symptoms, reduced JAK1 protein expression, and suppressed pathogenic CD4 T cell (CD4TC) proliferation and pathogenicity while promoting Treg proliferation. The inhibition of pathogenic CD4TCs by upadacitinib was observed in both flow cytometry and scRNA data. Additionally, upadacitinib was found to rescue the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)+ CD4TCs and CD8 T and B cell ratios and reduce expression of inflammatory-related genes. Upadacitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit abnormally activated cell-cell communication, particularly the CXCR4-mediated migration pathway, which has been implicated in EAU pathogenesis. CXCR4 inhibitors showed promising therapeutic effects in EAU.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings indicate that the JAK1-mediated signaling pathway is significantly upregulated in uveitis, and upadacitinib exhibits therapeutic efficacy against EAU.

The breadth of options available in this growing field increases the need for standardization of terminology and reporting criteria to facilitate effective communication of ideas and appropriate comparison among treatments that use different technologies, such as chemical (eg, ethanol or acetic acid) ablation, thermal therapies (eg, radiofrequency, laser, microwave, focused ultrasound, and cryoablation) and newer ablative modalities such as irreversible electroporation. This updated consensus document provides a framework that will facilitate the clearest communication among investigators regarding ablative technologies. An appropriate vehicle is proposed for reporting the various aspects of image-guided ablation therapy including classification of therapies, procedure terms, descriptors of imaging guidance, and terminology for imaging and pathologic findings. Methods are addressed for standardizing reporting of technique, follow-up, complications, and clinical results. As noted in the original document from 2003, adherence to the recommendations will improve the precision of communications in this field, leading to more accurate comparison of technologies and results, and ultimately to improved patient outcomes."

            "abstract": "Human memory can be unreliable, and when reading a sentence with a pragmatic implication, such as \"the karate champion hit the cinder block,\" people often falsely remember that the karate champion \"broke\" the cinder block. Yet, research has shown that encoding instructions affect the false memories we form. On the one hand, instructing participants to imagine themselves manipulating the to-be-recalled items increase false memories (imagination inflation effect). But on the other hand, instructions to imagine have reduced false memories in the DRM paradigm (imagination facilitation effect). Here, we explored the effect of imaginal encoding with pragmatic inferences, a way to study false memories for information about everyday actions. Across two experiments, we manipulated imaginal encoding through the instructions given to participants and the after-item filler task (none vs. math operations). In Experiment 1, participants were either assigned to the encoding condition of imagine+no filler; pay attention+math; or memorize+math. In Experiment 2, the encoding instructions (imagine vs. memorize) and the filler task (none vs. math) were compared across four separate conditions. Results from the two experiments showed that imagination instructions lead to better memory, by showing a higher proportion of correct responses and better performance in a memory benefit index. Similarly, a significant reduction of false memories was observed across both experiments, even though a complementary Bayesian analysis only supported this conclusion for Experiment 1. The findings show that imaginal encoding improves memory, suggesting the engagement of a distinctiveness heuristic and source-monitoring process."

Unfortunately, clozapine demonstrates clinical efficacy in only ~30-60 % of patients with TRS (clozapine-responders; ClzR+), while the remaining ~40-70 % are left with no pharmacological recourse for improvement (clozapine-resistant; ClzR-). Mechanism(s) underlying clozapine's superior efficacy remain unclear. However, in vitro evidence suggests clozapine may mitigate glutamatergic dysregulations observed in TRS, by modulating astrocyte activity in ClzR+, but not ClzR-. A factor that if proven correct, may help the assessment of treatment response and development of more effective antipsychotics. To explore the presence of clozapine-astrocyte interaction and clinical improvement, we used 3 T proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify levels of myo-Inositol, surrogate biomarker of astrocyte activity, in regions related to schizophrenia neurobiology: Dorsal-anterior-cingulate-cortex (dACC), left-dorsolateral-prefrontal-cortex (left-DLPFC), and left-striatum (left-striatum) of 157 participants (ClzR- = 30; ClzR+ = 37; responders = 38; controls = 52). Clozapine treatment was assessed using clozapine to norclozapine plasma levels, 11-12 h after last clozapine dose. Measures for symptom severity (i.e., Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale) and cognition (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination) were also recorded. Higher levels of myo-Inositol were observed in TRS groups versus responders and controls (dACC (p < 0.001); left-striatum (p = 0.036); left-DLPFC (p = 0.023)). In ClzR+, but not ClzR-, clozapine to norclozapine ratios were positively associated with myo-Inositol levels (dACC (p = 0.004); left-DLPFC (p < 0.001)), and lower positive symptom severity (p < 0.001). Our results support growing in vitro evidence of clozapine-astrocyte interaction in clozapine-responders.

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Retinal degeneration (RD) is a large cluster of retinopathies that is characterized by the progressive photoreceptor death and visual impairments. CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling has been documented to mediate the microglia activation and gliosis reaction during neurodegeneration. We intend to verify whether the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling is involved in the RD pathology.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A pharmacologically induced RD mice model was established. AZD8797, a CX3CR1 antagonist, was injected into the vitreous cavity of an RD model to modulate the neuroglia activation. Then, the experimental animals were subjected to functional, morphological, and behavioral analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling mediated neuroglia activation was implicated in the photoreceptor demise of an RD model. Intravitreal injection of AZD8797 preserved the retinal structure and enhanced the photoreceptor survival through inhibiting the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 expressions. Fundus photography showed that the distribution of retinal vessel was clear, and the severity of lesions was alleviated by AZD8797. In particular, these morphological benefits could be translated into remarkable functional improvements, as evidenced by the behavioral test and electroretinogram (mf-ERG) examination. A mechanism study showed that AZD8797 mitigated the microglia activation and migration in the degenerative retinas. The Müller cell hyper-reaction and secondary gliosis response were also suppressed by AZD8797.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The neuroinflammation is implicated in the photoreceptor loss of RD pathology. Targeting the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy. Future refinements of these findings may cast light into the discovery of new medications for RD."

Objective To present two cases of neurogenic shock that occurred immediately following posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and that appeared to have been caused by the vasovagal reflex after dural injury and incarceration of the cauda equina. Case Report We present two cases of neurogenic shock that occurred immediately following PLIF. One patient had bradycardia, and the other developed cardiac arrest just after closing the surgical incision and opening the drainage tube. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed immediately, and the patients recovered successfully, but they showed severe motor loss after awakening. The results of laboratory data, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, computed tomography, and echocardiography ruled out pulmonary embolism, hemorrhagic shock, and cardiogenic shock. Although the reasons for the postoperative shock were obscure, reoperation was performed to explore the cause of paralysis. At reoperation, a cerebrospinal fluid collection and the incarceration of multiple cauda equina rootlets through a small dural tear were observed. The incarcerated cauda equina rootlets were reduced, and the dural defect was closed. In both cases, the reoperation was uneventful. From the intraoperative findings at reoperation, it was thought that the pathology was neurogenic shock via the vasovagal reflex. Conclusion Incarceration of multiple cauda equina rootlets following the accidental dural tear by suction drainage caused a sudden decrease of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and traction of the cauda equina, which may have led to the vasovagal reflex."

MD was positively associated with experiencing exposure to one, or two or more, incidences of political violence (compared to none), and greater interpersonal and intrapersonal resource loss. Among women, PTSD was positively associated with greater interpersonal and intrapersonal resource loss, and MD was positively associated with death of a loved one, two or more socio-political stressors (compared to none) previous to the past year, one or more socio-political stressors (compared to none) in the past year, and greater interpersonal and intrapersonal resource loss. Interpersonal and intrapersonal resource losses were consistently associated with PTSD and MD, suggesting potential targets for intervention and prevention efforts and thus provide important keys to treatment in areas of ongoing conflict."

They underwent three monthly injections of intravitreal ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. After an initial clinical examination (baseline measurement), a follow-up visit was performed to determine treatment response one month after the third injection (treatment evaluation). Patients were evaluated based on ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography. Peripheral venous blood was collected for DNA analysis at baseline visit. Patients were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms within AMD-relevant genes and classified on good or poor responders based on visual acuity, central retinal thickness, intraretinal fluid, and subretinal fluid.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred ten AMD-associated SNPs have been analyzed.

            "abstract": "Chemoimmunotherapy with anti-programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 and cytotoxic chemotherapy is a promising therapeutic modality for women with triple-negative breast cancer, but questions remain regarding optimal chemotherapy backbone and biomarkers for patient selection. We report final outcomes from a phase Ib trial evaluating pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) with either weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly) or flat-dose capecitabine (2000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days of every 14-day cycle) in the 1st/2nd line setting. The primary endpoint is safety (receipt of 2 cycles without grade III/IV toxicities requiring discontinuation or ≥21-day delays). The secondary endpoint is efficacy (week 12 objective response). Exploratory aims are to characterize immunologic effects of treatment over time, and to evaluate novel biomarkers. The trial demonstrates that both regimens meet the pre-specified safety endpoint (paclitaxel: 87%; capecitabine: 100%). Objective response rate is 29% for pembrolizumab/paclitaxel (n = 4/13, 95% CI: 10-61%) and 43% for pembrolizumab/capecitabine (n = 6/14, 95% CI: 18-71%). Partial responses are observed in two subjects with chemo-refractory metaplastic carcinoma (both in capecitabine arm). Both regimens are associated with significant peripheral leukocyte contraction over time. Response is associated with clinical PD-L1 score, non-receipt of prior chemotherapy, and the H&E stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte score, but also by a novel 27 gene IO score and spatial biomarkers (lymphocyte spatial skewness). In conclusion, pembrolizumab with paclitaxel or capecitabine is safe and clinically active. Both regimens are lymphodepleting, highlighting the competing immunostimulatory versus lymphotoxic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further exploration of the IO score and spatial TIL biomarkers is warranted. The clinical trial registration is NCT02734290."

We report six cases of thyroid mucoepidermoid carcinoma, four occurred in women and two in men with an age range of 29 to 57 (median, 46 years). The clinical presentation was that of a painless mass. Radiographic studies showed a single, solid, \"cold\" nodule in either the right or left lobe, or isolated to the isthmus. There was no history of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma developing in more typical locations (eg, salivary gland) in any of the patients. Histologically, the tumors were characterized by an intimate admixture of squamoid/epidermoid cells and mucocytes. The tumors were delineated but not encapsulated with prominent cyst formation and a variable amount of associated fibrosis. The squamoid component showed horny pearl formation, individual cell keratinization and/or the presence of intercellular bridges. Intracytoplasmic and luminal epithelial mucin was observed in all cases. In three of the cases a prominent eosinophilic cellular infiltrate was intimately identified within the neoplastic proliferation. One other case was noteworthy for the presence of ciliated epithelium. In all of the cases the uninvolved thyroid tissue showed the presence of lymphocytic thyroiditis. Rare foci of squamous metaplasia were observed in two of the cases. A microscopic focus of thyroid papillary carcinoma was observed adjacent to the mucoepidermoid carcinoma in one case. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the mucoepidermoid carcinoma showed the following antigenic profile: cytokeratin (five of five), CAM 5.2 (four of four), thyroglobulin (five of six), calcitonin (none of six), chromogranin (none of six), polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (four of four), and monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (none of five). Surgical excision was the treatment of choice. All of the patients reported are alive without disease (recurrence or metastasis) over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years. Based on our findings, we believe that these tumors are of low-grade malignant potential and originate from thyroid follicular epithelial cells rather than from solid cell nests of the ultimobranchial body."

OKT thresholds were tested at single ages (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 months) in naïve groups of rats, or daily in groups that began at eye-opening (P15) or 10 days later (P25). Electroretinogram (ERG) response amplitudes were recorded after OKT testing, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness measurements were then obtained.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      OKT thresholds, when measured at a single time point in naïve Tg lines beginning at P30, did not decline until months after significant photoreceptor loss. Daily testing of Tg lines resulted mostly with OKT thresholds inversely related to photoreceptor degeneration, with rapid degenerations resulting in sustained OKT thresholds for long periods despite the rapid photoreceptor loss. Slower degenerations resulted in rapid decline of thresholds, long before the loss of most photoreceptors, which was even more pronounced when daily testing began at eye opening. This amplified loss of function was not a result of testing-induced damage to the rod or cone photoreceptors, as ERG amplitudes and ONL thicknesses were the same as untested controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The unexpected lack of correlation of OKT testing with photoreceptor degeneration in the Tg rats emphasizes the need in behavioral therapeutic studies for careful analysis of visual thresholds of experimental animals prior to therapeutic intervention."

However, their functional effects are not fully characterized. We previously identified a rare, AMD-associated variant in CFH (P503A, rs570523689) in 19 Amish individuals, but its functional consequences were not investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed genotyping for CFH P503A in 1326 Amish individuals to identify additional risk allele carriers.

Alacrimia and hypolacrimia, which are relatively rare during childhood or young adulthood, have their origin in a number of mechanisms which include agenesia, aplasia, hypoplasia, or incorrect maturation of the gland. Moreover, impaired innervation of the gland and/or the cornea and alterations of protein secretion pathways can lead to a defective tear film. In most conditions leading to alacrimia or hypolacrimia, however, the altered tear film is only one of numerous defects that arise and therefore is commonly disregarded. Here, we have systematically reviewed all of those genetic conditions or congenital disorders that have alacrimia or hypolacrimia as a feature. Where it is known, we describe the mechanism of the defect in question. It has been possible to clearly establish the physiopathology of only a minority of these conditions. As hypolacrimia and alacrimia are rare features, this review could be used as a tool in clinical genetics to perform a quick diagnosis, necessary for appropriate care and counseling."

We used CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi technologies to knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) nat10, the zebrafish ortholog of human NAT10, and evaluated its effects on early development. To assess the impact of nat10 knockdown on visual function, we performed comprehensive histological evaluations and behavioral analyses. Transcriptome profiling and real-time (RT)-PCR were utilized to detect alterations in gene expression resulting from the nat10 knockdown. Dot-blot and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-PCR analyses were conducted to verify changes in ac4C levels in both total RNA and opsin mRNA specifically.

Behavioral and histological assessments indicated significant vision impairment in nat10 KD zebrafish. Transcriptomic analysis and RT-PCR identified substantial downregulation of retinal transcripts related to phototransduction, light response, photoreceptors, and visual perception in the nat10 KD group. Dot-blot and RIP-PCR analyses confirmed a pronounced reduction in ac4C levels in both total RNA and specifically in opsin messenger RNA (mRNA).

Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD), microvascular reactivity [reactive hyperemia index (RHI)] and arterial stiffness [pulse wave velocity (PWV)] were measured at rest and 30-min after mental stress. The digital microvascular vasomotor response during mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). A total of 106(16.1%) patients had MSIMI. Mental stress was accompanied by significant increases in rate-pressure-product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure; RPP), epinephrine levels and PWV, and significant decreases in FMD and PAT ratio denoting microvascular constriction. In comparison to those with no MSIMI, patients with MSIMI had higher hemodynamic and digital vasoconstrictive responses (p<0.05 for both), but did not differ in epinephrine, endothelial or macrovascular responses. Only presence of ischemia during conventional stress (OR of 7.1, 95%CI of 4.2, 11.9), high hemodynamic response (OR for RPP response≥vs<ROC cutoff of 1.8, 95%CI of 1.1, 2.8), and high digital vasoconstriction (OR for PAT ratio<vs≥ROC cutoff of 2.1, 95%CI of 1.3, 3.3) were independent predictors of MSIMI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Ischemia during conventional stress testing and hemodynamic and vasoconstrictive responses to mental stress can help predict subjects with CAD at greater risk of developing MSIMI."

It has been suggested that gut microbiota can produce reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines that may travel from the gastric mucosa to distal sites, for example, the optic nerve head or trabecular meshwork. There is evidence for a gut-eye axis, as microbial dysbiosis has been associated with retinal diseases. We investigated the microbial composition in patients with glaucoma and healthy controls. Moreover, we analyzed the association of the gut microbiome with intraocular pressure (IOP; risk factor of glaucoma) and vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR; quantifying glaucoma severity).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The discovery analyses included participants of the Rotterdam Study and the Erasmus Glaucoma Cohort.

            "abstract": "Refractive errors are common eye disorders characterized by a mismatch between the focal power of the eye and its axial length. An increased axial length is a common cause of the refractive error myopia (nearsightedness). The substantial increase in myopia prevalence over the last decades has raised public health concerns because myopia can lead to severe ocular complications later in life. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have made considerable contributions to the understanding of the genetic architecture of refractive errors. Among the hundreds of genetic variants identified, common variants near the gap junction delta-2 (GJD2) gene have consistently been reported as one of the top hits. GJD2 encodes the connexin 36 (Cx36) protein, which forms gap junction channels and is highly expressed in the neural retina. In this review, we provide current evidence that links GJD2(Cx36) to the development of myopia. We summarize the gap junctional communication in the eye and the specific role of GJD2(Cx36) in retinal processing of visual signals. Finally, we discuss the pathways involving dopamine and gap junction phosphorylation and coupling as potential mechanisms that may explain the role of GJD2(Cx36) in refractive error development."

The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, used to treat epilepsy, and has beneficial effects for neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to determine whether the ketogenic diet could slow retinal degeneration.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Early weaned, rd10 and wild-type (WT) mice were placed on either standard chow, a ketogenic diet, or a ketogenic & low-protein diet. From postnatal day (PD) 23 to PD50, weight and blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels were recorded. Retinal thickness, retinal function, and visual performance were measured via optical coherence tomography, electroretinography (ERG), and optokinetic tracking (OKT). At PD40, serum albumin, rhodopsin protein, and phototransduction gene expression were measured.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both ketogenic diets elicited a systemic induction of ketosis. However, rd10 mice on the ketogenic & low-protein diet had significant increases in photoreceptor thickness, ERG amplitudes, and OKT thresholds, whereas rd10 mice on the ketogenic diet showed no photoreceptor preservation. In both rd10 and WT mice, the ketogenic & low-protein diet was associated with abnormal weight gain and decreases in serum albumin levels, 27% and 56%, respectively. In WT mice, the ketogenic & low-protein diet was also associated with an ∼20% to 30% reduction in ERG amplitudes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The ketogenic & low-protein diet slowed retinal degeneration in a clinically relevant IRD model.

We performed gene expression analyses and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies looking for new markers predicting the recurrence risk. We analyzed expression profiles of 23 meningiomas (10 grade I, 10 grade II, and 3 grade III) and validated the data using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We performed LOH analysis on 40 meningiomas, investigating chromosomal regions on 1p, 9p, 10q, 14q, and 22q. We found 233 and 268 probe sets to be significantly down- and upregulated, respectively, in grade II or III meningiomas. Genes downregulated in high-grade meningiomas were overrepresented on chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, and 14. Based on functional enrichment analysis, we selected LIM domain and actin binding 1 (LIMA1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3), cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2), leptin receptor (LEPR), and baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5) for validation using qPCR and confirmed their differential expression in the two groups of tumors. We calculated ΔCt values of CKS2 and LEPR and found that their differential expression (C-L index) was significantly higher in grade I than in grade II or III meningiomas (p < .0001). Interestingly, the C-L index of nine grade I meningiomas from patients who relapsed in <5 years was significantly lower than in grade I meningiomas from patients who did not relapse. These findings indicate that the C-L index may be relevant to define the progression risk in meningioma patients, helping guide their clinical management.

All patients received LTFC and were randomized (1:1) to group 1, morning (8 AM) dosing, or group 2, evening (8 PM) dosing. Vehicle drops were used in the morning or evening, accordingly, to preserve masking. Patients were treated for 4 weeks.

            "abstract": "Elevated [Ca(2+)](i) in human red blood cells (RBCs) activates IK1 K(+) channels leading to cell dehydration. NS309, a powerful IK1 agonist, has been shown to activate IK1 channels even at sub-physiological [Ca(2+)](i) levels. An intriguing feature of this response is its all-or-none nature, with responsive cells dehydrating fully and refractory cells retaining normal volume. We investigated the mechanism of this response suspecting cell-age involvement. We expected the younger cells, with the more vigorous plasma membrane Ca(2+) pumps (PMCA), to be the refractory cells because of their lower [Ca(2+)](i). Osmotic fragility measurements and density separation through phthalate oil were used to monitor red cell dehydration. The fraction of glycosilated haemoglobin (Hb A1c) was used to estimate the mean age of density fractionated cells. The results showed that inhibition of the PMCA by vanadate abolished the all-or-none response, that the mean age of the responsive cells was young, contrary to expectations, and that pump inhibition subsequent to an all-or-none response caused the refractory cells to dehydrate fully, suggesting that the all-or-none response resulted from a reduced efficiency of NS309 to increase the Ca(2+) sensitivity of IK1 channels in aged RBCs."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nTelevision viewing (TV), a highly prevalent behaviour, is associated with higher cardiovascular risk independently of physical activity. The relationship with mortality, however, is relatively unknown.\n## METHODS\nWe examined the prospective relationship between TV time and all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality in a population-based cohort [The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), Norfolk] of 13 197 men and women {age [SD (standard deviation)]: 61.5 ± 9.0 years}. Participants were free from stroke, myocardial infarction and cancer at baseline in 1998-2000 and were followed up for death ascertainment until 2009 (9.5 ± 1.6 years). TV time, total physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use, participant and family history of disease and total energy intake were self-reported; height and weight were measured by standardized procedures. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for mortality were estimated per 1-h/day increase in TV.\n## RESULTS\nEach 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with increased hazard of all-cause (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09; 1270 deaths) and cardiovascular (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.15; 373 deaths), but not cancer mortality (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.98-1.10; 570 deaths). This was independent of gender, age, education, smoking, alcohol, medication, diabetes history, family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, body mass index (BMI) and PAEE. They were similar when stratified by gender, age, education, BMI and PAEE. The population-attributable fraction for all-cause mortality comparing the highest TV tertile (>3.6 h/day) with the lowest (<2.5 h/day) was 5.4%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that public health recommendations should consider advising a reduction in TV time, a predominant leisure activity in modern society, in addition to advocating physical activity.\n"

            "abstract": "Anthracyclines are among the most active drugs in breast cancer. Because of excessive cardiotoxicity, their use in combination with trastuzumab has been discouraged in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2(+) metastatic breast cancer. We sought to describe how this treatment paradigm influenced the use of anthracyclines in this patient setting. We analyzed a multi-institutional database containing the treatment history of 450 patients who received at least one trastuzumab-based regimen for HER-2(+) metastatic breast cancer. Patients were considered eligible for anthracyclines for metastatic disease if they were never exposed (NE) or had been previously exposed (PE) to an anthracycline in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and had relapsed after 12 months from the last dose. We then assessed the use of anthracycline-based therapy after failure with the first trastuzumab-based regimen in eligible patients. Three-hundred twenty-one patients were considered eligible for anthracyclines. In total, 190 eligible patients developing disease progression during the initial trastuzumab-based therapy were analyzed. An anthracycline was administered as first salvage treatment in 14 NE and two PE patients. Another 15 NE and nine PE patients received an anthracycline as a further line of therapy. Of 119 eligible patients who died from breast cancer, only 30 received an anthracycline for metastatic disease. In conclusion, despite the fact that two thirds of the patients receiving trastuzumab-based therapy for HER-2 metastatic breast cancer are eligible for anthracyclines, these drugs are infrequently used nowadays to treat trastuzumab-refractory disease. A role for these compounds should be redefined in this patient subset."

            "abstract": "Balbiani ring premessenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles are built from a 7-nm RNP fiber which is tightly folded into a ring-shaped RNP ribbon. Isolated particles are known to disintegrate in all-or-none fashion upon RNase A treatment. In the present study we investigated whether this mode of disintegration is dependent on an intact particle structure or is inherent in the 7-nm fiber. When treated at low ionic strength, the Balbiani ring (BR) particles lost their higher order structure and the 7-nm fiber was unpacked, as evidenced by sucrose gradient sedimentation and electron microscopy. When treated with RNase A, unfolded as well as intact particles disintegrated in the all-or-none fashion, with similar kinetics and without apparent intermediates. Proteinase K treatment, however, obliterated this pattern: the protein-free particle RNA degraded progressively. As the typical disintegration pattern of the particles was not altered by unfolding, but was lost by deproteinization, the all-or-none mode of disintegration is likely to be a property of the 7-nm RNP fiber."

DGE management is variable with no gold standard prevention or treatment. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of intraoperative pyloric botulinum toxin injection in preventing DGE. All patients undergoing an ILGO for curative intent, semi-mechanical anastomosis, and enhanced recovery between 1st December 2011 and 30th June 2017 were included. Patients with pyloroplasties were excluded and botulinum toxin was routinely given from the 2nd April 2016. We compared botulinum toxin injection (BOTOX) against no intervention (NONE) for patient demographics, adjuvant therapy, surgical approach, DGE incidence, length of stay (LOS), and complications. Additionally, we compared pneumonia risk, anastomotic leak rate, and LOS in DGE versus non-DGE patients. DGE was defined using nasogastric tube input/output differences and chest X-ray appearance according to an algorithm adopted in our unit, which were retrospectively applied. There were 228 patients: 65 (28.5%) received botulinum toxin and 163 (71.5%) received no intervention. One hundred twenty-four (54.4%) operations were performed laparoscopically, of which 11 (4.8%) were converted to open procedures, and 104 (45.6%) were open operations. DGE incidence was 11 (16.9%) in BOTOX and 29 (17.8%) in NONE, P = 0.13. Medical management was required in 14 of 228 (6.1%) cases: 3 (4.6%) in BOTOX and 11 (4.8%) in NONE. Pyloric dilatation was required in 26 of 228 (11.4%): 8 of 65 (12.3%) in the BOTOX and 18 of 163 (11.0%) in NONE. There were no significant differences between groups and requirement for intervention, P = 0.881. Overall median LOS was 10 (6.0-75.0) days: 9 (7.0-75.0) in BOTOX and 10 (6.0-70.0) in NONE, P = 0.516. In non-DGE versus DGE patients, median LOS was 9 (6-57) versus 14 (7-75) days (P < 0.0001), pneumonia incidence of 27.7% versus 30.0% (P = 0.478), and anastomotic leak rate of 2.1% versus 10.0% (P = 0.014). Overall leak rate was 3.5%. Overall complication rate was 67.1%, including minor/mild complications. There were 43 of 65 (66.2%) in BOTOX and 110 of 163 (67.5%) in NONE, P = 0.482. In-hospital mortality was 1 (0.44%), 30-day mortality was 2 (0.88%), 90-day mortality was 5 (2.2%), and there were no 30-day readmissions. Intraoperative pyloric botulinum toxin injections were ineffective in preventing DGE (BOTOX vs. NONE: 16.9% vs. 17.8%) or reducing postoperative complications. DGE was relatively common (17.5%) with 11.4% of patients requiring postoperative balloon dilatation. DGE also resulted in prolonged LOS (increase from 9 to 14 days) and significant increase in leak rate from 2.1% to 10.0%.

A better identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy is warranted in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). As adipose tissue releases angiogenic factors, we determined whether parameters such as visceral fat area (VFA) were associated with outcome in these patients. Experimental Design. In 113 patients with mRCC who received antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib) (n = 64) or cytokines (n = 49) as first-line treatment, we used computed tomography to measure VFA and subcutaneous fat area (SFA). We evaluated associations linking body mass index (BMI), SFA, and VFA to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Results. High SFA and VFA values were significantly associated with shorter TTP and OS. By multivariate analysis, high VFA was independently associated with shorter TTP and OS. These results were internally validated using bootstrap analysis. By contrast, VFA was not associated with survival in the cytokine group. In the whole population, interaction between VFA and treatment group was significant for TTP and OS, thereby confirming the results. Conclusion. Our study provides the first evidence that high VFA could be a predictive biomarker from shorter survival in patients given first-line antiangiogenic agents for mRCC."

However, cutaneous adverse reactions that cause dyspigmentation in patients have been rarely reported. Erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP) is a rare pigmentary condition that causes ashy-grey hyperpigmented macules and patches, with a few cases reported from EGFRi in the literature. The disfiguration caused by this condition may negatively impact patients' quality of life. Our study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of EDP induced by EGFRi to better recognize and manage the condition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a multicenter retrospective review at three academic institutions to identify patients with EDP induced by EGFRi from 2017 to 2023 and included sixteen patients in our study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median age of patients was 66 years old, with 63% female and 37% male (Table 1). The majority of our patients were Asian (88%). All patients had non-small cell lung cancer and most patients received osimertinib. Median time to EDP was 6 months. The most common areas of distribution were the head/neck region, lower extremities, and upper extremities. Various topical ointments were trialed; however, approximately less than half had improvement in their disease and most patients had persistent EDP with no resolution. All patients desired treatment except one with EDP on the tongue, and there was no cancer treatment discontinuation or interruption due to EDP.

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Achromatopsia is a rare inherited disorder rendering retinal cone photoreceptors nonfunctional. As a consequence, the sizable foveal representation in the visual cortex is congenitally deprived of visual input, which prompts a fundamental question: is the cortical representation of the central visual field in patients with achromatopsia remapped to take up processing of paracentral inputs? Such remapping might interfere with gene therapeutic treatments aimed at restoring cone function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a multicenter study to explore the nature and plasticity of vision in the absence of functional cones in a cohort of 17 individuals affected by autosomal recessive achromatopsia and confirmed biallelic disease-causing CNGA3 or CNGB3 mutations. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis of foveal remapping in human achromatopsia. For this purpose, we applied two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based mapping approaches, i.e. conventional phase-encoded eccentricity and population receptive field mapping, to separate data sets.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both fMRI approaches produced the same result in the group comparison of achromatopsia versus healthy controls: sizable remapping of the representation of the central visual field in the primary visual cortex was not apparent.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Remapping of the cortical representation of the central visual field is not a general feature in achromatopsia. It is concluded that plasticity of the human primary visual cortex is less pronounced than previously assumed. A pretherapeutic imaging workup is proposed to optimize interventions."

            "abstract": "The issue whether consciousness is a graded or an all-or-none phenomenon has been and continues to be a debate. Both contradictory accounts are supported by solid evidence. Starting from a level of processing framework allowing for states of partial awareness, here we further elaborate our view that visual experience, as it is most often investigated in the literature, is both graded and all-or-none. Low-level visual experience is graded, whereas high-level visual experience is all-or-none. We then present a conceptual analysis starting from the notion that consciousness is a general concept. We specify a number of different subconcepts present in the literature on consciousness, and outline how each of them may be seen as either graded, all-or-none, or both. We argue that such specifications are necessary to lead to a detailed and integrated understanding of how consciousness should be conceived of as graded and all-or-none."

This study aims to develop an automatic method for Retinal Image Quality Assessment (RIQA) that incorporates visual explanations, aiming to comprehensively evaluate the quality of retinal fundus images (RIs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed an automatic RIQA system, named Swin-MCSFNet, utilizing 28,792 RIs from the EyeQ dataset, as well as 2000 images from the EyePACS dataset and an additional 1,000 images from the OIA-ODIR dataset. After preprocessing, including cropping black regions, data augmentation, and normalization, a Swin-MCSFNet classifier based on the Swin-Transformer for multiple color-space fusion was proposed to grade the quality of RIs. The generalizability of Swin-MCSFNet was validated across multiple data centers. Additionally, for enhanced interpretability, a Score-CAM-generated heatmap was applied to provide visual explanations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Experimental results reveal that the proposed Swin-MCSFNet achieves promising performance, yielding a micro-receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.93 and ROC scores of 0.96, 0.81, and 0.96 for the \"Good,\" \"Usable,\" and \"Reject\" categories, respectively. These scores underscore the accuracy of RIQA based on Swin-MCSF in distinguishing among the three categories. Furthermore, heatmaps generated across different RIQA classification scores and various color spaces suggest that regions in the retinal images from multiple color spaces contribute significantly to the decision-making process of the Swin-MCSFNet classifier.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study demonstrates that the proposed Swin-MCSFNet outperforms other methods in experiments conducted on multiple datasets, as evidenced by the superior performance metrics and insightful Score-CAM heatmaps.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      This study constructs a new retinal image quality evaluation system, which will contribute to the subsequent research of retinal images."

Gilts bred with NS/AI, AI/AI, and NS/NS had higher (P less than .05) farrowing rates than gilts bred with NS/none matings. Similarly, farrowing rates were higher (P less than .05) in NS/AI than in NS/NS gilts. Numbers of pigs born alive were greater (P less than .05) in NS/NS, NS/AI, and AI/AI than in NS/none gilts. In sows, a treatment x time interaction (P less than .01) was present for farrowing rate. In the AI/AI treatment, farrowing rate increased (P less than .01) from 70.0% (wk 1 through 3) to 88.5% (wk 4 through 10). Farrowing rates were 87.3, 93.2, and 76.0% in the NS/NS, NS/AI, and NS/none groups, respectively, and did not change (P = .72) over time. Sows bred via NS/NS and NS/AI had larger litters (P less than .05) than NS/none sows. In the present study, if four or more sows and gilts were bred, then AI required less (P less than .05) time per animal than NS.

These plasmids were used to investigate the effects of mutations on protein expression levels, Norrin/β-catenin activation capacity, membrane localization, norrin binding ability, and DVL2 recruitment ability in HEK293T, HEK293STF, and HeLa cells.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All five novel mutations (S91F, V103E, C145S, E160K, C377F) responsible for FEVR were found to compromise Norrin/β-catenin activation of FZD4 protein. After reviewing a total of 34 reported missense mutations, we categorized all mutations based on their functional changes: signal peptide mutations, cysteine mutations affecting disulfide bonds, extracellular domain mutations influencing norrin binding, transmembrane domain (TM) 1 and TM7 mutations impacting membrane localization, and intracellular domain mutations affecting DVL2 recruitment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We expanded the spectrum of FZD4 mutations relevant to FEVR and experimentally demonstrated that missense mutations in FZD4 can be classified into five categories based on different functional changes."

The ex vivo induction of the BM-MDSCs was assessed using flow cytometry, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and nitric oxide (NO) production in allogeneic stimulation. T-cell proliferation and regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion were investigated on allogeneic stimulation in the presence of ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs. IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. After subconjunctival injection of ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs, the migration of the BM-MDSCs into corneal grafts, allogeneic corneal graft survival, neovascularization, and lymphangiogenesis were assessed using flow cytometry, slit-lamp microscopy, and immunohistochemistry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The combination of GM-CSF and IL-6 significantly induced BM-MDSCs with increased iNos mRNA expression. The ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs promoted NO release in allogeneic stimulation in vitro. The ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs inhibited T-cell proliferation and promoted Treg expansion. Decreased IFN-γ and increased IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 production was observed in coculture of ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs. Injected ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs were confirmed to migrate into the grafts. The injected BM-MDSCs also prolonged corneal graft survival and prevented angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The ex vivo-induced BM-MDSCs have suppressive effects on allogeneic immune responses and prolong corneal allograft survival via the iNOS pathway, indicating that they may be a potential therapeutic tool for corneal transplantation."

            "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi has been variably associated with different forms of primary cutaneous lymphoma. Differences in prevalence rates among reported studies could be a result of geographic variability or heterogeneity in the molecular approaches that have been employed. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA in diagnostic tissue samples from fresh cutaneous biopsies of 98 primary cutaneous lymphomas and 19 normal skin controls. Three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols targeting the hbb, flagellin, and Osp-A genes were used. Direct sequencing of both sense and antisense strands of purified PCR products confirmed the specificity of the amplified fragments. Sequence specificity was assessed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and MultAlin software was used to investigate the heterogeneity of target gene sequences across the different samples. Borrelia DNA was not detected in 19 controls, 23 cases of follicular lymphoma, 31 cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, or 30 cases of mycosis fungoides. A single case of 14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases was positive for B. burgdorferi. This study does not support a pathogenic role of B. burgdorferi in primary cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas from areas nonendemic for this microorganism and the consequent rationale for the adoption of antibiotic therapy in these patients."

The objective of this study is to evaluate an auditory feedback system (AFS) used by the SCI subject when ambulating with the EMS-RGO. Three different types of auditory signals (M = metronome alone, MSL = metronome plus stride length information, and NONE = no auditory feedback) were examined at three different constant walking velocities (WV1 = 0.64 kph, WV2 = 1.22 kph, and WV3 = 1.80 kph). The experimental design was 3 x 3 full factorial with repeated measures, and the dependent variable was the absolute error (AE) of walking distance (absolute value of the distance the subject walked in one minute subtracted from the target distance). A block diagram and circuit schematic of the AFS is provided. The results indicate that at WV1 there is no significant difference of AE among the three auditory conditions (M, MSL and NONE). At WV2, the AE for the NONE auditory condition is significantly greater than the AE for M and MSL (p < 0.05). At WV3, the AE for the NONE auditory condition is significantly less than the AE for M and MSL (p < 0.05). Finally, there was no significant difference in AE between both the M and MSL auditory conditions at any of the three walking velocities. This study indicates that an adequate sensory feedback system for constant velocity control of ambulation in this SCI subject consists of metronome only auditory feedback.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The acini were then removed to isolate independent ducts. These MG ducts were subsequently cultivated on Matrigel-coated wells and covered with a glass plate to obtain HMGDCs. The HMGDCs were further cultivated until passage 2, and when they reached 60% confluence, they were treated with IL-1β and rosiglitazone for a duration of 48 hours.

The performance of the prediction model was evaluated using R2, mean difference between predicted and measured cycloplegic SER, and sensitivity and specificity for predicting myopia (cycloplegic SER ≤ -0.5 D).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among 3436 students (mean age, 9.7 years; 51% female), the mean (SD) noncycloplegic and cycloplegic SER values were -1.12 (1.97) D and -0.20 (2.19) D, respectively. The prediction model that included demographics, noncycloplegic SER, axial length/corneal curvature radius ratio, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), and intraocular pressure predicted cycloplegic SER with R2 of 0.93 in the development dataset and 0.92 in the validation dataset. The mean (SD) differences between predicted and measured cycloplegic SER were 0.0 (0.55) D in the development dataset and 0.06 (0.64) D in the validation dataset. In both the development and validation datasets, the combination of predicted SER and UCVA yielded high sensitivity (91.4% and 91.9%, respectively) and specificity (95.0% and 90.1%, respectively) for detecting myopia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cycloplegic refractive error can be predicted using measurements obtained under noncycloplegic conditions. The prediction model could potentially be used to correct the myopia prevalence in epidemiological studies in which administering cycloplegic agent on all participants is not feasible.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      The prediction model may provide a tool for correcting the overestimation of myopia from noncycloplegic refractive error in future epidemiological studies in which administering cycloplegic agent on all participants is not feasible."

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans were read to consensus by two masked graders for soft drusen, SDDs and choroidal thickness (CTh; choroidal thinning = CTh < 250 µm). Univariate testing was done with Fisher's exact test.

Mild ICA stenosis (≥1%-49%) was not significantly associated with ipsilateral SDDs. Multivariate regression found that older age (P = 0.015) and moderate or more ICA stenosis (P = 0.011) remained significant independent risks for ipsilateral SDDs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At least moderate ICA stenosis (≥50%-69%) is strongly associated with ipsilateral SDDs and choroidal thinning, supporting downstream ophthalmic artery and choroidal hypoperfusion from ICA stenosis as the mechanism for SDD formation.

We examined the associations of prolonged television viewing time with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/noncancer mortality in Australian adults.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nTelevision viewing time in relation to subsequent all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality (median follow-up, 6.6 years) was examined among 8800 adults > or =25 years of age in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). During 58 087 person-years of follow-up, there were 284 deaths (87 CVD deaths, 125 cancer deaths). After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, and exercise, the hazard ratios for each 1-hour increment in television viewing time per day were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.20) for all-cause mortality, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.35) for CVD mortality, and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.23) for cancer mortality. Compared with a television viewing time of <2 h/d, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.36) for > or =2 to <4 h/d and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.04 to 2.05) for > or =4 h/d. For CVD mortality, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.19 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.99) and 1.80 (95% CI, 1.00 to 3.25). The associations with both cancer mortality and non-CVD/noncancer mortality were not significant.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTelevision viewing time was associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. In addition to the promotion of exercise, chronic disease prevention strategies could focus on reducing sitting time, particularly prolonged television viewing.\n"

            "abstract": "Infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) occasionally leads to acute liver failure and has a higher fatality rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Vaccination of patients with HCV against HAV is effective and well tolerated. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of HAV vaccination in North American patients with chronic HCV. A decision analysis model was constructed to compare 3 HAV vaccination strategies in adult patients with chronic HCV over a period of 5 years: (1) vaccinate no patients (treat none); (2) vaccinate only susceptible (anti-HAV negative) patients (selective); or (3) vaccinate all patients without prior testing of immune status (universal). Probabilities and direct costs were estimated from hospital data and the literature. The cost per patient for the 3 vaccination strategies were: treat none, $2.00; selective, $56.00; and universal, $82.00. For every 1,000,000 patients with HCV vaccinated over a 5-year period, the selective strategy prevented 128 symptomatic cases of HAV, 3 liver transplantations, and 3 deaths owing directly to HAV compared with the treat none strategy. In addition, the selective strategy costs an additional $427,000 per patient with HAV prevented, and $23 million per HAV-related death averted, compared with the treat none strategy. The results were most sensitive to the incidence of HAV infection; vaccination increased costs if the annual rate of infection was less than 0.56% (baseline, 0.01%). Vaccination of North American patients with chronic HCV against HAV infection is not a cost-effective therapy."

Only in the domains 'Vascular & Ulcers' (ie, non-pharmacological approach to digital ulcer), 'PAH' (ie, screening and treatment), 'Treatment' and 'Juveniles' (ie, evaluation of juveniles with Raynaud's phenomenon) evidence-based and consensus-based guidelines could be included. Hence there is a preponderance of unmet needs in SSc referring to the diagnosis and (non-)pharmacological treatment of several SSc-specific complications. Patients with SSc experience significant uncertainty concerning SSc-related taxonomy, management (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and education. Day-to-day impact of the disease (loss of self-esteem, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and occupational, nutritional and relational problems) is underestimated and needs evaluation."

Competing-risk survival analysis was used to assess the factors associated with these changes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 195 eyes from 131 participants with diabetic retinopathy were included. Stable, regressed, obliterated, and progressed IRMA were observed in 65.1%, 12.8%, 11.3%, and 19% of eyes with diabetic retinopathy, respectively. Anti-VEGF injections during the follow-up periods and a slower increase of foveal avascular zone were associated with IRMA regression (P < 0.001 and P = 0.039). Obliterated IRMA were correlated with previous panretinal photocoagulation (P < 0.001) and a lower deep capillary plexus vessel density at baseline (P = 0.007), as well as with follow-up anti-VEGF injections (P = 0.025). A higher baseline ischemia index (ISI) and panretinal photocoagulation during the follow-up periods were associated with IRMA progression (P = 0.049 and P < 0.001). A faster increase in ISI predicted the development of NV elsewhere (NVE) from veins (P < 0.001). No significant factors were found to be associated with NVE originating from IRMA.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Changes in IRMA closely correlated with the severity of retinal ischemia and treatment. Notably, our study confirmed the potential, yet relatively rare, development of NVE from IRMA in a large cohort; however, the risk factors associated with this transformation require further exploration."

            "abstract": "The risk of ischemic events gradually decreases after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), reaching a stable level after 1 month, while the risk of bleeding remains steady during the whole period of dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT). Several de-escalation strategies of antiplatelet treatment aiming to enhance safety of DAPT without depriving it of its efficacy have been evaluated so far. We hypothesized that reduction of the ticagrelor maintenance dose 1 month after ACS and its continuation until 12 months after ACS may improve adherence to antiplatelet treatment due to better tolerability compared with the standard dose of ticagrelor. Moreover, improved safety of treatment and preserved anti-ischemic benefit may also be expected with additional acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) withdrawal. To evaluate these hypotheses, we designed the Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of Two Ticagrelor-based De-escalation Antiplatelet Strategies in Acute Coronary Syndrome - a randomized clinical trial (ELECTRA-SIRIO 2), to assess the influence of ticagrelor dose reduction with or without continuation of ASA versus DAPT with standard dose ticagrelor in reducing clinically relevant bleeding and maintaining anti-ischemic efficacy in ACS patients. The study was designed as a phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, investigator-initiated clinical study with a 12-month follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04718025; EudraCT number: 2020-005130-15)."

However, whether there is a protagonist in this cluster remains unclear. Here, we used a mutant mouse model to study the role of miR-96, a member of miR-183C, in photoreceptor development and functionality.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The mature miR-96 sequence was removed using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system. Electroretinogram (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) investigated the changes in structure and function in mouse retinas. Immunostaining determined the localization and morphology of the retinal cells. RNA sequencing was conducted to observe retinal transcription alterations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The miR-96 mutant mice exhibited cone developmental delay, as occurs in miR-183/96 double knockout mice. Immunostaining of cone-specific marker genes revealed cone nucleus mislocalization and exiguous Opn1mw/Opn1sw in the mutant (MT) mouse outer segments at postnatal day 10. Interestingly, this phenomenon could be relieved in the adult stages. Transcriptome analysis revealed activation of microtubule-, actin filament-, and cilia-related pathways, further supporting the findings. Based on ERG and OCT results at different ages, the MT mice displayed developmental delay not only in cones but also in rods. In addition, a group of miR-96 potential direct and indirect target genes was summarized for interpretation and further studies of miR-96-related retinal developmental defects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Depletion of miR-96 delayed but did not arrest photoreceptor development in mice.

            "abstract": "A propagated potential produced in the Pacinian corpuscle in response to mechanical stimuli leaves a refractory state of 7 to 10 msec. duration. The refractory state is presumably produced at the first intracorpuscular node of Ranvier. The recovery of receptor excitability for producing an all-or-none response to mechanical stimulation follows the same time course as that of the electrically excited axon. Upon progressive reduction of stimulus interval (mechanical), the propagated potential falls progressively to 75 per cent of its resting magnitude and becomes finally blocked within the corpuscle. A non-propagated all-or-none potential, presumably corresponding to activity of the first node, is then detected. The critical firing level for all-or-none potentials increases progressively during the relative refractory period of the all-or-none potential, as the stimulus interval is shortened. Thus generator potentials up to 85 per cent of a propagated potential can be produced in absence of all-or-none activity. Generator potentials show: gradual over-all increase in amplitude and rate of rise as a function of stimulus strength; constant latency; and spontaneous fluctuations in amplitude. A generator potential leaves a refractory state (presumably at the non-myelinated ending) so that the amplitude of a second generator response which falls on its refractory trail is directly related to the time elapsed after the first generator response and inversely to its amplitude. The generator potential develops independently of any refractory state left by a preceding all-or-none potential."

Methods: The nationwide FinnValve registry included data from 6463 patients who underwent TAVR or SAVR with a bioprosthesis for aortic stenosis from 2008 to 2017. Results: The annual number of treated patients increased three-fold during the study period. Thirty-day mortality declined from 4.8% to 1.2% for TAVR (p = .011) and from 4.1% to 1.8% for SAVR (p = .048). Two-year survival improved from 71.4% to 83.9% for TAVR (p < .001) and from 87.2% to 91.6% for SAVR (p = .006). During the study period, a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular regurgitation was observed among TAVR patients and a reduction of the rate of acute kidney injury was observed among both SAVR and TAVR patients. Similarly, the rate of red blood cell transfusion and severe bleeding decreased significantly among SAVR and TAVR patients. Hospital stay declined from 10.4 ± 8.4 to 3.7 ± 3.4 days after TAVR (p < .001) and from 9.0 ± 5.9 to 7.8 ± 5.1 days after SAVR (p < .001). Conclusions: In Finland, the introduction of TAVR has led to an increase in the invasive treatment of severe aortic stenosis, which was accompanied by improved early outcomes after both SAVR and TAVR. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03385915 Key Messages This study demonstrated that the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has led to its widespread use as an invasive treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Early and 2-year survival after transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement has improved during past decade.

The results of this study indicate that both interventions reduced the effects of performance expectations on behavioral ratings. However, analyses of rating accuracy and measures from both recognition memory and recall memory tests suggest that the structured recall memory intervention has distinct advantages.

The hazard ratios (HRs) for first stroke were as follows: mild versus no retinopathy, 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.58, P = 0.040), and severe versus no retinopathy, 2.40 (95% CI, 1.49-3.84, P < 0.001). The HRs for ischemic stroke were as follows: severe versus no retinopathy, 2.35 (95% CI, 1.41-3.90, P = 0.001), and nonsignificantly increased HRs for mild versus no retinopathy, 1.26 (95% CI, 0.99-1.60, P = 0.057).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was a significant positive association between hypertensive retinopathy and the risk of first stroke in patients with hypertension, indicating that hypertensive retinopathy may be a predictor of the risk of stroke.

Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by comparing VRL with controls and sarcoidosis, and functional pathway analysis was performed. Finally, vitreous concentrations of representative DEPs that were significantly upregulated in proteomics study were measured by ELISA using a separate cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 1594 proteins were identified in the vitreous humor of VRL, control, and sarcoidosis samples. Also, 282 DEPs were detected in VRL, 249 upregulated and 33 downregulated, compared with controls. Enrichment pathway analysis showed alterations in proteasome-related pathways. Compared to controls and sarcoidosis, 14 DEPs in VRL showed significant upregulation. In the validation study, ELISA confirmed significantly higher vitreous concentrations of PSAT1, YWHAG, and 20S/26S proteasome complex in VRL compared with controls and sarcoidosis.

By integrating transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analysis, we identified cell type-specific and shared gene regulation programs. We also uncovered critical TFs driving corneal epithelial cell differentiation, such as nuclear factor I (NFI) family members, Rarg, Elf3. We found that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family members were positive TFs in limbal cells and some superficial cells, but they were involved in regulating distinct biological processes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study presents a comprehensive gene regulatory landscape of mouse cornea epithelial cells, and provides valuable foundations for future investigation of corneal epithelial homeostasis in the context of cornea pathologies and regenerative medicine."

            "abstract": "The intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway of caspase activation is essential for apoptosis induction by various stimuli including cytotoxic stress. It depends on the cellular context, whether cytochrome c released from mitochondria induces caspase activation gradually or in an all-or-none fashion, and whether caspase activation irreversibly commits cells to apoptosis. By analyzing a quantitative kinetic model, we show that inhibition of caspase-3 (Casp3) and Casp9 by inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) results in an implicit positive feedback, since cleaved Casp3 augments its own activation by sequestering IAPs away from Casp9. We demonstrate that this positive feedback brings about bistability (i.e., all-or-none behaviour), and that it cooperates with Casp3-mediated feedback cleavage of Casp9 to generate irreversibility in caspase activation. Our calculations also unravel how cell-specific protein expression brings about the observed qualitative differences in caspase activation (gradual versus all-or-none and reversible versus irreversible). Finally, known regulators of the pathway are shown to efficiently shift the apoptotic threshold stimulus, suggesting that the bistable caspase cascade computes multiple inputs into an all-or-none caspase output. As cellular inhibitory proteins (e.g., IAPs) frequently inhibit consecutive intermediates in cellular signaling cascades (e.g., Casp3 and Casp9), the feedback mechanism described in this paper is likely to be a widespread principle on how cells achieve ultrasensitivity, bistability, and irreversibility."

Expression and location of AlkB homolog 5 RNA demethylase (ALKBH5), a key component of m6A demethytransferase, were determined by Western blot and immunostaining.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All 4646 m6A peaks within circRNAs had different abundances, with 2472 enriched and 2174 subdued. The level of m6A abundance in total circRNAs was decreased in the LECs from ARCCs in comparison with the controls. We also found that the expression of highly m6A-tagged circRNAs was mostly decreased in comparison with non-m6A-tagged circRNAs. The bioinformatics analysis predicted the potential functions of m6A modified circRNAs and the relevant pathways that may be associated with m6A modified circRNAs. Among five major methyltransferases, ALKBH5 was significantly upregulated in LECs of ARCCs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our data provided novel evidence regarding the involvement of circRNAs m6A modifications in ARC. The altered expression of methyltransferases in lens tissue might selectively change the epigenetic profile of lens genome through regulating genes that host the circRNAs, thus enhance the susceptibility to ARC. The results might provide a new insight in the molecular target of ARC pathogenesis."

In the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial MONALEESA-3, testing ribociclib vs. placebo in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women or men with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC), an increase of median progression-free survival (PFS) from 12.8 months to 20.5 months by the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor was reported (HR 0.59; P > 0.01). Taselisib, an alpha specific PI3K inhibitor, was tested in combination with fulvestrant in pretreated HR+/HER2- ABC patients with PIK3CA mutations in the placebo-controlled phase 3 trial SANDPIPER. PFS was significantly longer (7.4 months vs 5.4 months; HR 0.70, P < 0.01) but severe adverse events were more frequent (32% and 9%) in the taselisib group. In triple-negative breast cancer, the AKT inhibitor capivasertib (AZD5363) was combined with paclitaxel as first-line treatment in the placebo-controlled phase 2 trial PAKT. In patients with altered PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN, median PFS increased from 3.7 months to 9.3 months (HR 0.30; two-sided P = 0.01). No treatment effect was shown in the non-altered group. The most common adverse events attributed to capivasertib were diarrhea, fatigue and stomatitis. Results of two phase I trials of trastuzumab antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) indicated HER2 as a non-oncogenic surface target in breast cancer patients expressing HER2."

Among the six patients analyzed during fSRT, three (50%) patients had detectable ctDNA at baseline and three of six (50%) patients had undetectable levels of ctDNA. During the fSRT regimen, ctDNA levels remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The ctDNA fractions were undetectable to low in localized disease, and sWGS did not elucidate chromosome 3 status from blood samples.

Six HBsAg-positive patients had chronic hepatitis for 67 +/- 7 (SE) months before reduction of azathioprine and were followed for a further 49 +/- 14 months. None of the six patients remitted, 3 patients died from liver disease, and none returned to dialysis. In the group of 12 patients who did not have azathioprine reduced, none remitted, 4 died from liver disease, and none returned to dialysis during a follow-up of 115 +/- 9 months. Seven HBsAG-negative patients had chronic hepatitis for 32 +/- 11 months before reduction of azathioprine and were followed for a further 46 +/- 8 months. One of the seven remitted, none died from liver disease and one returned to dialysis. In the group of 15 patients who did not have azathioprine reduced 5 patients remitted, none died from liver disease, and none returned to dialysis. We conclude that prolonged reduction of azathioprine does not slow the progression of liver disease in renal transplant recipients with HBsAg-positive or HBsAg-negative chronic hepatitis, nor does it predispose to graft failure. However reduction of immunosuppression early in the course of hepatitis B disease may be necessary to prevent adverse long-term sequelae."

The tool should be similar to those already established for contraception A consortium of scientific societies coordinated by the Spanish Menopause Society met to formulate recommendations for the use of MHT by women with medical conditions based on the best available evidence. The project was developed in two phases. As a first step, we conducted 14 systematic reviews and 32 metanalyses on the safety of MHT (in nine areas: age, time of menopause onset, treatment duration, women with thrombotic risk, women with a personal history of cardiovascular disease, women with metabolic syndrome, women with gastrointestinal diseases, survivors of breast cancer or of other cancers, and women who smoke) and on the most relevant pharmacological interactions with MHT. These systematic reviews and metanalyses helped inform a structured process in which a panel of experts defined the eligibility criteria according to a specific framework, which facilitated the discussion and development process. To unify the proposal, the following eligibility criteria have been defined in accordance with the WHO international nomenclature for the different alternatives for MHT (category 1, no restriction on the use of MHT; category 2, the benefits outweigh the risks; category 3, the risks generally outweigh the benefits; category 4, MHT should not be used). Quality was classified as high, moderate, low or very low, based on several factors (including risk of bias, inaccuracy, inconsistency, lack of directionality and publication bias). When no direct evidence was identified, but plausibility, clinical experience or indirect evidence were available, \"Expert opinion\" was categorized. For the first time, a set of eligibility criteria, based on clinical evidence and developed according to the most rigorous methodological tools, has been defined. This will provide health professionals with a powerful decision-making tool that can be used to manage menopausal symptoms."

In this study, we investigated models of plateau potentials in multi-compartment neuron models and found that including glutamate spillover provides robust all-or-none behavior. This result arises due to the prolonged duration of extrasynaptic glutamate. When glutamate spillover is not included, the all-or-none behavior is very sensitive to the steepness of the Mg2+ block. These results suggest a potentially significant role of glutamate spillover in plateau potential generation, providing a mechanism for robust all-or-none behavior across a wide range of slopes of the Mg2+ block curve.

None had antithyroglobulin or antimicrosomal antibody. Only one mother was found to have TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII), and her child had agenesis of the thyroid. This women had Graves disease in remission for 2 years before delivery. None had TSH-stimulated cAMP response inhibitory immunoglobulin (TSII). Ten of the 24 congenital hypothyroid children had transient neonatal hypothyroidism, seven had agenesis of the thyroid, six had dyshormonogenesis and one had a sublingual thyroid. As none of the mothers who had children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism had blocking antibodies at the time of study, the aetiology of the transient neonatal hypothyroidism remains unclear. These data suggest that maternal TSH-blocking antibodies do not play a role in most cases of sporadic congenital hypothyroidism."

The changes in gene expression profiles of HRMECs at 24, 48, and 72 hours were characterized using RNA sequencing technology. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.

After H1N1 infection of HRMECs, 2562 DEGs were identified, including 1748 upregulated ones and 814 downregulated ones. These DEGs primarily involved in processes such as inflammation and immune response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, signal transduction regulation, and cell adhesion. The elevated expression levels of CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL5, TLR3, C3, IFNB1, IFNG, STAT1, HLA, and TNFSF10 after H1N1 infection were reduced by oseltamivir intervention, reaching levels comparable to those in the uninfected group.

            "abstract": "RAS gene mutations are the most frequent oncogenic event in lung cancer. They activate multiple RAS-centric signaling networks among them the MAPK, PI3K, and RB pathways. Within the MAPK pathway, ERK1/2 proteins exert a bottleneck function for transmitting mitogenic signals and activating cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. In view of disappointing antitumor activity and toxicity of continuously applied MEK inhibitors in patients with KRAS-mutant lung cancer, research has recently focused on ERK1/2 proteins as therapeutic targets and on ERK inhibitors for their ability to prevent bypass and feedback pathway activation. Here, we show that intermittent application of the novel and selective ATP-competitive ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 exerts single-agent activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of RAS-mutant lung cancer. Combination treatments were well tolerated and resulted in synergistic (ERKi plus PI3K/mTORi LY3023414) and additive (ERKi plus CDK4/6i abemaciclib) tumor growth inhibition in PDX models. Future clinical trials are required to investigate if intermittent ERK inhibitor-based treatment schedules can overcome toxicities observed with continuous MEK inhibition and-equally important-to identify biomarkers for patient stratification."

Exosome cargo heavily defines the vesicles' unique characteristics, and the cargo with the most intriguing prospects in its' biomedical applications is the non-coding RNAs. Non-coding RNAs, and specifically microRNAs are implicated in the regulation of many biological processes and have been associated with numerous diseases. Exosomes containing such important cargo can be used as biomarkers, therapeutic biomaterials, or even drug carriers. The potential media use of exosomes seems promising. However, some obstacles should be overcome before their clinical application. Synthetic exosome-like biomolecules may be a solution, but their production is still in their beginning stages.

Logistic regression models were employed to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for osteoporosis determined by T-score (less than -2.5 SD) using the None-None reference group. In men, the combination of EHs in adolescence and old age was not associated with osteoporosis prevalence.

Therefore we have retrospectively evaluated all diskectomies performed in Sweden during the period from 1965 to 1985. Eighty-seven patients had been operated upon with this technique and 69, with a follow-up time of 6 months or longer (median 20 months), were analyzed. The median of maximal opening increased and 74% of the patients had less frequent and less intensive pain at the follow-up examination than before surgery. The overall results of the operations were good in 51% of the patients (none or mild pain and opening greater than or equal to 35 mm and horizontal movements greater than or equal to 5 mm), acceptable in 22% of the patients (none or mild pain and opening greater than or equal to 30 mm) and bad in 28% of the patients (severe pain or opening less than 30 mm). The preoperative pain was found to be more diffuse in the patients with bad postoperative results than in the patients with good and acceptable results. This emphasizes the importance of avoiding operating on patients with sources of pain and functional limitation other than the temporomandibular joint proper. The operation should be used restrictively and only on accurately diagnosed patients with severe pain and functional limitation that originate in the joint and have not been alleviated by adequate nonsurgical treatment. The risk of residual pain or limitation of opening should be included in the preoperative evaluation."

The incidence and risk factors for invasive fungal disease (IFD) after haploHCT have not been well elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for IFD after haploHCT. The identification of key risk factors will permit targeted prevention measures and may explain elevated risk for other infectious complications after haploHCT. This single-center retrospective study included all adults undergoing haploHCT between May 2011 and May 2021 (n = 205). The 30-day and 1-year cumulative incidences of proven or probable IFD and 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were assessed. Secondary analyses evaluated risk factors for invasive yeast infection (IYI) using univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. Twenty-nine patients (14%) developed IFD following haploHCT. Nineteen (9.3%) developed IYI in the first year, 13 of which occurred early, with a 30-day cumulative incidence of 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9% to 9.6%) and increased NRM in patients with IYI (53.9% versus 10.9%). The majority of yeast isolates (17 of 20; 85%) were fluconazole- susceptible. The incidence of IYI in the first 30 days after haploHCT was 10% in the 110 patients (54%) who developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 21% in the 29 patients (14%) who received tocilizumab. On multivariable analysis, acute myelogenous leukemia (hazard ratio [HR], 6.24; 95% CI, 1.66 to 23.37; P = .007) and CRS (HR, 4.65; 95% CI, 1.00 to 21.58; P = .049) were associated with an increased risk of early IYI after haploHCT. CRS after haploHCT is common and is associated with increased risk of early IYI. The identification of CRS as a risk factor for IYI raises questions about its potential association with other infections after haploHCT. Recognition of key risk factors for infection may permit the development of individualized strategies for prevention and intervention and minimize potential side effects."

The brewing sector and representatives of the scientific community therefore stressed the need for specific principles for the proper and transparent governance of research and other collaborations between the brewing sector and research entities. At a 1-day seminar, a group of scientists and representatives from the brewing and food sector reached a consensus for such principles. They adhere to the following four fundamental conditions: Freedom of research, Accessibility, Contextualisation and Transparency. The points of focus in the FACT principles are open science, meaning that the methods and results are made accessible and reusable, and relationships are clearly disclosed. Actions to be taken for dissemination and implementation of the FACT Principles are, for instance, publishing them on public websites, including them in formal research agreements, and citing them in scientific publications. Scientific journals and (research) societies are encouraged to support the FACT Principles. In conclusion, the FACT Principles provide a framework for increased transparency and control of funding-related bias in research and other collaborations between the brewing sector and research entities. Monitoring their use and evaluating their impact will help to further refine and enforce the FACT Principles in the future."

Each plane contained half of the elements. For the dynamic condition, all elements were vertically oriented and moved to the left in one plane and to the right in another plane; for the static condition, the elements were horizontally oriented in one plane and vertically oriented in another plane.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For the range of motion speed that we measured (from 0.17°/s to 5.33°/s), we observed clear speed tuning of the stereo sensitivity (P = 3.0 × 10-5). The shape of this tuning did not significantly change with different spatial frequencies. We also found a significant difference in stereo sensitivity between stereopsis with static and laterally moving stimuli (speed = 0.67°/s; P = 0.004). Such difference was not evident when we matched the task between the static and moving stimuli.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We report that lateral motion modulates human global depth perception. This motion/stereo constraint is related to motion velocity not stimulus temporal frequency.

            "abstract": "The mental model theory postulates that reasoners build models of situations described in premises. These models normally make explicit only what is true according to the premises. The theory has an unexpected consequence. It predicts the existence of illusions in inferences: Certain inferences should have compelling but erroneous conclusions. Previous studies have corroborated the existence of such illusions. The present study reports the first effective antidote to them. For example, most people incorrectly answer \"yes\" to the following problem: Only one of the following statements is true ... /At least some of the plastic beads are not red./None of the plastic beads are red./Is it possible that none of the red beads are plastic? In two experiments, we progressively eliminated this fallacy and others by using instructions designed to overcome the bias toward truth. The difference between the illusory and the control problems disappeared when the participants were instructed to work out both the case in which the first premise was true and second premise was false and the case in which the second premise was true and the first premise was false."

As previous studies have revealed impaired blood flow as a provoking factor triggering PCS, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the potential association between self-reported chronic fatigue and retinal microcirculation in patients with PCS, potentially indicating an objective biomarker. A prospective study was performed, including 201 subjects: 173 patients with PCS and 28 controls. Retinal microcirculation was visualized by OCT angiography (OCT-A) and quantified using the Erlangen-Angio-Tool as macula and peripapillary vessel density (VD). Chronic fatigue (CF) was assessed according to the variables of Bell’s score, age and gender. VDs in the superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were analyzed, considering the repetitions (12 times). Seropositivity for autoantibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR-AAbs) was determined by an established cardiomyocyte bioassay. Taking account of the repetitions, a mixed model was performed to detect possible differences in the least square means between the different groups included in the analysis. An age effect in relation to VD was observed between patients and controls (p < 0.0001). Gender analysis showed that women with PCS showed lower VD levels in the SVP compared to male patients (p = 0.0015). The PCS patients showed significantly lower VDs in the ICP as compared to the controls (p = 0.0001 (CI: 0.32; 1)). Moreover, considering PCS patients, the mixed model revealed a significant difference between those with chronic fatigue (CF) and those without CF with respect to VDs in the SVP (p = 0.0033 (CI: −4.5; −0.92)). The model included variables of age, gender and Bell’s score, representing a subjective marker for CF.

            "abstract": "Whether consciousness is an all-or-none or graded phenomenon is an area of inquiry that has received considerable interest in neuroscience and is as of yet, still debated. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study we used a single stimulus paradigm with sub-threshold, threshold and supra-threshold duration inputs to assess whether stimulus perception is continuous with or abruptly differentiated from unconscious stimulus processing in the brain. By grouping epochs according to stimulus identification accuracy and exposure duration, we were able to investigate whether a high-amplitude perception-related cortical event was (1) only evoked for conditions where perception was most probable, (2) had invariant amplitude once evoked and (3) was largely absent for conditions where perception was least probable (criteria satisfying an all-on-none hypothesis). We found that averaged evoked responses showed a gradual increase in amplitude with increasing perceptual strength. However, single-trial analyses demonstrated that stimulus perception was correlated with an all-or-none response, the temporal precision of which increased systematically as perception transitioned from ambiguous to robust states. Due to poor signal-to-noise resolution of single-trial data, whether perception-related responses, whenever present, were invariant in amplitude could not be unambiguously demonstrated. However, our findings strongly suggest that visual perception of simple stimuli is associated with an all-or-none cortical-evoked response the temporal precision of which varies as a function of perceptual strength."

Using a solid-phase cross-reaction assay to establish if these complexes reacted with each other in specific disease groups, it was found that polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates of six AS patients cross reacted in 29 of 36 tests, but reacted with SLE and RA PEG precipitates in only two of 24 tests in each case.

            "abstract": "Conversion of graded responsiveness of lobster muscle fibers to all-or-none activity by alkali-earth and tetraethylammonium (TEA) ions appears to be due to a combination of effects. The membrane is hyperpolarized, its resistance is increased, and its sensitivity to external K(+) is diminished, all effects which indicate diminished K(+) conductance. While the spikes are prolonged, the conductance is higher throughout the response than it is in the resting membrane. Repetitive activity becomes prominent. These effects indicate maintained high conductance for an ion which causes depolarization. This is normally Na(+), since its presence in low concentrations potentiates the effects of Ba(++), but the alkali-earth ions and TEA can also carry inward charge. Ba(++), Sr(++), and TEA appear to be more effective than is Ca(++) in its normal role, which is probably to depress K(+) conductance and Na inactivation. Thus, conversion of graded to all-or-none responsiveness appears to occur because of the relative increase of depolarizing inward ion flux and decrease of repolarizing outward flux."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Physical exercise can improve cancer patients' functioning and reduce their symptom levels. A randomized, controlled trial was launched to test the hypothesis that physical exercise reduces fatigue and improves physical performance in cancer patients with advanced and incurable disease.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Cancer patients (n = 231) with a life expectancy ≤2 years were randomized to a physical exercise group (PEG, n = 121) or a control usual care group (UCG, n = 110). The PEG exercised under supervision 60 minutes twice a week for 8 weeks. Assessments were performed before and after the intervention. The primary outcome was physical fatigue (PF) measured by the Fatigue Questionnaire. Physical performance was a secondary outcome measured by the Shuttle Walk Test (SWT) and hand grip strength (HGS) test. Analyses were performed after multiple imputations for missing data. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier, NCT00397774).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six percent of the PEG were lost to follow-up compared with 23% of the UCG, primarily as a result of disease progression. Seventy-eight PEG and 85 UCG patients completed the intervention. Analyses showed no significant between-group effects in PF. However, clinically and statistically significant between-group effects were found for the SWT and HGS test.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Fatigue was not reduced but physical performance (SWT and HGS test) was significantly improved after 8 weeks of physical exercise. Physical exercise might therefore be a suitable approach for maintaining physical capacity in cancer patients with incurable and advanced disease."

The infected corneas were graded and harvested to evaluate the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells through immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay and absolute quantitative method.

But some models, considering reverberation of neural activity as necessary for conscious perception, predict a sharp nonlinear transition between unconscious and conscious processing. We asked participants to evaluate the visibility of target words on a continuous scale during the attentional blink, which is known to impede explicit reports. Participants used this continuous scale in an all-or-none fashion: Targets presented during the blink were either identified as well as targets presented outside the blink period or not detected at all. We suggest that a stochastic nonlinear bifurcation in neural activity underlies the all-or-none perception observed during the attentional blink."

We hypothesized that prolonged TV watching may increase risk for type 2 diabetes.\n## METHODS\nIn 1986, 37 918 men aged 40 to 75 years and free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer completed a detailed physical activity questionnaire. Starting from 1988, participants reported their average weekly time spent watching TV on biennial questionnaires.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 1058 cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed during 10 years (347 040 person-years) of follow-up. After adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol use, and other covariates, the relative risks (RRs) for type 2 diabetes across increasing quintiles of metabolic equivalent hours (MET-hours) per week were 1.00, 0.78, 0.65, 0.58, and 0.51 (P for trend, <.001). Time spent watching TV was significantly associated with higher risk for diabetes. After adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity levels, and other covariates, the RRs of diabetes across categories of average hours spent watching TV per week (0-1, 2-10, 11-20, 21-40, and >40) were 1.00, 1.66, 1.64, 2.16, and 2.87, respectively (P for trend, <.001). This association was somewhat attenuated after adjustment for body mass index, but a significant positive gradient persisted (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.31; P for trend,.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIncreasing physical activity is associated with a significant reduction in risk for diabetes, whereas a sedentary lifestyle indicated by prolonged TV watching is directly related to risk. Our findings suggest the importance of reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.\n"

EBV infection of lymphoma cells has been associated with different lymphoma subtypes while the precise role of EBV in lymphomagenesis and specific molecular characteristics of these lymphomas remain elusive. To further unravel the biology of EBV associated DLBCL, we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of overall 60 primary EBV positive (EBV+) DLBCLs using targeted sequencing of cancer candidate genes (CCGs) and genome-wide determination of recurrent somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in 46 cases, respectively. Applying the LymphGen classifier 2.0, we found that less than 20% of primary EBV + DLBCLs correspond to one of the established molecular DLBCL subtypes underscoring the unique biology of this entity. We have identified recurrent mutations activating the oncogenic JAK-STAT and NOTCH pathways as well as frequent amplifications of 9p24.1 contributing to immune escape by PD-L1 overexpression.

Atrial arrhythmias may reflect underlying left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction, which are prognostic of mortality. We hypothesized that these stress-induced arrhythmias are associated with long-term adverse cardiac events.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Exercise echocardiography was performed in 5,375 patients (age 61 +/- 12 years) with known or suspected coronary artery disease. An abnormal result was defined as exercise-induced atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), or AE.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 311 (5.8%) patients died (132 [2.5%] from cardiac causes) over a period of 3.1 +/- 1.7 years. In addition, 193 (3.6%) patients experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and 531 (9.9%) patients required revascularization. During exercise testing, 1,272 (24%) patients developed AE, 185 (3.4%) developed SVT, and 43 (0.8%) developed AF. The five-year cardiac death rate was not statistically different between groups (none [3.8%], AE [4.3%], SVT [3.7%], AF [0%], p = 0.43). The five-year rate of MI was significantly different between groups (none [5.7%], AE [8.3%], SVT [0%], AF [9.0%], p = 0.005). The five-year rate of revascularization between groups was not significantly different (none [14.2%], AE [17.0%], SVT [11.8%], AF [14.8%], p = 0.50). A composite of all five-year adverse end points was similar between groups (none [22.7%], AE [27.8%], SVT [17.7%], AF [25.7%], p = 0.10). In stepwise multivariate analysis, AE was not predictive of myocardial infarction when taking into account traditional clinical variables and exercise test results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this large cohort of patients, the occurrence of AE was predictive of an increased risk of MI. However, the association did not persist after adjustment for clinical and exercise variables known to predict adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes. The rate of long-term cardiac death or revascularization was not influenced by the development of stress-induced atrial arrhythmias."

However, the intrinsic factors that contribute to the high susceptibility to keratitis during CLW remain to be elucidated. CLW over an extended period can elevate corneal norepinephrine (NE) concentration. In this study, we investigated the role of NE in promoting PAK.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We constructed an injury-induced PAK model and a CLW-induced PAK model to confirm the impact of NE during corneal infection. Pharmacological blockage of NE and gene knockdown mouse were used to investigate the downstream effector of NE. RNA sequencing was performed to explore the cellular alterations during NE treatment. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used to ascertain the significance (P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Supplementation of NE led to PAK even without artificial corneal injury during CLW. The effect was mediated by the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) in the corneal epithelium. The β2-AR blockage by the NE antagonist ICI118,551 (ICI) or by deleting of its encoding gene Adrb2 significantly alleviated infection during CLW. Conversely, β2-AR activation compromised the integrity of the epithelium and significantly increased the cortical plaque marker ezrin. Transcriptome analysis identified that the protective effect of ICI on the keratitis was mediated by dual-specificity phosphatases. Suramin, a Dusp5 antagonist, abrogated the protective effect of ICI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These data reveal a new mechanism by which NE acts as an intrinsic factor that promotes CLW-induced PAK and provide novel therapeutic targets for treating keratitis by targeting NE-β2-AR."

The obesity analysis included 50 277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68 497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOnset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n## RESULTS\nDuring 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5%) of 50 277 women who had a BMI of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI > or =30). Overall, we documented 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching was associated with a 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-30%) increase in obesity and a 14% (95% CI, 5%-23%) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 0%-10%) increase in obesity and a 7% (95% CI, 0%-16%) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9% (95% CI, 6%-12%) reduction in obesity and a 12% (95% CI, 7%-16%) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%-29%) reduction in obesity and a 34% (95% CI, 27%-41%) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30% (95% CI, 24%-36%) of new cases of obesity and 43% (95% CI, 32%-52%) of new cases of diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (<10 h/wk of TV watching and > or =30 min/d of brisk walking).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIndependent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.\n"

            "abstract": "When leaves of Bryophyllum tubiflorum were cut into transverse sections, and held at 20 C in the dark, the capacity to accumulate organic acid decreased with decreasing section thickness. In addition, the rate of respiration increased with decreasing section thickness and was unaffected by changes in O(2) concentration above 5% or by the presence (1%) of CO(2). It was concluded that O(2) ventilation is not a controlling factor in respiration. Malonate (0.1 m) and fluoroacetate (0.01 m) restored the capacity of sectioned leaves to accumulate acid to normal levels and depressed respiration in 1-millimeter sections. Acid accumulation in 8-millimeter sections remained essentially constant at 20, 15, and 10 C, and was equal to that in unsectioned leaves, but accumulation in 2-millimeter sections rose to normal levels as the temperature fell to 10 C. Twenty-three additional metabolic inhibitors (none specific to the tricarboxylic acid cycle) were screened, and none promoted acid accumulation in sectioned leaves at 20 C. The results suggest that sectioning stimulates a respiratory sequence which includes the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This sequence in turn competes with the synthesis or accumulation of malic acid."

Five patients completed full-field electroretinography, six patients completed fluorescein angiography, and none showed pertinent abnormality on either test. FERG was performed in both eyes of seven patients and in one eye of three others. Signals were non-recordable from four eyes, abnormal in nine, equivocal in three, and normal in one. The severity of FERG abnormality did not correlate with the severity of acuity loss. FERG abnormalities were found in fourteen of 17 eyes of 10 patients with vision loss out of proportion to clinical findings. In these patients only one of 5 pattern VEP tests, none of 5 full-field ERGs, and none of 7 fluorescein angiograms suggested correspondingly severe maculopathy. The FERG results in these cases mitigated suspicions of nonorganic vision loss and permitted speedier referral to retinal disease and low vision specialists."

Mutations in FRIZZLED5 (FZD5) have been associated with microphthalmia, coloboma, and, more recently, high myopia. The molecular mechanism of how Fzd5 participates in ocular growth remains unknown. In this study, we compiled a list of human genes associated with ocular growth abnormalities based on public databases and a literature search. We identified a set of ocular growth-related genes from the list that was altered in the Fzd5 mutant mice by RNAseq analysis at different time points. The Fzd5 regulation of this set of genes appeared to be impacted by age and light damage. Further bioinformatical analysis indicated that these genes are extracellular matrix (ECM)-related; and meanwhile an altered Wnt signaling was detected. Altogether, the data suggest that Fzd5 may regulate ocular growth through regulating ECM remodeling, hinting at a genetic-environmental interaction in gene regulation of ocular axis control."

We hypothesized that PBMCs have different transcriptional profiles in patients harboring IAs as compared to IA-free controls, which could be the basis for potential blood-based biomarkers for the disease. To test this, we isolated PBMC RNA from whole blood of 52 subjects (24 with IA, 28 without) and performed next-generation RNA sequencing to obtain their transcriptomes. In a randomly assigned discovery cohort of n = 39 patients, we performed differential expression analysis to define an IA-associated signature of 54 genes (q < 0.05 and an absolute fold-change ≥ 1.3). In the withheld validation dataset, these genes could delineate patients with IAs from controls, as the majority of them still had the same direction of expression difference. Bioinformatics analyses by gene ontology enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrated enrichment of structural regulation processes, intracellular signaling function, regulation of ion transport, and cell adhesion. IPA analysis showed that these processes were likely coordinated through NF-kB, cytokine signaling, growth factors, and TNF activity. Correlation analysis with aneurysm size and risk assessment metrics showed that 4/54 genes were associated with rupture risk. These findings highlight the potential to develop predictive biomarkers from PBMCs to identify patients harboring IAs."

All oncologists expressed willingness to enroll patients in treatment optimization clinical trials; however, half indicated that they were more likely to experience a negative psychological response after a treatment optimization trial than after a traditional intensification trial, and a quarter reported that patient recurrence on an optimization trial would impact their recommendations for future trial enrollment. Oncologists who reported more negative psychological responses to patient recurrence after participation in an optimization trial were more likely to emphasize introspective factors, while those who reported no difference in response emphasized patient- and process-focused factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although most oncologists recognize the importance of treatment optimization trials, a significant proportion indicated a greater potential for psychological distress following patient recurrence in such trials and offered insight into how trial design and the process of patient enrollment can be improved to minimize those negative psychological responses."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of child and adolescent obesity and severe obesity continues to increase despite decades of policy and research aimed at prevention. Obesity strongly predicts cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk; both begin in childhood. Children who receive intensive behavioral interventions can reduce body mass index (BMI) and reverse disease risk. However, delivering these interventions with fidelity at scale remains a challenge. Clinic-community partnerships offer a promising strategy to provide high-quality clinical care and deliver behavioral treatment in local park and recreation settings. The Hearts & Parks study has three broad objectives: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the clinic-community model for the treatment of child obesity, (2) define microbiome and metabolomic signatures of obesity and response to lifestyle change, and (3) inform the implementation of similar models in clinical systems.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Methods are designed for a pragmatic randomized, controlled clinical trial (n = 270) to test the effectiveness of an integrated clinic-community child obesity intervention as compared with usual care. We are powered to detect a difference in body mass index (BMI) between groups at 6 months, with follow up to 12 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in biomarkers for cardiovascular disease, psychosocial risk, and quality of life. Through collection of biospecimens (serum and stool), additional exploratory outcomes include microbiome and metabolomics biomarkers of response to lifestyle modification.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We present the study design, enrollment strategy, and intervention details for a randomized clinical trial to measure the effectiveness of a clinic-community child obesity treatment intervention.

Devices like these appear to be universal in human languages. Is the ubiquity of quantification due to a universal property of the human mind or is it attributable to more gradual convergence through cultural evolution? We investigated whether classical quantifiers are present in a new language emerging in isolation from other languages, Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL). An observational study of historical data collected in the 1990s found evidence of potential quantifier forms. To confirm the quantificational meaning of these signs, we designed a production study that elicited, from three age cohorts of NSL signers (N = 17), three types of quantifiers: universal (all), existential (some), and negative (none). We find evidence for these classical quantifiers in the very first generation of signers, suggesting they may reflect a universal property of human cognition or a very rapid construction process."

Sensitivity and specificity, false-positive rates, and false-negative rates were examined for each type of monitoring, along with the relationship between each type of monitoring and the period of postoperative motor deficit. Results Comparison of the various combinations showed transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (TcMEP) + cord evoked potential after stimulation to the brain (Br-SCEP) combination had the highest sensitivity (90%). The TcMEP + somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and TcMEP + spinal cord evoked potential after stimulation to the spinal cord (Sp-SCEP) combinations each had a sensitivity of 80%, exhibiting little difference between their sensitivity and that obtained when TcMEP alone was used. Meanwhile, the sensitivity was as low as 50% with Br-SCEP + Sp-SCEP (i.e., the cases where TcMEP was not included).

From March 2012 to July 2021, LN patients who performed renal biopsy were enrolled in the study. Clinical, laboratory and pathology data were collected. We classified the patients into none-or-mild group and moderate-to-severe groups according to the severity of interstitial fibrosis (IF) /tubular atrophy (TA) or tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII). The t test, U test and Chi-square test were used for statistical analysis as appropriate.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 226 patients were included, of who 190 (84%) were female with a median age of 32 (26, 39) years. 89% (201/226) of the patients who pathologically proved to be proliferative LN by renal biopsy. The frequency of moderate-to-severe TII and moderate-to-severe IF/TA was 30% (67/226) and 34% (76/226) respectively. For autoantibodies, the patients with moderate-to-severe TII had a lower rate of positive serum anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) antibodies than the patients with none-or-mild TII (34% vs. 51%), and moderate-to-severe IF/TA had a lower rate of positive anti-ribosomal P protein (anti-P) antibodies than patients with none-or-mild IF/TA (19% vs. 33%). For other clinical indicators, the patients with moderate-to-severe TII and moderate-to-severe IF/TA were more often combined with proliferative LN, hypertension and anemia than the patients with none-or-mild TII and none-or-mild IF/TA, respectively. The patients with moderate-to-severe TII had higher serum creatinine values and lower glomerular filtration rates than the patients with none-or-mild TII. The patients with moderate-to-severe IF/TA had higher serum creatinine values, and lower glomerular filtration rates than the patients with none-or-mild IF/TA.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In patients with LN in Southern China, anti-RNP antibodies and anti-P antibodies may be potential protective factors for TII and IF/TA, respectively. More studies are needed to identify the risk factors of lupus patients with TID and investigate the correlation between autoantibodies and TID, which are critical for developing better preventive and therapeutic strategies to improve the survival rate of LN."

This may shed light on physiological variability and be used for studying subtle cases of foveal ectopia in macular pathology and after retinal detachment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      SD-OCT data of 890 healthy eyes were retrospectively analyzed. Exclusion criteria included axial myopia causing tilting of the optic disc, peripapillary atrophy >1/3 the width of the disc, macular images excluding greater than half of the optic disc, and patients unable to maintain vertical head positioning. Two independent reviewers measured the horizontal and vertical distance from the fovea to the optic disc center and optic disc diameter via cross-sectional and en-face scanning laser ophthalmoloscopy OCT imaging.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      890 eyes were included in the study. The right and left eyes differed in the horizontal distance from the fovea to the disc center (4359 vs. 4248 µm, P < 0.001) and vertical distance from the fovea to the disc center (464 µm vs. 647, P < 0.001). This corresponded to a smaller angle between the right and left eyes (6.07° vs. 8.67°, P < 0.001). Older age was associated with a larger horizontal (P = 0.008) and vertical distance (0.025).

All participants were otherwise healthy, apart from mild learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorder in two siblings of the second family. Variants in known optic atrophy genes were excluded. Analysis revealed a point variant in the WDR45 gene-a missense variant in the first family, NM_001029896.2:c.107C>A; NP_001025067.1:p.Pro36His (variant ID: 1704205), and a splice site variant in the second family, NM_001029896.2:c.236-1G>T; NP_009006.2:p.Val80Leu (variant ID: 1704204), located on Xp11.23 (OPA2 locus).

Three studies are commonly administered: renal-bladder ultrasound (RUS), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan. However, the order in which these tests are obtained depends on the methodology followed: bottom-up or top-down. Each strategy carries advantages and disadvantages, and some groups now advocate even less of a workup (none of the above) due to the current controversies about treatment when abnormalities are diagnosed. New technology is available and still under investigation, but it may help to clarify the interplay between vesicoureteral reflux, renal scarring, and dysfunctional elimination in the future."

However, this drug can have positive therapeutic potential in treating different conditions, including various neurodegenerative disorders such as other types of dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, psychiatric and mood disorders, and even infectious diseases. Hence, this study reviewed the therapeutic potential of this drug in treating Alzheimer's and other diseases by reviewing the articles from databases including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct. It was shown that donepezil could affect the pathophysiology of these diseases via mechanisms such as increasing the concentration of acetylcholine, modulating local and systemic inflammatory processes, affecting acetylcholine receptors like nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and activating various cellular signaling via receptors like sigma-1 receptors. Despite many therapeutic potentials, this drug has not yet been approved for treating non-Alzheimer's diseases, and more comprehensive studies are needed."

Only two patients with subhepatic collections were symptomatic, and none required treatment. Postoperative infective complications were seen in 13 of 38 patients with drainage and with a collection, and none of the 18 patients without drainage and without a collection had postoperative infective complications (p < 0.05). Cholecystectomy was then performed in 100 patients without using a drain. BULIDA radioisotope scans revealed a bile leak in only 4 of 34 patients studied. Subhepatic collections were seen on US after 48 to 72 hours in 42 patients. The collection resolved in 22 patients and was smaller in 6 on repeat US. None of the patients with collection was symptomatic, and none required treatment. Postoperative infective complications were seen in 7 of 42 patients with a collection and 5 of 58 patients without a collection (not significant). We conclude that (1) cholecystectomy with drainage is associated with more infective complications than when a drain is not used; (2) cholecystectomy without drainage is safe; and (3) asymptomatic nonbilious subhepatic collections are common after cholecystectomy without drainage but do not require treatment, resolving spontaneously."

            "abstract": "Avian brood parasitism reduces the reproductive success of hosts and is therefore expected to select for host defenses against parasitism, such as an ability to reject parasitic eggs. Field studies have shown that some hosts recognize and reject parasitism, whereas others do not, and the degree of the defense varies from population to population. One long-standing debate concentrates on the differences in the distribution of host defenses observed in hosts parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird and the common cuckoo. The cowbird's hosts show either few or nearly perfect defenses, whereas the cuckoo's hosts have defenses varying from none to complete, with most falling in between the two extremes. To explore the mechanisms underlying this pattern, I constructed a mathematical model in which host defense is assumed to be genetically determined and analyzed how the host defense is established under parasitic pressure. The model shows that differences in the defense-level distribution can be attributed to the difference in the parasite's breeding strategy, generalized or specialized: hosts parasitized by generalists show perfect, none, or intermediate levels of the defense depending on the host abundances, whereas hosts parasitized by specialists always exhibit either none or intermediate levels of the defense if the parasite lacks counter defenses such as egg mimicry. This result provides a testable explanation for the existence of accepter species of the brown-headed cowbird, which might reconcile the previously conflicting hypotheses."

Ultrawide-field swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to analyze staphyloma edges, which were divided into four areas: nasal to the optic disc (OD), superior to the macula, inferior to the macula, and temporal to the macula.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Staphylomas were significantly more prevalent in the mature (42.49%) and the elderly (51.35%) groups than in the children (13%) and youth (9%) groups. Staphyloma edges were predominantly superior to the macula in the mature and elderly groups. In contrast, staphylomas were rare in children and youth, with their edges mainly located nasal to the OD. The edges of staphylomas located superior and temporal to the macula were more likely to be associated with myopic traction maculopathy. During the follow-up period, 11 new staphyloma edges developed primarily in the mature group (64%). Additionally, 12 edges had an increased degree of protrusion over time, with most cases occurring in the mature (75%) group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence and location of staphyloma edges show significant variations depending on age.

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      A molecular diagnosis is only made in a subset of individuals with nonisolated microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC). This may be due to underutilization of clinical (whole) exome sequencing (cES) and an incomplete understanding of the genes that cause MAC. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of cES in cases of nonisolated MAC and to identify new MAC phenotypic expansions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We determined the efficacy of cES in 189 individuals with nonisolated MAC. We then used cES data, a validated machine learning algorithm, and previously published expression data, case reports, and animal models to determine which candidate genes were most likely to contribute to the development of MAC.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found the efficacy of cES in nonisolated MAC to be between 32.3% (61/189) and 48.1% (91/189). Most genes affected in our cohort were not among genes currently screened in clinically available ophthalmologic gene panels. A subset of the genes implicated in our cohort had not been clearly associated with MAC. Our analyses revealed sufficient evidence to support low-penetrance MAC phenotypic expansions involving nine of these human disease genes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that cES is an effective means of identifying a molecular diagnosis in individuals with nonisolated MAC and may identify putatively damaging variants that would be missed if only a clinically available ophthalmologic gene panel was obtained. Our data also suggest that deleterious variants in BRCA2, BRIP1, KAT6A, KAT6B, NSF, RAC1, SMARCA4, SMC1A, and TUBA1A can contribute to the development of MAC."

Gront et al., Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. 115, pp. 1569, 2001) we applied a simple combination of the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo and the Histogram methods in the computational studies of a simplified protein lattice model containing hydrophobic and polar units and sequence-dependent local stiffness. A well-defined, relatively complex Greek-key topology, ground (native) conformations was found; however, the cooperativity of the folding transition was very low. Here we describe a modified minimal model of the same Greek-key motif for which the folding transition is very cooperative and has all the features of the \"all-or-none\" transition typical of real globular proteins. It is demonstrated that the all-or-none transition arises from the interplay between local stiffness and properly defined tertiary interactions. The tertiary interactions are directional, mimicking the packing preferences seen in proteins. The model properties are compared with other minimal protein-like models, and we argue that the model presented here captures essential physics of protein folding (structurally well-defined protein-like native conformation and cooperative all-or-none folding transition)."

Analyzed were 289 Japanese with type 2 diabetes (men, 58.5%; mean age, 62.0 years; mean HbA1c, 53.4 mmol/mol) who completed the Food Frequency Questionnaire and Diabetes Family Behavior Checklist (DFBC). Relationships of mean values for food group intake to DFBC responses regarding MNT were examined using multivariate analysis of covariance. Positive response to \"Praise for following diet\" was associated with lower sweets intake (none: 60.1 g/day; ≥once monthly: 50.9 g/day, p = 0.038) and higher seasoning intake (none: 21.6 g/day, ≥once monthly: 24.1 g/day, p = 0.046). Energy intake was higher with positive responses to \"Eat at the same time that you do\" (none: 1636 kcal/day, ≥once monthly: 1818 kcal/day, p = 0.038). \"Nags about not following diet\" was associated with higher fish (none: 68.7 g/day, ≥once monthly: 78.7 g/day, p = 0.042) and salt intake (none: 8.3 g/day, ≥once monthly: 9.0 g/day, p = 0.014). Eating foods not part of the diabetic diet (none: 218.4 g/day, ≥once monthly: 246.9 g/day, p = 0.014) resulted in a higher vegetable intake. In females, significant differences in relationships in the overall analysis were reversed. Our results clarified relationships between types of family support of patients with type 2 diabetes and their dietary intake and the importance of sex differences for more effective MNT."

            "abstract": "People often subdivide a list into smaller pieces, called chunks. Some theories of serial recall assume memories are stored hierarchically, with all-or-none retrieval of chunks, but most mathematical models avoid hierarchical assumptions. Johnson (Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 8(6), 725-731, 1969) found steep drops in errors following correct recalls (transitional-error probabilities) within putative chunks during multi-trial letter-list learning, and viewed this as evidence for all-or-none retrieval. Here we test whether all-or-none retrieval occurs in lists studied only once. In serial recall of six-word lists (Experiment 1), transitional-error probabilities were inconsistent with all-or-none retrieval, both when participants were instructed to subdivide and when temporal grouping induced subdivision. Curiously, the same analysis of previous temporally grouped nine-letter lists produced compelling evidence for all-or-none retrieval, which may result from recoding rather than the formation of chunks. In Experiment 2, participants were pre-trained on three-word chunks. For nine-word lists constructed from those trained chunks, transitional-error probabilities exhibited more pronounced evidence of all-or-none retrieval. Nearly all effects reversed with post-cued backward recall, suggesting mechanisms that play out over the course of recall rather than encoding of the list. In sum, subdivided lists do not result in hierarchical memories after a single study trial, although they may emerge in lists formed from chunks that are previously learned as such. This suggests a continuous transition from non-hierarchical subdivision of lists to all-or-none retrieval over the course of chunk formation."

GLIM appointed a core leadership committee and a supporting working group with representatives bringing additional global diversity and expertise.

The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among the GLIM core and supporting working group members. The top five ranked criteria included three phenotypic criteria (weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) malnutrition are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed.

Low-level contamination (1 CFU per bag) was found in 3 of 253 solutions of saline and/or glucose into which nonantibiotic additives had been injected. None of 171 saline and/or glucose solutions with antibiotic additives or 47 parenteral nutrition fluids was culture positive. The risk of contamination did not increase with duration of storage, and none of 107 bags stored greater than or equal to 5 days was culture positive. Laboratory studies to measure growth of bacteria and fungi in glucose infusate and parenteral nutrition solutions confirmed that storage at 4 degrees C suppresses growth. Eight of twelve bacterial isolates grew in glucose solutions at 25 degrees C, while none grew at 4 degrees C. Of 13 species of bacteria and fungi inoculated in parenteral nutrition fluids, 8 proliferated at 25 degrees C and none proliferated at 4 degrees C.

We studied 13 cases of TCA by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy and correlated the findings with clinical features. The patients' mean age was 54.2 years (range 30-74); the male/female ratio was 7/6. Twelve of the 13 patients presented with signs and symptoms caused by compression of mediastinal organs; the other patient was asymptomatic. Paraneoplastic syndromes were never seen. At thoracotomy, 11 tumors invaded or adhered to surrounding structures; the other two were encapsulated. The histologic types include squamous carcinoma including the lymphoepithelioma-like subtype (seven cases), small cell carcinoma (four cases), clear cell carcinoma (one case), and adenosquamous carcinoma (one case). Positive immunoperoxidase studies were as follows: keratin (13 cases), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (13 cases), leukocyte common antigen (none), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (five cases), B72.3 (seven cases), Leu 7 (two cases), human placental alkaline phosphatase (none), vimentin (none), and chromogranin (one case). This profile is similar to those of normal thymus and thymoma except for the absence of CEA, B72.3, EMA in normal thymus, and the absence of CEA and B72.3 in thymoma. Electron-microscopic studies performed on eight cases showed glandular and squamous differentiation in one adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous differentiation in five squamous carcinomas, and neuroendocrine differentiation in one small-cell carcinoma. Nine patients died (three due to postoperative complications and six due to recurrences or metastasis at 3-36 months). Four patients (all with squamous carcinoma) were alive without disease at 2-60 months. The clinical and pathologic features were comparable with those of approximately 62 other cases of TCA previously reported. There are a number of well-defined histologic types of TCA that allow the pathologist to make a differential diagnosis of TCA from tumors extending or metastatic to thymus or other primary mediastinal tumors. Although neither asymptomatic presentation nor encapsulation improves the poor prognosis of TCA, the squamous carcinoma subtype is associated with a better outcome than the other subtypes. Based on the electronmicroscopic and immunohistochemical findings, the presence of normal thymic tissue at the periphery of several tumors, and the observation that several TCA arose from preexisting thymomas or thymic cysts, we conclude that TCA is derived from thymic epithelium."

Discordant binocular experience from childhood strabismus results in sensory and ocular motor impairments that can affect eye-hand coordination. We assessed reach kinematics during visually guided reaching in children treated for strabismus compared with controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six children aged 7 to 12 years diagnosed with esotropia, a form of strabismus, and a group of 35 age-similar control children were enrolled. Reach movements during visually guided reaching were recorded using the LEAP Motion Controller. While viewing binocularly, children reached out and touched a small dot that appeared randomly in one of four locations (±5° or ±10°). Kinematic measures were reach reaction time, total reach duration, peak velocity, acceleration duration, and deceleration duration. Touch accuracy and factors associated with impaired reach kinematics were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Strabismic children had longer total reach duration (545 ± 60 ms vs. 504 ± 43 ms; P = 0.002), had longer deceleration duration (343 ± 54 ms vs. 312 ± 45 ms; P = 0.010), and were less accurate (93% ± 6% vs. 96% ± 5%, P = 0.007) than controls. No differences were found for reach reaction time, peak velocity, or acceleration duration (all Ps ≥ 0.197). Binocular dysfunction was more related to slow reaching than amblyopic eye visual acuity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Strabismus affects visually guided reaching in children, with slower reaching in the final approach and reduced endpoint accuracy. Binocular dysfunction was predictive of slow reaching.

Consequently, it is important to ascertain which subgroups of patients will benefit from a specific treatment. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of colon cancer, there is a lack of prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers with proven utility in this setting. A secondary objective of the Pan European Trials in Adjuvant Colon Cancer-3 trial, which compared irinotecan in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in the postoperative treatment of stage III and stage II colon cancer patients, was to undertake a translational research study to assess a panel of putative prognostic and predictive markers in a large colon cancer patient cohort. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 trial, in a similar design, also investigated the use of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this article, the authors, who are coinvestigators from these trials and performed similar investigations of biomarker discovery in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer, review the current status of biomarker research in this field, drawing on their experiences and considering future strategies for biomarker discovery in the postgenomic era."

            "abstract": "Study Design A biomechanical and radiographic study using vertebral analogues. Objectives Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are widely used techniques to alleviate pain in fractures secondary to osteoporosis. However, cement leakage toward vital structures like the spinal cord can be a major source of morbidity and even mortality. We define safe cement injection as the volume of the cement injected into a vertebra before the cement leakage occurs. Our objective is to compare the amount of cement that can be safely injected into an osteoporotic vertebra with simulated compression fracture using either vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty techniques. Methods Forty artificial vertebral analogues made of polyurethane with osteoporotic cancellous matrix representing the L3 vertebrae were used for this study and were divided into four groups of 10 vertebrae each. The four groups tested were: low-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty, high-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty, low-viscosity cement injected using balloon kyphoplasty, and high-viscosity cement injected using balloon kyphoplasty. The procedures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The injection was stopped when the cement started protruding from the created vascular channel in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture model. The main outcome measured was the volume of the cement injected safely into a vertebra before leakage through the posterior vascular channel. Results The highest volume of the cement injected was in the vertebroplasty group using high-viscosity cement, which was almost twice the injected volume in the other three groups. One-way analysis of variance comparing the four groups showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005). Conclusions High-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty delivers more cement volume before cement leakage and fills the vertebral body more uniformly when compared with balloon kyphoplasty in osteoporotic vertebrae with compression fractures."

Additionally, assessment researchers suggest that using NOTA is problematic for assessment. In experiments conducted online (with trivia questions) and in the classroom (with course-related questions), I investigated the effects of including NOTA as a multiple-choice choice alternative on students' confidence and performance. In four experiments, participants answered two types of questions: basic multiple-choice questions (basic condition) and equivalent questions in which one incorrect choice was replaced with NOTA (NOTA condition). Immediately after answering each question, participants rated their confidence in their answer to that question (item-by-item confidence). At the end of the experiments, participants made aggregate confidence judgments for the two types of questions and provided additional comments about the use of NOTA as an alternative. Surprisingly, I found no significant differences in item-by-item confidence or performance between the two conditions in any of the experiments. However, across all four experiments, when making aggregate judgments, participants provided lower confidence estimates in the NOTA condition than in the basic condition. Although people often report that NOTA questions hurt their confidence, the present results suggest that they might not-at least not on a question-by-question basis."

A suspected late manifestation of the disease, paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome - temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), has been seen in small numbers of children and has a more severe disease course than acute SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic has meant that children around the world have been kept off school, isolated from their extended family and friends and asked to stay inside.

Symptom-associated probability (SAP) for acid and bolus components defined esophageal sensitivity: (1) SAcid as SAP ≥ 95% for acid (pH < 4), (2) SBolus as SAP ≥ 95% for bolus, (3) SAcid+Bolus as SAP ≥ 95% for acid and bolus, or (4) SNone as SAP < 95% for acid and bolus.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Esophageal sensitivity prevalence (SAcid, SBolus, SAcid+Bolus, SNone) was 28 (10%), 94 (34%), 65 (23%), and 92 (33%), respectively. Emesis occurred more in SBolus and SAcid+Bolus vs SNone (p < 0.05). Magnitude (#/day) of cough and emesis events increased with SBolus and SAcid+Bolus vs SNone (p < 0.05). SAcid+Bolus had increased acid exposure vs SNone (p < 0.05). Distributions of feeding and breathing methods were distinct in infants with SBolus vs SNone (both, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that arching and irritability events/day were lesser at higher PMAs (p < 0.001) and greater for infants on NCPAP (p < 0.01) with SBolus and SAcid+Bolus (p < 0.05). Coughs/day was greater at higher PMAs (p < 0.001) for infants with gavage and transitional feeding methods (p < 0.02) with SBolus and SAcid+Bolus (p < 0.05) but lesser with Trach (p < 0.001). Number of emesis events/day were greater with SBolus and SAcid+Bolus (p < 0.001). Sneezes/day decreased for infants on Trach (p = 0.02).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Feeding and breathing methods can influence the frequency and type of aerodigestive symptoms. We differentiated esophageal sensitivity phenotypes in NICU infants referred for GERD symptoms using pH-impedance. Acid sensitivity alone was rare, which may explain poor response to acid suppressives; aerodigestive symptoms were predominantly linked with bolus spread. Magnitude of esophageal acid exposure and esophageal sensitivity to bolus spread may explain the pathophysiological basis for symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Impact:\n        \n      \n      Objective GERD diagnosis and reasons for symptoms in NICU infants remains unclear. Differentiation of esophageal sensitivities by acid and bolus components of GER reveal distinct symptom profiles, specifically the bolus component of GER significantly contributes to symptom occurrence. Acid only sensitivity to GER is rare, and acid-suppressive therapy alone may not improve symptoms in a majority of NICU infants. Magnitude of esophageal acid exposure and esophageal sensitivity to any bolus spread may explain the pathophysiological basis for symptoms. Feeding and breathing methods can influence the frequency and type of aerodigestive symptoms. GERD treatments should be individualized to the patient's GERD phenotype and likely also target the bolus component of GER."

            "abstract": "Nonfatal suicidality is the most robust predictor of suicide death. However, only ~10% of those who survive an attempt go on to die by suicide. Moreover, ~50% of suicide deaths occur in the absence of prior known attempts, suggesting risks other than nonfatal suicide attempt need to be identified. We studied data from 4,000 population-ascertained suicide deaths and 26,191 population controls to improve understanding of risks leading to suicide death. This study included 2,253 suicide deaths and 3,375 controls with evidence of nonfatal suicidality (SUI_SI/SB and CTL_SI/SB) from diagnostic codes and natural language processing of electronic health records notes. Characteristics of these groups were compared to 1,669 suicides with no prior nonfatal SI/SB (SUI_None) and 22,816 controls with no lifetime suicidality (CTL_None). The SUI_None and CTL_None groups had fewer diagnoses and were older than SUI_SI/SB and CTL_SI/SB. Mental health diagnoses were far less common in both the SUI_None and CTL_None groups; mental health problems were less associated with suicide death than with presence of SI/SB. Physical health diagnoses were conversely more often associated with risk of suicide death than with presence of SI/SB. Pending replication, results indicate highly significant clinical differences among suicide deaths with versus without prior nonfatal SI/SB."

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) contributes to the progression of DR, but how is unclear. In homeostasis of the retinal microvasculature, myeloid-derived pro-angiogenic cells (PACs) also play a pivotal role, and fail to function properly in diabetic conditions. Here, we explored the putative contribution of Lp(a) from patients with T2DM with/without DR and healthy controls on inflammation and angiogenesis of retinal endothelial cells (RECs), and on PAC differentiation. Subsequently, we compared the lipid composition of Lp(a) from patients to that from healthy controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Lp(a)/LDL obtained from patients and healthy controls were added to TNF-alpha-activated RECs. Expression of VCAM-1/ICAM-1 was measured using flowcytometry. Angiogenesis was determined in REC-pericyte co-cultures stimulated by pro-angiogenic growth factors. PAC differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined by measuring expression of PAC markers.

DR-Lp(a) increased REC angiogenesis more than HC-Lp(a) did. Lp(a) from patients without DR showed intermediate profiles. HC-Lp(a) reduced the expression of CD16 and CD105 in PAC, but T2DM-Lp(a) did not.

AAU occurs in 30% to 50% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and both conditions are strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, implying a shared etiology. This study aims to apply genomewide association study (GWAS) to characterize the genetic associations of AAU and their relationship to the genetics of AS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We undertook the GWAS analyses in 2752 patients with AS with AAU (cases) and 3836 patients with AS without AAU (controls).

Suggestive association was observed at 11 additional loci, including previously reported AS loci ERAP1 (rs27529, P = 2.19 × 10-7, OR = 1.22) and NOS2 (rs2274894, P = 8.22 × 10-7, OR = 0.83). Multiple novel suggestive associations were also identified, including MERTK (rs10171979, P = 2.56 × 10-6, OR = 1.20), KIFAP3 (rs508063, P = 5.64 × 10-7, OR = 1.20), CLCN7 (rs67412457, P = 1.33 × 10-6, OR = 1.25), ACAA2 (rs9947182, P = 9.70 × 10-7, OR = 1.37), and 5 intergenic loci. The SNP-based heritability is approximately 0.5 for AS alone, and is much higher (approximately 0.7) for AS with AAU.

To compare benefit with harm in clinical practice and future clinical studies, adverse event (AE) profiles including severity need to be understood. Even though patients report harm symptoms earlier and more frequently than clinicians, rheumatology RCTs currently do not provide a reporting framework from the patient's perspective regarding harms. Our objective for this meta-research project was to identify AEs in order to determine harm clusters and whether these could be self-reported by patients. Our other objective was to examine reported severity grading of the reported harms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We considered primary publications of RCTs eligible if they were published between 2008 and 2018 evaluating pharmacological interventions in patients with a rheumatic or musculoskeletal condition and if they were included in Cochrane reviews.

Of these RCTs, 93 pharmacological trials met our inclusion criteria (including 31,023 patients; representing 20,844 accumulated patient years), which reported a total of 21,498 AEs, corresponding to 693 unique reported terms for AEs. We further sub-categorized these terms into 280 harm clusters (i.e., themes). AEs appropriate for patient self-reporting accounted for 58% of the AEs reported. Among the reported AEs, we identified medical terms for all of the 117 harm clusters appropriate for patient reporting and lay language terms for 86%. We intended to include severity grades of the reported AEs, but there was no evidence for systematic reporting of clinician- or patient-reported severity in the primary articles of the 93 trials.

Diagnostic and therapeutic options are limited, as the pathomechanism of LC is elusive. As the number of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections was and is large, LC will be a challenge for the healthcare system. Previous studies revealed an impaired blood flow, the formation of microclots, and autoimmune mechanisms as potential factors in this complex interplay. Since functionally active autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR-AAbs) were observed in patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study aimed to correlate the appearance of GPCR-AAbs with capillary microcirculation. The seropositivity of GPCR-AAbs was measured by an established cardiomyocyte bioassay in 42 patients with LC and 6 controls. Retinal microcirculation was measured by OCT-angiography and quantified as macula and peripapillary vessel density (VD) by the Erlangen-Angio Tool. A statistical analysis yielded impaired VD in patients with LC compared to the controls, which was accentuated in female persons. A significant decrease in macula and peripapillary VD for AAbs targeting adrenergic β2-receptor, MAS-receptor angiotensin-II-type-1 receptor, and adrenergic α1-receptor were observed. The present study might suggest that a seropositivity of GPCR-AAbs can be linked to an impaired retinal capillary microcirculation, potentially mirroring the systemic microcirculation with consecutive clinical symptoms."

Lacrimal glands were collected for secretory function testing, RNA sequencing, ferroptosis verification, and inflammatory factor detection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      UCNV significantly induced bilateral decreases in tear secretion. Inhibition of the maturation and release of secretory vesicles was observed in bilateral lacrimal glands. More importantly, UCNV induced ferroptosis in bilateral lacrimal glands. Furthermore, UCNV significantly decreased VIP, a neural transmitter, in bilateral lacrimal glands, which increased Hif1a, the dominant transcription factor of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1). Supplementary VIP inhibited ferroptosis, which decreased the inflammatory reaction and promoted the maturation and release of secretory vesicles. Supplementary VIP and Fer-1 improved tear secretion.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which UCNV induces bilateral ferroptosis through the VIP/Hif1a/TfR1 pathway, which might be a promising therapeutic target for DES-induced by corneal refractive surgeries."

Despite its high incidence, the treatment options for patients with conjunctival hyperemia are restricted to over-the-counter drugs that provide symptomatic relief due to short duration of action, tachyphylaxis and rebound redness. As our understanding of the immunopathological pathways causing conjunctival hyperemia expands, newer therapeutic targets are being discovered. These insights have also contributed to the development of animal models for mimicking the pathogenic changes in microvasculature causing hyperemia.

            "abstract": "Xenopus oocyte maturation is an example of an all-or-none, irreversible cell fate induction process. In response to a submaximal concentration of the steroid hormone progesterone, a given oocyte may either mature or not mature, but it can exist in intermediate states only transiently. Moreover, once an oocyte has matured, it will remain arrested in the mature state even after the progesterone is removed. It has been hypothesized that the all-or-none character of oocyte maturation, and some aspects of the irreversibility of maturation, arise out of the bistability of the signal transduction system that triggers maturation. The bistability, in turn, is hypothesized to arise from the way the signal transducers are organized into a signaling circuit that includes positive feedback (which makes it so that the system cannot rest in intermediate states) and ultrasensitivity (which filters small stimuli out of the feedback loop, allowing the system to have a stable off-state). Here we review two simple graphical methods that are commonly used to analyze bistable systems, discuss the experimental evidence for bistability in oocyte maturation, and suggest that bistability may be a common means of producing all-or-none responses and a type of biochemical memory.

Anthracyclines are usually combined with widely different doses of alkylating agents, which may significantly modulate tumor response to these combinations. We analyzed three series of de novo stage II-III breast cancer patients treated front line with anthracycline-based regimens of various cyclophosphamide dose intensities: 65 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)(-) tumors treated with anthracyclines alone (Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels), 51 unselected breast cancer patients treated with intermediate doses of cyclophosphamide (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and 128 others treated with a dose-dense anthracycline-cyclophosphamide combination (St. Louis, Paris). After chemotherapy and surgery, pathologic complete response (pCR) was evaluated. p53 status was determined by a yeast functional assay on the pretreatment tumor sample. In a multivariate analysis of the pooled results, a lack of ER expression and high-dose cyclophosphamide administration were associated with a higher likelihood of pCR. A sharp statistical interaction was detected between p53 status and cyclophosphamide dose intensity. Indeed, when restricting our analysis to patients with ER(-) tumors, we confirmed that a mutant p53 status was associated with anthracycline resistance, but found that p53 inactivation was required for response to the dose-intense alkylating regimen. The latter allowed very high levels of pCR in triple-negative tumors. Thus, our data strongly suggest that cyclophosphamide dose intensification in ER(-) p53-mutated breast cancer patients could significantly improve their response."

This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2017 to 2018. A glaucoma screening test was performed using stereo fundus images and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Glaucoma was defined based on the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of glaucoma was 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-8.6) overall. The prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0-6.6); that of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5-1.1); and that of exfoliation glaucoma was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.7-1.4). In addition to aging, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.33), higher intraocular pressure (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), longer axial length (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.31-1.59), and thinner central corneal thickness (CCT) (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15) were significant risk factors for POAG. Diabetes (OR = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.19-6.62) was a significant risk factor for PACG, and diabetes (OR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03-4.47) and thinner CCT (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.28) were significant risk factors for exfoliation glaucoma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of glaucoma was approximately 8%, probably due to the increase in the Japanese aging population. Not only ocular factors but also lower eGFR for POAG and diabetes for PACG and exfoliation glaucoma were risk factors in a general Japanese population.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      Systemic factors such as eGFR and diabetes must also be considered when implementing preventive measures against glaucoma."

Mucosal edema and bleeding are the two most important obstacles to a successful operation. This study analyzed relationships between unenhanced computed tomography (UECT) findings and ureteroscopic findings to determine whether ureteroscopic results could be predicted preoperatively by using UECT imaging.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      From January 2009 to July 2011, 675 patients were diagnosed with ureteral stones through UECT. Among them, we retrospectively reviewed 92 cases of patients who underwent ureteroscopy (URS). We identified findings such as hydronephrosis, rim sign, periureteral fat stranding, and perinephric fat stranding on the UECT and then categorized these findings into four categories (none, mild, moderate, and severe) according to their severity. We also divided the URS findings of mucosal edema and bleeding into four categories (none, mild, moderate, and severe) and compared these findings with the UECT images.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 92 study patients were included in this study: 59 were male and 33 were female patients. According to the location of the stone, 31 cases were classified as upper ureteral stones, 15 were midureteral stones, and 46 were lower ureteral stones. Hydronephrosis identified with UECT was correlated with the mucosal edema severity observed during URS (p=0.004).

Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments were performed to assess the roles of ETS1 and HMGA2 in LESC proliferation. ETS1-bound cis-regulatory elements and target genes in LESCs were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. The epigenetic features of ETS1-binding sites were assessed by the published histone modification and chromatin accessibility profiles.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ETS1 was robustly expressed in LESCs but dramatically reduced on differentiation into corneal epithelial cells (CECs). ETS1 knockdown in LESCs inhibited cellular proliferation and activated CEC markers (KRT3, KRT12, CLU, and ALDH3A1). When ETS1 was overexpressed during CEC differentiation, LESC-associated genes were upregulated while CEC-associated genes were downregulated. The genome-wide binding profile of ETS1 was identified in LESCs. ETS1 occupied H3K4me3-marked promoters and H3K27ac/H3K4me1-marked enhancers. ETS1-binding sites were also enriched for chromatin accessibility signal. HMGA2 showed a consistent expression pattern with ETS1. ETS1 activates HMAG2 by binding to its promoter.

            "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated the inaccuracy of endoscopic estimation of size. Although several devices have been developed to help improve estimation of size, none are convenient for clinical use. We have designed and evaluated a clinical teaching protocol to aid endoscopists in better estimating size. Thirteen \"endoscopists\" with varying levels of experience (none, less than 1 year, more than 1 year) estimated the size of six steel ball bearings placed into a model colon and viewed with a videoendoscope. They were then taught to compensate for optic distortion and retested immediately after teaching and again 1 month later. The mean error of estimation decreased from 28% before teaching to 8% after teaching (p < .05) and rose to 12% 1 month later (p < .05). Although the indices of mean error decreased immediately after teaching in all groups, only those individuals with less than 1 year of endoscopic experience retained the improvement 1 month after teaching. We conclude that endoscopists can be taught how to compensate for the optic distortion encountered during endoscopy. This teaching is most effective if performed early in the training program."

The psychometric issues were explored by analyzing their test-retest reliability and construct validity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Four hundred eighty-one parents and their children with JIA (n = 465) completed the PARQ and CARQ at the 4-year follow-up. Mean age and disease duration of patients were 10.1 ± 3.7 and 4.7 ± 0.8 years, respectively. The rate of missing values for PARQ/CARQ was generally satisfactory, test-retesting showed sufficient reliability. PARQ/CARQ mean child ability total scores (0-100, 100 = best) for medication were 73.1 ± 23.3/76.5 ± 24.2, for exercise: 85.6 ± 16.5/90.3 ± 15.0, for splints: 72.9 ± 24.2/82.9 ± 16.5. Construct validity was supported by PARQ and CARQ scores for medications, exercise and splints showing a fair to good correlation with the Global Adherence Assessment (GAA) and selected PedsQL scales. Adolescents showed poorer adherence than children. About one third of the parents and children reported medication errors. Perceived helpfulness was highest for medication, and adverse effects were reported the greatest barrier to treatment adherence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The German versions of the PARQ and CARQ appear to have a good reliability and sufficient construct validity. These questionnaires are valuable tools for measuring treatment adherence, identifying potential barriers and evaluating helpfulness of treatments in patients with JIA."

            "abstract": "c-MET and its ligand HGF are frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and increased c-MET levels are found in CRC liver metastases. This study investigated the role of the HGF/c-MET axis in regulating migration/invasion in CRC, using pre-clinical models and clinical samples. Pre-clinically, we found marked upregulation of c-MET at both protein and mRNA levels in several invasive CRC cells. Down-regulation of c-MET using RNAi suppressed migration/invasion of parental and invasive CRC cells. Stimulation of CRC cells with rh-HGF or co-culture with HGF-expressing colonic myofibroblasts, resulted in significant increases in their migratory/invasive capacity. Importantly, HGF-induced c-MET activation promoted rapid downregulation of c-MET protein levels, while the MET transcript remained unaltered. Using RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH), we further showed that MET mRNA, but not protein levels, were significantly upregulated in tumor budding foci at the invasive front of a cohort of stage III CRC tumors (p < 0.001). Taken together, we show for the first time that transcriptional upregulation of MET is a key molecular event associated with CRC invasion and tumor budding. This data also indicates that RNA ISH, but not immunohistochemistry, provides a robust methodology to assess MET levels as a potential driving force of CRC tumor invasion and metastasis."

Histological analysis revealed a reduction in corneal nerve fiber density and corneal endothelial cells, along with conjunctival fibrosis and loss of goblet cells. Moreover, cGVHD induced progressive aggravation of immune cell infiltration and fibrosis in the lacrimal glands. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) results of the lacrimal glands demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and cGVHD groups were associated with GVHD pathways. Immune infiltration analysis using RNA-seq and flow cytometry confirmed that CD8+ T lymphocytes predominantly constituted the inflammatory infiltrating cells within the lacrimal glands.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This lupus-like cGVHD model (bm12→C57BL/6J) exhibited persistent ocular surface manifestations, characterized by immune infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the lacrimal glands.

Secondary outcome measures evaluated efficacy of the therapy based on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and improvements in visual sensitivity and systemic involvement following ocular delivery.

            "abstract": "Study Design Prospective clinical study. Objective Posterior decompression and fusion surgery for beak-type thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (T-OPLL) generally has a favorable outcome. However, some patients require additional surgery for postoperative severe paralysis, a condition that is inadequately discussed in the literature. The objective of this study was to describe the efficacy of a procedure we refer to as \"resection at an anterior site of the spinal cord from a posterior approach\" (RASPA) for severely paralyzed patients after posterior decompression and fusion surgery for beak-type T-OPLL. Methods Among 58 consecutive patients who underwent posterior decompression and fusion surgery for beak-type T-OPLL since 1999, 3 with postoperative paralysis (5%) underwent RASPA in our institute. Clinical records, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, gait status, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) findings, and complications were evaluated in these cases. Results All three patients experienced a postoperative decline in Manual Muscle Test (MMT) scores of 0 to 2 after the first surgery. RASPA was performed 3 weeks after the first surgery. All patients showed gradual improvements in MMT scores for the lower extremity and in ambulatory status; all could walk with a cane at an average of 4 months following RASPA surgery. There were no postoperative complications. Conclusions RASPA surgery for beak-type T-OPLL after posterior decompression and fusion surgery resulted in good functional outcomes as a salvage surgery for patients with severe paralysis. Advantages of RASPA include a wide working space, no spinal cord retraction, and additional decompression at levels without T-OPLL resection and spinal cord shortening after additional dekyphosis and compression maneuvers. When used with IONM, this procedure may help avoid permanent postoperative paralysis."

The aim of this study was to examine the safety and feasibility of performing radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) tube placement in patients taking clopidogrel and/or aspirin. Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis of the medical records for 237 consecutive patients following RIG tube placement secondary to dysphagia from August 2017 to January 2019. Antiplatelet medications and RIG type placement techniques (push vs pull) were compared with bleeding complications. Complications were categorized based on the Society of Interventional Radiology clinical practice guidelines. Of the 237 patients with RIG tubes placed, 77 patients were on antiplatelet therapy: 55 on single antiplatelet therapy and 22 on dual antiplatelet therapy. Of the 55 patients on single antiplatelet therapy, 26 were taking clopidogrel and 29 were taking aspirin. Results: A total of 9 bleeding complications were observed. The most common complication was minimal bleeding or hematoma around the incision site (n=7). No statistically significant increase was seen in bleeding rates when comparing patients on any antiplatelet therapy regimen vs none (P=0.15), single antiplatelet therapy vs none (P=0.13), clopidogrel vs none (P=0.71), or dual antiplatelet therapy vs none (P=0.61). No significant increase in the bleeding complication rate was noted when comparing the aspirin-only regimen vs clopidogrel alone (P=0.34). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the risk of bleeding complications is not increased in patients taking clopidogrel and/or aspirin prior to RIG tube placement."

IOP and ICP were controlled with gravity-based perfusion systems into the anterior chamber and lateral ventricle, respectively. IOP and ICP were modulated from baseline to high (19-30 mmHg) and highest (35-50 mmHg) levels while maintaining a fixed ICP of 8 to 12 mmHg and IOP of 15 mmHg, respectively. After three-dimensional registration and segmentation, the paths of pores visible in all settings were tracked based on their geometric centroids. Pore path tortuosity was defined as the measured distance divided by the minimal distance between the most anterior and posterior centroids.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median pore tortuosity at baseline varied among the eyes (range, 1.16-1.68). For the IOP effect under fixed ICP (six eyes, five animals), two eyes showed statistically significant increased tortuosity and one showed a decrease (P < 0.05, mixed-effects model). No significant change was detected in three eyes. When modulating ICP under fixed IOP (five eyes, four animals), a similar response pattern was detected.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Baseline pore tortuosity and the response to acute pressure increase vary substantially across eyes.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      LC pore path tortuosity could be associated with glaucoma susceptibility."

            "abstract": "Cystoisospora belli, previously known as Isospora belli, is an obligate intracellular coccidian parasite that is most often associated with gastrointestinal disease in immunocompromised patients. In this study, we detail the clinicopathologic features of 18 cases of Cystoisospora infection affecting the gallbladder in immunocompetent individuals and compare them with a control group. Each case was reviewed for cholecystitis (none, acute, chronic), epithelial disarray, presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes (none, rare [≤5 per 20 epithelial cells], present [>5 per 20 epithelial cells]), architectural distortion, intramucosal eosinophilia, and mural thickening/serositis. The mean age of patients with Cystoisospora infection was 33 years and the male to female ratio 1:4.3. Cholecystectomy was performed for biliary dyskinesia (n=7), abdominal pain (n=7), suspected cholelithiasis (n=5), and cholecystitis (n=3). In 2 cases, Cystoisospora was found in donor gallbladders resected at the time of liver transplantation. Each case was characterized by eosinophilic, oval or banana-shaped intraepithelial parasites within perinuclear parasitophorous vacuoles. Most cases showed epithelial disarray and minimal intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Of the 11 cases with an average follow-up of 15 months, none had evidence of disease related to Cystoisospora infection within the biliary tract or elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. We present the largest series of gallbladder cystoisosporiasis in immunocompetent patients to date. Cystoisospora infection is underrecognized in the gallbladders of immunocompetent patients, in part due to the subtle findings in routine cholecystectomy specimens. On the basis of the clinical follow-up, gallbladder cystoisosporiasis in immunocompetent individuals appears to be a self-limited infection."

Ex vivo flow cytometry showed that cladribine administration led to peripheral immune cell depletion in a compartment-specific manner and reduced immune cell infiltration into the CNS. Histological evaluations revealed no significant differences for inflammatory lesion load following cladribine treatment compared to vehicle control. Single cell electrophysiology in acute brain slices was performed and showed an impact of cladribine treatment on intrinsic cellular firing patterns and spontaneous synaptic transmission in neurons of the primary auditory cortex. Here, cladribine administration in vivo partially restored cortical neuronal network function, reducing action potential firing.

The recent discovery of the SMAD family of signal transducer proteins as mediators of TGF-β relaying signals from cell membrane to nucleus has revolutionized the understanding of the molecular basis of these processes (1,2). To date, at least eight homologues of the Smad genes have been identified and shown to be downstream of the serine/threonine kinase receptors Table 1 ). SMADs are molecules of relative mass 42K-60K composed of two regions of homology at the amino and carboxy terminals of the protein. The activation of SMADs by receptors upon TGF-β binding results in the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes and translocation to the nucleus where transcription of target genes is effected. However, some of the SMADs apparently inhibit rather than mediate, TGF-β signaling. These inhibitory SMADs are also induced by TGF-β stimulation suggesting that there is an intracellular negative-feedback loop.

Methods The authors describe the clinical case review. Results A 64-year-old woman had undergone epidural anesthesia 18 years before she was referred to our hospital because of lower-back pain and lower neurologic deficit with leg pain. The clinical examination showed the presence of a fragment of an epidural catheter in the thoracolumbar canal, as assessed by computed tomography, and a spinal hematoma that compressed the spinal cord at the same spinal level, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical removal of the epidural catheter and decompression surgery were performed. The patient exhibited substantial clinical improvement 1 month after surgery; she achieved a steady gait without the need for a cane and had no leg pain. Conclusion This is the first report of delayed onset of spinal hematoma following the breakage of an epidural catheter. Generally, when the breakage of an epidural catheter occurs without symptoms, follow-up alone is recommended. However, because spinal hematoma might exhibit a late onset, the possibility of this complication should be considered when deciding whether to remove the catheter fragment. We believe that in our patient, there could be a relationship between the catheter fragment and subdural hematoma, and catheter breakage could have been a risk factor for the spinal hematoma."

This type of transgenic mice has been proved as an ideal tool to achieve efficient labeling of a distinct subset of ACs that selectively express Tpbg."

            "title": "An International Multicenter Study Assessing the Role of Ethnicity on Variation of Lumbar Facet Joint Orientation and the Occurrence of Degenerative Spondylolisthesis in Asia Pacific: A Study from the AOSpine Asia Pacific Research Collaboration Consortium.",
            "abstract": "Study Design A multinational, multiethnic, cross-sectional image-based study was performed in 33 institutions, representing 10 countries, which were part of the AOSpine Asia Pacific Research Collaboration Consortium. Objective Lumbar facet joint orientation has been reported to be associated with the development of degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). The role of ethnicity regarding facet joint orientation remains uncertain. As such, the following study was performed across a wide-ranging population base to assess the role of ethnicity in facet joint orientation in patients with DS in the Asia Pacific region. Methods Lateral standing X-rays and axial magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained for patients with lumbar DS. The DS parameters and facet joint angulations were assessed from L3-S1. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and ethnicity were also noted. Results The study included 371 patients with known ethnic origin (mean age: 62.0 years; 64% males, 36% females). The mean BMI was 25.6 kg/m(2). The level of DS was most prevalent at L4-L5 (74.7%). There were 28.8% Indian, 28.6% Japanese, 18.1% Chinese, 8.6% Korean, 6.5% Thai, 4.9% Caucasian, 2.7% Filipino, and 1.9% Malay patients. Variations in facet joint angulations were noted from L3 to S1 and between patients with and without DS (p < 0.05). No differences were noted with regards to sex and overall BMI to facet joint angulations (p > 0.05); however, increasing age was found to increase the degree of angulation throughout the lumbar spine (p < 0.05). Accounting for age and the presence or absence of DS at each level, no statistically significant differences between ethnicity and degree of facet joint angulations from L3-L5 were noted (p > 0.05). Ethnic variations were noted in non-DS L5-S1 facet joint angulations, predominantly between Caucasian, Chinese, and Indian ethnicities (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study is the first to suggest that ethnicity may not play a role in facet joint orientation in the majority of cases of DS in the Asia-Pacific region. Findings from this study may facilitate future comparative studies in other multiethnic populations. An understanding of ethnic variability may assist in identifying those patients at risk of postsurgical development or progression of DS. This study also serves as a model for large-scale multicenter studies across different ethnic groups and cultural boundaries in Asia."

            "abstract": "Cancers of origin in the gallbladder and bile ducts are rarely curable with current modalities of cancer treatment. Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas. In an analysis of frozen tissue specimens, IDH1 mutation was associated with highly elevated tissue levels of the enzymatic product 2-hydroxyglutarate. Thus, IDH1 mutation is a molecular feature of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin. These findings define a specific metabolic abnormality in this largely incurable type of gastrointestinal cancer and present a potentially new target for therapy."

Amantadine acts as a nicotinic receptor antagonist, dopamine receptor agonist and non-competitive N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Amantadine is a long-known drug, originally approved for treatment of influenza A and Parkinson`s Disease. It has been proven effective in improving vigilance after traumatic brain injury. The underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, albeit anti-glutamatergic and dopaminergic effects might be most relevant. With limited evidence of amantadine efficacy in non-traumatic pathologies, the aim of our study is to assess the effects of amantadine for neuroenhancement in non-traumatic neurointensive patients with persisting coma.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An investigator-initiated, monocenter, phase IIb proof of concept open-label pilot study will be carried out.

If participants present as non-responders (increase < 3 points or decrease on the GCS) within the first 48 h, the dosage will be doubled from day three to five.

In total, 207 myopic children were assigned randomly to group A/B. Participants in group A received 1% atropine weekly (phase 1) and 0.01% atropine daily (phase 2) for 6 months each. Those in group B received 0.01% atropine daily for 1 year. Four plausible intervention mediators were assessed: total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In group A, LA, SA, and TCA increased significantly after receiving 1% atropine for 6 months. The increment diminished after tapering to 0.01% atropine. In group B, those parameters remained stable. TCA mediated approximately one-third of 1% atropine's effect on spherical equivalent progression in both phases. In phase 1, the mediation effect of TCA was shared by LA and SA, while only that of LA remained significant in phase 2. No mediation effect of CVI was found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      One percent atropine induced choroidal thickening by increasing both LA and SA, while 0.01% atropine had little choroidal response. The choroidal changes following 1% atropine treatment diminished after switching to 0.01% atropine. TCA, but not CVI, partially explains atropine's antimyopic and myopic-rebound mechanisms. SA may serve as a potential biomarker to predict the postrebound treatment efficacy of high-dose atropine. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03949101.)."

            "abstract": "Intracellular recordings were obtained from supragranular neurons in slices of the rat visual cortex. In approximately 25% of the cells large (0.5-1.6 mV) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of constant amplitude were observed after minimal, presumably single-fibre stimulation. The amplitude variance of these large EPSPs was surprisingly small and within the range of the variance of the noise. These EPSPs could be reduced in amplitude by paired-pulse and low-frequency stimulation or by raising extracellular Mg2+ concentration. Reduced EPSPs could either continue to behave as all-or-none responses, or they could fluctuate between several amplitude levels. Conversely, responses where the amplitude fluctuated from trial to trial under control conditions could be converted into large all-or-none responses by paired-pulse facilitation. This indicates that the large all-or-none EPSPs were composed of several subunits, probably reflecting the action of several different release sites. It is concluded that these release sites are either independent and operate with a probability close to 1 or, if operating with a lower probability, are coordinated by a mechanism which synchronizes release. Several observations suggest that release probabilities can switch from values close to 1 to 0 with repetitive stimulation or high Mg2+ concentration. Thus, a substantial fraction of single-fibre inputs to supragranular cells possess synapses which operate with high synaptic efficiency and extremely low variance under control conditions but can undergo drastic changes in efficacy when release probabilities are interfered with. Such modifications of release probability could serve as an effective mechanism to regulate the gain of synaptic transmission."

In the TBP subanalysis, the median OS duration from treatment initiation and time of disease progression were longer in patients who continued receiving trastuzumab TBP (>27.8 months and 21.3 months, respectively) than in those who stopped (16.8 months and 4.6 months, respectively). However, the groups were not completely comparable, because patients who continued trastuzumab TBP had better prognoses at treatment initiation. The median TTP was longer in patients who continued trastuzumab TBP (10.2 months) than in those who stopped (7.1 months).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The Hermine findings confirm that the pivotal trials of first-line trastuzumab treatment in MBC patients are applicable in clinical practice.

            "abstract": "Monogonont rotifers reproduce parthenogenetically or sexually. The proportion of sexual females in a population (rate of mixis) can be modified by external factors. Published data about these factors are inconsistent and in part even contradictory (Table 1).In summer 1967 we made quantitative plankton studies in 15 tanks (0.3 to 50 m3). The following parameters were recorded every third day: population density, egg rate (eggs/female), and rate of mixis of the three rotifer species Brachionus calyciflorus, B. rubens and B. angularis; pH, temperature, rainfall, and phytoplankton biomass (dry weight). The latter was subdivided into three categories: ultra, nanno and micro-plankton.A correlation analysis of the environmental factors revealed many intercorrelations (Table 2). The coefficients of correlation between each rate of mixis and all other parameters are given in Table 3. A most striking result is the absence of significant correlations among the rates of mixis of the three species. This means that the periods of sexuality of the three related species are independent of one another in the same biotope. No one factor shows a consistent positive or negative correlation with the rates of mixis of all three species. But there are no contradictions, i.e., none of the parameters is correlated positively in one species and negatively in another species. Positive correlations (or none) are demonstrated with temperature, changing of temperature, and micro-phytoplankton; negative correlations (or none) with total phytoplankton, ultra-phytoplankton, nanno-phytoplankton, eggs/female, and population density of the competing Brachionus species; in no case are significant correlations found with pH and rainfall. That factors with significant correlations do not show these correlations with all species could be due to different threshold values of the mixis-inducing factors in the three rotifer species.In one respect our analysis is at variance with previous findings: whereas in all published data the population growth rate promotes the rate of mixis, we find in no case a significantly positive correlation between the rate of mixis and the population growth rate, or the rate of eggs/female. In some cases we find a significantly negative correlation.At present it is difficult to decide, whether the significant factors influence the rate of mixis directly or indirectly. The intercorrelations of the factors (Table 2) suggest that in many if not most cases these influences are indirect. tionsdichte von B. calyciflorus (bei B. rubens).

            "abstract": "Cefoperazone/sulbactam (CSL) and piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) are commonly used in clinical practice in China because of their excellent antimicrobial activity. CSL and TZP-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae are typically resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone (CRO). However, 11 nonrepetitive Enterobacteriaceae strains, which were resistant to CSL and TZP yet susceptible to CRO, were collected from January to December 2020. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and whole-genome sequencing were conducted to elucidate the mechanism for this rare phenotype. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that all isolates were amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid resistant and sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefepime/tazobactam, cefepime/zidebactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, and ceftolozane/tazobactam. Whole-genome sequencing revealed three of seven Klebsiella pneumoniae strains harbored bla SHV-1 only, and four harbored bla SHV-1 and bla TEM-1B. Two Escherichia coli strains carried bla TEM-1B only, while two Klebsiella oxytoca isolates harbored bla OXY-1-3 and bla OXY-1-1, respectively. No mutation in the β-lactamase gene and promoter sequence was found. Outer membrane protein (Omp) gene detection revealed that numerous missense mutations of OmpK36 and OmpK37 were found in all strains of K. pneumoniae. Numerous missense mutations of OmpK36 and OmpK35 and OmpK37 deficiency were found in one K. oxytoca strain, and no OmpK gene was found in the other. No Omp mutations were found in E. coli isolates. These results indicated that narrow spectrum β-lactamases, TEM-1, SHV-1, and OXY-1, alone or in combination with Omp mutation, contributed to the resistance to CSL and TZP in CRO-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae.

Hip osteoporosis was defined as T-score <or=-2.5 at femoral neck or total hip, and spine osteoporosis as T-score <or=-2.5 at lumbar spine. Incident clinical fractures were self-reported and centrally adjudicated. Incident radiographic spine fractures were defined morphometrically. Compared to women with osteoporosis at neither hip nor spine, those osteoporotic only at hip had a 3.0-fold age- and weight-adjusted increased risk for hip fracture (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.6), and smaller increases in risk of nonhip nonspine (hazard ratios [HR]=1.6), clinical spine (odds ratio [OR]=2.2), and radiographic spine fractures (OR=1.5). Women osteoporotic only at spine had a 2.8-fold increased odds of radiographic spine fracture (95% CI: 2.1-3.8), and smaller increases in risk of clinical spine (OR=1.4), nonhip nonspine (HR=1.6), and hip fractures (HR=1.2). Discordant BMD results predict different fracture patterns. DXA fracture risk estimation in these patients should be site specific. Women osteoporotic only at spine would not have been identified from hip BMD measurement alone, and may have a sufficiently high fracture risk to warrant preventive treatment."

We assessed the accuracy of probabilistic clinician prediction of survival (CPS) and temporal CPS for advanced cancer patients admitted to our acute palliative care unit, and identified factors associated with CPS accuracy. Eight physicians and 20 nurses provided their estimation of survival on admission by (a) the temporal approach, \"What is the approximate survival for this patient (in days)?\" and (b) the probabilistic approach, \"What is the approximate probability that this patient will be alive (0%-100%)?\" for ≥24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. We also collected patient and clinician demographics. Among 151 patients, the median age was 58 years, 95 (63%) were female, and 138 (81%) had solid tumors. The median overall survival time was 12 days. The median temporal CPS was 14 days for physicians and 20 days for nurses. Physicians were more accurate than nurses. A higher accuracy of temporal physician CPS was associated with older patient age. Probabilistic CPS was significantly more accurate than temporal CPS for both physicians and nurses, although this analysis was limited by the different criteria for determining accuracy. With the probabilistic approach, nurses were significantly more accurate at predicting survival at 24 hours and 48 hours, whereas physicians were significantly more accurate at predicting survival at 6 months. The probabilistic approach was associated with high accuracy and has practical implications."

Differences in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, photoreceptor layer status, and parallelism (reflects the complexity of photoreceptor layer alterations) were analyzed in each image type. The order of PSNRs from highest to lowest was SR > LA > BC > BL > non-processed enlarged images (NONE). The PSNR was statistically different in all groups. The NONE, BC, and LA images resulted in significantly thicker RNFL measurements than the OR image.

To explore reasons for the unexpected vascular toxicities, we examined the effects of melphalan, as well as carboplatin (another chemotherapeutic used with retinoblastoma), in vitro using primary human retinal endothelial cells, and in vivo using a non-human primate model, which allowed us to monitor the retina in real time during SSIOAC. Results. Both melphalan and carboplatin triggered human retinal endothelial cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and increased expression of adhesion proteins intracellullar adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1] and soluble chemotactic factors (IL-8). Melphalan increased monocytic adhesion to human retinal endothelial cells. Consistent with these in vitro findings, histopathology showed vessel wall endothelial cell changes, leukostasis, and vessel occlusion. Conclusions. These results reflect a direct interaction of chemotherapeutic drugs with both the vascular endothelium and monocytes. The vascular toxicity may be related to the pH, the pulsatile delivery, or the chemotherapeutic drugs used. Our long-term goal is to determine if changes in the drug of choice and/or delivery procedures will decrease vascular toxicity and lead to better eye-targeted treatment strategies."

In this work, several optical elastography techniques were used to investigate the effect of collagen XII deficiency on the stiffness of the murine cornea.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A three-prong optical elastography approach was used to investigate the mechanical properties of the cornea. Brillouin microscopy, air-coupled ultrasonic optical coherence elastography (OCE) and heartbeat OCE were used to assess the mechanical properties of wild type (WT) and collagen XII-deficient (Col12a1-/-) murine corneas. The Brillouin frequency shift, elastic wave speed, and compressive strain were all measured as a function of intraocular pressure (IOP).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All three optical elastography modalities measured a significantly decreased stiffness in the Col12a1-/- compared to the WT (P < 0.01 for all three modalities). The optical coherence elastography techniques showed that mean stiffness increased as a function of IOP; however, Brillouin microscopy showed no discernable trend in Brillouin frequency shift as a function of IOP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our approach suggests that the absence of collagen XII significantly softens the cornea. Although both optical coherence elastography techniques showed an expected increase in corneal stiffness as a function of IOP, Brillouin microscopy did not show such a relationship, suggesting that the Brillouin longitudinal modulus may not be affected by changes in IOP. Future work will focus on multimodal biomechanical models, evaluating the effects of other collagen types on corneal stiffness, and in vivo measurements."

SELECTION OF STUDY SUBJECTS--A consecutive series of 20 patients undergoing colonic surgery over a 7-month period from October 1992 to April 1993. OBSERVATIONAL METHODS AND MAIN FINDINGS--A protocol was drawn up for prospective record of data from 11 male and 9 female patients (age 34 years to 83 years). Information was collected regarding length of operation (average 3 hours), actual anastomotic time (average 13.5 minutes) and problems or complications associated with the Valtrac device during surgery (none). Postoperatively, the cases were carefully documented for intestinal obstruction from faecal impaction due to Valtrac fragments (none), the timing of bowel movements (majority 4th day, range 1-7 days), and awareness of passing fragments (none). There were no mortality and no anastomotic leakage though two patients developed wound infection. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS--This preliminary study confirms that the biofragmentable anastomotic ring is a simple, rapid and efficacious method of bowel anastomosis comparable to existing procedures. It has the distinct advantage of being uniformly reproducible."

            "abstract": "Study Design Randomized, controlled animal study. Objective Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is frequently utilized as a bone graft substitute in spinal fusions to overcome the difficult healing environment in patients with osteoporosis. However, the effects of estrogen deficiency and poor bone quality on rhBMP-2 efficacy are unknown. This study sought to determine whether rhBMP-2-induced healing is affected by estrogen deficiency and poor bone quality in a stringent osteoporotic posterolateral spinal fusion model. Methods Aged female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent an ovariectomy (OVX group) or a sham procedure, and the OVX animals were fed a low-calcium, low-phytoestrogen diet. After 12 weeks, the animals underwent a posterolateral spinal fusion with 1 μg rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge. Representative animals were sacrificed at 1 week postoperative for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin serum analyses. The remaining animals underwent radiographs 2 and 4 weeks after surgery and were subsequently euthanized for fusion analysis by manual palpation, micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging, and histologic analysis. Results The ALP and osteocalcin levels were similar between the control and OVX groups. Manual palpation revealed no significant differences in the fusion scores between the control (1.42 ± 0.50) and OVX groups (1.83 ± 0.36; p = 0.07). Fusion rates were 100% in both groups. Micro-CT imaging revealed no significant difference in the quantity of new bone formation, and histologic analysis demonstrated bridging bone across the transverse processes in fused animals from both groups. Conclusions This study demonstrates that estrogen deficiency and compromised bone quality do not negatively influence spinal fusion when utilizing rhBMP-2, and the osteoinductive capacity of the growth factor is not functionally reduced under osteoporotic conditions in the rat. Although osteoporosis is a risk factor for pseudarthrosis/nonunion, rhBMP-2-induced healing was not inhibited in osteoporotic rats."

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss."

The emergence of relevant research suggesting a pathogenic linkage between H. pylori infection and MetS-related cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly through mechanisms involving brain pericyte deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, elevated lipoprotein-a, galectin-3 overexpression, atrial fibrillation, and gut dysbiosis, has raised stimulating questions regarding their pathophysiology and its translational implications for clinicians. An additional stimulating aspect refers to H. pylori and MetS-related activation of innate immune cells, mast cells (MC), which is an important, often early, event in systemic inflammatory pathologies and related brain disorders. Synoptically, MC degranulation may play a role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori and MetS-related obesity, adipokine effects, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, vascular dysfunction and arterial stiffness, an early indicator of atherosclerosis associated with cardio-cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Meningeal MC can be activated by triggers including stress and toxins resulting in vascular changes and neurodegeneration. Likewise, H.pylori and MetS-related MC activation is linked with: (a) vasculitis and thromboembolic events that increase the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, and (b) gut dysbiosis-associated neurodegeneration, whereas modulation of gut microbiota and MC activation may promote neuroprotection. This narrative review investigates the intricate relationship between H. pylori infection, MetS, MC activation, and their collective impact on pathophysiological processes linked to neurodegeneration. Through a comprehensive search of current literature, we elucidate the mechanisms through which H. pylori and MetS contribute to MC activation, subsequently triggering cascades of inflammatory responses. This highlights the role of MC as key mediators in the pathogenesis of cardio-cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing their involvement in neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction and, ultimately, neuronal damage. Although further research is warranted, we provide a novel perspective on the pathophysiology and management of brain disorders by exploring potential therapeutic strategies targeting H. pylori eradication, MetS management, and modulation of MC to mitigate neurodegeneration risk while promoting neuroprotection."

I consider an arbitrary distribution of protection that the vaccine confers, including the extreme cases of leaky and all-or-none vaccines. The optimal vaccination policy depends on the distribution of protection. While for low values of the basic reproduction number R0 the optimal policy prioritises the most susceptible hosts, I show that for almost any distribution the order of priority reverses and the least susceptible hosts should be vaccinated when R0 is high. The exception where this does not happen is the all-or-none vaccine.

Seven pathogenic variants were detected, including one nonsense (c.1765C>T/p.Arg589*), three frameshift (c.39dupG/p.Leu14Alafs*21; c.544delC/p.Leu182Cysfs*3, c.594delG/p.Gln199Lysfs*35), and three missense (c.371G>A/p.Cys124Tyr; c.1051G>A/p.Gly351Arg; c.1669G>A/p.Glu557Lys) variants. Clinical data of nine patients from nine unrelated families revealed myopia at the first visit at about 5 years of age, showing slow progression with age. Visual acuity at the last visit ranged from 0.04 to 0.9 (median age at last visit = 5 years, range 3.5-15 years). High myopic fundus changes, observed in all nine patients, were classified as tessellated fundus (C1) in five patients and diffuse choroidal atrophy (C2) in four patients.

We identified transmembrane protein 135 (Tmem135) as a gene important for regulating retinal aging and mitochondrial dynamics in mice. Overexpression of Tmem135 causes mitochondrial fragmentation and pathologies in the hearts of mice. In this study, we examine the eyes of mice overexpressing wild-type Tmem135 (Tmem135 TG) and compare their phenotype to Tmem135 mutant mice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eyes were collected for histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, quantitative PCR, and Western blot analysis.

We observed reduced mitochondria number and size in the Tmem135 TG RPE. ERG amplitudes were decreased in 365-day-old mice overexpressing Tmem135 that correlated with reduced expression of RPE cell markers. In Tmem135 mutant mice, RPE cells are thicker, smaller, and denser than their littermate controls without any signs of degeneration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overexpression and mutation of Tmem135 cause contrasting RPE abnormalities in mice that correlate with changes in mitochondrial shape and size (overfragmented in TG vs. overfused in mutant).

A range of 19.7 to 309.0 μg kg-1of BLs was found, where the highest amount represented AMX in ex-layers. Mean AMX contents in all chicken types, and AMP in broilers were above the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). For SAs, only SPD mean content was above MRL in ex-layers. Human health risks from exposure to antibiotic-contaminated chicken meat was evaluated using % ADI. All tested βLs were of no risk (<1% ADI) to human health. SPD and SDZ posed considerable risk (1-5% ADI) in some chicken meat, whereas SPD in ex-layers' chicken meat posed distinctive risk (>5% ADI) to children. Considering the co-occurrence of different types of antibiotics in same samples, obtained MRLs and % ADI (for some of the antibiotics) are indicative of potential human health risks.

Symptoms include reduced visual acuity and disturbed color vision. We studied BCM color vision to determine outcome measures for future clinical trials.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with BCM and normal-vision participants were examined with Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) arrangement tests and the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test. A retrospective case series in 36 patients with BCM (ages 6-70) was performed with the FM D-15 test. A subset of six patients also had Roth-28 Hue and CAD tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All patients with BCM had abnormal results for D-15, Roth-28, and CAD tests. With D-15, there was protan-deutan confusion and no bimodal tendency. Roth-28 results reinforced that finding. There was symmetry in color vision metrics between the two eyes and coherence between sessions with the arrangement tests and CAD. Severe abnormalities in red-green sensitivity with CAD were expected. Unexpected were different levels of yellow-blue results with two patterns of abnormal thresholds: moderate elevation in two younger patients and severe elevation in four patients ≥35 years. Coefficients of repeatability and intersession means were tabulated for all test modalities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Given understanding of advantages, disadvantages, and complexities of interpretation of results, both an arrangement test and CAD should be useful monitors of color vision through a clinical trial in BCM.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      Our pilot studies in BCM of arrangement and CAD tests indicated both were clinically feasible and interpretable in the context of this cone gene disease."

Gene therapy targeting RB1 is an effective strategy to treat RB. However, it is difficult to target the RB1 gene by site-specific repair, with up to 3366 gene mutation sites identified in RB1. Thus, it is necessary to construct a promising and efficacious gene therapeutic strategy for patients with RB.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To recover the function of the RB1 protein, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2) expressing RB1 that can restore RB1 function and significantly inhibit RB progression. To confirm the clinical feasibility of rAAV2-RB1, the RB1 protein was validated in vitro and in vivo after transfection. To further evaluate the clinical efficacy, RB patient-derived xenograft models were established and applied. The biosafety of rAAV2-RB1 was also validated in immunocompetent mice.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      rAAV2-RB1 was a rAAV2 expressing the RB1 protein, which was validated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, rAAV2-RB1 was effectively expressed in patient-derived RB cells. In mice, intravitreal administration of rAAV2-RB1 in a population-based patient-derived xenograft trial induced limited tumor growth. Moreover, after transfection of rAAV2-RB1 in immunocompetent mice, rAAV2-RB1 did not replicate and was expressed in other important organs, except retinas, inducing minor local side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study suggested a promising efficacy gene therapeutic strategy, which might provide a chemotherapy-independent treatment option for RB."

This technique, so called because its first phase is performed with occlusion of the vessel suspected of being pathologic, is used for the diagnosis of spinal arteriovenous fistula (sDAVF). Case Report The authors present the case of a 68-year-old man with an sDAVF fed by the right T7 segmentary artery. IGV was initially performed with the presumptive fistula feeder occluded for less than 1 minute, which provided both diagnostic and postexclusion control in one procedure. This technique therefore is reversible by not prolonging vascular exclusion times. Discussion IGV in negative is an extremely visual and intuitive procedure that represents an improvement over conventional IGV. Conclusion Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to determine whether IGV in negative can further reduce the need for postoperative digital subtraction angiography."

We studied 22 BCs and 34 teratomas metastatic to the retroperitoneum in men. Of 22 BCs, 17 (77%) showed well or moderate architectural differentiation toward normal tracheobronchial structures, whereas none of the teratomas did. In addition, 20 (91%) of the BCs had respiratory-type epithelium and none had enteric-type epithelium. Immature elements, atypia, and tumor necrosis were absent in BCs. All BCs expressed cytokeratin (CK) 7, and none expressed CDX-2 in immunohistochemical analysis. Teratomas had mixed enteric and respiratory-type epithelium. The majority of the glands were positive for CK7 (33 [97%]), CK20 (34 [100%]), CDX-2 (34 [100%]), and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 (17 [50%]). Coexpression of CDX-2 and TTF-1 was found in 11 teratomas (32%) but none of the BCs.

However, less is known regarding how change blindness manifests in virtual settings varying in visual clutter or with varying types of interaction with someone prior to the change. Across two studies (n = 134), participants engaged in an online video chat with a confederate, with two levels of visual clutter (none, a lot) and three levels of interaction (none, light conversations about weather/TV, deeper conversations about goals/greatest regrets). We found no modulation of change blindness rates across perceptual clutter. Curiously, we found a large discrepancy in change blindness rates in Experiment 1 (79%; 52/66) versus Experiment 2 (16%; 11/68) that we explored, leading to some evidence that increasing the level of interaction led to greater change blindness rates, but only for pairs who identified as belonging to different ethnicities. Taken together, our work suggests that we may pay attention to people differently in virtual settings compared to in-person, that in-group and out-group biases may have an effect on change blindness rates, and that while clutter does not seem to affect change blindness rates, one's level of interaction just might.

Detailed ocular phenotypes were characterized. The disease course was evaluated by long-term follow-up observation, with a focus on fundus changes. Cox regression was used to identify the factors associated with disease progression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of genetic and clinical data for 228 patients and follow-up data for 42 patients indicated specific features in patients with two ABCA4 variants. Of 185 patients with available fundus images, 107 (57.8%) showed focal lesions restricted to the central macula without flecks. Among these 107 patients, 30 patients (28.0%) initially presented with relatively preserved visual acuity and inconspicuous performance on routine fundus screening. A pigmentary change in the posterior pole was observed in 22 of 185 patients (11.9%), and this change mimicked retinitis pigmentosa in 10 cases (45.5%). Follow-up visits and sibling comparisons demonstrated disease progression from cone-rod dystrophy, Stargardt disease, to retinitis pigmentosa. An earlier age of onset was associated with a more rapid decrease in visual acuity (P = 0.03). Patients with two truncation variants had an earlier age of onset.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Phenotypic variation in ABCA4-associated retinopathy may represent sequential changes in a single disease: early-stage Stargardt disease may resemble cone-rod dystrophy, whereas the presence of diffuse pigmentation in the late stage may mimic retinitis pigmentosa. Recognizing the natural progression of fundus changes, especially those visualized by wide-field fundus autofluorescence, is valuable for diagnostics and therapeutic decision-making."

FDM was also induced in retina- (Six3creD2Rfl/fl) or fibroblast-specific (S100a4creD2Rfl/fl) D2R-KO mice. A subset of retina-specific D2R-KO mice and D2Rfl/fl littermates were also given sulpiride or vehicle injections.

Similarly, the development of myopia was partially inhibited by retina-specific (deletion efficiency: 94.7%) but not fibroblast-specific (66.9%) D2R-KO. The sulpiride-mediated inhibitory effects on FDM also disappeared with retinal D2R-KO, suggesting that antagonizing D2Rs outside the retina may not attenuate myopia.

Recent studies have suggested that a more quantitative approach to the measurement of HER2 protein expression may improve specificity in selecting patients for HER-2 targeted therapy. In the current study, we have used HER2 expression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples as a model to explore the potential utility of a novel immunodetection technique, using streptavidin coated Phosphor Integrated Dot fluorescent nanoparticles (PID), which can be quantitatively measured using computer analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The expression of HER2 protein in cell lines was evaluated with antibody-binding capacity using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for comparison with PID measurements to test for correlations with existing quantitative protein analysis methodologies. Various other analytic validation tests were also performed, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, robustness and reproducibility. A methods comparison study investigated correlations between PID versus IHC and ISH in clinical samples. Lastly, we measured HER2 protein expression using PID in the pretreatment biopsies from 34 HER2-positive carcinomas that had undergone neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the analytic validation, PID HER2 measurements showed a strong linear correlation with FACS analysis in breast cell lines, and demonstrated significant correlations with all aspects of precision, sensitivity, robustness and reproducibility. PID also showed strong correlations with conventional HER2 testing methodologies (IHC and ISH). In the neoadjuvant study, patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) had a significantly higher PID score compared with patients who did not achieve a pCR (p = 0.011), and was significantly correlated to residual cancer burden (RCB) class (p = 0.026, R2 = 0.9975).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Analytic testing of PID showed that it may be a viable testing methodology that could offer advantages over other experimental or conventional biomarker diagnostic methodologies.

Prominent photoreceptor outer segment degeneration and an increase in the number of retinal dual cones (co-expressing S- and M-opsins simultaneously) have been described in diabetic rat models, suggesting a connection with the development of CVDs.

All women were from a similar socioeconomic class and were controlled for gestational age and tobacco use. None of the cocaine placentas were from women whose toxicology screens were positive for drugs other than cocaine. In the 26 cocaine placentas, there was 1 infarct, 3 chronic villitis, and 1 segmental fibrosis, with none present in the controls. In the control group, there was 1 decidual vasculopathy and 1 thrombus in a maternal vessel, but none were in the cocaine placentas. Each group had 1 thrombus in a fetal vessel. The study group showed 6 cases of chorioamnionitis and 1 funisitis; the control group had 10 and 4 cases, respectively. None of the above or seven other features showed a statistically significant difference between the cases and controls. Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictive agent that blocks re-uptake of norepinephrine at the adrenergic nerve terminals.

In addition, to evaluate the thresholds at each site for an association with visual acuity (VA) and spherical equivalent (SE).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We estimated rod-mediated dark-adapted thresholds (DATs) for the detection of 2 degree diameter, 50 ms, blue (λ < 510 nm) flashes at 10 degrees and 30 degrees eccentric in former preterm subjects (n = 111), stratified by ROP severity: None (n = 32), Mild (n = 66), and Severe (n = 13). We also tested Term-born (n = 28) controls. To determine the age at half-maximal sensitivity (Agehalf) for each group and eccentricity, we fit DATs to logistic growth curves. We obtained VA and SE for Preterm subjects and evaluated the course of threshold development at 10 degrees and 30 degrees for significant association with VA and SE predicted at age 10 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      DAT development at 10 degrees was significantly delayed in ROP (Mild and Severe); ROP did not significantly alter DAT development at 30 degrees. At age 10 years, among Preterm subjects, both VA and SE were significantly associated with group (None,Mild, and Severe). SE was predicted by the course of DAT development at 30 degrees. VA was not associated with the course of DAT development at 10 degrees.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At 10 degrees, ROP-whether mild or severe-is associated with significant delays in DAT development, evidence that the late-maturing central retina is vulnerable to ROP. The association of 30 degree threshold and myopia are evidence that more peripheral retina is important to refractive development."

            "abstract": "Smoking is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Smoking is heritable, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of smoking behaviors have identified hundreds of significant loci. Most GWAS-identified variants are noncoding with unknown neurobiological effects. We used genome-wide genotype, DNA methylation, and RNA sequencing data in postmortem human nucleus accumbens (NAc) to identify cis-methylation/expression quantitative trait loci (meQTLs/eQTLs), investigate variant-by-cigarette smoking interactions across the genome, and overlay QTL evidence at smoking GWAS-identified loci to evaluate their regulatory potential. Active smokers (N=52) and nonsmokers (N=171) were defined based on cotinine biomarker levels and next-of-kin reporting. We simultaneously tested variant and variant-by-smoking interaction effects on methylation and expression, separately, adjusting for biological and technical covariates and using a two-stage multiple testing approach with eigenMT and Bonferroni corrections. We found >2 million significant meQTL variants (padj<0.05) corresponding to 41,695 unique CpGs. Results were largely driven by main effects; five meQTLs, mapping to NUDT12, FAM53B, RNF39, and ADRA1B, showed a significant interaction with smoking. We found 57,683 significant eQTLs for 958 unique eGenes (padj<0.05) and no smoking interactions. Colocalization analyses identified loci with smoking-associated GWAS variants that overlapped meQTLs/eQTLs, suggesting that these heritable factors may influence smoking behaviors through functional effects on methylation/expression. One locus containing MUSTIN1 and ITIH4 colocalized across all data types (GWAS + meQTL + eQTL). In this first genome-wide meQTL map in the human NAc, the enriched overlap with smoking GWAS-identified genetic loci provides evidence that gene regulation in the brain helps explain the neurobiology of smoking behaviors."

Localised GPA of the nasal mucosa or persistent disease activity ('grumbling disease') is often encountered even under immunosuppressive therapy. Necessity for reconstructive surgery is common and careful scheduling to prevent failure and minimise revision rates is crucial. Therefore, reliable estimation of GPA activity in the upper airways using a score is mandatory for diagnosis, follow-up and scheduling reconstructive surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifty endoscopic, endonasal images of 45 patients with GPA were used. Twelve (4 German, 8 Mexican) experienced (n=7) and inexperienced (n=5) physicians assessed GPA-activity at two times (T1/T2) in dichotomy and in a grading approach (none, mild, moderate and high activity) using the novel ENT Activity Score (ENTAS).

In addition to traditional CVD risk factors, autoimmune conditions are increasingly being recognized as contributors to adverse CVD consequences in women. Chronic systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disorders can trigger premature and accelerated atherosclerosis, microvascular dysfunction, and thrombosis. The presence of comorbid conditions, duration of the autoimmune condition, disease severity, and treatment of underlying inflammation are all factors that impact CVD risk and progression. Early identification and screening of CVD risk factors in those with underlying autoimmune conditions may attenuate CVD in this population. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, disease modifying agents and biologics may influence CVD risk factors and overall risk.

A previously suggested expression for quantitative oxygen toxicity, DMG = a x t2 x PO2c (t-time, DMG-measured level of O2 toxicity), has been adapted for the all-or-none phenomenon: K = t2 x PO2c. A symptom may appear when K reaches a threshold value Kc. Non-linear regression was successfully applied to all-or-none symptoms from the literature: survival, convulsions, substernal distress, reduction in short circuit current and nerve conduction blockade. The generality of these expressions enabled calculation of cumulative oxygen toxicity and a search for the mechanism of oxygen toxicity. Cumulative oxygen toxicity is calculated in three-step calculation loops in three suggested exposure profiles. For a possible recovery period between exposures the expressions took the form: DMGt = DMGc x e-rt, and Kt = Kc x e-rt, where r is the recovery constant. A possibly bimodal distribution of c close to the values of 1 and 4 could be attributed to systemic effects."

We developed a customized training algorithm based on U-Net to digitalize the vasculature in the fundus images to quantify vascular density (area and fractal dimension), skeleton length, and number of bifurcation points. For statistical comparisons, this study divided participants into two groups. The amblyopic eyes and the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral amblyopia formed the paired group, while bilateral amblyopic patients and healthy controls formed the independent group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the paired group, the vascular area (P = 0.007), vascular fractal dimension (P = 0.007), and vascular skeleton length (P = 0.002) of the amblyopic eyes were significantly smaller than those of the fellow eyes. In the independent group, significant decreases in the vascular fractal dimension (P = 0.006) and skeleton length (P = 0.048) were observed in bilateral amblyopia compared to control.

The retinas, draining lymph nodes (DLNs), and spleens were analyzed. Isolated T cells were used for proliferation, differentiation, and function assays in vitro. Selective inhibitors and pathway agonists were used to study signaling pathways. The effect of APOA1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from uveitis patients was also examined.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Administration of APOA1 ameliorated EAU. APOA1 suppressed pathogenic CD4+ T cell expansion in DLNs and spleen, and decreased the infiltration of effector T (Teff) cells into retina. APOA1 also inhibited T cell proliferation and T helper 1 cell differentiation in vitro and promoted regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation. APOA1 restricted inflammatory cytokine production from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs. Mechanistic studies revealed that the effect of APOA1 was mediated by scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and downstream signals including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein kinase B (PKB, or Akt), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-κB.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      APOA1 ameliorates EAU by regulating the Teff/Treg partially through SR-BI.

            "abstract": "Background: Echocardiographic Pulmonary to Left Atrial Ratio (ePLAR) represents an accurate and sensitive non-invasive tool to estimate the trans-pulmonary gradient. The prognostic value of ePLAR in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of ePLAR on in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients admitted to two Italian institutions for COVID-19 undergoing early (<24 h) echocardiographic examination were included; ePLAR was determined from the maximum tricuspid regurgitation continuous wave Doppler velocity (m/s) divided by the transmitral E-wave: septal mitral annular Doppler Tissue Imaging e′-wave ratio (TRVmax/E:e′). The primary outcome measure was in-hospital death. Results: patients who died during hospitalization had at baseline a higher prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation, higher ePLAR, right-side pressures, lower Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)/ systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (sPAP) ratio and reduced inferior vena cava collapse than survivors. Patients with ePLAR > 0.28 m/s at baseline showed non-significant but markedly increased in-hospital mortality compared to those having ePLAR ≤ 0.28 m/s (27% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.055). Multivariate Cox regression showed that an ePLAR > 0.28 m/s was independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 5.07, 95% CI 1.04−24.50, p = 0.043), particularly when associated with increased sPAP (p for interaction = 0.043). Conclusions: A high ePLAR value at baseline predicts in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. These results support an early ePLAR assessment in patients admitted for COVID-19 to identify those at higher risk and potentially guide strategies of diagnosis and care."

The present study quantitatively assessed the performance of different visual stimulation approaches for mapping visual field coverage.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twelve patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were examined using high-resolution ultra-high field fMRI (Siemens Magnetom 7T) and microperimetry (MP; Nidek MP-3). The population receptive field (pRF)-based coverage maps obtained with two different stimulus techniques (moving bars, and rotating wedges and expanding rings) were compared with the results of MP. Correspondence between MP and pRF mapping was quantified by calculating the simple matching coefficient (SMC).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Stimulus choice is shown to bias the spatial distribution of pRF centers and eccentricity values with pRF sizes obtained from wedge/ring or bar stimulation showing systematic differences. Wedge/ring stimulation results show a higher number of pRF centers in foveal areas and strongly reduced pRF sizes compared to bar stimulation runs. A statistical comparison shows significantly higher pRF center numbers in the foveal 2.5 degrees region of the visual field for wedge/ring compared to bar stimuli. However, these differences do not significantly influence SMC values when compared to MP (bar <2.5 degrees: 0.88 ± 0.13; bar >2.5 degrees: 0.88 ± 0.11; wedge/ring <2.5 degrees: 0.89 ± 0.12 wedge/ring; >2.5 degrees: 0.86 ± 0.10) for the peripheral visual field.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Both visual stimulation designs examined can be applied successfully in patients with GA.

Isolated smooth muscle cells from guinea-pig taenia caecum were permeabilized by use of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store was depleted by exposure to 0.1 microM A23187. 2. Shortening of alpha-toxin-permeabilized single smooth muscle cells was induced by increasing free Ca2+ but was not induced by 0.2 microM free Ca2+. 3. Shortening of the permeabilized cells was caused by application of acetylcholine (ACh) with free Ca2+ concentration held at 0.2 microM. Permeabilized smooth muscle cells responded to 0.3 microM or 1 microM ACh with 0.2 microM Ca2+ with maximal shortening. The concentration-response relationship to ACh had a very steep slope and the cell shortening appeared to be an all-or-none response rather than a graded response, as was the shortening of intact cells to ACh. 4. The shortening of permeabilized cells was also induced by application of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) with 0.2 microM free Ca2+, showing an all-or-none response. The threshold concentration of GTP that induced an all-or-none response was between 10 microM and 30 microM. 5. These results suggest that Ca2+ sensitivity is augmented by stimulation of the muscarinic receptor or GTP-binding protein(s) in an all-or-none manner. It seems probable that this contributes to the all-or-none response to ACh in intact smooth muscle cells."

Unfortunately, few such models are available. Here, we report the lens phenotypes of aged mice lacking the critical antioxidant transcription factor Nfe2l2 (designated as Nrf2 -/-).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Three independent cohorts of Nrf2 -/- and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were evaluated for cataracts using combinations of slit lamp imaging, photography of freshly dissected lenses, and histology.

This study examines the effects of two reinforcing stimuli and four reinforcement schedules in maintaining sampling behavior in a virtual inspection task. Participants were asked to decide (yes or no) for each \"product\" whether it should be sampled for inspection. In Experiment 1, \"yes\" responses were reinforced with the message that defectives were found, once for every five times (FR), once for every one to nine (on average five) times (VR), only the first time (FTO), or never (None). The sampling behavior declined gradually in FR and VR and somewhat surprisingly more sharply in FTO than in None. In Experiment 2, the sampling behavior was effectively maintained when the participants were regularly provided with the evaluative feedback on their sampling behavior, although they were kept informed that defectives were not found. These results indicate the importance of utilizing reinforcing stimuli whose administration is independent of the outcome (e.g., defective or not) of the response (e.g., inspection) to be reinforced."

Time spent watching TV and time spent riding in a car were reported. Mortality data were ascertained through the National Death Index until December 31, 2003. Cox regression analysis quantified the association between sedentary behaviors (hours per week watching TV, hours per week riding in a car, and total hours per week in these two behaviors) and CVD mortality rates.\n## RESULTS\nThree hundred and seventy-seven CVD deaths occurred during 21 yr of follow-up. After age adjustment, time riding in a car and combined time spent in these two sedentary behaviors were positively (P(trend) < 0.001) associated with CVD death. Men who reported >10 h x wk(-1) riding in a car or >23 h x wk(-1) of combined sedentary behavior had 82% and 64% greater risk of dying from CVD than those who reported <4 or <11 h x wk(-1), respectively. The pattern of the association did not materially change after multivariate adjustment. Regardless of the amount of sedentary activity reported by these men, being older, having normal weight, being normotensive, and being physically active were associated with a reduced risk of CVD death.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn men, riding in a car and combined time spent in these two sedentary behaviors were significant CVD mortality predictors. In addition, high levels of physical activity were related to notably lower rates of CVD death even in the presence of high levels of sedentary behavior. Health promotion efforts targeting physically inactive men should emphasize both reducing sedentary activity and increasing regular physical activity for optimal cardiovascular health.\n"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the cariogenicity of four processed cheese formulations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Enamel demineralisation was measured intra-orally in bovine enamel, and aliquots of 10g of each test cheese were used to assess plaque pH using the plaque harvesting technique after the San Antonio criteria. In a second experiment, the same cheeses were assessed for their effects on enamel using the intra-oral cariogenicity test (ICT) with bovine enamel.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      None of the four cheeses caused pH drops below the critical pH and two of the cheeses raised the pH slightly.

Using this model, we performed ocular anterior chamber perfusion to reversibly elevate IOP over a range from 30 to 90 mm Hg while monitoring cortical activity with intrinsic signal optical imaging. Drifting random-dot fields and gratings were used to characterize cortical population responses to motion direction and orientation in early visual areas 17 and 18.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found that acute IOP elevations at 50 mm Hg and above, which is often observed in acute glaucoma, suppressed cortical motion direction responses. This suppression was more profound in area 17 than in area 18, and more profound in central than peripheral visual field (eccentricities 0°-4° vs. 4°-8°) within area 17.

Secondary image processing was applied to the angiographic videos to obtain posterior distribution maps of choroidal arteries and large veins. Differences between different distribution patterns regarding age, gender, eye laterality, and circulation time were compared. We also conducted a comparison of choroidal vascular distribution characteristics between patients with AMD and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and provided a summary of choroidal vascular distribution patterns in AMD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The filling patterns of choroidal arteries can be classified into the invisible trunk arteries type, the partially masked trunk arteries type, and the exposed trunk arteries type. The vascular topography of the large choroidal vein can be classified into the watershed type, the non-watershed type, and the unknown type, further divided into six subtypes. The distribution patterns of choroidal arteries and veins were significantly correlated with age (P < 0.001). Left eye, older age, and the exposed trunk arteries type were independent risk factors for non-watershed large choroidal vein (P < 0.05). The non-watershed type was the main characteristic of the venous phase in AMD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The distribution characteristics of the arterial and venous patterns in AMD suggest atrophy of the small blood vessels in the choroid and insufficient perfusion pressure of the blood flow."

Physical activity, screen time, and sleep (i.e., movement behaviors) are independently associated with mental health, but their combined effects are poorly understood, particularly in military populations. We analyzed data from active component service members in the national 2018 Health Related Behaviors Survey (N = 17,166). Weighted gender-stratified logistic regression models examined the associations of meeting recommended/healthy levels of moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), screen time, and sleep duration - separately and in combination (none, some, all) - with PTSD, suicide ideation, and serious psychological distress. In both men and women, meeting sleep recommendations was associated with reduced odds of each outcome. Meeting MVPA recommendations was associated with lower odds of serious psychological distress only in men (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58-1.00). No/low screen time was associated with lower odds of suicide ideation only in women (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.95).

This modification is a dynamic and reversible process that plays a crucial role in regulating various biological processes, including RNA stability, transport, translation, and degradation. Currently, there is a lack of research on the role of m6A modifications in maintaining the characteristics of RPE cells. m6A readers play a crucial role in executing the functions of m6A modifications, which prompted our investigation into their regulatory roles in the RPE.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Phagocytosis assays, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry experiments, β-galactosidase staining, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were conducted to assess the functional and cellular characteristics changes in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells following short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2). RNA-seq and ultraviolet crosslinking immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) were employed to identify the target genes regulated by IGF2BP2. adeno-associated virus (AAV) subretinal injection was performed in 6- to 8-week-old C57 mice to reduce IGF2BP2 expression in the RPE, and the impact of IGF2BP2 knockdown on mouse visual function was assessed using immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      IGF2BP2 was found to have a pronounced effect on RPE phagocytosis.

The aim of the study was to describe and classify the vascular abnormalities of the gastric wall as observed on echoendoscopy in cirrhotic patients and to compare the data with endoscopy.

The abnormalities of the gastric wall were classified into 3 grades: 0 (none), grade 1 (thickening and brilliance of the third hyperechogenic layer with or without fine internal anechogenic structures), grade 2 (visible vessels in the third layer which deform the entire wall, with penetrating varices). Endoscopy provides better visualization of esophageal varices than echoendoscopy but does not detect gastric varices and the first signs of portal hypertension as well.

Mechanically, N6-methyladenosine level of the IPW transcript regulated its stability with YTHDC1 as the reader. IPW mediated RPE features by suppressing MEG3 expression to sequester its inhibition on the AKT serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

We explored caregivers' willingness to assume treatment risk in exchange for reduced hyperphagia according to a PWS-validated observer-reported outcome measure. Methods. We partnered with PWS patient organizations to develop a discrete-choice experiment exploring caregivers' benefit-risk tradeoffs for emerging PWS treatments. The treatment benefit was a reduction in hyperphagia (as measured by a 0-, 5-, or 10-point change on the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [HQ-CT]). Treatment risks included weight gain (none, 5%, 10%), added risk of skin rash (none, 10%, 20%), and risk of liver damage (none, 1 in 1000, 10 in 1000). Preference models were estimated using mixed logistic regression and maximum acceptable risk. We explored differences in preferences across familial caregivers of patients with and without hyperphagia. Results. Four hundred sixty-eight caregivers completed the online survey. The majority of caregivers reported that patients experienced hyperphagia (68%) and half of patients experienced obesity (52%). Caregivers of patients without hyperphagia were willing to accept greater weight gain (16.4% v. 8.1%, P = 0.004) and a higher risk of skin rash (11.7% v. 6.2% P = 0.008) as compared to caregivers of patients with hyperphagia. Caregivers of patients with hyperphagia would accept a higher risk of liver damage as compared to caregivers of patients without hyperphagia (11.9 out of 1000 v. 6.4 out of 1000, P = 0.04). Conclusions. This research demonstrates that caregivers are willing to accept risk in exchange for a five-point improvement on the HQ-CT, a smaller marginal improvement than had been previously classified as meaningful. Patient experience with hyperphagia is a modifier in how much risk caregivers will accept."

            "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that women who participate in vigorous physical activity may have lower risk of breast cancer due to lower lifetime exposure to ovarian hormones. A population-based case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between leisure-time physical activity and risk of breast cancer among women aged 21 to 45 years. Cases were 747 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1983 and 1990 in three counties of western Washington state (United States), and were identified through the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Controls were 961 women selected from the same area by random-digit telephone dialing. Physical activity was assessed through personal interview, with questions on frequency and duration of each type of recreational activity during the two-year period immediately prior to reference data (date of diagnosis for cases and a comparable assigned date for controls) and between ages 12 and 21. For the two-year time period before diagnosis, there was no association with frequency of activity (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.93, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.71-1.22 for four or more episodes per week cf none), total hours spent in physical activity (age-adjusted OR = 0.92, CI = 0.71-1.22 for four or more hours per week cf none) or MET (metabolic equivalent energy expenditure unit) (age-adjusted OR = 0.95, CI = 0.73-1.23 for 18 or more METs per week of none), nor any trend is risk with increasing activity levels. Similarly, there was no association between leisure activity during adolescence and breast cancer risk. These results were not confounded further by body mass index (wt/ht2), age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, parity, family history of breast cancer, or other measured health behaviors. Our findings do not support a protective effect of leisure-time physical activity either in the adolescent years or in adulthood on breast cancer in young women."

The identification of target-specific interventions that confer radiomitigating activity is an unmet challenge. Here we identify the thrombomodulin (Thbd)-activated protein C (aPC) pathway as a new mechanism for the mitigation of total body irradiation (TBI)-induced mortality. Although the effects of the endogenous Thbd-aPC pathway were largely confined to the local microenvironment of Thbd-expressing cells, systemic administration of soluble Thbd or aPC could reproduce and augment the radioprotective effect of the endogenous Thbd-aPC pathway. Therapeutic administration of recombinant, soluble Thbd or aPC to lethally irradiated wild-type mice resulted in an accelerated recovery of hematopoietic progenitor activity in bone marrow and a mitigation of lethal TBI. Starting infusion of aPC as late as 24 h after exposure to radiation was sufficient to mitigate radiation-induced mortality in these mice. These findings suggest that pharmacologic augmentation of the activity of the Thbd-aPC pathway by recombinant Thbd or aPC might offer a rational approach to the mitigation of tissue injury and lethality caused by ionizing radiation."

A comparative analysis of the in-house data and literature review suggested several characteristics: (1) a higher proportion of cysteine involvement variants in FBN1, either variants introducing or eliminating cysteine, and an earlier diagnosis age were presented in our cohort than in published literature; (2) the axial length (AL) and refractive error increased more rapidly with age in preschool EL children than normal children, and the increased rate of AL was slower in patients with surgery than those without surgery; (3) aberrant astigmatism was common in EL; and (4) worse vision and earlier onset age were observed in patients with non-FBN1 variants (all P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Variants in FBN1 are the predominant cause of EL, with the most common cysteine involvement variants. Early-stage EL manifests refractive error but gradually converts to axial myopia through defocus introduced by lens dislocation. Aberrant astigmatism is a suggestive sign of EL. Non-FBN1 variants cause early-onset and severe phenotypes. These results provide evidence for early diagnosis as well as timely treatment for EL."

            "abstract": "We report a single-vesicle approach to compare the all-or-none and graded mechanisms of lipid bilayer permeabilization by CpreTM and NpreTM, two peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region of the HIV fusion glycoprotein gp41 subunit. According to bulk requenching assays, these peptides permeabilize large unilamellar vesicles via all-or-none and graded mechanisms, respectively. Visualization of the process using giant unilamellar vesicles shows that the permeabilization of individual liposomes by these two peptides differs in kinetics, degree of dye filling, and stability of the permeabilized state. All-or-none permeabilization by CpreTM is characterized by fast and total filling of the individual vesicles. This process is usually accompanied by the formation of stably open pores, as judged from the capacity of the vesicles to incorporate a second dye added after several hours. In contrast, graded permeabilization by NpreTM is transient and exhibits slower kinetics, which leads to partial filling of the individual liposomes. Of importance, quantitative analysis of vesicle population distribution allowed the identification of mixed mechanisms of membrane permeabilization and the assessment of cholesterol effects. Specifically, the presence of this viral envelope lipid increased the stability of the permeating structures, which may have implications for the fusogenic activity of gp41."

To clarify the roles of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in the all-or-none response of isolated smooth muscle cells from guinea-pig taenia caecum to ACh, we examined the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-induced contractile response in Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle cells and the effect of depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores on the all-or-none response to ACh in intact smooth muscle cells. 3. alpha-Toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle cells responded to 3-30 nmol/L or 0.3-3 nmol/L IP(3) in the presence of 0.2 micromol/L Ca(2+) with 1 mmol/L EGTA or 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, respectively, in an all-or-none manner. These results suggest that Ca(2+) release induced by IP(3) is Ca(2+) dependent and is evoked in an all-or-none manner. 4. In the presence of the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 (0.1 micromol/L) or the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (1 micromol/L), the shortening of intact smooth muscle cells induced by increasing concentrations of ACh showed a graded response, but not an all-or-none response. 5.

            "abstract": "The role of Notch signaling in cervical cancer is seemingly controversial. To confirm the function of Notch signaling in this type of cancer, we established a stable Notch1-activated cervical cancer HeLa cell line. We found that Notch1 activation resulted in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and tumor suppression. At the molecular level, we found that a variety of genes associated with cyclic AMP, G protein-coupled receptor, and cancer signaling pathways contributed to Notch1-mediated tumor suppression. We observed that the expression of somatostatin (SST) was dramatically induced by Notch1 signaling activation, which was accompanied by enhanced expression of the cognate SST receptor subtype 1 (SSTR1) and SSTR2. Certain genes, such as tumor protein 63 (TP63, p63), were upregulated, whereas others, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), Myc, Akt, and STAT3, were downregulated. Subsequently, knockdown of Notch1-induced SST reversed Notch1-induced decrease of BCL-2 and increase of p63, indicating that Notch1-induced tumor suppression may be partly through upregulating SST signaling. Our findings support a possible crosstalk between Notch signaling and SST signaling. Moreover, Notch-induced SSTR activation could enhance SSTR-targeted cancer chemotherapy. Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, suppressed cell growth and upregulated the expression of Notch1 and SSTR2. A combination therapy with VPA and the SSTR2-targeting cytotoxic conjugate CPT-SST strongly led to greater suppression, as compared to each alone. Our findings thus provide us with a promising clinical opportunity for enhanced cancer therapy using combinations of Notch1-activating agents and SSTR2-targeting agents."

The covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status, diabetes, hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95% CI: 1.33 to 3.96) for participants engaging in ≥4 h/day of screen time relative to <2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause mortality: HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably. Approximately 25% of the association between screen time and CVD events was explained collectively by C-reactive protein, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nRecreational sitting, as reflected by television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality and CVD risk regardless of physical activity participation. Inflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this relationship.\n"

Biochemical characterizations included the measurements of the rates of endogenous, substrate-dependent respirations, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and generation of reactive oxygen species using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from five affected matrilineal relatives of these families and three control subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ten of 41 matrilineal relatives exhibited variable severity and age at onset of optic neuropathy. The average age at onset of optic neuropathy in matrilineal relatives of the three families was 5, 11, and 24 years, respectively. Molecular analysis identified the ND1 T3866C (I187T) mutation and distinct sets of polymorphisms belonging to the Eastern Asian haplogroups D4a, M10a, and R, respectively. The I187T mutation is localized at the highly conserved isoleucine at a transmembrane domain of the ND1 polypeptide. The marked reductions in the rate of endogenous, malate/glutamate-promoted and succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate-promoted respiration were observed in mutant cell lines carrying the T3866C mutation. The deficient respiration is responsible for the reduced ATP synthesis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our data convincingly show that the ND1 T3866C mutation leads to LHON. This mutation may be insufficient to produce a clinical phenotype. Other modifier factors may contribute to the phenotypic manifestation of the T3866C mutation. The T3866C mutation should be added to the list of inherited factors for molecular diagnosis of LHON. Thus, our findings may provide new insights into the understanding of pathophysiology and valuable information on the management of LHON."

            "abstract": "Isolated smooth muscle cells from guinea pig taenia caecum were prepared by collagenase digestion. Isolated single smooth muscle cells showed an all-or-none response to acetylcholine (ACh) under our experimental conditions. A Scatchard plot of the specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to the cells gave a straight line, and the KD and Bmax values were calculated as 0.18 +/- 0.03 nM and 1.11 +/- 0.10 pmol/mg protein, respectively. ACh competitively inhibited the specific binding of [3H]QNB in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, although the cells showed an all-or-none response, ACh bound to the receptor concentration dependently. The contraction of the cells in response to ACh was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, by nicardipine suggesting that the contraction of smooth muscle cells in response to ACh depended on the influx of extracellular Ca2+. The ACh-stimulated increase of the Ca2+ influx was very rapid and correlated well with the contraction of the cells; it decreased after reaching a maximum. The all-or-none response of the cells could be due to a rapid influx of Ca2+. These results suggest that ACh binds to its receptor in a concentration-dependent manner, and that when the binding reaches a certain threshold, a rapid influx of Ca2+ occurs and the cells show an all-or-none response, followed by an efflux of Ca2+."

            "abstract": "The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a three-tiered phosphorylation cascade that is ubiquitously expressed among eukaryotic cells. Its primary function is to propagate signals from cell surface receptors to various cytosolic and nuclear targets. Recent studies have demonstrated that the MAPK cascade exhibits an all-or-none response to graded stimuli. This study quantitatively investigates MAPK activation in Xenopus oocytes using both empirical and biologically-based mechanistic models. Empirical models can represent overall tissue MAPK activation in the oocytes. However, these models lack description of key biological processes and therefore give no insight into whether the cellular response occurs in a graded or all-or-none fashion. To examine the propagation of cellular MAPK all-or-none activation to overall tissue response, mechanistic models in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations are employed. An adequate description of the dose response relationship of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocytes is achieved. Furthermore, application of these mechanistic models revealed that the initial receptor-ligand binding rate contributes to the cells' ability to exhibit an all-or-none MAPK activation response, while downstream activation parameters contribute more to the magnitude of activation. These mechanistic models enable us to identify key biological events which quantitatively impact the shape of the dose response curve, especially at low environmentally relevant doses."

The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that: in the peri-operative/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately post-extubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery."

Fourteen OCTA metrics were compared within and between the programs, and agreement was measured by Pearson's R coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Correlation was highest between all Heidelberg metrics and Fractalyse (all >0.84), and lowest between Matlab skeletonized or foveal avascular zone metrics and all other measures (e.g., skeletal fractal dimension and vessel density at -0.02). Agreement between eyes was moderate to excellent in all metrics (0.60-0.90).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The significant variability between metrics and programs used for OCTA analysis demonstrates that they are not interchangeable and supports a recommendation for perfusion density metrics to be reported as standard.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      Agreement between different OCTA analyses is variable and not interchangeable. The high agreement between non-skeletonized vessel density metrics suggests that these should be routinely reported."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an acquired degenerative disease of the retina classified into early, intermediate, and advanced AMD. A key factor in the pathogenesis of AMD is the complement system. The interaction of age and sex with the complement system may affect the risk of developing AMD. The purpose of this study was to determine if there were sex-specific differences in levels of complement factors among patients with the intermediate phenotype of AMD (iAMD) and explore the correlation between age and complement proteins.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied complement factors in patients with iAMD and controls without AMD. Nonparametric, rank-based linear regressions including a sex by AMD interaction were used to compare levels for each analyte. Correlations between age and complement proteins were evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found significantly higher levels of factor B and factor I in females compared with males with iAMD, whereas no differences were seen in complement levels in male and female controls. The ratios of Ba/factor B, C3a/C3, C4b/C4, and C5a/C5 were not different in males and females with iAMD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We demonstrate disparities in a subset of systemic complement factors between females and males with iAMD, but apparent complement turnover as measured by ratios of activation fragments to intact molecules was not different between these groups. The results suggest that complement system levels, including complement regulator factor I, exhibits sex-related differences in patients with iAMD and highlights that stratification by sex might be helpful in the interpretation of clinical trials of anticomplement therapy."

            "abstract": "Most isolated smooth muscle cells from guinea pig taenia caecum responded repeatedly, showing an all-or-none response to acetylcholine (ACh). However, the average responses of all the cells were graded owing to the difference in the threshold concentration of ACh, like that of whole tissue. The sensitivity of the muscarinic receptor on individual cells was the same as that of whole tissue and ACh bound to the receptor concentration-dependently. The shortening of the cells in response to ACh depended upon the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through the Ca channel. 45Ca2+ influx stimulated by ACh was very sharp and highly correlated with the shortening of the cells. The shortening of alpha-toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle cells was induced by increasing free Ca2+. The concentration-response relationship to free Ca2+ had a very steep slope, and the shortening appeared to be an all-or-none response rather than a graded response. In conclusion, it is suggested that isolated smooth muscle cells show an all-or-none response as a result of a slight increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ level over the threshold concentration when early signalling coupled to ACh-receptor stimulation reaches the threshold to evoke Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release."

The severity of myopia was determined by measurements of visual acuity (<5.0) and noncycloplegic refraction (spherical equivalent <-0.50 diopters). Twenty-three myopia-influencing factors were divided into three categories: eye-use habits, lifestyle, and family and subjective factors. Responses to each of these 23 factors were labeled as either positive or negative options and then combined to generate a comprehensive score.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Boys and girls were equally represented (50%) and had the same average age (11.5 years) at each wave.

Each of the 23 factors was associated with myopia prevalence but had no significant effect on myopia incidence or progression. However, these 23 factors had a cumulative effect on myopia risks; higher scores were associated with more positive factors and lower risk ratios of myopia and vice versa.

We carried out MYCN expression, cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, soft agar colony formation, and transwell assays to examine the role of MYCNOS1 in MYCN and cell behaviors.

We aimed to improve large scale extraction of labels by comparing three methods for negation detection in Dutch clinical notes. We used the Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus to compare a rule-based method based on ContextD, a biLSTM model using MedCAT and (finetuned) RoBERTa-based models. We found that both the biLSTM and RoBERTa models consistently outperform the rule-based model in terms of F1 score, precision and recall. In addition, we systematically categorized the classification errors for each model, which can be used to further improve model performance in particular applications. Combining the three models naively was not beneficial in terms of performance. We conclude that the biLSTM and RoBERTa-based models in particular are highly accurate accurate in detecting clinical negations, but that ultimately all three approaches can be viable depending on the use case at hand."

In contrast to younger patients, the relative survival did not improve significantly over time for elderly patients. With increasing age, the observed-expected death ratio decreased to almost 1.0.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Survival for elderly patients with breast cancer did not improve significantly. Observed-expected death ratios in the elderly are close to 1, indicating that excess mortality is low. Elderly patients with breast cancer have a higher risk for overtreatment and undertreatment, with a delicate therapeutic balance between breast cancer survival gain and potential toxicities. To improve breast cancer survival in the elderly, a critical reappraisal is needed of costs and benefits of hormonal as well as other treatments, and better selection of patients who can benefit from available therapies is warranted."

Precision medicine is a new trend all over the world and identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is a step forward towards this trend. In this context, multi-omics data and integrated analysis are being investigated to develop personalized medicine in the management of colorectal cancer. Given the large amount of data from multi-omics approach, data integration and analysis is a great challenge. In this Review, we summarize how statistical and machine learning techniques are applied to analyze multi-omics data and how it contributes to the discovery of useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Moreover, we discuss the importance of these biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the clinical management of colorectal cancer in the future. Taken together, integrated analysis of multi-omics data has great potential for finding novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, however, there are still challenges to overcome in future studies."

This is precisely the behaviour predicted by thermodynamics for first order phase transitions ('all-or-none' transitions) in small systems. It follows that N-->U, N-->MG and MG-->U transitions in proteins are all of the 'all-or-none' type. Thus the molten globule state of protein molecules is separated by an 'all-or-none' transition both from the native and the unfolded state, i.e. the molten globule state is a third thermodynamic state of protein molecules in addition to the two previously established states--the native and the unfolded."

We report the use of absorbable sutures for the closure of sternotomy. Three figure of 8 ligations were made. Cranial side suture was placed through the sternal manubrium. Other sutures were placed through the intercostal spaces.Sutures were tied 6 or 7 times. Braided #2 polyglactin suture were used in a consecutive 150 patients. Looped (double) #1 monofilament polyglyconate sutures were used in a subsequent 150 patients. Both sutures with blunt needle are commercially available. None of the patients in either group required re-exploration of the sternum for bleeding and tamponade, and none developed wound infections or mediastinitis. Five patients in the polyglactin group developed seroma and/or instability of the sternum after more than 2 postoperative weeks, but none required surgical refixation of the sternum. These 5 patients had diabetes, chronic renal failure, autoimmune disease and/or chronic lung diseases. None of the patients in the polyglyconate group developed any trouble in their sternum.

Because of this it is essential in cases of inflammatory colic disorders to analyse critically these different elements before affirming the diagnosis that is often arrived at too easily.

ECD may be acquired, continue over time, or be relinquished. They thus may represent acute stress (immediate, severe) or chronic stress (persistent, milder). Workers at six U.S. manufacturing companies completed surveys (N = 520). ECD were operationalized as providing assistance to an adult aged 65+ years due to disability or illness. Workers were categorized into four ECD groups (persistent, relinquished, acquired, and none), and we examined the ECD groups' association with person-centric and work-centric outcomes. Respondents with acquired ECD had worse mental health and greater depressive symptoms than those with none, and those with persistent ECD had greater work stress and family-work conflict than those with none. Findings suggesting that acute stress is more related to person-centric outcomes and chronic stress is more related to work-centric outcomes could inform development of tailored interventions."

            "abstract": "The study of the human microbiome in oncology is a growing and rapidly evolving field. In the past few years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies investigating associations of microbiome and cancer, from oncogenesis and cancer progression to resistance or sensitivity to specific anticancer therapies. The gut microbiome is now known to play a significant role in antitumor immune responses and in predicting the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients. Beyond the gut, the tumor-associated microbiome-microbe communities located either in the tumor or within its body compartment-seems to interact with the local microenvironment and the tumor immune contexture, ultimately impacting cancer progression and treatment outcome. However, pre-clinical research focusing on causality and mechanistic pathways as well as proof-of-concept studies are still needed to fully understand the potential clinical utility of microbiome in cancer patients. Moreover, there is a need for the standardization of methodology and the implementation of quality control across microbiome studies to allow for a better interpretation and greater comparability of the results reported between them. This review summarizes the accumulating evidence in the field and discusses the current and upcoming challenges of microbiome studies."

We reported previously that a nonsense mutation in the centrosome-associated protein CEP250 gene (encoding C-Nap1) causes atypical USH in patients of Iranian Jewish origin. To better characterize CEP250, we aimed to generate and study a knockout (KO) mouse model for Cep250.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Mice heterozygous for a \"knockout-first\" Cep250 construct were generated and bred with Cre recombinase mice to generate the null allele and produce homozygous Cep250 KO mice. Retinal function was evaluated by full-field electroretinography (ffERG) at variable ages, and retinal structure changes were examined using histological analysis. Hearing thresholds were detected using auditory brainstem response (ABR) at the age of 20 months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Cep250 KO mouse model was generated by activating a construct harboring a deletion of exons 6 and 7. At 6 months, the ffERG was normal, but it decreased gradually with age. For both photopic and scotopic ffERG responses, very low amplitudes were evident at 20 months. Histological analysis confirmed late-onset retinal degeneration. ABR tests illustrated that hearing threshold significantly increased at the age of 20 months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although most USH animal models have normal retinal function and structure, the Cep250 KO mouse model shows both retinal degeneration and hearing loss with a relatively late age of onset.

There is no question that RDN lowers blood pressure (BP), it does so to an extent at best corresponding to one antihypertensive drug. The procedure has an excellent safety record. However, it remains clinically impossible to predict whose BP responds to RDN and whose does not. Long-term efficacy data on BP reduction are still unconvincing despite the recent results in the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED trial; experimental studies indicate that reinnervation is occurring after RDN. Although BP is an acceptable surrogate endpoint, there is complete lack of outcome data with RDN. Clear indications for RDN are lacking although patients with resistant hypertension, those with documented increase in activity of the sympathetic system and perhaps those who desire to take fewest medication may be considered."

In an effort to ensure optimal, uniform, and reliable community-based KRAS testing throughout Europe, a KRAS external quality assessment (EQA) scheme was set up. The first large assessment round included 59 laboratories from eight different European countries. For each country, one regional scheme organizer prepared and distributed the samples for the participants of their own country. The samples included unstained sections of 10 invasive colorectal carcinomas with known KRAS mutation status. The samples were centrally validated by one of two reference laboratories. The laboratories were allowed to use their own preferred method for histological evaluation, DNA isolation, and mutation analysis. In this study, we analyze the setup of the KRAS scheme. We analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the regional scheme organization by analyzing the outcome of genotyping results, analysis of tumor percentage, and written reports. We conclude that only 70% of laboratories correctly identified the KRAS mutational status in all samples. Both the false-positive and false-negative results observed negatively affect patient care. Reports of the KRAS test results often lacked essential information. We aim to further expand this program to more laboratories to provide a robust estimate of the quality of KRAS testing in Europe, and provide the basis for remedial measures and harmonization."

The anterior segment parameters, including central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), angle opening distance (AOD), angle recess area (ARA), trabecular iris space area (TISA), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle to angle width (ATA), and anterior chamber volume (ACV), were obtained using SS-ASOCT at baseline and 30 minutes after mydriasis. Regression analyses were performed to identify the factors related to the relative change of AOD500 (ΔAOD500).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 938 patients (938 eyes) were included. The AOD500 decreased from 0.46 ± 0.22 mm to 0.40 ± 0.19 mm, with percent ΔAOD500 of -13.59% ± 37.73% (P = 0.005). The patients with high myopia had a smaller reduction of anterior angle parameters, with a percent ΔAOD500 of -22.74% ± 58.09%% in non-high myopic eyes and -0.84% ± 45.47% in high myopic eyes (P < 0.001). The stepwise multivariate regression demonstrated that the smaller reduction of AOD500 were independently associated with younger age (coefficient = -2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.59 to -1.64, P < 0.001), presence of high myopia (coefficient = 15.35, 95% CI = 3.63 to 27.07, P = 0.010), greater baseline TISA500 (coefficient = 60.78, 95% CI = 8.75 to 112.82, P = 0.022), and ATA (coefficient = 11.21, 95% CI = 4.53 to 17.89, P = 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The anterior chamber angle decreased after pharmacologic mydriasis in these patients with cataract. Angle shallowing after pharmacologic mydriasis was significantly less pronounced in high myopic eyes than in non-high myopic eyes.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      These findings are informative for the relative less risk of angle-closure glaucoma in highly myopic eyes."

Records were reviewed for age at symptom onset, visual acuity, full-field ERG, fundus colour photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and SD-OCT. Images were graded into six phenotypes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median age at symptom onset was 40 years (range, 4-78 years).

Symptom onset was earlier in retinitis pigmentosa as compared with pseudo-Stargardt pattern dystrophy (34 vs 44 years; P = 0.004). The median visual acuity was 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range, 0-0.54 logMAR) and 0.18 logMAR (interquartile range 0-0.42 logMAR) in the right and left eyes, respectively. ERG showed a significantly reduced amplitude across all components (P < 0.001) and a peak time delay in the light-adapted 30-Hz flicker and single-flash b-wave (P < 0.001). Twenty-two variants were novel. The central areolar choroidal dystrophy phenotype was associated with 13 missense variants.

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are changing all areas of research and have a variety of capabilities of analysis in ophthalmology, specifically in visual fields (VFs) to detect or predict vision loss progression. Whereas most of the AI algorithms are implemented in Python language, which offers numerous open-source functions and algorithms, the majority of algorithms in VF analysis are offered in the R language. This paper introduces PyVisualFields, a developed package to address this gap and make available VF analysis in the Python language.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For the first version, the R libraries for VF analysis provided by vfprogression and visualFields packages are analyzed to define the overlaps and distinct functions. Then, we defined and translated this functionality into Python with the help of the wrapper library rpy2. Besides maintaining, the subsequent versions' milestones are established, and the third version will be R-independent.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The developed Python package is available as open-source software via the GitHub repository and is ready to be installed from PyPI. Several Jupyter notebooks are prepared to demonstrate and describe the capabilities of the PyVisualFields package in the categories of data presentation, normalization and deviation analysis, plotting, scoring, and progression analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We developed a Python package and demonstrated its functionality for VF analysis and facilitating ophthalmic research in VF statistical analysis, illustration, and progression prediction.\n    \n\n\n          Translational relevance:\n        \n      \n      Using this software package, researchers working on VF analysis can more quickly create algorithms for clinical applications using cutting-edge AI techniques."

The adherence rate was 95.7% (95% CI: 78.1-99.9; n = 23 because 3 patients progressed in the first 12 months of treatment). Up to month 6 post-treatment, QoL and fatigue remained stable (EORTC QLQC30 and BN20, MFI-20); some specific symptoms were transitory. Both subjective (FACT-Cog) and objective (Z-scores of neurocognitive tests) neurocognitive outcomes remained stable or tended to improve.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe aim of the present study was to examine whether the amount of time spent watching television is a potential risk factor for incident diabetes and to what extent this association may be explained by obesity.\n## METHODS\nWe used data for 23,855 men and women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam Study. During an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants developed diabetes. Incident diabetes was identified on the basis of self-report and was verified by contacting the patient's attending physician. The amount of time spent watching television was self-reported.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean time that the participants who developed diabetes watched television was 2.4 h/week, compared with 2.0 h/week for those who did not develop diabetes (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, educational status, smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, physical activity, the intake of various foods, and systolic blood pressure, the adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes among participants who watched ≥4 h/day of television compared with those who watched <1 h/day was 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.27]. After additional adjustment for waist circumference and body mass index, the hazard ratio was reduced to 1.14 (95% CI: 0.81-1.61).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn the present study, the amount of time spent watching television was an independent predictor of incident diabetes only in models that adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and systolic blood pressure. The attenuation of the association after adjusting for anthropometric measures may represent an explanatory mechanism for our findings.\n"

Although interlingual identification exerts a powerful influence on L2 pronunciation, it is still poorly understood. Orthographic classification was used here to assess the interlingual identification of Spanish and English vowels. Sixty native speakers of Spanish in three experiments judged the vowels /i/, /I/, /e/, and /ae/ in multiple tokens of English words (\"beat\", \"bit\", \"bet\", \"bat\") spoken by ten native speakers of American English. The subjects labelled each English vowel by circling one of the five letters used to spell the vowel phonemes of Spanish (viz. less than i greater than, less than e greater than, less than a greater than, less than o greater than, less than u greater than) or by circling \"none\" if they thought they had heard a vowel not found in Spanish. Subjects who spoke English as an L2 used the \"none\" label more often than did Spanish monolinguals, suggesting that L2 learning heightens bilinguals' awareness of cross-language phonetic differences. Experienced Spanish speakers of English did use the \"none\" label more often than did inexperienced subjects (42% vs. 18%). A few subjects used the \"none\" label consistently for /ae/ and /I/, suggesting that they may have regarded these vowels as \"new\" (i.e., non-Spanish). However, the group data provided little support for the hypothesis that the adult Spanish learners of English treated either /ae/ or /I/ as new. The great majority of subjects, even those highly experienced in English, identified English /ae/ with their Spanish /a/."

We studied orbital and systemic exposure of topotecan in the swine model after ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) and intravenous (IV) delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Landrace pigs (n = 3) underwent 30-minute OAC of topotecan (4 mg), and samples were serially obtained from the femoral artery and from a microdialysis probe inserted into the lateral rectus muscle sheath of the infused eye as a surrogate of the orbital irrigation. Animals were recovered, and, after a wash-out period, plasma and microdialysate samples from the contralateral eye were collected after a 30-minute IV infusion of topotecan (4 mg). Samples were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using MonolixSuite.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After OAC, median topotecan exposure in the orbit was 5624 ng × h/mL (range 3922-12531) compared to 23 ng × h/mL (range 18-75) after IV infusion. Thus, topotecan exposure in the orbit was 218-fold (range 75-540) higher after OAC than after IV infusion despite comparable systemic exposure (AUCpl) between routes (AUCpl, OAC: 141 ng × h/mL [127-191] versus AUCpl, IV: 139 ng × h/mL [126-186]). OAC was more selective to target the orbit because the median (range) orbital-to-plasma exposure ratio was 44 (28-65) after OAC compared to 0.18 (0.13-0.40) after IV infusion.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      OAC of topotecan resulted in higher orbital exposure than after IV infusion and was a more selective route for local drug delivery. Patients with orbital retinoblastoma may benefit from a multimodal treatment strategy including OAC therapy."

Histamine was administered intravitreously, and CNV volume was measured. Laser photocoagulation and intravitreous injection of HRH4 antagonist JNJ7777120 were performed after intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposome, which depletes circulating monocyte-derived macrophages; CNV volume was compared with that in mice injected with control (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]/PBS). Three days after laser-CNV, the F4/80+CD11b+ macrophage population in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid complex was quantified with flow cytometry in wild-type and Hrh4-/- mice. The long-acting HRH4 antagonist JNJ28307474 was then administrated periorally, and the laser-CNV volume was compared with controls.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Intravitreous injection of histamine did not affect laser-CNV volume. The laser-CNV from the eye injected with JNJ7777120 was equivalent to that injected with the DMSO/PBS in mice that had intraperitoneally received clodronate liposome. Flow cytometry after laser-CNV induction revealed a smaller F4/80+CD11b+ macrophage population in the RPE/choroid complex of Hrh4-/- mice than in wild-type mice.

A stratified sample of 463 patients admitted during 1997, 2000 and 2003, was studied.

Significant predictors of amputation identified by the logistic regression analysis were ''type of lesion'' (none; neuro-infectious; ischemic; mixture), ''initial diagnosis'' (phlebolymphopathies, acute arterial insufficiency, chronic arterial insufficiency, diabetic foot, others), ''plantar region lesion'' (no; yes), ''diabetes'' (no; yes), ''number of toes affected'' (none; 1-2; 3 or more), and ''area of leg affected'' (none; lower third; + lower third). More than 80% of patients were correctly classified with the final model: sensitivity was 42% and specificity 96%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It seems that SMLA in patients with vascular diagnoses can be predicted reasonably well using as predictors only clinical variables measured on admission. This is a potentially useful result for Angiology Services located in developing/poor communities. The amputation probability for each patient obtained from the logistic regression model can be used in several ways: 1) the medical care of patients can be customized so that the amputation rate of the whole Service can be reduced, and 2) the amputation probability of the statistical model can be used as an estimation of the severity of the disease in each patient, which in turn can be used to standardize the amputation rates computed on different years; this would allow a better assessment of the Institutional performance over time."

Our group has demonstrated that screening with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is a quick, sensitive, and accurate means to diagnose and monitor the serum of patients with plasma cell disorders. Microflow liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole TOF MS adds further sensitivity. We identified 33 patients with AL amyloidosis who achieved amyloid complete hematologic response, who also had negative bone marrow by six-color flow cytometry, and who had paired serum samples to test by MS. These samples were subjected to blood MS. Four patients (12%) were found to have residual disease by these techniques. The presence of residual disease by MS was associated with a poorer time to progression (at 50 months 75% versus 13%, p = 0.003). MS of the blood out-performed serum and urine immunofixation, the serum immunoglobulin free light chain, and six-color flow cytometry of the bone marrow in detecting residual disease.

The primary aims of this study were to determine SCP content and format, as well as to assess the preferred timing of SCP provision following HSCT. HSCT survivors and nontransplantation clinicians (oncologists and primary care physicians) were invited to participate in a survey evaluating the usefulness and utility of a sample HSCT-specific SCP with a treatment summary generated by autopopulation from an electronic health record (EHR). All participating HSCT survivors (n = 29) and clinicians (n = 18) indicated a desire to receive an SCP. More than 85% of the participants perceived information about treatments received, recommended follow-up and health maintenance including vaccinations, survivor and clinician resources, and graft-versus-host disease and other late/chronic side effects to be useful. The majority of survivors also believed that care team contact information was useful. In addition, >85% of survivors and clinicians agreed that the SCP increased their understanding of treatments and chronic/late side effects, improved health care provided, and were satisfied with the SCP and found it understandable and easy to use. The majority of survivors indicated that additional information should be added to the SCP, whereas some clinicians deemed the SCP too long. Survivors preferred to receive the SCP as a paper document at the end of a regular follow-up visit and review it with a cancer clinician, whereas clinicians preferred to receive the SCP through the EHR. These findings will help improve the design of future SCPs for use by HSCT survivors and clinicians.

In stark contrast to the effective trials that have been conducted in other neurological diseases, nearly 30 studies of interventions employed during acute hospital care for TBI have failed to identify treatments that improve outcome. Many factors may confound the ability to detect true and meaningful treatment effects. One promising area for improving the precision of intervention studies is to optimize the validity of the outcome assessment battery by using well-designed tools and data collection strategies to reduce variability in the outcome data. The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study, conducted at 18 sites across the United States, implemented a multidimensional outcome assessment battery with 22 measures aimed at characterizing TBI outcome up to 1 year postinjury. In parallel, through the TBI Endpoints Development (TED) Initiative, federal agencies and investigators have partnered to identify the most valid, reliable, and sensitive outcome assessments for TBI. Here, we present lessons learned from the TRACK-TBI and TED initiatives aimed at optimizing the validity of outcome assessment in TBI."

Patients were grouped into five AMD stages: early AMD, intermediate AMD, central geographic atrophy, active choroidal neovascularization or inactive choroidal neovascularization. Differences in complement activation, as defined by the systemic C3d/C3 ratio, between AMD stages were evaluated using general linear modeling. In addition, we evaluated the influence of 18 genetic AMD polymorphisms in complement genes and their effect on complement activation.

Previously, we identified ubiquitin-protein ligase E3D (UBE3D) as an AMD-associated protein for East Asian populations, and here we further demonstrate that UBE3D could be associated with DNA damage response.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The established I-SceI-inducible GFP reporter system was used to explore the effect of UBE3D on homologous recombination.

Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assays were used to investigate the function of UBE3D on heterochromatin de-condensation upon DNA damage. An aged mouse model of blue light-induced eye damage was constructed, and electroretinography (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to compare the differences between wild-type and UBE3D+/- mice.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      First, we show that GFP-UBE3D is recruited to damage sites by PCNA, through a PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box. Furthermore, UBE3D interacts with KAP1 via R377R378 and oxidation of the AMD-associated V379M mutation abolishes KAP1-UBE3D binding. By MNase assays, UBE3D depletion reduces the chromatin relaxation levels upon DNA damage. In addition, UBE3D depletion renders less KAP1 recruitment. Compared with wild type, blue light induces less damage in UBE3D+/- mice as measured by ERG and OCT, consistent with our biochemical results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Hence, we propose that one potential mechanism that UBE3D-V379M contributes to AMD pathogenesis might be via defective DNA damage repair linked with oxidative stress and our results offered a potential direction for the treatment of AMD."

This study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2007. Negative UA was defined as urine white blood cell count less than 5 per high-power field, negative leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites. Urine cultures were classified into E. coli and non-E. coli groups. These groups were compared for sex, race, and UA findings. Multivariate forward logistic regression, using the Wald test, was performed to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of each variable (eg, sex, race, UA parameters) in predicting UTI. In addition, antibiotic sensitivities between both groups were compared.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 749 medical records reviewed, 608 were included; negative UA(-) was present in 183 cases, and positive UA(+) was observed in 425 cases. Furthermore, 424 cases were caused by E. coli, and 184 were due to non-E. coli organisms. Among 425 UA(+) cases, E. coli was identified in 349 (82.1%), whereas non-E. coli organisms were present in 76 (17.9%); in contrast, in 183 UA(-) cases, 108 (59%) were due to non-E. coli organisms versus 75 (41%), which were caused by E. coli. Urinalysis results were shown to be associated with organism group (P < 0.001). Positive leukocytes esterase had an LR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.2), positive nitrites had an LR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4-5.5), and urine white blood cell count had an LR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.4) in predicting E. coli versus non-E. coli infections. Antibiotic sensitivity compared between UA groups demonstrated equivalent superiority of cefazolin (94.7% sensitive in UA(+) vs 84.0% in UA(-) group; P < 0.0001), cefuroxime (98.2% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and nitrofurantoin (96.1% vs 82.2%; P < 0.0001) in the UA(+) group. In contrast, the UA(-) group showed significant sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (82.2% vs 71.3% in UA(+); P = 0.008).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Urinalysis is not an accurate predictor of UTI. A positive urine culture in the presence of negative UA most likely grew non-E. coli organisms, whereas most UA(+) results were associated with E. coli. This study also highlighted local patterns of antibiotic resistance between E. coli and non-E. coli groups. Negative UA results in the presence of strong suspicion of a UTI suggest a non-E. coli organism, which may be best treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conversely, UA(+) results suggest E. coli, which calls for treatment with cefazolin or cefuroxime."

            "abstract": "Daily evaluation of rectal temperature (RT) during the first 10 d in milk (DIM) is used to facilitate the early identification of postpartum complications, particularly metritis in dairy cows. The factors associated with RT of postpartum dairy cows have not been clearly established and the RT threshold used to define fever has been variable. The objectives were to identify factors associated with the RT of postpartum dairy cows and provide descriptive statistics of the RT during the first 10 DIM to clarify the normal range of RT for cows. Daily RT was evaluated from 1 to 10 DIM for all cows calving during 2 consecutive summers on a single 1,500-cow Holstein dairy. Cows were placed into metabolic/digestive (METB), infectious (INF), and no recorded disease (NONE) groups based on disease diagnoses during the first 10 DIM. Cows were grouped based on calving difficulty and parity. Multiple linear regression models with repeated measures were used to evaluate the factors associated with RT. Three hundred and ninety-two cows were evaluated, of which 45% were primiparous and 32% required assistance at calving. No difference was observed in calving assistance by parity. First disease diagnoses peaked in the INF and METB groups at 3 and 1 DIM, respectively. The RT of primiparous cows was 0.1 to 0.2°C higher than that of multiparous cows from 1 to 8 DIM, accounting for calving difficulty, twin births, month of calving, and disease group in the model. The INF group cows had a higher RT than did NONE group cows (38.9±0.04 to 39.2±0.73 vs. 38.7±0.03°C, respectively) on each of the first 10 DIM, which was approximately 0.6°C higher from 3 to 5 DIM. The RT of cows with metritis was at least 0.1°C higher (38.8±0.05°C) than that of NONE group cows beginning 4 d before diagnosis. The mean RT of primiparous, defined healthy (NONE group) cows was 38.8±0.02°C, with an upper normal limit (mean+2 SD) of 39.6°C. The mean RT of multiparous cows in the NONE group during the first 10 DIM was 38.7±0.01°C, with an upper normal limit of 39.5°C. The RT of dairy cattle during the first 10 DIM was associated with parity, month of calving, and an infectious disease diagnosis, particularly the diagnosis of metritis. The normal RT of dairy cattle in the immediate postpartum period, during the warm summer months, is potentially higher than that generally reported."

            "abstract": "To evaluate the effects on cognitive function of deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients treated surgically for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). The subjects were 106 patients in whom a Wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (WAIS-R) examination was performed 1 week before and 1 month after clipping surgery for asymptomatic UIAs. DWMH severity was evaluated on preoperative MR images by Fazekas scale, as follows: none (absence), mild (punctate foci), moderate (beginning confluence of foci), or severe (large confluent areas). A decrease of 7 or more points in intelligence quotient (IQ) postoperatively was considered deterioration. Fazekas score was none in 41 (none group), mild in 42 (mild group), moderate in 21, and severe in 2 patients (moderate/severe group). Patient characteristics, surgical factors, IQ change, and abnormal findings on postoperative MRI were compared among the groups. Although there was no statistically significant deterioration in IQ postoperatively in any group, the percentage of deteriorated patients was significantly higher in the moderate/severe group (34.8%) than in the other groups (4.9% in the none group, 7.1% in the mild group; p <0.01, p <0.05, respectively). Brain injury was observed more frequently on postoperative MR images in the moderate/severe group (17.4%) compared with the none group (2.4%; p = 0.052). The presence of moderate/severe DWMHs was an independent prognostic factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, the presence of moderate/severe DWMHs was a prognostic factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction after surgery for UIAs."

Hip and knee flexion with EXO often exceeded NONE without increasing heart rate for kneel. During lift with EXO, participants avoided greater lateral trunk flexion associated with injuries and used the preferred semi-squat technique. Participants produced more foot clearance with EXO than NONE during climb. Other outcomes of heart rate, perceived exertion, fatigue, and usability were mixed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      EXO augmentation does not need to alter movement kinematics during performances of kneel, lift, and climb tasks. EXO kinematic alterations did not appear to compromise user safety in terms of lateral trunk bending. It may encourage good technique, such as greater foot clearance to avoid tripping, for some tasks, and changes in lifting strategies to avoid extreme flexion and protect passive tissues."

However, selection of artificial intelligence (AI) architecture is an important variable in model development. Here, we explore 12 distinct AI architecture combinations to determine the most effective approach for GA segmentation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We investigated various AI architectures, each with distinct combinations of encoders and decoders.

Specifically, we investigated how the provision of an explanation for comment removal (none vs. real vs. placebic), and opinion congeniality between the remaining comments and the user's opinion (uncongenial vs. congenial) qualify social responses to AI. Results showed that news users were more suspicious of political motives for an AI (vs. human) moderator's comment removal (a) when the remaining comments were uncongenial, and (b) when no explanation was offered for deleted comments. Providing a real explanation (vs. none) attenuated participants' suspicion of political motives behind comment removal, but only for the AI moderator. When AI moderated the comments section, the exposure to congenial (vs. uncongenial) comments led participants to endorse the AI heuristic more strongly, but only in the absence of an explanation for comment removal. By contrast, the participants' belief in AI heuristic was stronger when a human moderator preserved uncongenial (vs. congenial) comments. Apparently, they considered AI as a viable alternative to a human moderator whose performance was unsatisfactory."

None were terminally ill. None were in pain. None knew their lives were about to end. None were evacuated. The victims had one thing in common: they all had chosen to be designated as Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) patients. All were killed with overdoses of medications that had not been prescribed for them. Dr. Daniel Nuss of the Louisiana State University School of Medicine and Dr. Floyd Burras, President of the Louisiana Medical Society defend the doctor's actions as involuntary euthanasia or mercy killing. Was this euthanasia, or homicide? At Memorial, the term DNR took on a new meaning--Do Not Rescue. In this new Memorial model, patient autonomy to control and choose one's medical treatment, yields to the physician's unilateral power to arbitrarily decide who lives and who dies.

We categorized changes in use patterns and tested associations between those changes and CD4 count and HIV viral suppression at 12 months in linear and logistic regressions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three patterns were identified at baseline: 18% did not use any substance (NONE--a priori defined); 63% used mostly cannabis and alcohol (CA); and 19% used opioids along with other drugs, including cocaine, tranquilizers, cannabis, and alcohol (MULTI). At 12 months, 40% moved from a high to a lower substance use class (MULTI to CA, either to NONE) or remained as NONE, 43% were in CA both times and 17% increased (NONE to CA, either to MULTI) or remained as MULTI. The adjusted mean CD4 count (for baseline covariates and baseline CD4 count) was significantly lower among participants increasing or remaining in MULTI (523, 95% CI [448, 598], cells/mm3) compared with those who decreased/abstained throughout (607, 95% CI [552, 663], p = .02). No significant difference was observed for HIV viral suppression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We identified distinct polysubstance use patterns among PWH with SUD: cannabis/alcohol and opioids with alcohol and other drugs. Changes over time toward fewer substances/no use were associated with lower HIV disease severity based on CD4 count but not based on HIV viral suppression."
