Background Television viewing (TV), a highly prevalent behaviour, is associated
with higher cardiovascular risk independently of physical activity.
The relationship with mortality, however, is relatively unknown.
Methods We examined the prospective relationship between TV time and
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality in a population-based
cohort [The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC), Norfolk] of 13197 men and women {age [SD
(standard deviation)]: 61.5(cid:2)9.0 years}. Participants were free
from stroke, myocardial infarction and cancer at baseline in
1998–2000 and were followed up for death ascertainment until
2009 (9.5(cid:2)1.6 years). TV time, total physical activity energy
expenditure (PAEE), education level, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use,
participant and family history of disease and total energy intake
were self-reported; height and weight were measured by stan-
dardized procedures. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence interval
(CI)] for mortality were estimated per 1-h/day increase in TV.
Results Each 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with increased
hazard of all-cause (HR¼1.04, 95% CI¼1.01–1.09; 1270 deaths)
and cardiovascular (HR¼1.07, 95% CI¼1.01–1.15; 373 deaths),
but not cancer mortality (HR¼1.04, 95% CI¼0.98–1.10;
570 deaths). This was independent of gender, age, education, smok-
ing, alcohol, medication, diabetes history, family history of cardio-
vascular disease and cancer, body mass index (BMI) and PAEE.
They were similar when stratified by gender, age, education, BMI
and PAEE. The population-attributable fraction for all-cause mor-
tality comparing the highest TV tertile (43.6h/day) with the lowest
(<2.5h/day) was 5.4%.
Conclusions These findings suggest that public health recommendations should
consider advising a reduction in TV time, a predominant leisure
activity in modern society, in addition to advocating physical
activity.

KEY MESSAGES
(cid:5) The findings from this large population-based cohort of middle-aged Caucasians indicate that each
1-h increment in TV time is independently associated with a 4 and 7% increased risk of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality, respectively.
(cid:5) Given the high prevalence of excessive TV watching, recommendations aimed at decreasing TV time
might have a relevant impact on public health.
(cid:5) As the associations found are independent of physical activity levels, these recommendations should
be in addition to the established public health recommendations for physical activity.
