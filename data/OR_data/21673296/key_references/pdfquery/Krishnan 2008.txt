Few modiﬁable risk factors for type 2 diabetes have been documented in the high-risk population of US black 
women. The authors used data from 45,668 black women aged 21–69 years, followed biennially from 1995 to 2005 
in the Black Women’s Health Study, to estimate incidence rate ratios for type 2 diabetes comparing various levels 
of physical activity and television watching. Cox proportional hazards models were used to control confounding 
factors. During 10 years of follow-up, 2,928 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identiﬁed. Vigorous activity 
was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (Ptrend < 0.0001); the incidence rate ratio for (cid:1)7 hours per week 
was 0.43 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.59) relative to no activity. Brisk walking for (cid:1)5 hours per week was 
associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk (incidence rate ratio ¼ 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.92) relative to no walking. 
Television watching was associated with an increased type 2 diabetes risk: The incidence rate ratio was 1.86 (95% 
CI: 1.54, 2.24) for (cid:1)5 hours relative to <1 hour of television per day, independent of physical activity. These 
observational data suggest that black women might reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by increasing 
their time spent walking or engaged in vigorous physical activity and by limiting television watching.

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the 
United States and affects an estimated 20.6 million people 
(1, 2). The burden of this disease is particularly large among 
African-American women, among whom the prevalence is 
almost twice that of non-Hispanic whites (2). Although ep- 
idemiologic studies support a role for physical activity in 
preventing type 2 diabetes (3–15), there has been little at- 
tention focused on the impact of this factor in the high-risk 
population of African-American women. A recent random- 
ized clinical trial (Diabetes Prevention Program) showed 
that an intensive lifestyle modiﬁcation (healthy diet and 
moderate physical activity of 30 minutes a day for 5 days 
a week) reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 50% as 
compared with placebo (10). We undertook to examine how 
the actual levels of physical activity in a large population of 
African-American women were related to type 2 diabetes 
incidence. With detailed questionnaire data collected every 
2 years from over 40,000 women in the Black Women’s 
Health Study (BWHS), we were able to assess the inﬂuence 
of vigorous activity, walking, and television watching on the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes in black women. 

The BWHS, a collaborative project of Boston University 
and Howard University, is an ongoing prospective follow-up 
study of African-American women from across the United 
States (16). The study began in 1995 when women aged 
21–69 years were enrolled through postal questionnaires 
mailed to subscribers of Essence magazine, members of 
several professional organizations, and friends and relatives 
of early respondents. The baseline questionnaire collected

information on demographics, medical and reproductive his- 
tory, height, weight, physical activity, and cigarette and alcohol 
use, among other factors. Dietary intake was assessed by using 
a modiﬁed version of the NCI [National Cancer Institute]- 
Block food frequency questionnaire (17, 18). 
After exclusion of 5,500 women who had completed the 
questionnaire but were outside the age range 21–69 years, 
who had not completed the questionnaire satisfactorily, or 
whose addresses were judged to be invalid, 59,052 women 
that has been followed. Biennial 
comprised the cohort 
follow-up questionnaires collect updated information on in- 
cident disease, weight, smoking, physical activity, and other 
factors. Follow-up has averaged over 80% of the baseline 
cohort over 5 completed questionnaire cycles. 
Analyses are based on follow-up from 1995 through 2005, 
with follow-up beginning at age 30 years. We excluded 
women who did not reach the age of 30 years by the end 
of follow-up (n ¼ 1,330); who reported a history of diabetes 
(n ¼ 2,930) or gestational diabetes (n ¼ 636) at baseline; 
who reported stroke (n ¼ 359), myocardial infarction (n ¼ 
447), or cancer (n ¼ 1,144) at baseline (whose questionnaire 
assessment of physical activity and diet may not reﬂect long- 
term patterns because these conditions may have caused 
modiﬁcations of physical activity level and diet); who were 
pregnant at baseline (n ¼ 957); or who had missing data on 
weight, height, or physical activity at baseline (n ¼ 5,581). 
The ﬁnal analysis cohort consisted of 45,668 women. 

Each follow-up questionnaire asked about new diagnoses 
of diabetes during the previous 2-year period. Incident di- 
abetes was reported by 2,928 women during follow-up. 
We assessed the accuracy of self-reported diabetes among 
a random sample of 227 women whose physicians provided 
data from their medical records. The diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes was conﬁrmed for 218 (96%) of the women. Of 
the remaining 9 women, 3 did not have diabetes, 2 had type 
1 diabetes, 2 had gestational diabetes, 1 had steroid-induced 
diabetes, and 1 was classiﬁed as having metabolic syndrome. 

Physical activity data were obtained on each follow-up 
questionnaire. Subjects were asked separate questions on 
the number of hours per week spent on vigorous physical 
activity (e.g., running, swimming), walking for exercise, 
and walking to and from work. Response options were 0, 
<1, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–9, and (cid:1)10 hours per week. Partic- 
ipants were asked on the 2003 questionnaire to classify their 
usual walking pace as casual/strolling (<2 mph), average/ 
normal (2–<3 mph), fairly brisk (3–<4 mph), and brisk/ 
striding ((cid:1)4 mph) (1 mile ¼ 1.6 km). In our analysis of 
walking and diabetes risk, we used data on walking pace 
from the 2003 questionnaire to reﬂect their usual walking 
pace at all time periods. We created a variable that grouped 
participants into categories based on both walking pace (ca- 
sual, average, or brisk (fairly brisk and brisk)) and amount 
of walking, taking into account both walking for exercise 
and walking to and from work. We created cumulative 


average variables for each individual based on activity data 
from each questionnaire that preceded the occurrence of 
diabetes or end of follow-up; when data are available for 
a number of different time periods, cumulative averages 
give a better representation of long-term exposure, as com- 
pared with the standard follow-up approach of updating the 
exposure variable for each time period (19). The number of 
hours per day spent watching television was also assessed 
in each questionnaire with possible response categories of 0, 
<1, 1–2, 3–4, and (cid:1)5 hours per day. 
Physical activity assessment in the BWHS was validated 
in a study conducted at the Howard University Cancer 
Center (20). Actigraphs (activity monitors) were worn by 
101 BWHS participants during their waking hours for 7 
days. They also completed 7-day physical activity diaries 
and completed the BWHS questions on physical activity. 
Signiﬁcant positive correlations were observed between 
BWHS questionnaire data and actigraph measurements for 
total activity (metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week), r ¼ 
0.28, P < 0.01; walking, r ¼ 0.26, P < 0.01; and vigorous 
activity, r ¼ 0.40, P < 0.01. Correlations between the diary 
data and the BWHS questionnaire data were signiﬁcant for 
total activity (MET-hours/week), r ¼ 0.32, P < 0.01, as well 
as vigorous activity, r ¼ 0.41, P < 0.01. 

Age- and time-stratiﬁed Cox proportional hazards models 
were used to calculate incidence rate ratios, also known as 
hazard ratios, and 95% conﬁdence intervals (21). Person- 
years were calculated from baseline to the year of diagnosis 
of type 2 diabetes, loss to follow-up, death, or the end of 
follow-up in 2005, whichever came ﬁrst. Incidence rate 
ratios for diabetes were calculated for the levels of each 
physical activity measure relative to the lowest 
level. 
Time-varying covariates were reassigned every 2 years by 
using the Anderson-Gill data structure (22). The Anderson- 
Gill data structure creates a new record for every follow-up 
cycle at which the participant is at risk and assigns covariate 
values reported for that speciﬁc questionnaire cycle. The 
covariates included in the multivariable models were age 
(continuous), questionnaire cycle, family history of diabetes 
(biologic parents, siblings, or children), years of education 
((cid:2)12, 13–15, 16, (cid:1)17), household income in dollars 
((cid:2)15,000, 15,001–25,000, 25,001–35,000, 35,001–50,000, 
50,001–100,000, and >100,000), marital status (single, 
married, divorced/separated/widowed), cigarettes smoked 
per day (0, <15, 15–24, and (cid:1)25), alcoholic drinks per 
week (0, 1–6, 7–13, (cid:1)14), energy intake in kilocalories 
(quintiles), and coffee consumption in cups/week (<1, 1, 
2–3, (cid:1)4) (1 cup ¼ 236.6 ml) . We carried out analyses with 
and without terms for body mass index (weight (kg)/height 
(m)2) that we hypothesized to be in the causal pathway 
between physical activity and type 2 diabetes risk. Tests 
for linear trend across categories of physical activity varia- 
bles were carried out by including in the regression model 
an ordinal term for increasing levels of exposure. Departure 
from the proportional hazards assumption was tested by 
using a likelihood ratio test comparing models with and 
without cross-product terms between exposure and age.

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study 
population by vigorous physical activity and television 
watching. At baseline, 31.6% of the cohort reported no vig- 
orous physical activity. Compared with women who exer- 
cised (cid:1)7 hours per week, women who reported no vigorous 
activity were older, had a higher mean body mass index, 
smoked more, had a higher percentage of energy from fat, 
and were less likely to walk for exercise. At baseline, 14.6% 
of the population watched (cid:1)5 hours of television per day. 
Compared with women who watched <1 hour per day of 
television, those who watched (cid:1)5 hours per day were less 
educated; had a higher mean body mass index, higher energy 
intake, higher percentage of energy from fat, and greater use 
of cigarettes and alcohol; and were less likely to participate 
in vigorous physical activity or to walk for exercise. The 
correlation coefﬁcient for the relation between vigorous ac- 
tivity and television watching was (cid:3)0.035 (P < 0.0001). 
There were 2,928 incident cases of type 2 diabetes ascer- 
tained during 182,994 person-years of follow-up. In the 
multivariable model, vigorous physical activity was in- 
versely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). 
The incidence rate ratio for (cid:1)7 hours per week of vigorous 
activity relative to 0 hours was 0.43 (95% conﬁdence inter- 
val (CI): 0.31, 0.59) (Ptrend < 0.0001). When body mass 
index was added to the model, the incidence rate ratio was 
0.57 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.79) (data not shown). Brisk walking 
was also associated with a reduced risk: The incidence rate 
ratio for walking at a brisk pace for (cid:1)5 hours per week 
relative to no walking was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.92). With 
inclusion of terms for body mass index in the regression 
model, the incidence rate ratio was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.64, 
1.19) (data not shown). 
Television watching was positively associated with the 
risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). The incidence rate ratio 
was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.54, 2.24) for watching (cid:1)5 hours per day 
relative to <1 hour per day (Ptrend < 0.0001). In a multivari- 
able model that included body mass index, the incidence rate 
ratio was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.89) (data not shown). 
The inverse association between vigorous physical activ- 
ity and type 2 diabetes risk was present at all levels of body 
mass index (Table 3), even among those with a body mass 
index of (cid:1)30, the World Health Organization deﬁnition of 
obesity (23). The positive association of television watching 
and risk of type 2 diabetes was also present at all levels of 
body mass index. The association was strongest in those 
with a body mass index of <25, among whom the incidence 
rate ratio for watching (cid:1)5 hours per day of television 
was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.24, 5.02) relative to <1 hour per day 
(Ptrend ¼ 0.01). The associations for vigorous activity and 
television watching were similar among premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women (data not shown). 
Figure 1 shows the combined effect of vigorous physical 
activity and television watching. The reference group was 
those women who reported (cid:1)3 hours per week of vigorous 
activity and <1 hour per day of television watching. Type 2 
diabetes risk increased with decreasing physical activity in 
each category of television watching and increased with 
increased television watching in each category of physical

activity. The incidence rate ratio for no vigorous physical 
activity and watching (cid:1)5 hours per day of television was 
3.64 (95% CI: 2.23, 5.92). 

In this large prospective study of black women, vigorous 
physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of type 

2 diabetes. Walking at a brisk pace, but not slow walking, 
was also associated with a reduction in risk. The risk of type 
2 diabetes was increased among women who spent an ap- 
preciable amount of time watching television, and this in- 
crease was apparent at every level of physical activity. 
The present ﬁndings on vigorous physical activity in 
black women are consistent with those reported for white 
women in previous studies (4, 5, 7, 9, 12–14). Results from

niﬁcant association of walking with diabetes risk in black 
women, but statistical power was limited (13). 
The positive association between television watching and 
type 2 diabetes risk in our study of black women is similar to 
that found in 2 previous studies of white women (24) and 
men (25). Importantly, this association was independent of 
physical activity and other known risk factors for type 2 
diabetes.

Incidence rate ratios for type 2 diabetes by levels of vig-

Health Study, 1995–2005. The reference category for all other strata

the Diabetes Prevention Program trial showed that a lifestyle 
intervention consisting of diet and physical activity was 
effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes among all 
racial subgroups, including African Americans (10). In the 
Women’s Health Initiative observational cohort, there was 
no signiﬁcant association among African-American women, 
but statistical power was limited because there were only 
395 diabetic cases among the black women (13). The Wom- 
en’s Health Initiative cohort included only postmenopausal 
women, but this does not explain the difference between 
their results and ours. We found an inverse association of 
physical activity with diabetes in both pre- and postmeno- 
pausal women. The other epidemiologic studies that have 
included an appreciable number of black women have been 
cross-sectional in design (5, 6). 
We had enough statistical power to assess the association 
of physical activity and type 2 diabetes within strata of body 
mass index, and we found that physical activity is beneﬁcial 
regardless of body mass index. Previous studies of physical 
activity and diabetes that have assessed physical activity 
within strata of body mass index have provided inconsistent 
results (3, 4, 9, 12). 
Our results showing that walking at a brisk pace is asso- 
ciated with a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes are consis- 
tent with ﬁndings on white women from the Nurses’ Health 
Study (7). The Women’s Health Initiative did not ﬁnd a sig- 





Body mass index, which is inﬂuenced in part by levels of 
physical activity and is a strong independent risk factor for 
type 2 diabetes, may be an intermediate in the association of 
physical activity and diabetes or a confounder of the asso- 
ciation. When we controlled for body mass index in multi- 
variable analyses, the association between physical activity 
and type 2 diabetes was reduced slightly, but a strong in- 
verse association still remained. In addition, the inverse 
association of physical activity with diabetes risk was pres- 
ent at all levels of body mass index, including the <25 
category of body mass index where confounding from body 
mass index would be smallest. The latter 2 observations 
suggest that confounding, if present, played a minor role 
in the present study and that mechanisms other than body 
mass index may also play a role in the reduction in risk. 
The relation between type 2 diabetes and physical activity 
may be mediated through increased insulin sensitivity due to 
increases in levels of the glucose transporter protein GLUT-4 
and muscle glycogen synthase activity, a decrease in serum 
triglyceride concentration, and an increase in muscle capillary 
network (15, 26). Physical activity can also lead to weight loss 
or maintenance of a healthy weight (27), which in turn can 
lead to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. 
The positive association between television watching and 
type 2 diabetes might be explained by 2 mechanisms (28). 
First, television watching is related to a lower expenditure of 
energy, which in turn can lead to obesity, weight gain, and 
increased risk of diabetes. Adjustment for body mass index 
attenuated the incidence rate ratios in our study; this is 
compatible with the association of television watching with 
type 2 diabetes being at least partially mediated through 
obesity. Another possible mechanism is that 
television 
watching leads to a higher caloric intake and a relatively 
unhealthy dietary pattern. Participants in our study who 
watched more television had a higher energy intake and 
a higher fat and carbohydrate intake as compared with those 
who watched no television. 
One of the main strengths of our study is the prospective 
study design, which reduces the potential of recall bias. In 
addition, the BWHS has high follow-up rates that reduce the 
possibility of bias resulting from selective losses. The sam- 
ple size was large, providing excellent statistical power to 
assess effects overall and in subgroups. We were able to 
adjust for a large number of possible confounding variables. 
Physical activity was self-reported. Because we had re- 
peated measures of physical activity, we were able to get 
a better representation of long-term physical activity. Our 
validation study showed signiﬁcant correlations of question- 
naire responses with diary and actigraph measurement of 
physical activity. Nonetheless, measurement errors are 
likely but should be nondifferential, which would move 
estimates for the highest exposure categories toward the 
null. To the extent that there was misclassiﬁcation of expo- 
sure, the true association of activity with diabetes risk may 
be even stronger than shown here. 
Identiﬁcation of type 2 diabetes cases was based on self- 
report. A validation study indicated that type 2 diabetes was 
reported with a high degree of accuracy. Some women with 
undiagnosed type 2 diabetes were undoubtedly misclassiﬁed 
as noncases, but the prevalence of undiagnosed disease was 


likely to be low (29). Physicians are well aware of the high risk 
of diabetes among African-American women, and it seems 
likely that BWHS participants were screened for the disease 
during the course of regular check-ups. Access to health care is 
quite good among BWHS participants: 93% reported that they 
had health insurance in 1997, and 98% reported that they had 
visited a physician/hospital in the past 2 years. 
The BWHS participants were from 17 states across the 
United States with approximately equal numbers living in 
the Northeast, South, West, and Midwest. In addition, 97% 
of the participants have completed high school or a higher 
level of education. Among the US black female population 
of the same ages, 83% have at least a high school education 
(30). In this respect, our results should be applicable to most 
US black women, except possibly the approximately 17% 
who have not completed high school. 
The present observational ﬁndings suggest that physical 
activity may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in African- 
American women, a population at high risk of the disease. 
Recent recommendations for physical activity for adults in- 
clude ‘‘moderate-intensity physical activities for at least 30 
minutes on 5 or more days of the week’’ (Centers for Dis- 
ease Control and Prevention) and ‘‘vigorous-intensity phys- 
ical activity 3 or more days per week for 20 or more minutes 
per occasion’’ (Healthy People 2010) (31). Like the majority 
of adults in the United States, most African-American 
women do not meet recommended levels of physical activ- 
ity. Our results for vigorous activity and brisk walking sug- 
gest that levels approximating those recommended might 
indeed be protective against type 2 diabetes. Regular brisk 
walking may be easier to implement than vigorous physical 
activity. Reducing sedentary behaviors, such as television 
watching, or at least reducing the excess eating that often 
accompanies it, might also be effective. A necessary ﬁrst 
step for the translation of scientiﬁc ﬁndings into behavioral 
change is dissemination of the health information to those 
affected, and the current results provide the basis for edu- 
cating African-American women about the beneﬁts of phys- 
ical activity in preventing type 2 diabetes.
