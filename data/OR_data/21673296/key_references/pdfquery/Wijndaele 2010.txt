Background Television viewing (TV), a highly prevalent behaviour, is associated 
with higher cardiovascular risk independently of physical activity. 
The relationship with mortality, however, is relatively unknown. 


We examined the prospective relationship between TV time and 
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality in a population-based 
cohort [The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition (EPIC), Norfolk] of 13 197 men and women {age [SD 
(standard deviation)]: 61.5 (cid:2) 9.0 years}. Participants were free 
from stroke, myocardial 
infarction and cancer at baseline in 
1998–2000 and were followed up for death ascertainment until 
2009 (9.5 (cid:2) 1.6 years). TV time, 
total physical activity energy 
expenditure (PAEE), education level, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use, 
participant and family history of disease and total energy intake 
were self-reported; height and weight were measured by stan- 
dardized procedures. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence interval 
(CI)] for mortality were estimated per 1-h/day increase in TV. 

Each 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with increased 
hazard of all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.09; 1270 deaths) 
and cardiovascular (HR ¼ 1.07, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.15; 373 deaths), 
95% CI ¼ 0.98–1.10; 
but not 
570 deaths). This was independent of gender, age, education, smok- 
ing, alcohol, medication, diabetes history, family history of cardio- 
vascular disease and cancer, body mass index (BMI) and PAEE. 
They were similar when stratified by gender, age, education, BMI 
and PAEE. The population-attributable fraction for all-cause mor- 
tality comparing the highest TV tertile (43.6 h/day) with the lowest 
(<2.5 h/day) was 5.4%. 

Conclusions These findings suggest that public health recommendations should 
consider advising a reduction in TV time, a predominant leisure 
in addition to advocating physical 
activity in modern society, 
activity. 



Introduction 
Sedentary behaviour (i.e. excessive sitting, as distinct 
from insufficient physical activity) has increasingly 
gained interest as a potential determinant of 
ill 
health, particularly given its high prevalence (e.g. 
55% of the waking day in the USA).1 Television view- 
ing (TV) time in particular has been reported as the 
most widespread leisure-time sedentary behaviour of 
adults.2–4 Cross-sectional and prospective evidence is 
accumulating for adverse associations between TV 
time and several intermediate cardiovascular risk fac- 
tors, including the metabolic syndrome and related 
cardio-metabolic biomarkers,5–13 obesity,14,15 abnor- 
mal glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.15–19 
Some cancers have also been associated with exces- 
sive levels of TV time.20,21 These associations were 
independent of physical activity and an adverse 
effect of elevated TV time has been observed in phys- 
ically active individuals.13 Some physiological mech- 
anisms supporting detrimental effects of sedentary 
behaviour are also emerging.19 Building on the avail- 
able evidence, so far, two recent studies have exam- 
ined whether TV time independently predicts specific 
mortality endpoints (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and 
cancer mortality), of which one only focused on car- 
diovascular mortality in men.22,23 
to 
the present 
examine the prospective association between TV 
time and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and cancer 
in a relatively large 
sample of healthy middle-aged Caucasian men and 
women and (ii) to examine whether this association 
total physical activity energy 
is 
expenditure (PAEE) and other potentially confound- 
ing variables. 




Methods 
Study participants 
EPIC-Norfolk is part of the 10-country collaborative 
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition Study (EPIC). Between 1993 and 1997, a 
cohort of 25 633 residents of Norfolk (UK), 
in the 
age range of 45–79 years and recruited via participat- 
agreed to participate. 
ing general practitioners, 
The study design and cohort characteristics have 
previously been described.24 Between January 1998 
and October 2000, participants were invited for a 
follow-up assessment. At this follow-up, the EPIC 
physical activity questionnaire (EPAQ2) was intro- 
duced as a more comprehensive physical activity 
measure, which also included questions on TV time. 
This examination constitutes the baseline for the cur- 
rent analyses. A total of 15 784 participants attended, 
of whom 15 021 provided complete data for variables 
included in the present study. Participants with a 
self-reported baseline history of stroke (n ¼ 360), 
myocardial infarction (n ¼ 488) or cancer (n ¼ 1075) 


were excluded. As a result, 13 197 participants 
(5729 men and 7468 women) were included. The 
Norwich District Health Authority Ethics Committee 
approved the study design and all participants 
provided written informed consent. 
Measures 
Mortality 
All EPIC-Norfolk participants are followed up for 
mortality and the present study reports on follow-up 
until 30 April 2009 (9.5 (cid:2) 1.6 years). All individuals 
have been flagged for death certification at 
the 
Office of National Statistics (UK) with vital status 
ascertained on the whole cohort. Coding of death cer- 
tificates was executed by trained nosologists accord- 
ing to the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD). Cardiovascular death was defined as ICD 
410–448 (ICD 9) or ICD I10–I79 (ICD 10) as the 
underlying cause of death. Cancer death was defined 
as ICD 140–208 (ICD 9) or ICDC00–C97 (ICD 10) as 
the underlying cause. 
TV time and PAEE 
Participants completed the EPAQ2, providing infor- 
mation on their physical (in)activity in a disaggre- 
gated way (in and around the home, to work, at 
work and during leisure time), using the past year 
as a reference frame.25 PAEE [metabolic equivalent 
(MET) (cid:3) h/week] in each domain was calculated by 
multiplying participation (h/week) by the metabolic 
cost of each activity (MET).26 Total PAEE was calcu- 
lated by summing energy expenditure of the different 
(mutually exclusive) domains, as previously described 
in detail.27 Time spent viewing television and video 
(h/week) was calculated by summing responses to 
four questions about viewing before and after 6 pm 
the 
on week and weekend days. Repeatability of 
EPAQ2 was high both in terms of TV time and total 
PAEE.25 Comparison against minute-by-minute heart 
rate monitoring 
capacity 
and maximal 
(VO2max) suggested that the questionnaire is valid 
for ranking individuals.25 For ease of interpretation, 
TV time and PAEE were expressed in h/day and 
MET (cid:3) h/day, respectively. The two measures were 
mutually exclusive and weakly inversely correlated 
(Spearman correlation: (cid:4)0.18, P < 0.01). 


Covariates 
Education level (low, O, A, degree), social class 
(current, 
(manual, non-manual), 
former and never), alcohol consumption (U/week), 
anti-hypertensive medication (yes, no), medication 
for dyslipidaemia (yes, no), baseline history of myo- 
cardial infarction or stroke (yes, no), cancer (yes, no) 
and diabetes (yes, no), family history of CVD (yes, 
no) and cancer (yes, no) were self-reported using a 
detailed health and lifestyle questionnaire.24 Total 
energy intake (kJ/day) was derived from a validated 
where Px is prevalence of the exposure, and HR is the 
hazard ratio of the highest compared with the lowest 
TV tertile (derived from Model C including PAEE). 
To minimize the potential effect of reverse causality, 
analyses were repeated after additionally excluding 
participants who died within the first 2 years of 
the 
follow-up. Analyses were

Results 
Descriptive characteristics 
A total 
(725 men and 
545 women) died during 124 902 person-years of 
follow-up (men: 53 330, women: 71 572). There were 
373 cardiovascular deaths (men: 211, women: 162) 
and 570 cancer deaths (men: 321, women: 249). 
Descriptive baseline characteristics are shown by 
vital status in Table 1. Participants who died from 
any cause watched TV for on average 0.4 h/day more 
than survivors. This difference was greater for cardio- 
vascular mortality (0.6 h/day) and smaller, although 
significant, for cancer mortality (0.3 h/day). Deceased 
participants were also less physically active, and 
showed a less favourable profile for several other 
characteristics, 
including waist circumference and 
BMI. Baseline characteristics by TV tertiles are 
shown in Table 2, indicating that participants watch- 
ing more TV scored less 
several 
characteristics. 

Cox proportional hazards regression 
The increases found for unadjusted mortality rates per 
10 000 person-years by 1-h increments in TV time 
suggested a linear association between TV time and 
all three mortality outcomes (Figure 1). There was no 
significant improvement in model fit after adding the 
quadratic TV term to the adjusted model (Model C), 
for any of the three outcomes. 
Results for the Cox regression (Table 3) showed that 
TV time (h/day) was positively associated with 
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality after 
for age and gender (Model A). For

all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, associations 
remained significant after further adjustment for edu- 
cation level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, 
medication for hypertension and dyslipidaemia,

Statistical analysis 
Baseline characteristics were compared by vital status 
(independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests) 
and by TV tertiles (lowest: <2.5, middle: 2.5–3.6, 
highest: 43.6 h/day; one-way analysis of variance 
and chi-squared tests). 


Cox proportional hazards regression was used to 
examine the association between baseline TV time 
(h/day) and all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mor- 
tality. The proportional hazards assumption was 
checked using Schoenfeld residuals and Kaplan– 
Meier plots for all three outcomes. The Schoenfeld 
residuals did not suggest evidence of deviations 
from proportionality, and this was consistent with ob- 
servations in the Kaplan–Meier plots. To examine lin- 
earity of the association between TV time and the 
outcomes, unadjusted mortality rates [95% confidence 
interval (CI)] per 10 000 person-years of follow-up 
were 
increments. 
1-h 
Additionally, a log likelihood-ratio test examined 
whether addition of a quadratic term for TV time to 
the adjusted model (Model C) resulted in a statistic- 
ally significant improvement in model fit. Based on 
evidence for a linear association, hazard ratios (HRs) 
(95% CI) per h/day increase in TV time were esti- 
mated, first adjusting for baseline age and gender 
(Model A). Further adjustment (Model B) was made 
for baseline education level, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, medication (hypertension and dyslipi- 
daemia; not included for cancer mortality), diabetes 
history and family history of CVD and cancer. We 
then introduced baseline PAEE to the model to exam- 
ine whether TV time was independently associated 
with mortality (Model C). 

To determine whether associations were modified 
by gender, age (460, 460 years), education (low or 
O, A or degree) or BMI (normal weight: <25, over- 
weight or obese: 525 kg/m2), multiplicative inter- 
action terms were included in Model C. Effect 
modification by physical activity was examined by 
including a (TV (cid:3) total PAEEmedian split) interaction 
term in Model C (cut-offs, 
total PAEE: 415.7, 
415.7 MET h/day). 
Continuous BMI and waist circumference were then 
added (consecutively) to Model C, to examine a po- 
tential mediation effect of overall and central adipos- 
ity. By including total energy intake (kJ/day), a 
potential mediation effect of diet was evaluated in a 
subsample, excluding 21% of participants with miss- 
ing data for total energy intake.

(Model B). These results were virtually unchanged 
after further adjustment for total PAEE (Model C). 
A 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with 
an increased hazard of death from CVD of 8% and 
from all causes of 5%. Adjustment for social class 
(2% missing) instead of education level did not ma- 
terially change results in any of the analyses (data not 
shown). Results were also materially unchanged after 
excluding participants who died within the first 
2 years of follow-up (data not shown). 
Table 4 shows HRs (95% CI) for all-cause mortality 
derived from Model C stratified by gender, age, edu- 
cation, BMI and PAEE. HRs were in the same direc- 
tion and differences between subgroups were small. 
Consistently, after including multiplicative interaction 
terms in Model C in the total sample, interactions 
among TV time and gender, age, education and BMI 
were non-significant for all three outcomes. Also, no 
significant interaction was found between TV and 
total PAEE for all-cause (P ¼ 0.46), cardiovascular 
(P ¼ 0.45) or cancer mortality (P ¼ 0.45), supporting 
the similar association between TV and mortality be- 
tween high and low physically active groups. 
To examine whether central and general adiposity 
mediated the associations between TV and mortality, 
BMI and waist circumference were added to Model C. 
The inclusion of BMI had virtually no effect on the 
results for all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.09, 
P ¼ 0.03), or 
cardiovascular mortality (HR ¼ 1.07, 
95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.15, P ¼ 0.04; results for cancer mor- 
tality: HR ¼ 1.04, 
P ¼ 0.20). 
Adding waist circumference to Model C attenuated 
the effect of TV on both all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% 
CI ¼ 0.99–1.08, P ¼ 0.07) and cardiovascular mortality 
(HR ¼ 1.07, 95% CI ¼ 0.99–1.15, P ¼ 0.06) to a margin- 
ally non-significant level (results for cancer mortality: 
HR ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼ 0.97–1.09, P ¼ 0.31). 

No evidence was found for a potential mediation 
effect of diet. Comparable significant HRs per h/day 
increase in TV time were obtained after including 
total energy intake in Model C (n ¼ 10 431): all-cause: 
HR ¼ 1.05, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.10, P ¼ 0.03; cardiovascu- 
lar: HR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 1.02–1.20, P ¼ 0.02 and

Discussion 
The results from this prospective population-based 
cohort study suggest that high levels of TV time are 
associated with an increased risk of death from all 
causes and CVD. These effects are independent of 
total physical activity and other relevant covariates 
and are similar between low and high physically 
active groups. These findings strengthen the available 
evidence on independent detrimental effects of excess 
TV time, previously observed in cross-sectional and 
prospective studies on intermediate risk factors, 
including cardio-metabolic biomarkers and the meta- 
bolic syndrome,5–13 obesity,14,15 abnormal glucose me- 
tabolism and type 2 diabetes.15–18 They also extend 
recent 
from a smaller population-based 
sample of Australian adults suggesting a linear in- 
crease in risk for all-cause (284 cases) and cardiovas- 
cular mortality (87 cases), but not cancer mortality 
(125 cases), with every 1-h increment in TV time, 
independently of leisure exercise and other confoun- 
ders.22 Another recent study specifically focusing on 
cardiovascular mortality in US men did not show an 
independent association with TV time.23 

Other previous studies have examined the associ- 
ation between daily sitting time and mortality.29–31 
For example, a population-based study in 17 013

sample of 83 034 Japanese middle-aged adults, sitting

premature death from all causes compared with sit- 
ting <3 h/day, independent of physical activity levels

public health effect of shifting from the highest to the 
lowest TV tertile appears to be lower than that of 
shifting from the lowest to the highest PAEE tertile, 
an excess rate of 5.4% for total mortality is still sub- 
stantial. Given the independence of the TV/mortality 
and PAEE/mortality associations, substituting TV time 
by physical activity may result in an additive reduc- 
tion of mortality. TV time, however, increases with 
time.2 
increasing age but may also change over 
Therefore, the PAF for comparing the highest with 
the lowest TV tertile as shown in this middle-aged 
cohort may not generalize to younger populations. 
Although watching TV is only one component of 
overall sedentary behaviour, we specifically focused 
it is 
on this behaviour for several reasons. First, 
highly prevalent (e.g. one of the three main activities 
in the UK besides sleeping and working),2 and the 
most frequently reported sedentary behaviour during 
the USA3 and Australia.4 
leisure time in UK,2 



Consequently, watching TV is likely a strong indicator 
behaviour.32 
of 
Secondly, it is probably one of the sedentary behav- 
iours that is most susceptible to voluntary change 
compared with other 
types of prolonged sitting 
(e.g. occupational sitting). Therefore, reducing TV 
time is a potential target for behavioural change in 
future intervention studies. Finally, TV might trigger 
adverse pathways that are additional to those (physio- 
logical) pathways hypothesized for sitting per se.19 
For example, a recent study demonstrated that expos- 
ure to snack-food advertisement during TV watching 
triggered automatic eating behaviours 
that were 
independent of hunger in children and adults.33 
Potential pathways linking TV time to all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortalities are likely to be diverse and 
need further exploration. Some possible mechanisms 
were examined within the current study. First of all, 
extensive adjustment for PAEE diminishes the likeli- 
hood that our results can be explained by displace- 
ment of 
(even low intensity) physical activity. 
Secondly, as previously suggested, high exposure to 
high-caloric food advertisements increases (uncon- 
food 
scious) snacking and the overall amount of 
consumed.33,34 However, the effect of TV time on 
mortality in our study was independent of 
total 
energy intake. Given the amount of measurement 
error usually associated with self-reported dietary 
intake, we cannot exclude residual confounding by 
dietary intake. Our results were, however, independ- 
ent of overall adiposity (BMI). In contrast, central 
obesity (i.e. waist circumference) might have a med- 
iating role between TV time and mortality, although 
the associations were only marginally non-significant 
after adjustment for this variable. Causal 
inference 
cannot be made, however, about 
the association 
between TV time and all other variables measured 
at baseline. Higher levels of adiposity may also lead 
to increased TV time, as recently shown for objectively 
measured total sedentary time.35 Other pathways 
include intermediate cardiovascular and metabolic 
risk factors previously suggested to be independently 
associated with TV time.5–19 Current and future 
studies examining pathophysiological processes that 
are specific for sedentary behaviours and not just the 
effect of absence of physical activity are an important 
and emerging area of research, which may support the 
current epidemiological evidence. One of these bio- 
logical processes, shown in animal models, 
is the 
acute drop in skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase activity 
caused by muscle inactivity (absence of muscle con- 
tractions) and resulting in disruption of triglyceride 
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism.36 
Consistently, observations in free-living humans by 
objective monitoring of body movement suggested 
that 
in sedentary time are 
beneficially associated with level of triglycerides,37 
and urge the need for future epidemiological and 
experimental studies further exploring these findings. 




The present study has several strengths. The large 
population-based sample enabled us to control for po- 
tential reverse causality by excluding participants with 
relevant health conditions at baseline and by add- 
itionally excluding those who died within the first 
2 years of follow-up. Furthermore, we were able to 
adjust for non-categorized overall PAEE and not just 
(categorized) time spent in leisure, or moderate to 
vigorous physical activity, minimizing residual con- 
founding. In addition to previously demonstrated cri- 
terion validity,25 our PAEE measure has previously 
also been shown to predict 
cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality in this cohort.27 We also adjusted 
our analyses for several relevant covariates, including 
energy intake. However, the following study limita- 
tions should also be highlighted. First, TV time was 
self-reported. Measurement error may have biased 
the associations observed towards the null, 
leading 
to an underestimation of 
the true associations. 
Furthermore, as TV time was only measured at base- 
line, changes in this behaviour might additionally 
have caused misclassification and, therefore, attenu- 
ation of the associations found. The self-report and 
categorical nature of some covariates may have re- 
sulted in residual confounding. Some confounding 
might still exist for other non-measured psychosocial 
determinants of health, such as social network inter- 
action/loneliness, which might be correlated with TV 
time, especially in older individuals.38 Finally, as we 
excluded participants with baseline chronic disease to 
minimize the possibility of reverse causality and in- 
crease internal validity, the associations found are 
cohort of healthy middle-aged 
relative 
Caucasians, and may not generalize to other popula- 
tions. Large prospective studies, using repeated meas- 
urements with longer duration of 
follow-up and 
preferably using objective measures of physical activ- 
ity and sedentary time, are warranted to extend the 
present results and confirm dose–response effects and 
indicators of population health risk on different types 
of mortality in different populations. 


in this population-based cohort of 
middle-aged Caucasians, higher levels of TV time 
increased the risk for mortality from all causes and 
CVD, independently of physical activity levels. Given 
the high prevalence of excessive TV watching, result- 
ing in a substantial PAF, these results indicate the 
importance of public health recommendations aimed 
at decreasing TV time and possibly overall sedentary 
behaviour. These recommendations should be in add- 
ition to the established public health recommenda- 
tions for physical activity.

principal 
EPIC-Norfolk study, who sadly passed away shortly 
before finalization of this manuscript. The authors 
also thank the EPIC-Norfolk staff and participants 
for their invaluable contributions. 


(cid:5) The findings from this large population-based cohort of middle-aged Caucasians indicate that each 
1-h increment in TV time is independently associated with a 4 and 7% increased risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality, respectively.
