paigns to reduce obesity and 
type 2 diabetes have largely fo- 
cused on increasing exercise 
levels, but have paid little attention to the 
reduction of sedentary behaviors. Tele- 
vision (TV) watching is a major seden- 
tary behavior in the United States. In a 
survey conducted in 1997, an adult male 
spent approximately 29 hours per week 
watching TV, and an adult female spent 
34 hours per week.1 In recent decades, 
in parallel with increasing obesity, there 
has been a steady increase in the num- 
ber of homes with multiple TV sets, vid- 
eocassette recorders (VCRs), cable TV, 
and remote controls, as well as the num- 
ber of hours spent watching TV.1 
Compared with other sedentary ac- 
tivities such as sewing, playing board 
games, reading, writing, and driving a 
car, TV watching results in a lower meta- 
bolic rate.2 Constant exposure to food ad- 
vertising leads to increased food and calo- 
rie intake and unhealthy eating 
patterns.3-5 It is well established that pro- 
longed TV watching is associated with 
obesity in children.6-8 However, the role 
of TV watching compared with other 
sedentary behaviors, such as sitting at 
work or reading, in the development of 
obesity and type 2 diabetes among adults 
Context Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have 
largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction 
of sedentary behaviors. 
Objective To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, espe- 
cially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women. 
Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992 
to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses’ Health Study. The obesity analy- 
sis included 50277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and 
were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed 
questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analy- 
sis included 68497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes melli- 
tus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. 

Results During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5%) of 50277 women who had a BMI 
of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI (cid:1)30). Overall, we documented 1515 new 
cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of 
obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, ex- 
ercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching 
was associated with a 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-30%) increase in obe- 
sity and a 14% (95% CI, 5%-23%) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in 
sitting at work was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 0%-10%) increase in obesity and a 
7% (95% CI, 0%-16%) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at 
home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9% (95% CI, 6%-12%) reduction in obesity and a 
12% (95% CI, 7%-16%) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking 
was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%-29%) reduction in obesity and a 34% (95% 
CI, 27%-41%) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30% (95% CI, 
24%-36%) of new cases of obesity and 43% (95% CI, 32%-52%) of new cases of 
diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle ((cid:2)10 h/wk of TV 
watching and (cid:1)30 min/d of brisk walking). 
Conclusions Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watch- 
ing, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, 
whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. 
This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other 
sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.

has not been well studied, especially 
among women. We therefore exam- 
ined prospectively the relationship be- 
tween several common sedentary behav- 
iors and incidence of obesity and type 2 
diabetes in a large cohort of women. 
METHODS 
Study Participants 
The Nurses’ Health Study cohort was es- 
tablished in 1976 when 121700 female 
registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years and 
residing in 1 of 11 US states responded 
to mailed questionnaires regarding their 
medical history and health practices; de- 
tails have been published elsewhere.9 For 
this study, we excluded women with di- 
agnosed cardiovascular disease 
(n=3102), cancer (n=9917), or diabe- 
tes (n=4373) in 1992. The final sample 
for the diabetes analysis consisted of 
68497 women. For the obesity analy- 
sis, we also excluded women who were 
already obese (body mass index [BMI] 
(cid:1)30) in 1992 or earlier cycles, leaving 
50277 women in the final analysis. 
Assessment of Sedentary 
Behaviors and Physical Activity 
In 1992, participants were asked to re- 
port their average weekly time spent sit- 
ting at home while watching TV or 
VCR, sitting at work or away from home 
or while driving, and other sitting at 
home (eg, reading, meal times, at desk). 
They were also asked to report time 
spent standing or walking around at 
home or at work. The responses in- 
cluded 9 categories (ranging from 0 
h/wk to (cid:3)90 h/wk). In the current 
analyses, 5 categories were coded con- 
sistently across all the 5 items (0-1, 2-5, 
6-20, 21-40, and (cid:3)40 h/wk). 
In 1992, 1994, and 1996, partici- 
pants were asked the amount of time 
they spent on average per week on each 
of the following physical activities: walk- 
ing, jogging, running, bicycling, calis- 
thenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing 
machine, lap swimming, squash/ 
racquetball, and tennis. They were also 
asked about their usual walking pace, 
specified as easy/casual ((cid:2)2 miles per 
hour [mph]), normal (2-2.9 mph), brisk 
(3-3.9 mph), or very brisk/striding ((cid:1)4 
mph). From this information, weekly 
energy expenditure in metabolic equiva- 
lent hours (MET-hours) was calcu- 
lated.2 For example, brisk walking re- 
quires an energy expenditure of about 
4 METs and is considered to be a mod- 
erate-intensity activity. In this cohort, 
walking is the most common type of ac- 
tivity (60% of all women reported that 
they walked (cid:1)1 h/wk). Because the re- 
sults using baseline and updated physi- 
cal activity measures were similar, we re- 
ported only baseline analyses. 
The reproducibility and validity of the 
physical activity questionnaire has been 
described elsewhere.10 In a representa- 
tive sample (n=147) of participants in 
the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort, the 
2-year test-retest correlation for activity 
was 0.59. The correlation between physi- 
cal activity reported on 1-week recalls 
and that reported on the questionnaire 
was 0.79. The correlation between ac- 
tivity reported in diaries and that re- 
ported on the questionnaire was 0.62. In 
a separate study on a population aged 20 
to 59 years recruited from a university 
community (n=103), the correlation be- 
tween physical activity score on a very 
similar questionnaire and maximum oxy- 
gen consumption was 0.54.11 In a par- 
allel cohort of men, average hours of TV 
watching were significantly associated 
with higher levels of leptin and low- 
density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower 
levels of high-density lipoprotein cho- 
lesterol and apolipoprotein A1.12 
Assessment of Obesity 
Body weight was self-reported in the bien- 
nial questionnaires. Self-reported weights 
were highly correlated with measured 
weights (r=0.96; mean difference, 1.5 
kg).13 In 1976, the nurses were asked to 
report their height to the closest inch. 
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by the square 
of height in meters. Incidence of obesity 
is defined as the transition from non- 
obese (BMI (cid:2)30) in 1992 to a BMI of 30 
or more at the end of follow-up in 1998. 
Thus, only individuals with a BMI of less 
than 30 across all time points (between 
1976 and 1992) were included in the obe- 
sity analysis (n=50277). 
Diagnosis of Diabetes 
A supplementary questionnaire regard- 
ing symptoms, diagnostic tests, and hy- 
poglycemic therapy was mailed to 
women who indicated on any biennial 
questionnaire that they had been diag- 
nosed with diabetes. A case of diabetes 
was considered confirmed if at least 1 
of the following was reported on the 
supplementary questionnaire: (1) clas- 
sic symptoms plus elevated glucose lev- 
els (a fasting plasma glucose concentra- 
tion (cid:1)140 mg/dL [7.7 mmol/L] or a 
randomly measured concentration of at 
least 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]); (2) at 
least 2 elevated plasma glucose concen- 
trations on different occasions in the ab- 
sence of symptoms (levels as above or 
(cid:1)200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L] after (cid:1)2 
hours of oral glucose tolerance test- 
ing); and (3) treatment with oral hypo- 
glycemic agents or insulin. Our criteria 
for diabetes classification are consis- 
tent with those proposed by the Na- 
tional Diabetes Data Group.14 
The validity of this diagnostic proce- 
dure has been verified in a subsample 
of this study population.15 In addition, 
another substudy assessing the preva- 
lence of undiagnosed diabetes sug- 
gested a very low rate of false-negative 
results.16 
Statistical Analysis 
Person-time for each participant was cal- 
culated from the date of return of the 
1992 questionnaires to the date of con- 
firmed type 2 diabetes (for diabetes 
analysis only), the year of first reported 
obesity (for obesity analysis only), death 
from any cause, or June 1, 1998, which- 
ever came first. Incidence rates of obe- 
sity or type 2 diabetes were obtained by 
dividing the number of cases by person- 
years in each category of average time 
spent on each sedentary behavior (eg, 
TV watching). Relative risks (RRs) were 
computed as the incidence rate in a spe- 
cific category of TV watching divided by 
that in the reference category, with ad- 
justment for 5-year age categories. Tests 
for linear trend across increasing cat- 
egories of average time spent watching 
TV were conducted by treating the cat- 
egories as a continuous variable and as- 




signing the middle score for the cat- 
egory as its value. 
We used Cox regression to adjust es- 
timated incidence rate ratios simulta- 
neously for potential confounding vari- 
ables. In the multivariate analyses of 
onset of obesity, we adjusted for age 
((cid:2)50, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, (cid:1)65 years), 
smoking (never, past, current 1-14, 15- 
24, and (cid:1)25 cigarettes/d), alcohol con- 
sumption (0, 0.1-4.9, 5-14.9, (cid:1)15 g/d), 
and physical activity (METs in quintiles). 
We further adjusted for dietary vari- 
ables including total energy intake, total 
fat, glycemic load, and cereal fiber (all in 
quintiles). For multivariate analyses of 
diabetes, our covariates included age, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and fam- 
ily history of diabetes. Further analyses 
adjusted for dietary intakes of polyun- 
saturated fat, glycemic load, cereal fi- 
ber, and trans fat (all in quintiles).17 
We calculated the population- 
attributable risk to estimate the percent- 
ages of obesity and type 2 diabetes cases 
in this population that are attributable 
to the joint effects of 2 risk factors (ei- 
ther (cid:3)10 h/wk of TV watching or (cid:2)30 
min/d walking or equivalent energy 
expenditure).18 P=.05 was considered 
significant. Statistical analysis was per- 
formed using SAS statistical software, ver- 
sion 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 
RESULTS 
Women who spent more time watch- 
ing TV were more likely to smoke and 
drink alcohol and less likely to exer- 
cise (TABLE 1). However, the correla- 
tion between TV watching and physi- 
cal activity levels was minimal 
(r = −0.03). These women also had 
higher intake of total energy, total and 
saturated fats, red meat, processed meat, 
refined grain products, snacks, sweets/ 
desserts, and lower intakes of fish, veg- 
etables, fruits, and whole grains. 
During 6 years of follow-up (282141 
person years), 3757 women who were 
not obese at baseline (7.5%) became 
obese in 1998. Time spent watching TV 
was positively associated with risk of 
obesity (TABLE 2). The age-adjusted 
RRs across categories of TV watching 
(0-1, 2-5, 6-20, 21-40, (cid:3)40 h/wk) were 
1.0, 1.23, 1.42, 1.68, and 2.00, respec- 
tively (P for trend, (cid:2) .001). Further ad-

justment for exercise levels and other 
covariates did not appreciably alter the 
RRs. Sitting at work or away from home 
or driving was also significantly asso- 
ciated with elevated risk of obesity. In 
contrast, time spent standing or walk- 
ing around at home was associated 
with a lower risk of obesity (multivar- 
iate RR comparing extreme catego- 
ries, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.61-0.97; P for trend, (cid:2).001). Fur- 
ther adjustment for baseline BMI sub- 
stantially attenuated the RRs. The mul- 
tivariate RR comparing the extreme 
categories of TV watching was 1.29 
(95% CI, 1.01-1.66). These results sug- 
gest that women who watched more TV 
were already on a trajectory to be- 
come obese at baseline. 
During 6 years of follow-up (396900 
person-years), we documented 1515 
newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabe- 
tes. After adjustment for age, average 
time spent watching TV was signifi- 
cantly associated with increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes (TABLE 3). The RRs 
across categories of average hours spent 
watching TV per week were 1.0, 1.10, 
1.30, 1.53, and 1.98 (P for trend, 
(cid:2).001). Further adjustment for di- 
etary factors slightly attenuated the RRs. 
As expected, these RRs were substan- 
tially attenuated after further adjust- 
ment for BMI (RR comparing extreme 
categories, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.82-1.67), 
suggesting that the increased risk of dia- 
betes associated with TV watching was 
largely mediated through obesity. 
Sitting at work and other sitting at 
home (last category only) were both as- 
sociated with significantly increased risk 
of diabetes in multivariate analyses ad- 
justing for dietary and nondietary co- 
variates (Table 3). Standing or walk- 
ing around at home was associated with 
a modestly lower risk of diabetes. 
To compare the predictive role of vari- 
ous sedentary behaviors and physical ac- 
tivity, we conducted a multivariate 
analysis including simultaneously these 
behaviors (in continuous form), physi- 
cal activity (4 METs/d, equivalent to 1 
h/d of brisk walking), and nondietary 
and dietary covariates. Among various 
sedentary behaviors, time spent watch- 
ing TV was most strongly associated with 
obesity risk (FIGURE 1). For each 2-h/d

increase in time spent watching TV, 
there was a 23% (95% CI, 17%-30%) in- 
crease in obesity risk. In contrast, other 
sitting at home or standing or walking 
around home was associated with a sig- 
nificantly lower risk of obesity. Each 
1-h/d increase in brisk walking was as- 
sociated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%- 
29%) reduction in obesity. 
Watching TV was also most strongly 
associated with elevated risk of type 2 
diabetes (Figure 1). Each 2-h/d incre- 
ment in time spent watching TV was 
associated with a 14% (95% CI, 5%- 
23%) increase in diabetes risk. Stand- 
ing or walking around at home was as- 
sociated with a lower risk of diabetes 
(12% [95% CI, 7%-16%] risk reduc- 
tion for each 2-h/d increment). Brisk 
walking was strongly associated with 
a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (34% 
[95% CI, 27%-41%] risk reduction for 
each 1-h/d increment). 
To address the possibility that sur- 
veillance for diabetes may have varied 
according to physical activity levels, we 
did an analysis restricted to cases re- 
porting at least 1 symptom of diabetes 
at diagnosis. Results from this sub- 
group were not appreciably different 
from those for the entire cohort. The 
multivariate RRs across categories of av- 
erage hours spent watching TV per week 
were 1.0, 1.09, 1.30, 1.44, and 1.70. 
In multivariate analyses, we ob- 
served independent effects of TV watch- 
ing and exercise levels on obesity and 
type 2 diabetes (FIGURE 2). Compared 
with women who were in the most ac- 
tive (the highest tertile of METs/wk) 
and the lowest TV watching category 
((cid:2)6 h/wk watching TV), those who 
were in the lowest of METs per week 
and most sedentary category ((cid:1)20 h/wk 
watching TV) had a significantly in- 
creased risk of obesity (RR, 1.90; 95% 
CI, 1.61-2.24) and type 2 diabetes (RR, 
2.89; 95% CI, 2.21-3.79). 
We estimated that 30% (95% CI, 24%- 
36%) of new obesity cases and 43% (95% 
CI, 32%-52%) of type 2 diabetes cases 
could be attributable to the joint effects 
of 2 risk factors (either (cid:3)10 h/wk of TV 
watching or (cid:2)30 min/d walking or 
equivalent energy expenditure). Only 
15% of participants in our cohort be- 
longed to the joint low-risk group (de- 
fined as (cid:2)10 h/wk of TV watching and 
(cid:1)30 min/d of walking or equivalent 
energy expenditure).

consistent with our previous analysis 
showing a positive association be- 
tween prolonged TV watching and type 
2 diabetes among men in the Health Pro- 
fessionals Follow-up Study.5 Our find- 
ings extend the literature showing that 
moderate-intensity activity such as brisk 
walking is strongly protective against 
type 2 diabetes15,23-29 and indicate a con- 
tinuum in the relationship between 
physical activity levels and obesity and 
diabetes risk, and TV watching has the 
highest risk for obesity and diabetes 
among several sedentary behaviors. 
There are at least 3 potential mecha- 
nisms for the observed positive associa- 
tion between TV watching and obesity 
and diabetes risk.30 First, TV watching 
typically displaces physical activity and 
thus reduces energy expenditure.20,21 In 
our study, women who spent more time 
watching TV tended to exercise less, but 
the effects of TV watching and exercise 
on the development of obesity and dia- 
betes were largely independent. Sec- 
ond, TV watching results in increased 
food and total energy intake because in- 
dividuals tend to eat while watching TV 
despite their low physical activity lev- 
els.3-5 Also, participants who spent more 
time watching TV tended to follow an

COMMENT 
In this large prospective cohort of 
women, sedentary behaviors, espe- 
cially TV watching, were significantly 
associated with risk of obesity and type 
2 diabetes. Sedentary occupation re- 
flected by long hours of sitting or stand- 
ing at work was significantly associ- 
ated with risk of obesity. In contrast, 
even light activities such as standing or 
walking around at home (which prob- 
ably reflects household work) and brisk 
walking were associated with a signifi- 
cantly lower risk of obesity and diabe- 
tes. Our study suggests that 30% of obe- 
sity cases and 43% of type 2 diabetes 
cases can be potentially prevented by 
following a relatively active lifestyle 
((cid:2)10 h/wk TV watching and (cid:1)30 
min/d of brisk walking). 
Our results are consistent with pre- 
vious studies of TV watching in rela- 
tion to obesity and weight gain in chil- 
dren4,6,7 and adults.19-22 They are also

unhealthy eating pattern.5 Such an eat- 
ing pattern is directly related to com- 
mercial advertisements and food cues ap- 
pearing on TV31 and has been associated 
with risk of obesity and diabetes.32 An- 
other potential mechanism is that TV 
viewing results in lower energy expen- 
diture compared with other sedentary ac- 
tivities such as sewing, reading, writ- 
ing, and driving a car.2 The combinations 
of these factors may explain our find- 
ings that TV watching is more strongly 
associated with obesity than other sed- 
entary behaviors. 
Our findings could have important 
public health implications. The preva- 
lence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has 
increased dramatically in the past sev- 
eral decades in the United States.33 Al- 
though leisure-time physical activity lev- 
els are generally low in the United States, 
there is no evidence that recreational 
physical activity has declined in recent 
decades. However, sedentary lifestyle has 
become more prevalent and pervasive as 
reflected by the large numbers of TV sets, 
VCRs, and remote controls per house- 
hold and increasing time spent watch- 
ing TV in the past several decades.1 We 
speculated that increasing sedentary be- 
haviors, especially TV watching, may 
have contributed to the obesity epi- 
demic in the United States. Given the 
strong relationship observed between 
sedentary lifestyle and obesity and dia- 
betes risk, public health campaigns to re- 
duce obesity and diabetes should not 
only promote increasing exercise lev- 
els, but also decreasing sedentary behav- 
iors, especially prolonged TV watch- 
ing. Substantial health benefits can be 
gained by even light to moderate activ- 
ity such as doing household chores and 
by engaging in simple and convenient ac- 
tivities such as walking. 
The major strengths of this study in- 
clude its large sample size, prospective 
design, and detailed measures of physi- 
cal activity, sedentary behaviors, and a 
multitude of dietary and nondietary co- 
variates. However, the observational na- 
ture of this study cannot prove a causal 
relationship between TV watching and 
obesity because of the potential recip- 
rocal relationship between TV watch- 

ing behavior and obesity. This issue 
could be addressed in randomized clini- 
cal trials among adults. However, school- 
based intervention studies have al- 
ready demonstrated that reductions in 
TV watching were effective in prevent- 
ing obesity among children.8 
In conclusion, our data provide strong 
evidence that sedentary behaviors, es- 
pecially prolonged TV watching, are di- 
rectly related to obesity and diabetes risk. 
In contrast, even light- to moderate- 
intensity activity substantially lowers the 
risk. While these findings lend further 
support to current guidelines that pro- 
mote physical activity, they also sug- 
gest the importance of reducing seden- 
tary behaviors in the prevention of 
obesity and type 2 diabetes.
