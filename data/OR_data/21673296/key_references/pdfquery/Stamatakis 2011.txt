The aim of this study was to examine the independent relationships of television viewing or other screen-based 
entertainment (“screen time”) with all-cause mortality and clinically conﬁrmed cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
events. A secondary objective was to examine the extent to which metabolic (body mass index, high-density li- 
poprotein and total cholesterol) and inﬂammatory (C-reactive protein) markers mediate the relationship between 
screen time and CVD events. 
Although some evidence suggests that prolonged sitting is linked to CVD risk factor development regardless of 
physical activity participation, studies with hard outcomes are scarce. 
A population sample of 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents ((cid:1)35 years) were followed up 
to 2007 for all-cause mortality and CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined). Main exposures were interviewer- 
assessed screen time ((cid:1)2 h/day; 2 to (cid:1)4 h/day; and (cid:1)4 h/day) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. 
Two hundred ﬁfteen CVD events and 325 any-cause deaths occurred during 19,364 follow-up person-years. The 
covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status, diabetes, 
hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 
2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95% CI: 1.33 to 3.96) for participants engaging in (cid:1)4 h/day of screen time 
relative to (cid:1)2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause mortal- 
ity: HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with 
CVD events in the ﬁrst 2 years of follow-up and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appre- 
ciably. Approximately 25% of the association between screen time and CVD events was explained collectively by 
C-reactive protein, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 

Recreational sitting, as reﬂected by television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality and CVD risk 
regardless of physical activity participation. Inﬂammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this 
relationship. 

There is indisputable evidence on the links between physical 
activity and risk for premature death (1). Some emerging 
published reports consistently suggest that excessive seden- 
tary behavior (as characterized by those activities involving

sitting) might be linked to increased risk for obesity (2,3), 
dyslipidemia (4), plasma glucose levels (5), and the meta- 
bolic syndrome (6) independently of moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity participation. Television viewing and 
screen-based entertainment (screen time) in general seems 
to be the most important indicator of nonoccupational 
sitting behavior (7). Recent time-use surveys (8 –10) indi- 
cate that, aside from sleeping, watching TV is the behavior 
that occupies the most time in the domestic setting. 
If sitting or total sedentary time is established to be inde- 
pendently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), clin- 
ical and public health recommendations should explicitly ad- 
dress sitting in addition to physical activity; currently they do

not (11). Because only a minority of adults in western popu- 
lations participate regularly in sport and exercise activities 
(12,13), and those who do not take part in sports are more 
likely to develop CVD or die prematurely (14), it might be 
possible to reduce the risk of nonparticipants by restricting 
sitting time and increasing nonexercise activity (e.g., 
standing and ambulating) throughout the day (15). There is no 
conclusive evidence obtained from comparing the feasibility or 
long-term effectiveness of interventions designed to increase 
formal exercise versus decreasing sitting behavior during the 
day. However, the latter approach might be more promising in 
terms of long-term adherence, because it will involve more 
subtle lifestyle changes and fewer of the commonly cited 
barriers (16) for joining a sporting or lifestyle exercise program. 
The primary aim of this study was to examine the 
relationships of leisure-time sitting behavior (indexed from 
screen time) with all-cause mortality and CVD events while 
taking multiple measures to address reverse causality. Be- 
cause it is also important to understand the mechanisms 
through which sedentary behavior might inﬂuence cardio- 
vascular risk, a secondary aim was to determine the extent to 
which several biomarkers explain these relationships. 

Sample and outcomes. The 2003 Scottish Health Survey 
(SHS03) was a household-based survey that recruited a 
population sample with multistage, stratiﬁed probability 
sampling with postcode sectors selected at the ﬁrst stage and 
household addresses selected at the second stage (17). 
Ethical approval was granted by the Local Research Ethics 
Councils. Of eligible adults, 83% consented to take part in 
the survey. The SHS03 data were linked to the Scottish 
Information Division Database (ISD) patient-based data- 
base of hospital episodes (from 1981 onwards) and deaths 
up to December 2007. The linked data are of excellent 
quality—the ISD database has demonstrated 94% accuracy 
and 99% completeness when samples of computerized CVD 
records from the Scottish national database were compared 
with the original patient case notes. Information on deaths 
was ascertained from the General Registrar Ofﬁce for 
Scotland. Classiﬁcation of the underlying cause of death is 
based on information collected on the medical certiﬁcate of 
cause of death together with any additional information pro- 
vided subsequently by the certifying doctor. All the relevant 
details regarding the ISD can be found at the ISD Scotland 
website. Diagnoses for CVD cause of death was recorded with 
the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases-9 (codes 390-459) 
and -10 (codes I01-I99). An event was deﬁned as CVD- 
related hospital episode (including myocardial infarction, cor- 
onary artery bypass, angioplasty, stroke, heart failure) or CVD- 
related death. The potentially eligible sample comprised 6,353 
adults ((cid:1)35 years), of which 5,814 (91.5% of eligible) con- 
sented to their records being linked to records of mortality, 
hospital episodes, and cancer registration. Among these, 1,302 
(22.4% of consenting) were lost to follow-up, leaving 4,512 
respondents (1,964 male) who 
comprised the core sample for the 
present study (71.0% of eligible). 
We carried out comparisons be- 
tween those who consented and 
those who did not consent to be 
followed up with likelihood ratios 
(categorical variables) or Student t 
tests (continuous variables). Com- 
pared with those who did not con- 
sent, those who consented were 
older; reported fewer moderate-to- 
vigorous physical activity and more screen time min/week; and 
more likely to be from nonmanual social class, white, not to be 
married, to have a body mass index (BMI) under 30 kg/m2, to 
be current or former cigarette smokers, to have long-standing 
illness, to be inactive at work, to have been diagnosed with 
hypertension, and not to meet the physical activity recommen- 
dations. We also carried out comparisons between those 1,302 
participants who were lost to follow-up and those 4,512 who 
were retained in the analyses. Those who were lost to 
follow-up were younger and reported more moderate-to- 
vigorous physical activity and less screen time min/week than 
those who were retained. They were also were more likely to be 
from nonmanual social class, to be single, to be current or 
ex-cigarette smokers, to be free from long-standing illness and 
doctor-diagnosed hypertension, and to meet the physical 
activity recommendations.

Analyses with cardiovascular events as the outcome ex- 
cluded 340 respondents who had cardiovascular hospital 
episodes according to the linked patient-based database 
between 1981 and before baseline testing. To minimize the 
chances of reverse causality due to prodromal/undiagnosed 
disease, we repeated the analyses after excluding another 48 
participants with cardiovascular events in the ﬁrst 24 
months of follow-up (CVD analysis). We also repeated the 
analysis after excluding the 295 participants who had cancer 
registrations before baseline. 
Exposures, confounders, and potentially mediating variables. 
The main exposure was screen time. Two questions en- 
quired about screen time on weekdays (“Thinking of week- 
days, how much time on average day do you spend watching 
TV or another type of screen such as a computer, or video 
game? Please do not include any time spent in front of a 
screen while at school, college or work”) and weekend days 
(with an equivalent question). Although there is no infor- 
mation on the reliability and criterion validity of the screen 
time questions, the previously reported (2) consistent direct 
correlations of screen time with waist circumference and 
BMI and the inverse correlation with physical activity 
support their convergent validity. Nonoccupational physical 
activity questions included frequency (days in the last 4 
weeks) and duration (min/day) of heavy housework (e.g., 
scrubbing ﬂoors), heavy do-it-yourself/gardening (e.g., dig- 
ging, building work), walking (14), and any leisure-time 
exercise (e.g., cycling, swimming, aerobics, calisthenics,

gym, dancing, football) (12). Occupational physical activity 
was assessed by asking respondents how physically active 
they are at work (very/fairly active, not very/not at all active). 
Their response was combined with information on their 
occupation with the Standard Occupational Classiﬁcation 
1990 (18) to classify work activity. The criterion validity of 
the physical activity questionnaire is supported by an accel- 
erometry study on 106 British adults (19). Height, weight, 
socioeconomic status, health status, and other health behav- 
iors were measured by trained interviewers with standard 
protocols (2,17). In a separate visit, trained nurses collected 
nonfasting blood samples with standard protocols and 
procedures that have been described previously in detail 
(14,20). Blood sample analytes used in the present analysis 
were C-reactive protein (CRP), high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol (17,21). 
Variable handling and statistical analysis. Screen time 
was grouped as (cid:1)2 h/day; (cid:1)2 h/day (cid:1)4 h/day; (cid:1)4 h/day. 
The choice of 2 h/day as a cutoff for the lowest screen time 
group is consistent with recommendations for children 
(20,22) that make speciﬁc references to TV. The same cutoff 
has been used in publications similar to ours (23). The main 
confounding variable was nonoccupational moderate-to- 
vigorous physical activity, which was entered in the statis- 
tical models as min/day. Other covariables entered into the 
models were sex, age, BMI ((cid:1)25, 25 to 30, (cid:2)30 kg/m2), 
social class (I, II, III nonmanual, III manual, IV/V non- 
manual), doctor-diagnosed diabetes and hypertension, long- 
standing illness, marital status (single/never married, mar- 
ried, separated/divorced, and widowed), smoking (never, 
ex, current smoker), and occupational physical activity 
(inactive/light/moderate-to-vigorous). 
For individuals who survived and remained CVD-free, 
data were censored to December 2007. The Cox propor- 
tional hazards model was used with months as the time scale 
to estimate the risk of death from any cause or the risk of 
CVD event by screen time level. The proportional hazards 
assumption was examined by comparing the cumulative 
hazard plots grouped on exposure, although no appreciable 
violations were noted. Test for linear trend was obtained by 
entering the categorical variables as continuous parameters 
in the models. We applied Cox models that were adjusted 
for age and sex (Model 1), plus all covariables minus 
physical activity (Model 2), plus physical activity (Model 3). 
To account for the skewed distribution of physical activity, 
in an alternative analysis we re-ran the Cox models with 
physical activity as a categorical variable (no physical activity 
vs. some physical activity, (cid:1)150 min/week vs. (cid:1)150 min/ 
week), but because results were not appreciably different, we 
the models with the continuous physical 
only present 
activity variables. To further address the issue of reverse 
causality, we repeated the Cox models after excluding CVD 
events occurring during the ﬁrst year of follow-up and 
cancer registrations before baseline. In another analysis we 
excluded events in the ﬁrst 2 years of follow-up and cancer 
registrations. In these analyses, we dichotomized the screen 
time variable to (cid:1)2 and (cid:1)2 h/day to preserve statistical 
power. For the same reason, we used the same dichotomous 
screen time variable when we stratiﬁed our analyses by sex, 
physical activity level ((cid:1)150 min/week vs. (cid:1)150 min/week; 
no physical activity/any physical activity), BMI level ((cid:1)25 
kg/m2 vs. (cid:1)25 kg/m2), and smoking (noncurrent smoker vs. 
current smoker). To provide a direct comparison for the 
potential hazard of screen time and the potential beneﬁt of 
physical activity, we ran analogous Cox models with phys- 
ical activity as the main exposure with adjustments for: 1) 
age and sex; 2) plus nonscreen time covariables; 3) plus 
screen time. To enable direct comparisons, both screen time 
and physical activity were entered as continuous variables in 
this analysis. 
To test the extent to which certain biological risk factors 
explained the association between sedentary time and car- 
diovascular events, we used a method similar to that used by 
us (21) and others (24). This method involved: 1) separately 
adding CRP, BMI, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol 
into a basic (sex-, age-, and physical activity-adjusted) Cox 
model; and 2) using the following formula to calculate 
proportion of CVD risk explained by each biological risk 
factor: 
HR basic model (cid:2) HR adjusted 
HR basic model (cid:2) 1 

The CRP was log transformed to improve normality of 
distribution. All blood variables and BMI were included as 
continuous variables. Analyses were also run entering risk 
markers as categorical variables, although this did not 
appreciably alter the results. We used analysis of variance 
with Scheffe post hoc tests and chi-square tests to examine 
univariable relationships of the confounders or potential 
mediators with the exposure variables. 
Analyses were performed with SPSS (version 13, SPSS, 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois), and all tests of statistical signiﬁcance 
were based on 2-sided probability. 

A total of 325 any-cause deaths (153 in men) and 215 
incident cardiovascular events (107 in men) occurred during 
4.3 ((cid:3)0.5) years of average follow-up and 19,364 person- 
years at risk in the core sample. Table 1 presents the 
descriptive characteristics of the core sample.

h/day of screen time, and CVD event risk increased with 
(cid:1)2 h/day of screen time. Adjusting for physical activity 
made very little difference in both types of analyses (Table 2). 
Excluding deaths or CVD events in the ﬁrst year of follow-up 
and participants with previous cancer registration slightly 
weakened the associations (Table 3). Results were robust to

effect estimates were markedly consistent 
There was little evidence for an association between screen 
time and CVD events among those who reported long- 
standing illness (n (cid:4) 2,234; 158 CVD events): fully adjusted 
HR for (cid:1)4 h/day: 1.70, 95% CI: 0.94 to 3.09, p (cid:4) 0.15. 
Despite the small number of events among those with no 
long-standing illness (n (cid:4) 2,016, 55 CVD events) and the 
corresponding wide CIs, there was some evidence for an 
association: HR for (cid:1)4 h/day: 6.51, 95% CI: 1.47 to 28.8, 
p (cid:4) 0.046). 
Explanatory analysis. A total of 1,928 cases had valid data 
in all 4 potentially mediating variables (BMI, CRP, total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol), corresponding to 70 CVD 
events, and were entered in the explanatory analysis. Com- 
pared with those excluded, those included had lower mean 
age, higher physical activity (p (cid:4) 0.002), and lower screen 
time (p (cid:4) 0.001) and were more likely to be married (p (cid:4) 
0.02), have a BMI over 30 kg/m2, have a long-standing 
illness (p (cid:1) 0.001), be inactive at work (p (cid:1) 0.001), not to 
have been diagnosed with hypertension (p (cid:1) 0.001), not to 
have had a CVD event (p (cid:1) 0.001), and to have met the 
physical activity recommendations (p (cid:1) 0.001) (data not 
shown). Figure 1 presents the extent to which BMI, HDL 
and total cholesterol, and CRP explain the associations 
between screen time and CVD events. CRP explained CVD 
events to the greatest extent (18%), which was equal to the 
amount explained by the 3 metabolic factors together. 
These 4 biological factors explained approximately 28% of 
the screen time–CVD association, with 25% explained by 
BMI, HDL cholesterol, and CRP. These 3 variables (but 
not total cholesterol) met the statistical criteria for being a 
mediator variable (25). 

Our results suggest that there is an independent, deleterious 
relationship of screen-based recreational sitting time with 
CVD events and all-cause mortality. Compared with those 
spending (cid:1)2 h/day on screen-based entertainment, there 
was a 48% increased risk of all-cause mortality in those 
spending (cid:1)4 h/day and an approximately 125% increase in 
risk of CVD events in those spending (cid:1)2 h/day (Table 3). 
These associations were independent of traditional risk 
factors such as smoking, hypertension, BMI, social class, as 
well as physical activity. Our all-cause mortality results are 
in agreement with a large study of Canadian adults who 
were followed up for 12 years, where the all-cause mortality 
HR for the highest category of nonrecreational (work, 
school, housework) daily sitting time (“almost all the time”) 
was 1.54 (26). Another study among (cid:2)8,000 Australian 
adults reported a very similar all-cause mortality HR (1.46) 
for (cid:1)4 h of TV watching compared with the (cid:1)2 h/day 
reference group (23). Both studies were also robust for 
adjustments or stratiﬁcations by sex, physical activity level, 
smoking, and BMI. The Canadian study, however, had 
minimal control of physical health at baseline, which makes 
reverse causation a strong possibility (26). In contrast, we

were able to exclude respondents with objectively veriﬁed 
CVD/cancer at baseline and adjust for multiple indicators of 
health. Our study speciﬁcally examined recreational seden- 
tary time. Because the largest proportion of sitting time for 
many people is spent at work and in many circumstances is 
difﬁcult to modify, our data imply that reduced recreational 
sitting time might be linked to reduced risk. Although we 
found no evidence of a dose-response relationship, our 
analysis suggests that a threshold of (cid:1)2 h/day of screen time 
might be linked to an increased risk for a CVD event. The 
Australian study (23) found that daily TV viewing times in 
excess of 4 h/day (but not 2 to 4 h/day) were associated with 
CVD death risk. We speculate that this disagreement 
occurs because our exposure variable was more inclusive 
than TV alone that was used in the Australian study and 
because our CVD outcome included nonfatal as well as fatal 
events. We were not able to demonstrate, in contrast to the 
Canadian (26) study, a clear relationship between screen 
time and CVD events among those who meet the physical 
activity recommendations and among those with a BMI 
(cid:1)25 kg/m2 (Online Table 1). In this analysis, there were 
only 50 events, and as such, we speculate that the lack of a 
robust and statistically important association was due to 
limited statistical power. Nevertheless, the direction of the 
association was markedly consistent across all strata, lending 
support to our main conclusion that screen time is an 
independent predictor of CVD events. Another large study 
among U.S. women, Manson et al. (27), found that extreme 
amounts of sitting ((cid:2)16 h/day) were linked to an increased 
risk for incident CVD compared with (cid:1)4 h/day after 6 
years of follow-up. Such levels of sitting imply that an 
individual spends their entire waking time sitting, but there 
was no evidence for adverse effects of smaller amounts of 
daily sitting (27). 
Biological mediators. The precise pathways linking sitting 
and cardio-metabolic disease are unclear. It has been sug- 
gested that metabolic mechanisms might partly explain 
these links (15), and data from animals have demonstrated 
that prolonged sitting might disturb lipid metabolism. 
There is evidence for a dramatic reduction of lipoprotein 
lipase activity (by 80% to 90%) during sitting compared with 
standing up or ambulating (28). Lipoprotein lipase is a key 
enzyme for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins 
in the endothelium, and its reduced activity might raise the 
possibility of other metabolic actions being impaired (15). 
Our study provides novel ﬁndings to suggest a role of 
metabolic and inﬂammatory pathways in partly explaining 
the association between sitting and CVD risk. A well- 
established marker of low-grade inﬂammation, CRP, was 
approximately 3-fold higher in participants spending more 
than 4 h/day in screen time and explained a substantial 
amount of 
the screen time–CVD association. Because 
screen time was assessed at the same time point as the risk 
markers, we cannot establish the nature of the temporal 
relationship between these factors. Nevertheless, our results 
are in concordance with another study of ours with clear 
temporal element, which found that TV viewing at age 23 
years was independently associated with composite factors 
of metabolic (including HDL and BMI) and hemostatic/ 
inﬂammatory (including CRP) but not with cholesterol 

Extent to Which Biological Risk Factors Explain Association

(total or LDL) biomarkers at 42 years (29) (Stamatakis et al., 
unpublished observations, January to February, 2010). Both 
sets of our results are partly corroborated by experimental data 
in humans. The induction of 5 days bed rest, which represents 
an extreme form of sedentary behavior, had profound effects on 
various metabolic risk (including insulin resistance and vascular 
dysfunction) but not on inﬂammation (30). Thus, low-grade 
inﬂammation might only result from chronic exposure to 
sedentary lifestyle. A further important mechanism might 
be related to a decreased expression of endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase that is caused from reduced local shear stress 
as a result of lower blood ﬂow from excessive sitting. Further 
experimental studies will be required to determine the exact 
mechanisms accounting for increased CVD risk during 
prolonged inactivity in humans. 
Strengths. The main strengths of this study are the de- 
tailed measures we were able to take to minimize reverse 
causality, the many potential confounders we included in 
our models, and the objectively conﬁrmed CVD events. 
Other strengths include the nationally representative sample 
that is expected to have adequate variability in terms of 
primary and secondary exposures, and therefore it is appro- 
priate to examine the relationships of interest. 
Study limitations. Screen time was self-reported. The TV 
and computer use questions have been shown to underesti- 
mate sedentary time when compared with accelerometry 
(31). Although we have no information on the reliability 
and criterion validity of the SHS03 screen time questions, 
we observed the expected associations of screen time with 
various sociodemographic variables, which provides conver- 
gent validity evidence of the screen time data. It is also 
encouraging that a recent review (7) concluded that TV and 
computer use time questions have the strongest reliability 
and validity among sitting-related questions. Although 
screen time is a partial indicator of overall sitting, TV and 
computer use account for the overwhelming proportion of 
leisure time sitting among British adults (32). Also, screen 
entertainment time tends to be associated with excess calorie 
consumption, but we were unable to account for dietary 
intake, although our results were independent of BMI. 
Finally, our explanatory analyses were limited by the small 
sample size available, due to limited compliance with blood 
measurements. 

We found a deleterious relationship between recreational 
sitting and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. 
Our analyses suggest the relationship is independent of 
physical activity, although further studies that employ ob- 
jective measures of activity and sedentary time are required 
to conﬁrm this. We also provide evidence to suggest a role 
of metabolic and inﬂammatory pathways in partly explain- 
ing the association between sitting and CVD risk. Further 
experimental studies will be required to determine the exact 
mechanisms. Our results support the inclusion of a seden- 
tary behavior guideline in public health recommendations 
for CVD prevention.
