Background: The aim of the present study was to examine whether the 
amount of time spent watching television is a potential risk factor for inci- 
dent diabetes and to what extent this association may be explained by 
obesity. 
Methods: We used data for 23 855 men and women from the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam Study. Dur- 
ing an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants developed diabe- 
tes. Incident diabetes was identiﬁed on the basis of self-report and was 
veriﬁed by contacting the patient’s attending physician. The amount of 
time spent watching television was self-reported. 
Results: The mean time that 
the participants who developed diabetes 
watched television was 2.4 h ⁄ week, compared with 2.0 h ⁄ week for those 
who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, 
educational status, smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, phys- 
ical activity, the intake of various foods, and systolic blood pressure, the 
adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes among participants who watched 
‡4 h ⁄ day of television compared with those who watched <1 h ⁄ day was 
1.63 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.17–2.27]. After additional adjustment 
for waist circumference and body mass index, the hazard ratio was reduced 
to 1.14 (95% CI: 0.81–1.61). 
Conclusions: In the present study, the amount of time spent watching tele- 
vision was an independent predictor of incident diabetes only in models that 
adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and systolic 
blood pressure. The attenuation of the association after adjusting for anthro- 
pometric measures may represent an explanatory mechanism for our ﬁndings.

Inadequate physical activity is a well recognized risk 
factor for diabetes. Most prospective studies of diabe- 
tes have generally examined the associations between 
various forms of energy expenditure and incident dia- 
betes. Less well understood is the association between 
sedentary behavior and incident diabetes. In two large 
cohort studies, the amount of television viewing was 
found to be a signiﬁcant independent risk factor for 
developing diabetes.1,2 
There are several reasons for focusing on the associ- 
ations between television viewing and chronic con- 
ditions such as diabetes. First, cross-sectional and 




prospective studies have linked the amount of televi- 
sion viewing with an increased risk of obesity, a major 
risk factor for diabetes.3,4 Second, television viewing 
has been associated with obesity and diabetes indepen- 
dently of physical activity.1,2 Thus, the act of television 
viewing may denote more than the absence of physical 
activity. Third, messages to promote physical activity 
in the population may not only need to convince peo- 
ple to engage in adequate levels of physical activity 
but may also need to discourage excessive sedentary 
behavior. Finally, an increased risk of developing dia- 
betes attributable to excess sedentary behavior has 
potential implications for clinicians and public health 
practitioners. 
Few studies have examined the association between 
television watching and incident diabetes prospectively. 
Establishing these relationships in different countries 
and cultures is important, because the differences in 
attendant behaviors could affect the risk of adverse 
outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was 
to examine data from a large German prospective 
study to address this association. Because the pathway 
from excessive television viewing to incident diabetes is 
likely to lead through obesity to a considerable extent, 
we hypothesized that any increase in the risk of diabe- 
tes from excessive television viewing would be attenu- 
ated by adjusting for anthropometric measures. 

Study population 
In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer 
and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam Study, Germany, men 
aged 40–65 years and women aged 35–65 years were 
the target of recruitment. In total, 27 548 subjects 
(16 644 women and 10 904 men) from the general pop- 
ulation joined the study between 1994 and 1998.5 The 
baseline examination included anthropometric mea- 
surements, a personal interview including questions on 
prevalent diseases, a questionnaire on sociodemograph- 
ic and lifestyle characteristics, and a food frequency 
to identify 
questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaires 
incident cases of diabetes mellitus have been adminis- 
tered every 2–3 years since. The response rates for each 
of the waves of follow-up exceeded 90%. We also con- 
sidered questionnaires that were part of the ongoing 
fourth wave of 
follow-up and were sent out until 
31 January 2005. By 31 August 2005, 90% had been 
returned. Consent was obtained from all participants 
in the study and approval was given by the Ethical 
Committee of the State of Brandenburg, Germany. 
Participants with diabetes at baseline were excluded 
from the analyses. Self-reported diabetes mellitus at 
baseline was evaluated by a physician using informa- 
tion on self-reported medical diagnoses, medication 
records, and dieting behavior. Uncertainties regarding 
a proper diagnosis were clariﬁed with the participant 
or the treating physician. A total of 23 855 partici- 
pants (9167 men, 14 688 women) who had complete 
information for the study variables were included in 
the analyses. 

Potentially incident cases of diabetes were identiﬁed 
via self-reports of a diabetes diagnosis, diabetes-rele- 
vant medication, or dietary treatment due to diabetes. 
All potentially incident cases were veriﬁed by question- 
naires that were mailed to the diagnosing physician 
asking about the date and type of diagnosis, diagnostic 
tests, and treatment of diabetes. Only cases with a phy- 
sician diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revi- 
sion: E11; http://apps.who.int/classiﬁcations/apps/icd/ 
icd10online/, accessed 27 July 2009) and a diagnosis 
date after the baseline examination were considered as 
conﬁrmed incident cases of T2DM. 

The amount of time each week that a participant spent 
watching television was assessed with the following 
question administered at baseline: ‘‘On average, how 
many h ⁄ day did you watch television during the last 
12 months?’’ 

We included the following covariates from the baseline 
data collection: age, sex, educational status, smoking 
status, alcohol use, physical strain at work, physical 
activity (h ⁄ week of walking, gardening, bicycling, and 
performing sports), waist circumference, body mass 
index (BMI), 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 
intakes of red meat, coffee, whole-grain bread, fruits 
and vegetables, pizza, soda, cake, chips, dessert, total 
energy, total fat, saturated fat, protein, and carbo- 
hydrates. 
Information on educational attainment, 
smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, and 
physical activity was assessed with a self-administered 
questionnaire and a personal interview. The physical 
activity questions, which were developed for the EPIC 
study, included questions about bicycling (a common 
mode of transportation in the Potsdam area), sports 
activities, and gardening. The food frequency question- 
naire in this study included 148 of the 158 food items 




originally tested for the German cohorts of the EPIC 
study.6,7 Anthropometric measurement procedures fol- 
lowed standard protocols under strict quality control. 

Differences in baseline characteristics by incident dia- 
betes status were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
for continuous variables. Linear trends for continuous 
variables across categories of time spent watching tele- 
vision were evaluated using linear regression analysis, 
and trends for categorical variables were assessed with 
the Cochran–Mantel–Haenzel test. Cox proportional 
hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios 
(HRs) and the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Age was 
used as the primary time-dependent variable in all 
models, with entry time deﬁned as the subject’s age at 
recruitment and exit time as the date of diagnosis of 
diabetes, death, or return of the last follow-up ques- 
tionnaire. All analyses were performed with sas release 
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 

During 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants (534 
men, 393 women) developed diabetes. Television view- 
ing time ranged from 0 to 12 h ⁄ day. The mean time 
that participants who developed diabetes watched tele- 
vision was 2.4 h ⁄ day, compared with 2.0 h ⁄ day for 
those who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001). 
Signiﬁcant positive associations were noted between 
the amount of 
time spent watching television and 
age, the percentage of women, the percentage of par- 
ticipants who had an occupation requiring heavy or 
very heavy physical strain, waist circumference, BMI, 
SBP, the intake of alcohol and several foods, and 
time (h ⁄ week) spent walking, gardening, and play- 
ing sport (Table 1). Furthermore, signiﬁcant inverse 
associations were present for the percentage of par- 
ticipants receiving a university education, the percent- 
age of participants who never smoked, 
the intake 
of whole-grain bread, 
fruits and vegetables, and 
bicycling.

In proportional hazards analyses adjusted for soci-

watched ‡4 h ⁄ day television was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.43– 
2.78) 
compared with participants who watched 
<1 h ⁄ day television (Table 2). Adjusting for behav- 
ioral variables, such as smoking, alcohol use, and 
physical activity, reduced the HRs a bit. Additional 
adjustment 
foods 
resulted in additional small reductions in the HRs. 
However, when the model was adjusted for waist cir- 
cumference and BMI, the HRs were attenuated to the 
point being non-signiﬁcant. 



In the present study, the amount of time spent watch- 
ing television was a signiﬁcant predictor of incident 
diabetes in analyses that adjusted only for sociodemo- 
graphic factors and other lifestyle behaviors, including 
physical activity. The attenuation of 
the HR after 
adjustment for measured anthropometric variables is 
consistent with a mechanism by which excessive televi- 
sion viewing increases obesity, which, in turn, increases 
the risk for diabetes. 
There are several 
limitations to the present study. 
First, undiagnosed diabetes was not identiﬁed. How- 
ever, our estimates of relative risk should be accurate 
assuming that the association between the amount of 
time spent watching television and incident diabetes 
was similar in those with diagnosed and undiagnosed 
diabetes. Second, the amount of time spent watching 
television was self-reported and, thus, may be subject 
to recall bias. Third, despite adjusting the results for a 
substantial number of potential confounders, we may 
not have included all relevant confounders. For exam- 
ple, 
information concerning each participant’s family 
history of diabetes was not available. In addition, the 
results may be subject to residual confounding. 


spend a substantial 
amount of time watching television.8,9 There are sev- 
eral negative implications on health associated with 
television. First, 
watching an excessive amount of 




watching television represents a potential lost opportu- 
nity to engage in activities that increase energy expen- 
diture. Second, energy expenditure while watching 
television is lower than that for other sedentary activi- 
ties.10 Third, the reduction in energy expenditure may 
be compounded by increases in energy intake attribut- 
able to exposure to television commercials that may 
spur additional eating, which increases energy intake 
and possibly also the intake of foods of questionable 
nutritional value.11 Thus, reductions in the amount of 
time that people watch television could yield substan- 
tial public health beneﬁts. In pediatric populations, 
interventions that reduce the amount of time spent 
watching television have demonstrated a favorable 
effect on obesity.12 



the 
amount of time they spend watching television and 
dedicate at least some of this time to the pursuit of 
activities that 
increase energy expenditure. To this 
end, clinicians can inquire about the television viewing 
the 
habits of 
negative impact excess television viewing can have on 
their health, and suggest healthier alternatives. As part 
of comprehensive public health efforts to promote 
physical activity in the population, 
interventions 
that motivate people to decrease their pursuit of 
sedentary activities, such as television viewing, deserve 
consideration.
