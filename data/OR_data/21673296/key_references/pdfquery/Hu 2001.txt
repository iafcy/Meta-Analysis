Background: Television (TV) watching, a major sed- 
entary behavior in the United States, has been associ- 
ated with obesity. We hypothesized that prolonged TV 
watching may increase risk for type 2 diabetes. 
Methods: In 1986, 37918 men aged 40 to 75 years and 
free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer com- 
pleted a detailed physical activity questionnaire. Start- 
ing from 1988, participants reported their average weekly 
time spent watching TV on biennial questionnaires. 
Results: A total of 1058 cases of type 2 diabetes were 
diagnosed during 10 years (347040 person-years) of fol- 
low-up. After adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol use, 
and other covariates, the relative risks (RRs) for type 2 
diabetes across increasing quintiles of metabolic equiva- 
lent hours (MET-hours) per week were 1.00, 0.78, 0.65, 
0.58, and 0.51 (P for trend, (cid:44).001). Time spent watch- 
ing TV was significantly associated with higher risk for 
diabetes. After adjustment for age, smoking, physical ac- 
tivity levels, and other covariates, the RRs of diabetes 
across categories of average hours spent watching TV per 
week (0-1, 2-10, 11-20, 21-40, and (cid:46)40) were 1.00, 1.66, 
1.64, 2.16, and 2.87, respectively (P for trend, (cid:44).001). 
This association was somewhat attenuated after adjust- 
ment for body mass index, but a significant positive gra- 
dient persisted (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.31; 
P for trend, .01). 
Conclusions: Increasing physical activity is associated 
with a significant reduction in risk for diabetes, whereas 
a sedentary lifestyle indicated by prolonged TV watch- 
ing is directly related to risk. Our findings suggest the 
importance of reducing sedentary behavior in the pre- 
vention of type 2 diabetes. 


exercise in the prevention of 
strongly supports a role of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.1-8 
However, less attention has 
focused on sedentary behaviors in rela- 
tion to risk for diabetes. Television (TV) 
watching represents a major sedentary be- 
havior in the United States; on average, a 
male adult spends approximately 29 hours 
per week watching TV, and a female adult, 
34 hours per week.9 Television watching 
results in lower metabolic rate compared 
with other sedentary activities such as sew- 
ing, playing board games, reading, writ- 
ing, and driving a car.10 In several stud- 
ies, time spent watching TV has been 
strongly associated with weight gain and 
obesity in children11,12 and adults.13-15 The 
purpose of this study is to examine 
whether prolonged TV watching predicts 
subsequent diabetes risk independent of 
physical activity in a prospective cohort 
of men. We also examined total physical 
activity, vigorous exercise, and moderate- 
intensity activity in relation to risk for type 
2 diabetes in this cohort. 

During 10 years (347040 person-years) of 
follow-up, we documented 1058 newly di- 
agnosed cases of type 2 diabetes. As de- 
scribed elsewhere,15 physically more ac- 
tive men tended to be leaner and were less 
likely to be current smokers. Increasing to- 
tal physical activity score was strongly as- 
sociated with progressively reduced risk 
for type 2 diabetes (Table 1). The age- 
adjusted RRs across quintiles of MET 
score from total physical activity were 
1.00, 0.76, 0.61, 0.55, and 0.47 (P for 
trend, (cid:44).001). Further adjustment for 
smoking, parental history of diabetes, and 
other covariates did not appreciably change 
these RRs. This inverse gradient re- 
mained strong even after adjusting for BMI 
(RRs across quintiles of MET score were 
1.00, 0.82, 0.72, 0.66, and 0.62; P for trend, 
(cid:44).001). Adjustment for dietary intakes of

The Health Professional’s Follow-up Study (HPFS) began in 
1986 when 51529 US health professionals (dentists, optom- 
etrists, pharmacists, podiatrists, osteopaths, and veterinar- 
ians), aged 40 to 75 years, answered a detailed question- 
naire that included a comprehensive diet survey and items 
on lifestyle practice and medical history.16 Follow-up ques- 
tionnaires were sent in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 to 
update information on potential risk factors and to identify 
newly diagnosed cases of diabetes and other diseases. We ex- 
cluded from the present analysis men with a previous diag- 
nosis of cardiovascular disease (n=4639), cancer (n=1638), 
or diabetes (n=1796) at baseline. Participants with diag- 
nosed cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline were ex- 
cluded because these diagnoses may lead to change in physi- 
cal activity levels. Participants who had missing information 
on activity questions or reported implausible total energy in- 
take on the food frequency questionnaire17 ((cid:44)3347 or (cid:46)17572 
kJ/d) were also excluded (n=5538). We followed up the re- 
maining 37918 men for incidence of type 2 diabetes during 
the subsequent 10 years of the study. 

Physical activity was assessed using mailed questionnaires at 
baseline and every 2 years thereafter. Subjects were asked to 
report the average amount of time they spent per week on 
each of the following activities: walking, jogging, running, 
bicycling, calisthenics or use of a rowing machine, lap swim- 
ming, squash or racquetball, and tennis. They were also asked 
about their usual walking pace, specified as easy or casual ((cid:44)2 
miles/h), normal (2-2.9 miles/h), brisk (3-3.9 miles/h), or strid- 
ing ((cid:36)4 miles/h). From this information, weekly energy ex- 
penditure in metabolic equivalent hours (MET-hours) was 
calculated.10 We defined any physical activity requiring 6 MET- 
hours or greater (a 6-fold or greater increase above resting 
metabolic rate) as vigorous. These activities included 
jogging, running, bicycling, calisthenics or use of a rowing 
machine, lap swimming, squash or racquetball, and tennis. 
In contrast, walking requires an energy expenditure of only 
2 to 4.5 MET-hours, depending on pace, and was therefore 
considered to be a moderate-intensity activity. 
The reproducibility and validity of the physical activity 
questionnaire was evaluated in a subsample (n=238) of par- 
ticipants in the HPFS cohort.18 The Pearson correlation be- 
tween moderate plus vigorous physical activity, assessed by 
means of diaries for 4 weeks across different seasons, and that 
reported on the questionnaire was 0.58. The correlation be- 
tween vigorous activity score, assessed by means of the ques- 
tionnaire, and resting pulse was −0.45; for pulse after stop- 
ping, the correlation was −0.41. In a separate study on a 
population aged 20 to 59 years recruited from a university 
community (n=103), the correlation between physical ac- 
tivity score on a similar questionnaire and maximum oxy- 
gen consumption was 0.54.19 In a subsample of participants 
in the HPFS cohort (n=466), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol level increased by 0.06 mmol/L (2.4 mg/dL) for 
each increment of 20 MET-hours per week (P(cid:44).01).20 
Starting from 1988, participants reported their aver- 
age weekly time spent watching TV (including video- 
tapes) on the biennial questionnaires. The 1988 question- 
naire included 6 response categories (ranging from 0-1 to 
(cid:46)40 h/wk). Subsequent questionnaires included 13 re- 
sponse categories (ranging from 0 to (cid:46)40 h/wk). In the pres- 
ent analyses, 5 categories were coded consistently across 
all questionnaires (0-1, 2-10, 11-20, 21-40, and (cid:46)40 h/wk). 
In a subsample of participants in the HPFS (n=466), av- 
erage hours of TV watching were significantly associated 
with higher levels of leptin and low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol and with lower levels of HDL choles- 
terol and apolipoprotein A-I.20 

A supplementary questionnaire regarding symptoms, di- 
agnostic tests, and hypoglycemic therapy was mailed to men 

fats and cereal fiber did not appreciably change the 
results. 
To minimize potential bias from subclinical dis- 
ease, we conducted additional analyses in which we ex- 
cluded cases of type 2 diabetes that occurred during the 
first 2 years of follow-up. The multivariate RRs (with- 
out BMI) across quintiles of physical activity score were 
1.00, 0.88, 0.75, 0.69, and 0.57 (P for trend, (cid:44).001). The 
inverse association between total physical activity score 
and diabetes risk was persistent in subgroup analyses ac- 
cording to age ((cid:44)65 or (cid:36)65 years), family history of dia- 
betes, smoking (never or ever), and BMI ((cid:44)25.0, 25.0- 
29.9, or (cid:36)30.0 kg/m2) (Table 2). In particular, the 
increased risks associated with family history of diabe- 
tes and obesity were substantially mitigated by increas- 
ing physical activity levels. To address the possibility that 
medical surveillance may have varied according to physi- 
cal activity level, we conducted an analysis restricted to 
subjects reporting at least 1 symptom of diabetes at di- 
agnosis (n=595). Results from this subgroup were simi- 
lar to those for the entire cohort (multivariate RRs with- 
out BMI in the model across quintiles of MET score were 
1.00, 0.66, 0.65, 0.57, and 0.49; P for trend, (cid:44).001). 
After adjustment for age and other covariates, we 
observed a significant inverse association between MET 
score for walking and risk for type 2 diabetes. The mul- 
tivariate RRs across quintiles of walking score were 1.00, 
1.02, 0.80, 0.76, and 0.72 (P for trend, (cid:44).001). This in- 
verse association remained significant after adjustment 
for vigorous exercise (RRs were 1.00, 1.06, 0.86, 0.82, 
and 0.80; P for trend, .006). Independent of the number 
of hours spent walking, walking pace was strongly as- 
sociated with risk for diabetes. Compared with men whose 
usual walking pace was easy or casual, multivariate RRs 
were 0.68 for normal pace, 0.46 for brisk pace, and 0.39 
for very brisk pace (P for trend, (cid:44).001). 
Walking and vigorous exercise were associated with 
comparable risk reductions for equivalent energy expen- 
diture. When the walking and vigorous activity scores 
were entered into the model as continuous variables si- 





who indicated on any biennial questionnaire that they had 
been diagnosed with diabetes. A case of diabetes was con- 
sidered confirmed if at least 1 of the following was re- 
ported on the supplementary questionnaire: (1) 1 or more 
classic symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, 
hunger) plus 1 fasting plasma glucose level of at least 7.8 
mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or random plasma glucose of at least 
11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); (2) at least 2 elevated plasma 
glucose concentrations on different occasions (fasting, (cid:36)7.8 
mmol/L [(cid:36)140 mg/dL]; random, (cid:36)11.1 mmol/L [(cid:36)200 mg/ 
dL]; and/or (cid:36)11.1 mmol/L [(cid:36)200 mg/dL] after (cid:36)2 hours 
of oral glucose tolerance testing) in the absence of symp- 
toms; or (3) treatment with hypoglycemic medication (in- 
sulin or oral hypoglycemic agent). Because of potential as- 
sociations between weight and physical activity, no body 
weight criteria were used in the classification of type of dia- 
betes for these analyses. Our criteria for diabetes classifi- 
cation are consistent with those proposed by the National 
Diabetes Data Group21 for 1986-1996. The validity of self- 
report of diabetes has been verified in a subsample of 71 
men from the HPFS cohort. A physician blinded to the in- 
formation reported on the supplementary questionnaire and 
reviewed the medical records according to the diagnostic 
criteria. Of the 71 patients, 12 had incomplete records, eg, 
absent laboratory data (n=2), or 1 set only of laboratory 
data (n = 9). Among the remaining 59 cases, the diagnosis 
of type 2 diabetes was confirmed in 57 (97%). One patient 
denied the diagnosis and another lacked evidence of dia- 
betes in his submitted records. Similarly, 98% of diabetic 
cases reported by the supplementary questionnaire were 
confirmed by medical record review in a subsample of par- 
ticipants (n=62) in the Nurses’ Health Study.22 

Person-time for each participant was calculated from the 
date of return of the 1986 (physical activity) or 1988 (TV 
watching) questionnaires to the date of confirmed type 2 
diabetes, death due to any cause, or January 1, 1996, which- 
ever came first. Incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were ob- 
tained by dividing the number of cases by person-years in 
each category of physical activity or average time spent on 
watching TV. Relative risks (RRs) were computed as the 
incidence rate in a specific category of MET score (ie, MET- 
hours per week) or TV watching divided by that in the ref- 
erence category, with adjustment for 5-year age catego- 
ries. Tests for linear trend across increasing categories of 
MET score or average time spent watching TV were con- 
ducted by treating the categories as a continuous variable 
and assigning the median score for the category as its value. 
Both MET score or time spent watching TV were updated 
every 2 years. 
We used pooled logistic regression to adjust esti- 
mated incidence rate ratios simultaneously for potential con- 
founding variables. In this approach, independent 2-year 
blocks of person-time of follow-up are pooled for regres- 
sion analysis, and the dependence of the incidence rates 
on time is modeled nonparametrically with indicator vari- 
ables. D’Agostino et al23 have shown that the pooled logis- 
tic model is asymptotically equivalent to the Cox regres- 
sion when the time intervals are short and the probability 
of outcome in the intervals is low. Our covariates in- 
cluded age (40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and 
(cid:36)70 years), smoking (never, past, or current [1-14, 15- 
24, and (cid:36)25 cigarettes per day]), alcohol consumption (0-4, 
5-9, 10-14, 15-29, and (cid:36)30 g/d), parental history of dia- 
betes, and history of hypercholesterolemia or hyperten- 
sion at baseline. In additional analyses, we included body 
mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms di- 
vided by the square of height in meters], in quintiles) in 
the model to examine the degree to which the relation with 
physical activity was mediated through BMI. 
To examine whether the effects of physical activity on 
diabetes were modified by important covariates, we con- 
ducted multivariate analyses according to categories of age 
((cid:44)65 or (cid:36)65 years), family history of diabetes (no or yes), 
smoking (never or ever), and BMI ((cid:44)25.0, 25.0-29.9, or 
(cid:36)30.0 kg/m2). To examine independent effects of physi- 
cal activity and TV watching, we estimated RRs of diabe- 
tes according to joint classifications of these 2 variables. 
In this analysis, both variables were classified into quar- 
tiles rather than 5 categories to have sufficient power. 
multaneously, RRs associated with an increase in en- 
ergy expenditures of 10 MET-hours per week were 0.89 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.96) for walking and 
0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) for vigorous exercise. 
Men who spent more time watching TV were more 
likely to smoke and drink alcohol and less likely to ex- 
ercise (Table 3). They were substantially heavier and 
more likely to have hypertension and hypercholesterol- 
emia. These men also had higher intake of total energy, 
total and saturated fats, red meat, processed meat, French 
fries, refined grain products, snacks, and sweets or des- 
serts and lower intakes of fish, vegetables, fruits, and whole 
grains. 
After adjustment for age, average time spent watch- 
ing TV was strongly associated with increased risk for 
diabetes (Table 4). The RRs across categories of aver- 
age hours spent watching TV per week (0-1, 2-10, 11- 
20, 21-40, and (cid:46)40) were 1.00, 1.62, 1.61, 2.22, and 3.35 
(95% CI, 1.71-6.55, respectively; P for trend, (cid:44).001). Af- 
ter further adjustment for smoking, alcohol use, physi- 
cal activity, and other covariates, the positive associa- 
tion persisted (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.87; 
95% CI, 1.46-5.65; P for trend, (cid:44).001). The significant 
positive association persisted even after adjustment for 
BMI (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.31; 95% CI, 
1.17-4.56; P for trend, .01). Further simultaneous ad- 
justment for intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated 
fat, polyunsaturated fat, trans-fatty acids, and cereal fi- 
ber did not appreciably change the results (Table 4). 
In multivariate analyses, we observed independent 
effects of TV watching and physical activity levels 
(Figure). Compared with men who were in the most ac- 
tive ((cid:46)46 MET-hours per week) and the lowest TV watch- 
ing category ((cid:44)3.5 h/wk), those who were in the least 
active ((cid:44)10 MET-hours per week) and most sedentary 
category ((cid:46)15 h/wk watching TV) had a significantly in- 
creased risk for type 2 diabetes (RR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.87- 
4.55; P for interaction, .90). When total physical activ- 
ity score and time spent watching TV were simultaneously 
included in a multivariate model (without BMI), an in-

crement of 2 h/d spent watching TV was associated with 
a 20% (95% CI, 8%-32%) increase in risk for diabetes, 
whereas an increment of 18 MET-hours per week (equiva- 
lent to very brisk walking for 40 minutes per day) was 
associated with a 19% (95% CI, 13%-24%) reduction 
in risk. 

In this large prospective cohort of men, greater leisure 
time physical activity was associated with reduced risk 
for type 2 diabetes. In contrast, a sedentary lifestyle, as 
indicated by time spent watching TV, was significantly 
associated with an increased risk for diabetes, inde- 
pendent of the effects of physical activity and body 
weight. 
Our findings extend the literature showing that 
regular physical activity is associated with a substantial 
reduction in risk for type 2 diabetes.1-5,7,22 Our results 
also suggest that the apparent beneficial effect of exer- 
cise is not confined to high-risk groups (eg, subjects 
with (cid:36)1 risk factors such as obesity and family history 
of diabetes). Contrary to the belief that fitness and 
physical activity might offset the adverse effects of obe- 
sity,24 we found that men who were obese and physi- 
cally active had a substantially increased risk for diabe- 
tes compared with those who were lean and inactive 
(Table 2), although obese and inactive men were at

highest risk. In addition, we found that equivalent 
energy expenditure from brisk walking or vigorous 
exercise may confer comparable benefits. These find- 
ings are consistent with emerging evidence to support 
the benefits of moderate-intensity activities in the pre- 
vention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.8,25-27 
Since walking is an activity that is highly accessible, 
readily adopted, and rarely associated with exercise- 
related injury, these findings may have important pub- 
lic health implications. 
The beneficial effects of vigorous exercise and walk- 
ing on risk for type 2 diabetes are partly mediated by body 
weight and body fat distribution. Leaner individuals have 
a reduced risk for diabetes,28-30 and physical activity fa- 
cilitates weight loss and weight maintenance.31 Further- 
more, exercise may lead to loss in visceral fat,32 which is 
strongly associated with insulin resistance and the re- 
lated metabolic syndrome. To the extent that exercise 
causes individuals to have lower BMI than they would 
otherwise, adjustment for BMI in regression models 
constitutes statistical overcorrection and results in 
underestimation of the true beneficial effect of physi- 
cal activity. 
In our study, prolonged TV watching was strongly 
associated with risk for diabetes. These findings do not 
necessarily imply that TV watching per se causes type 2 
diabetes; rather, they suggest that a sedentary lifestyle sub- 
stantially affects future risk for diabetes. There are at least 
2 explanations for the observed positive association be- 
tween TV watching and diabetes risk. First, TV watch- 
ing is directly related to obesity and weight gain,11-15,33 
probably due to lower energy expenditure (ie, less physi- 
cal activity) and higher caloric intake. Second, partici- 
pants who spent more time watching TV tended to eat 
more red meat, processed meat, snacks, refined grains, 
and sweets and fewer vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. 
Such an eating pattern, which is directly related to com- 
mercial advertisements and food cues appearing on TV,34,35 
may adversely affect diabetes risk. In our previous study 
of 466 men in the HPFS, average hours of TV watching 
was significantly associated with increased levels of lep- 
tin and LDL cholesterol and lower levels of HDL choles- 
terol and apolipoprotein A-I, independent of physical ac- 
tivity levels.20 
Because our cohort did not undergo uniform screen- 
ing for glucose intolerance, some diabetes cases may have

Our data provide further evidence that higher levels of 
physical activity, including moderate-intensity exer- 
cise such as walking, are associated with a substantial 
reduction in risk for diabetes. In contrast, sedentary 
lifestyle indicated by prolonged TV watching is 
directly related to diabetes risk. Although these find- 
ings lend further support to current guidelines37,38 that 
promote physical activity, they also suggest the impor- 
tance of reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention 
of diabetes.

been undiagnosed. However, misclassification would be 
expected to be small compared with that in the general 
population because of health professionals’ ready access 
to medical care. For example, more than 85% of men in 
our study visited a physician for a physical examina- 
tion, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at least once be- 
tween 1988 and 1990. In addition, when the analyses were 
restricted to symptomatic cases of type 2 diabetes, the 
findings were similar, suggesting that surveillance bias 
according to activity level is unlikely. The diagnostic cri- 
teria for type 2 diabetes have recently changed36 such that 
lower fasting glucose levels ((cid:46)7.0 mmol/L [(cid:46)126 mg/ 
dL]) would now be considered diabetic. We used the cri- 
teria proposed by the National Diabetes Data Group21 be- 
cause all of our cases were diagnosed before January 1996. 
If new criteria were used, some nondiabetic subjects would 
have been classified as diabetic. However, this is un- 
likely to explain our results, because inclusion of dia- 
betics in the nondiabetic group would have attenuated 
the associations we observed.
