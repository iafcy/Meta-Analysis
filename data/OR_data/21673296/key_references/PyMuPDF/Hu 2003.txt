vision (TV) watching is a major seden-
tary behavior in the United States. In a
surveyconductedin1997,anadultmale
spent approximately 29 hours per week
watching TV, and an adult female spent
34 hours per week.1 In recent decades,
in parallel with increasing obesity, there
has been a steady increase in the num-
ber of homes with multiple TV sets, vid-
eocassette recorders (VCRs), cable TV,
and remote controls, as well as the num-
ber of hours spent watching TV.1

Context Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have
largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction
of sedentary behaviors.
Objective To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, espe-
cially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women.
Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992
to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses’ Health Study. The obesity analy-
sis included 50277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and
were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed
questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analy-
sis included 68497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes melli-
tus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer.
Main Outcome Measures Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Results During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5%) of 50277 women who had a BMI
of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI 30). Overall, we documented 1515 new
cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of
obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, ex-
ercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching
was associated with a 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-30%) increase in obe-
sity and a 14% (95% CI, 5%-23%) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in
sitting at work was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 0%-10%) increase in obesity and a
7% (95% CI, 0%-16%) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at
home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9% (95% CI, 6%-12%) reduction in obesity and a
12% (95% CI, 7%-16%) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking
was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%-29%) reduction in obesity and a 34% (95%
CI, 27%-41%) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30% (95% CI,
24%-36%) of new cases of obesity and 43% (95% CI, 32%-52%) of new cases of
diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (10 h/wk of TV
watching and 30 min/d of brisk walking).
Conclusions Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watch-
ing, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes,
whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk.
This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other
sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.

among women. We therefore exam-
ined prospectively the relationship be-
tweenseveralcommonsedentarybehav-
iors and incidence of obesity and type 2
diabetes in a large cohort of women.
METHODS
Study Participants
The Nurses’ Health Study cohort was es-
tablished in 1976 when 121700 female
registerednursesaged30to55yearsand
residing in 1 of 11 US states responded
to mailed questionnaires regarding their
medical history and health practices; de-
tailshavebeenpublishedelsewhere.9For
this study, we excluded women with di-
agnosed cardiovascular disease
(n=3102), cancer (n=9917), or diabe-
tes (n=4373) in 1992. The final sample
for the diabetes analysis consisted of
68497 women. For the obesity analy-
sis, we also excluded women who were
already obese (body mass index [BMI]
30) in 1992 or earlier cycles, leaving
50277 women in the final analysis.
Assessment of Sedentary
Behaviors and Physical Activity
In 1992, participants were asked to re-
port their average weekly time spent sit-
ting at home while watching TV or
VCR, sitting at work or away from home
or while driving, and other sitting at
home (eg, reading, meal times, at desk).
They were also asked to report time
spent standing or walking around at
home or at work. The responses in-
cluded 9 categories (ranging from 0
h/wk to 90 h/wk). In the current
analyses, 5 categories were coded con-
sistently across all the 5 items (0-1, 2-5,
6-20, 21-40, and 40 h/wk).
In 1992, 1994, and 1996, partici-
pants were asked the amount of time
they spent on average per week on each
ofthefollowingphysicalactivities:walk-
ing, jogging, running, bicycling, calis-
thenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing
machine, lap swimming, squash/
racquetball, and tennis. They were also
asked about their usual walking pace,
specified as easy/casual (2 miles per
hour[mph]),normal(2-2.9mph),brisk
(3-3.9 mph), or very brisk/striding (4
mph). From this information, weekly
energyexpenditureinmetabolicequiva-
lent hours (MET-hours) was calcu-
lated.2 For example, brisk walking re-
quires an energy expenditure of about
4 METs and is considered to be a mod-
erate-intensity activity. In this cohort,
walking is the most common type of ac-
tivity (60% of all women reported that
they walked 1 h/wk). Because the re-
sults using baseline and updated physi-
calactivitymeasuresweresimilar,were-
ported only baseline analyses.
The reproducibility and validity of the
physical activity questionnaire has been
described elsewhere.10 In a representa-
tive sample (n=147) of participants in
the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort, the
2-year test-retest correlation for activity
was0.59.Thecorrelationbetweenphysi-
cal activity reported on 1-week recalls
and that reported on the questionnaire
was 0.79. The correlation between ac-
tivity reported in diaries and that re-
ported on the questionnaire was 0.62. In
a separate study on a population aged 20
to 59 years recruited from a university
community(n=103),thecorrelationbe-
tween physical activity score on a very
similarquestionnaireandmaximumoxy-
gen consumption was 0.54.11 In a par-
allel cohort of men, average hours of TV
watching were significantly associated
with higher levels of leptin and low-
densitylipoproteincholesterolandlower
levels of high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol and apolipoprotein A1.12
Assessment of Obesity
Bodyweightwasself-reportedinthebien-
nialquestionnaires.Self-reportedweights
were highly correlated with measured
weights (r=0.96; mean difference, 1.5
kg).13 In 1976, the nurses were asked to
report their height to the closest inch.
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as
weightinkilogramsdividedbythesquare
of height in meters. Incidence of obesity
is defined as the transition from non-
obese (BMI 30) in 1992 to a BMI of 30
or more at the end of follow-up in 1998.
Thus,onlyindividualswithaBMIofless
than 30 across all time points (between
1976and1992)wereincludedintheobe-
sity analysis (n=50277).
Diagnosis of Diabetes
A supplementary questionnaire regard-
ing symptoms, diagnostic tests, and hy-
poglycemic therapy was mailed to
women who indicated on any biennial
questionnaire that they had been diag-
nosed with diabetes. A case of diabetes
was considered confirmed if at least 1
of the following was reported on the
supplementary questionnaire: (1) clas-
sic symptoms plus elevated glucose lev-
els (a fasting plasma glucose concentra-
tion 140 mg/dL [7.7 mmol/L] or a
randomly measured concentration of at
least 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]); (2) at
least 2 elevated plasma glucose concen-
trations on different occasions in the ab-
sence of symptoms (levels as above or
200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L] after 2
hours of oral glucose tolerance test-
ing); and (3) treatment with oral hypo-
glycemic agents or insulin. Our criteria
for diabetes classification are consis-
tent with those proposed by the Na-
tional Diabetes Data Group.14
The validity of this diagnostic proce-
dure has been verified in a subsample
of this study population.15 In addition,
another substudy assessing the preva-
lence of undiagnosed diabetes sug-
gested a very low rate of false-negative
results.16
Statistical Analysis
Person-timeforeachparticipantwascal-
culated from the date of return of the
1992 questionnaires to the date of con-
firmed type 2 diabetes (for diabetes
analysis only), the year of first reported
obesity (for obesity analysis only), death
from any cause, or June 1, 1998, which-
ever came first. Incidence rates of obe-
sity or type 2 diabetes were obtained by
dividing the number of cases by person-
years in each category of average time
spent on each sedentary behavior (eg,
TV watching). Relative risks (RRs) were
computed as the incidence rate in a spe-
cific category of TV watching divided by
that in the reference category, with ad-
justment for 5-year age categories. Tests
for linear trend across increasing cat-
egories of average time spent watching
TV were conducted by treating the cat-
egories as a continuous variable and as-

signing the middle score for the cat-
egory as its value.
We used Cox regression to adjust es-
timated incidence rate ratios simulta-
neously for potential confounding vari-
ables. In the multivariate analyses of
onset of obesity, we adjusted for age
(50, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65 years),
smoking (never, past, current 1-14, 15-
24, and 25 cigarettes/d), alcohol con-
sumption (0, 0.1-4.9, 5-14.9, 15 g/d),
andphysicalactivity(METsinquintiles).
We further adjusted for dietary vari-
ables including total energy intake, total
fat, glycemic load, and cereal fiber (all in
quintiles). For multivariate analyses of
diabetes, our covariates included age,
smoking,alcoholconsumption,andfam-
ily history of diabetes. Further analyses
adjusted for dietary intakes of polyun-
saturated fat, glycemic load, cereal fi-
ber, and trans fat (all in quintiles).17
We calculated the population-
attributable risk to estimate the percent-
ages of obesity and type 2 diabetes cases
in this population that are attributable
to the joint effects of 2 risk factors (ei-
ther 10 h/wk of TV watching or 30
min/d walking or equivalent energy
expenditure).18 P=.05 was considered
significant. Statistical analysis was per-
formedusingSASstatisticalsoftware,ver-
sion 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Women who spent more time watch-
ing TV were more likely to smoke and
drink alcohol and less likely to exer-
cise (TABLE 1). However, the correla-
tion between TV watching and physi-
cal activity levels was minimal
(r=−0.03). These women also had
higher intake of total energy, total and
saturated fats, red meat, processed meat,
refined grain products, snacks, sweets/
desserts, and lower intakes of fish, veg-
etables, fruits, and whole grains.
During 6 years of follow-up (282141
person years), 3757 women who were
not obese at baseline (7.5%) became
obese in 1998. Time spent watching TV
was positively associated with risk of
obesity (TABLE 2). The age-adjusted
RRs across categories of TV watching
(0-1, 2-5, 6-20, 21-40, 40 h/wk) were
1.0, 1.23, 1.42, 1.68, and 2.00, respec-
tively (P for trend,  .001). Further ad-

justment for exercise levels and other
covariates did not appreciably alter the
RRs. Sitting at work or away from home
or driving was also significantly asso-
ciated with elevated risk of obesity. In
contrast, time spent standing or walk-
ing around at home was associated
with a lower risk of obesity (multivar-
iate RR comparing extreme catego-
ries, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.61-0.97; P for trend, .001). Fur-
ther adjustment for baseline BMI sub-
stantially attenuated the RRs. The mul-
tivariate RR comparing the extreme
categories of TV watching was 1.29
(95% CI, 1.01-1.66). These results sug-
gest that women who watched more TV
were already on a trajectory to be-
come obese at baseline.
During 6 years of follow-up (396900
person-years), we documented 1515
newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabe-
tes. After adjustment for age, average
time spent watching TV was signifi-
cantly associated with increased risk of
type 2 diabetes (TABLE 3). The RRs
across categories of average hours spent
watching TV per week were 1.0, 1.10,
1.30, 1.53, and 1.98 (P for trend,
.001). Further adjustment for di-
etary factors slightly attenuated the RRs.
As expected, these RRs were substan-
tially attenuated after further adjust-
ment for BMI (RR comparing extreme
categories, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.82-1.67),
suggesting that the increased risk of dia-
betes associated with TV watching was
largely mediated through obesity.
Sitting at work and other sitting at
home (last category only) were both as-
sociatedwithsignificantlyincreasedrisk
of diabetes in multivariate analyses ad-
justing for dietary and nondietary co-
variates (Table 3). Standing or walk-
ing around at home was associated with
a modestly lower risk of diabetes.
Tocomparethepredictiveroleofvari-
oussedentarybehaviorsandphysicalac-
tivity, we conducted a multivariate
analysis including simultaneously these
behaviors (in continuous form), physi-
cal activity (4 METs/d, equivalent to 1
h/d of brisk walking), and nondietary
and dietary covariates. Among various
sedentary behaviors, time spent watch-
ingTVwasmoststronglyassociatedwith

increase in time spent watching TV,
there was a 23% (95% CI, 17%-30%) in-
crease in obesity risk. In contrast, other
sitting at home or standing or walking
around home was associated with a sig-
nificantly lower risk of obesity. Each
1-h/d increase in brisk walking was as-
sociated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%-
29%) reduction in obesity.
Watching TV was also most strongly
associated with elevated risk of type 2
diabetes (Figure 1). Each 2-h/d incre-
ment in time spent watching TV was
associated with a 14% (95% CI, 5%-
23%) increase in diabetes risk. Stand-
ing or walking around at home was as-
sociated with a lower risk of diabetes
(12% [95% CI, 7%-16%] risk reduc-
tion for each 2-h/d increment). Brisk
walking was strongly associated with
a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (34%
[95% CI, 27%-41%] risk reduction for
each 1-h/d increment).
To address the possibility that sur-
veillance for diabetes may have varied
according to physical activity levels, we
did an analysis restricted to cases re-
porting at least 1 symptom of diabetes
at diagnosis. Results from this sub-
group were not appreciably different
from those for the entire cohort. The
multivariate RRs across categories of av-
eragehoursspentwatchingTVperweek
were 1.0, 1.09, 1.30, 1.44, and 1.70.
In multivariate analyses, we ob-
served independent effects of TV watch-
ing and exercise levels on obesity and
type 2 diabetes (FIGURE 2). Compared
with women who were in the most ac-
tive (the highest tertile of METs/wk)
and the lowest TV watching category
(6 h/wk watching TV), those who
were in the lowest of METs per week
and most sedentary category (20 h/wk
watching TV) had a significantly in-
creased risk of obesity (RR, 1.90; 95%
CI, 1.61-2.24) and type 2 diabetes (RR,
2.89; 95% CI, 2.21-3.79).
Weestimatedthat30%(95%CI,24%-
36%)ofnewobesitycasesand43%(95%
CI, 32%-52%) of type 2 diabetes cases
could be attributable to the joint effects
of 2 risk factors (either 10 h/wk of TV
watching or 30 min/d walking or
equivalent energy expenditure). Only
15% of participants in our cohort be-
longed to the joint low-risk group (de-
fined as 10 h/wk of TV watching and
30 min/d of walking or equivalent
energy expenditure).

COMMENT
In this large prospective cohort of
women, sedentary behaviors, espe-
cially TV watching, were significantly
associated with risk of obesity and type
2 diabetes. Sedentary occupation re-
flected by long hours of sitting or stand-
ing at work was significantly associ-
ated with risk of obesity. In contrast,
even light activities such as standing or
walking around at home (which prob-
ably reflects household work) and brisk
walking were associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of obesity and diabe-
tes. Our study suggests that 30% of obe-
sity cases and 43% of type 2 diabetes
cases can be potentially prevented by
following a relatively active lifestyle
(10 h/wk TV watching and 30
min/d of brisk walking).
Our results are consistent with pre-
vious studies of TV watching in rela-
tion to obesity and weight gain in chil-
dren4,6,7 and adults.19-22 They are also
consistent with our previous analysis
showing a positive association be-
tween prolonged TV watching and type
2diabetesamongmenintheHealthPro-
fessionals Follow-up Study.5 Our find-
ings extend the literature showing that
moderate-intensity activity such as brisk
walking is strongly protective against
type 2 diabetes15,23-29 and indicate a con-
tinuum in the relationship between
physical activity levels and obesity and
diabetes risk, and TV watching has the
highest risk for obesity and diabetes
among several sedentary behaviors.
There are at least 3 potential mecha-
nisms for the observed positive associa-
tion between TV watching and obesity
and diabetes risk.30 First, TV watching
typically displaces physical activity and
thus reduces energy expenditure.20,21 In
our study, women who spent more time
watching TV tended to exercise less, but
the effects of TV watching and exercise
on the development of obesity and dia-
betes were largely independent. Sec-
ond, TV watching results in increased
food and total energy intake because in-
dividuals tend to eat while watching TV
despite their low physical activity lev-
els.3-5 Also, participants who spent more
time watching TV tended to follow an

unhealthy eating pattern.5 Such an eat-
ing pattern is directly related to com-
mercialadvertisementsandfoodcuesap-
pearing on TV31 and has been associated
with risk of obesity and diabetes.32 An-
other potential mechanism is that TV
viewing results in lower energy expen-
diturecomparedwithothersedentaryac-
tivities such as sewing, reading, writ-
ing,anddrivingacar.2Thecombinations
of these factors may explain our find-
ings that TV watching is more strongly
associated with obesity than other sed-
entary behaviors.
Our findings could have important
public health implications. The preva-
lence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has
increased dramatically in the past sev-
eral decades in the United States.33 Al-
thoughleisure-timephysicalactivitylev-
elsaregenerallylowintheUnitedStates,
there is no evidence that recreational
physical activity has declined in recent
decades.However,sedentarylifestylehas
become more prevalent and pervasive as
reflectedbythelargenumbersofTVsets,
VCRs, and remote controls per house-
hold and increasing time spent watch-
ing TV in the past several decades.1 We
speculated that increasing sedentary be-
haviors, especially TV watching, may
have contributed to the obesity epi-
demic in the United States. Given the
strong relationship observed between
sedentary lifestyle and obesity and dia-
betesrisk,publichealthcampaignstore-
duce obesity and diabetes should not
only promote increasing exercise lev-
els, but also decreasing sedentary behav-
iors, especially prolonged TV watch-
ing. Substantial health benefits can be
gained by even light to moderate activ-
ity such as doing household chores and
byengaginginsimpleandconvenientac-
tivities such as walking.
The major strengths of this study in-
clude its large sample size, prospective
design, and detailed measures of physi-
cal activity, sedentary behaviors, and a
multitude of dietary and nondietary co-
variates. However, the observational na-
ture of this study cannot prove a causal
relationship between TV watching and
obesity because of the potential recip-
rocal relationship between TV watch-
ing behavior and obesity. This issue
could be addressed in randomized clini-
caltrialsamongadults.However,school-
based intervention studies have al-
ready demonstrated that reductions in
TV watching were effective in prevent-
ing obesity among children.8
Inconclusion,ourdataprovidestrong
evidence that sedentary behaviors, es-
pecially prolonged TV watching, are di-
rectlyrelatedtoobesityanddiabetesrisk.
In contrast, even light- to moderate-
intensityactivitysubstantiallylowersthe
risk. While these findings lend further
support to current guidelines that pro-
mote physical activity, they also sug-
gest the importance of reducing seden-
tary behaviors in the prevention of
obesity and type 2 diabetes.
