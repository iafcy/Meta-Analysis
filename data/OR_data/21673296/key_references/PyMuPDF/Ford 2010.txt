Introduction
Inadequate physical activity is a well recognized risk
factor for diabetes. Most prospective studies of diabe-
tes have generally examined the associations between
various forms of energy expenditure and incident dia-
betes. Less well understood is the association between
sedentary behavior and incident diabetes. In two large
cohort studies, the amount of television viewing was
found to be a signiﬁcant independent risk factor for
developing diabetes.1,2
There are several reasons for focusing on the associ-
ations between television viewing and chronic con-
ditions such as diabetes. First, cross-sectional and

Abstract
Background: The aim of the present study was to examine whether the
amount of time spent watching television is a potential risk factor for inci-
dent diabetes and to what extent this association may be explained by
obesity.
Methods: We used data for 23 855 men and women from the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam Study. Dur-
ing an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants developed diabe-
tes. Incident diabetes was identiﬁed on the basis of self-report and was
veriﬁed by contacting the patient’s attending physician. The amount of
time spent watching television was self-reported.
Results: The mean time that the participants who developed diabetes
watched television was 2.4 h⁄ week, compared with 2.0 h⁄ week for those
who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex,
educational status, smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, phys-
ical activity, the intake of various foods, and systolic blood pressure, the
adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes among participants who watched
‡4 h⁄ day of television compared with those who watched <1 h ⁄day was
1.63 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.17–2.27]. After additional adjustment
for waist circumference and body mass index, the hazard ratio was reduced
to 1.14 (95% CI: 0.81–1.61).
Conclusions: In the present study, the amount of time spent watching tele-
vision was an independent predictor of incident diabetes only in models that
adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and systolic
blood pressure. The attenuation of the association after adjusting for anthro-
pometric measures may represent an explanatory mechanism for our ﬁndings.

prospective studies have linked the amount of televi-
sion viewing with an increased risk of obesity, a major
risk factor for diabetes.3,4 Second, television viewing
has been associated with obesity and diabetes indepen-
dently of physical activity.1,2 Thus, the act of television
viewing may denote more than the absence of physical
activity. Third, messages to promote physical activity
in the population may not only need to convince peo-
ple to engage in adequate levels of physical activity
but may also need to discourage excessive sedentary
behavior. Finally, an increased risk of developing dia-
betes attributable to excess sedentary behavior has
potential implications for clinicians and public health
practitioners.
Few studies have examined the association between
television watching and incident diabetes prospectively.
Establishing these relationships in different countries
and cultures is important, because the differences in
attendant behaviors could affect the risk of adverse
outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was
to examine data from a large German prospective
study to address this association. Because the pathway
from excessive television viewing to incident diabetes is
likely to lead through obesity to a considerable extent,
we hypothesized that any increase in the risk of diabe-
tes from excessive television viewing would be attenu-
ated by adjusting for anthropometric measures.
Methods
Study population
In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam Study, Germany, men
aged 40–65 years and women aged 35–65 years were
the target of recruitment. In total, 27 548 subjects
(16 644 women and 10 904 men) from the general pop-
ulation joined the study between 1994 and 1998.5 The
baseline examination included anthropometric mea-
surements, a personal interview including questions on
prevalent diseases, a questionnaire on sociodemograph-
ic and lifestyle characteristics, and a food frequency
questionnaire. Follow-up
questionnaires to identify
incident cases of diabetes mellitus have been adminis-
tered every 2–3 years since. The response rates for each
of the waves of follow-up exceeded 90%. We also con-
sidered questionnaires that were part of the ongoing
fourth wave of follow-up and were sent out until
31 January 2005. By 31 August 2005, 90% had been
returned. Consent was obtained from all participants
in the study and approval was given by the Ethical
Committee of the State of Brandenburg, Germany.
Participants with diabetes at baseline were excluded
from the analyses. Self-reported diabetes mellitus at
baseline was evaluated by a physician using informa-
tion on self-reported medical diagnoses, medication
records, and dieting behavior. Uncertainties regarding
a proper diagnosis were clariﬁed with the participant
or the treating physician. A total of 23 855 partici-
pants (9167 men, 14 688 women) who had complete
information for the study variables were included in
the analyses.
Ascertainment of incident diabetes
Potentially incident cases of diabetes were identiﬁed
via self-reports of a diabetes diagnosis, diabetes-rele-
vant medication, or dietary treatment due to diabetes.
All potentially incident cases were veriﬁed by question-
naires that were mailed to the diagnosing physician
asking about the date and type of diagnosis, diagnostic
tests, and treatment of diabetes. Only cases with a phy-
sician diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM;
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion: E11; http://apps.who.int/classiﬁcations/apps/icd/
icd10online/, accessed 27 July 2009) and a diagnosis
date after the baseline examination were considered as
conﬁrmed incident cases of T2DM.
Assessment of television viewing
The amount of time each week that a participant spent
watching television was assessed with the following
question administered at baseline: ‘‘On average, how
many h⁄ day did you watch television during the last
12 months?’’
Covariates
We included the following covariates from the baseline
data collection: age, sex, educational status, smoking
status, alcohol use, physical strain at work, physical
activity (h ⁄ week of walking, gardening, bicycling, and
performing sports), waist circumference, body mass
index
(BMI),
systolic
blood
pressure
(SBP),
and
intakes of red meat, coffee, whole-grain bread, fruits
and vegetables, pizza, soda, cake, chips, dessert, total
energy, total fat, saturated fat, protein, and carbo-
hydrates.
Information
on
educational
attainment,
smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, and
physical activity was assessed with a self-administered
questionnaire and a personal interview. The physical
activity questions, which were developed for the EPIC
study, included questions about bicycling (a common
mode of transportation in the Potsdam area), sports
activities, and gardening. The food frequency question-
naire in this study included 148 of the 158 food items

originally tested for the German cohorts of the EPIC
study.6,7 Anthropometric measurement procedures fol-
lowed standard protocols under strict quality control.
Statistical analyses
Differences in baseline characteristics by incident dia-
betes status were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
for continuous variables. Linear trends for continuous
variables across categories of time spent watching tele-
vision were evaluated using linear regression analysis,
and trends for categorical variables were assessed with
the Cochran–Mantel–Haenzel test. Cox proportional
hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Age was
used as the primary time-dependent variable in all
models, with entry time deﬁned as the subject’s age at
recruitment and exit time as the date of diagnosis of
diabetes, death, or return of the last follow-up ques-
tionnaire. All analyses were performed with sas release
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
During 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants (534
men, 393 women) developed diabetes. Television view-
ing time ranged from 0 to 12 h⁄ day. The mean time
that participants who developed diabetes watched tele-
vision was 2.4 h⁄ day, compared with 2.0 h⁄ day for
those who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001).
Signiﬁcant positive associations were noted between
the amount of time spent watching television and
age, the percentage of women, the percentage of par-
ticipants who had an occupation requiring heavy or
very heavy physical strain, waist circumference, BMI,
SBP, the intake of alcohol and several foods, and
time (h ⁄ week) spent walking, gardening, and play-
ing sport (Table 1). Furthermore, signiﬁcant inverse
associations were present for the percentage of par-
ticipants receiving a university education, the percent-
age of participants who never smoked, the intake
of
whole-grain
bread,
fruits
and
vegetables,
and
bicycling.

In proportional hazards analyses adjusted for soci-
odemographic variables, the HR for participants who
watched ‡4 h ⁄day television was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.43–
2.78)
compared
with
participants
who
watched
<1 h⁄ day television (Table 2). Adjusting for behav-
ioral variables, such as smoking, alcohol use, and
physical activity, reduced the HRs a bit. Additional
adjustment
for
macronutrients
or
various
foods
resulted in additional small reductions in the HRs.
However, when the model was adjusted for waist cir-
cumference and BMI, the HRs were attenuated to the
point being non-signiﬁcant.
Discussion
In the present study, the amount of time spent watch-
ing television was a signiﬁcant predictor of incident
diabetes in analyses that adjusted only for sociodemo-
graphic factors and other lifestyle behaviors, including
physical activity. The attenuation of the HR after
adjustment for measured anthropometric variables is
consistent with a mechanism by which excessive televi-
sion viewing increases obesity, which, in turn, increases
the risk for diabetes.
There are several limitations to the present study.
First, undiagnosed diabetes was not identiﬁed. How-
ever, our estimates of relative risk should be accurate
assuming that the association between the amount of
time spent watching television and incident diabetes
was similar in those with diagnosed and undiagnosed
diabetes. Second, the amount of time spent watching
television was self-reported and, thus, may be subject
to recall bias. Third, despite adjusting the results for a
substantial number of potential confounders, we may
not have included all relevant confounders. For exam-
ple, information concerning each participant’s family
history of diabetes was not available. In addition, the
results may be subject to residual confounding.

watching television represents a potential lost opportu-
nity to engage in activities that increase energy expen-
diture. Second, energy expenditure while watching
television is lower than that for other sedentary activi-
ties.10 Third, the reduction in energy expenditure may
be compounded by increases in energy intake attribut-
able to exposure to television commercials that may
spur additional eating, which increases energy intake
and possibly also the intake of foods of questionable
nutritional value.11 Thus, reductions in the amount of
time that people watch television could yield substan-
tial public health beneﬁts. In pediatric populations,
interventions that reduce the amount of time spent
watching television have demonstrated a favorable
effect on obesity.12
Prudence
dictates
that
people
should
limit
the
amount of time they spend watching television and
dedicate at least some of this time to the pursuit of
activities that increase energy expenditure. To this
end, clinicians can inquire about the television viewing
habits
of
their
patients,
counsel
them
about
the
negative impact excess television viewing can have on
their health, and suggest healthier alternatives. As part
of comprehensive public health efforts to promote
physical
activity
in
the
population,
interventions
that motivate people to decrease their pursuit of
sedentary activities, such as television viewing, deserve
consideration.
