Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the independent relationships of television viewing or other screen-based
entertainment (“screen time”) with all-cause mortality and clinically confirmed cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events. A secondary objective was to examine the extent to which metabolic (body mass index, high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein) markers mediate the relationship between
screen time and CVD events.

Background Although some evidence suggests that prolonged sitting is linked to CVD risk factor development regardless of
physical activity participation, studies with hard outcomes are scarce.

Methods A population sample of 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents (�35 years) were followed up
to 2007 for all-cause mortality and CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined). Main exposures were interviewerassessed screen time (�2 h/day; 2 to �4 h/day; and �4 h/day) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity.

Results Two hundred fifteen CVD events and 325 any-cause deaths occurred during 19,364 follow-up person-years. The
covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status, diabetes,
hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to
2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95% CI: 1.33 to 3.96) for participants engaging in �4 h/day of screen time
relative to �2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause mortality: HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with
CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably. Approximately 25% of the association between screen time and CVD events was explained collectively by
C-reactive protein, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusions Recreational sitting, as reflected by television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality and CVD risk
regardless of physical activity participation. Inflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this
relationship. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2011;57:292–9) © 2011 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation


There is indisputable evidence on the links between physical
activity and risk for premature death (1). Some emerging
published reports consistently suggest that excessive sedentary behavior (as characterized by those activities involving

sitting) might be linked to increased risk for obesity (2,3),
dyslipidemia (4), plasma glucose levels (5), and the metabolic syndrome (6) independently of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity participation. Television viewing and
screen-based entertainment (screen time) in general seems
to be the most important indicator of nonoccupational
sitting behavior (7). Recent time-use surveys (8–10) indicate that, aside from sleeping, watching TV is the behavior
that occupies the most time in the domestic setting.
If sitting or total sedentary time is established to be independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), clinical and public health recommendations should explicitly ad

not (11). Because only a minority of adults in western populations participate regularly in sport and exercise activities
(12,13), and those who do not take part in sports are more
likely to develop CVD or die prematurely (14), it might be
possible to reduce the risk of nonparticipants by restricting
sitting time and increasing nonexercise activity (e.g.,
standing and ambulating) throughout the day (15). There is no
conclusive evidence obtained from comparing the feasibility or
long-term effectiveness of interventions designed to increase
formal exercise versus decreasing sitting behavior during the
day. However, the latter approach might be more promising in
terms of long-term adherence, because it will involve more
subtle lifestyle changes and fewer of the commonly cited
barriers (16) for joining a sporting or lifestyle exercise program.
The primary aim of this study was to examine the
relationships of leisure-time sitting behavior (indexed from
screen time) with all-cause mortality and CVD events while
taking multiple measures to address reverse causality. Because it is also important to understand the mechanisms
through which sedentary behavior might influence cardiovascular risk, a secondary aim was to determine the extent to
which several biomarkers explain these relationships.

Methods

**Sample and outcomes. The 2003 Scottish Health Survey**
(SHS03) was a household-based survey that recruited a
population sample with multistage, stratified probability
sampling with postcode sectors selected at the first stage and
household addresses selected at the second stage (17).
Ethical approval was granted by the Local Research Ethics
Councils. Of eligible adults, 83% consented to take part in
the survey. The SHS03 data were linked to the Scottish
Information Division Database (ISD) patient-based database of hospital episodes (from 1981 onwards) and deaths
up to December 2007. The linked data are of excellent
quality—the ISD database has demonstrated 94% accuracy
and 99% completeness when samples of computerized CVD
records from the Scottish national database were compared
with the original patient case notes. Information on deaths
was ascertained from the General Registrar Office for
Scotland. Classification of the underlying cause of death is
based on information collected on the medical certificate of
cause of death together with any additional information provided subsequently by the certifying doctor. All the relevant
details regarding the ISD can be found at the ISD Scotland
website. Diagnoses for CVD cause of death was recorded with
the International Classification of Diseases-9 (codes 390-459)
and -10 (codes I01-I99). An event was defined as CVDrelated hospital episode (including myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, angioplasty, stroke, heart failure) or CVDrelated death. The potentially eligible sample comprised 6,353
adults (�35 years), of which 5,814 (91.5% of eligible) consented to their records being linked to records of mortality,
hospital episodes, and cancer registration. Among these, 1,302


respondents (1,964 male) who Abbreviations

more likely to be from nonmanual social class, white, not to be
married, to have a body mass index (BMI) under 30 kg/m[2], to
be current or former cigarette smokers, to have long-standing
illness, to be inactive at work, to have been diagnosed with
hypertension, and not to meet the physical activity recommendations. We also carried out comparisons between those 1,302
participants who were lost to follow-up and those 4,512 who
were retained in the analyses. Those who were lost to
follow-up were younger and reported more moderate-tovigorous physical activity and less screen time min/week than
those who were retained. They were also were more likely to be
from nonmanual social class, to be single, to be current or
ex-cigarette smokers, to be free from long-standing illness and
doctor-diagnosed hypertension, and to meet the physical
activity recommendations.
Analyses with cardiovascular events as the outcome excluded 340 respondents who had cardiovascular hospital
episodes according to the linked patient-based database
between 1981 and before baseline testing. To minimize the
chances of reverse causality due to prodromal/undiagnosed
disease, we repeated the analyses after excluding another 48
participants with cardiovascular events in the first 24
months of follow-up (CVD analysis). We also repeated the
analysis after excluding the 295 participants who had cancer
registrations before baseline.
**Exposures, confounders, and potentially mediating variables.**
The main exposure was screen time. Two questions enquired about screen time on weekdays (“Thinking of weekdays, how much time on average day do you spend watching
TV or another type of screen such as a computer, or video
game? Please do not include any time spent in front of a
screen while at school, college or work”) and weekend days
(with an equivalent question). Although there is no information on the reliability and criterion validity of the screen
time questions, the previously reported (2) consistent direct
correlations of screen time with waist circumference and
BMI and the inverse correlation with physical activity
support their convergent validity. Nonoccupational physical
activity questions included frequency (days in the last 4
weeks) and duration (min/day) of heavy housework (e.g.,
scrubbing floors), heavy do-it-yourself/gardening (e.g., digging, building work), walking (14), and any leisure-time

gym, dancing, football) (12). Occupational physical activity
was assessed by asking respondents how physically active
they are at work (very/fairly active, not very/not at all active).
Their response was combined with information on their
occupation with the Standard Occupational Classification
1990 (18) to classify work activity. The criterion validity of
the physical activity questionnaire is supported by an accelerometry study on 106 British adults (19). Height, weight,
socioeconomic status, health status, and other health behaviors were measured by trained interviewers with standard
protocols (2,17). In a separate visit, trained nurses collected
nonfasting blood samples with standard protocols and
procedures that have been described previously in detail
(14,20). Blood sample analytes used in the present analysis
were C-reactive protein (CRP), high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol (17,21).
**Variable handling and statistical analysis. Screen time**
was grouped as �2 h/day; �2 h/day �4 h/day; �4 h/day.
The choice of 2 h/day as a cutoff for the lowest screen time
group is consistent with recommendations for children
(20,22) that make specific references to TV. The same cutoff
has been used in publications similar to ours (23). The main
confounding variable was nonoccupational moderate-tovigorous physical activity, which was entered in the statistical models as min/day. Other covariables entered into the
models were sex, age, BMI (�25, 25 to 30, �30 kg/m[2]),
social class (I, II, III nonmanual, III manual, IV/V nonmanual), doctor-diagnosed diabetes and hypertension, longstanding illness, marital status (single/never married, married, separated/divorced, and widowed), smoking (never,
ex, current smoker), and occupational physical activity
(inactive/light/moderate-to-vigorous).
For individuals who survived and remained CVD-free,
data were censored to December 2007. The Cox proportional hazards model was used with months as the time scale
to estimate the risk of death from any cause or the risk of
CVD event by screen time level. The proportional hazards
assumption was examined by comparing the cumulative
hazard plots grouped on exposure, although no appreciable
violations were noted. Test for linear trend was obtained by
entering the categorical variables as continuous parameters
in the models. We applied Cox models that were adjusted
for age and sex (Model 1), plus all covariables minus
physical activity (Model 2), plus physical activity (Model 3).
To account for the skewed distribution of physical activity,
in an alternative analysis we re-ran the Cox models with
physical activity as a categorical variable (no physical activity
vs. some physical activity, �150 min/week vs. �150 min/
week), but because results were not appreciably different, we
only present the models with the continuous physical
activity variables. To further address the issue of reverse
causality, we repeated the Cox models after excluding CVD
events occurring during the first year of follow-up and
cancer registrations before baseline. In another analysis we
excluded events in the first 2 years of follow-up and cancer


time variable to �2 and �2 h/day to preserve statistical
power. For the same reason, we used the same dichotomous
screen time variable when we stratified our analyses by sex,
physical activity level (�150 min/week vs. �150 min/week;
no physical activity/any physical activity), BMI level (�25
kg/m[2] vs. �25 kg/m[2]), and smoking (noncurrent smoker vs.
current smoker). To provide a direct comparison for the
potential hazard of screen time and the potential benefit of
physical activity, we ran analogous Cox models with physical activity as the main exposure with adjustments for: 1)
age and sex; 2) plus nonscreen time covariables; 3) plus
screen time. To enable direct comparisons, both screen time
and physical activity were entered as continuous variables in
this analysis.
To test the extent to which certain biological risk factors
explained the association between sedentary time and cardiovascular events, we used a method similar to that used by
us (21) and others (24). This method involved: 1) separately
adding CRP, BMI, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol
into a basic (sex-, age-, and physical activity-adjusted) Cox
model; and 2) using the following formula to calculate
proportion of CVD risk explained by each biological risk
factor:

HR basic model � HR adjusted

� 100
HR basic model � 1

The CRP was log transformed to improve normality of
distribution. All blood variables and BMI were included as
continuous variables. Analyses were also run entering risk
markers as categorical variables, although this did not
appreciably alter the results. We used analysis of variance
with Scheffe post hoc tests and chi-square tests to examine
univariable relationships of the confounders or potential
mediators with the exposure variables.
Analyses were performed with SPSS (version 13, SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, Illinois), and all tests of statistical significance
were based on 2-sided probability.

Results

A total of 325 any-cause deaths (153 in men) and 215
incident cardiovascular events (107 in men) occurred during
4.3 (�0.5) years of average follow-up and 19,364 personyears at risk in the core sample. Table 1 presents the
descriptive characteristics of the core sample.
**Cox models. Table 2 shows the hazard ratios (HRs) and**
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality and
CVD events. All-cause mortality risk increased with �4
h/day of screen time, and CVD event risk increased with
�2 h/day of screen time. Adjusting for physical activity
made very little difference in both types of analyses (Table 2).
Excluding deaths or CVD events in the first year of follow-up
and participants with previous cancer registration slightly
weakened the associations (Table 3). Results were robust to

Online Table 1 presents analyses stratified by physical
activity and other key risk factors. Although the statistical
power in certain strata was low due to low number of events,
effect estimates were markedly consistent in direction.
There was little evidence for an association between screen
time and CVD events among those who reported longstanding illness (n � 2,234; 158 CVD events): fully adjusted

Despite the small number of events among those with no
long-standing illness (n � 2,016, 55 CVD events) and the

**Explanatory analysis. A total of 1,928 cases had valid data**
in all 4 potentially mediating variables (BMI, CRP, total
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol), corresponding to 70 CVD
events, and were entered in the explanatory analysis. Compared with those excluded, those included had lower mean
age, higher physical activity (p � 0.002), and lower screen
time (p � 0.001) and were more likely to be married (p �
0.02), have a BMI over 30 kg/m[2], have a long-standing


have been diagnosed with hypertension (p � 0.001), not to
have had a CVD event (p � 0.001), and to have met the
physical activity recommendations (p � 0.001) (data not
shown). Figure 1 presents the extent to which BMI, HDL
and total cholesterol, and CRP explain the associations
between screen time and CVD events. CRP explained CVD
events to the greatest extent (18%), which was equal to the
amount explained by the 3 metabolic factors together.
These 4 biological factors explained approximately 28% of
the screen time–CVD association, with 25% explained by
BMI, HDL cholesterol, and CRP. These 3 variables (but
not total cholesterol) met the statistical criteria for being a
mediator variable (25).

Discussion

Our results suggest that there is an independent, deleterious
relationship of screen-based recreational sitting time with
CVD events and all-cause mortality. Compared with those
spending �2 h/day on screen-based entertainment, there
was a 48% increased risk of all-cause mortality in those
spending �4 h/day and an approximately 125% increase in
risk of CVD events in those spending �2 h/day (Table 3).
These associations were independent of traditional risk
factors such as smoking, hypertension, BMI, social class, as
well as physical activity. Our all-cause mortality results are
in agreement with a large study of Canadian adults who
were followed up for 12 years, where the all-cause mortality
HR for the highest category of nonrecreational (work,
school, housework) daily sitting time (“almost all the time”)
was 1.54 (26). Another study among �8,000 Australian
adults reported a very similar all-cause mortality HR (1.46)
for �4 h of TV watching compared with the �2 h/day
reference group (23). Both studies were also robust for
adjustments or stratifications by sex, physical activity level,
smoking, and BMI. The Canadian study, however, had
minimal control of physical health at baseline, which makes

were able to exclude respondents with objectively verified
CVD/cancer at baseline and adjust for multiple indicators of
health. Our study specifically examined recreational sedentary time. Because the largest proportion of sitting time for
many people is spent at work and in many circumstances is
difficult to modify, our data imply that reduced recreational
sitting time might be linked to reduced risk. Although we
found no evidence of a dose-response relationship, our
analysis suggests that a threshold of �2 h/day of screen time
might be linked to an increased risk for a CVD event. The
Australian study (23) found that daily TV viewing times in
excess of 4 h/day (but not 2 to 4 h/day) were associated with
CVD death risk. We speculate that this disagreement
occurs because our exposure variable was more inclusive
than TV alone that was used in the Australian study and
because our CVD outcome included nonfatal as well as fatal
events. We were not able to demonstrate, in contrast to the
Canadian (26) study, a clear relationship between screen
time and CVD events among those who meet the physical
activity recommendations and among those with a BMI
�25 kg/m[2] (Online Table 1). In this analysis, there were
only 50 events, and as such, we speculate that the lack of a
robust and statistically important association was due to
limited statistical power. Nevertheless, the direction of the
association was markedly consistent across all strata, lending
support to our main conclusion that screen time is an
independent predictor of CVD events. Another large study
among U.S. women, Manson et al. (27), found that extreme
amounts of sitting (�16 h/day) were linked to an increased


years of follow-up. Such levels of sitting imply that an
individual spends their entire waking time sitting, but there
was no evidence for adverse effects of smaller amounts of
daily sitting (27).
**Biological mediators. The precise pathways linking sitting**
and cardio-metabolic disease are unclear. It has been suggested that metabolic mechanisms might partly explain
these links (15), and data from animals have demonstrated
that prolonged sitting might disturb lipid metabolism.
There is evidence for a dramatic reduction of lipoprotein
lipase activity (by 80% to 90%) during sitting compared with
standing up or ambulating (28). Lipoprotein lipase is a key
enzyme for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
in the endothelium, and its reduced activity might raise the
possibility of other metabolic actions being impaired (15).
Our study provides novel findings to suggest a role of
metabolic and inflammatory pathways in partly explaining
the association between sitting and CVD risk. A wellestablished marker of low-grade inflammation, CRP, was
approximately 3-fold higher in participants spending more
than 4 h/day in screen time and explained a substantial
amount of the screen time–CVD association. Because
screen time was assessed at the same time point as the risk
markers, we cannot establish the nature of the temporal
relationship between these factors. Nevertheless, our results
are in concordance with another study of ours with clear
temporal element, which found that TV viewing at age 23
years was independently associated with composite factors
of metabolic (including HDL and BMI) and hemostatic/

(total or LDL) biomarkers at 42 years (29) (Stamatakis et al.,
unpublished observations, January to February, 2010). Both
sets of our results are partly corroborated by experimental data
in humans. The induction of 5 days bed rest, which represents
an extreme form of sedentary behavior, had profound effects on
various metabolic risk (including insulin resistance and vascular
dysfunction) but not on inflammation (30). Thus, low-grade
inflammation might only result from chronic exposure to
sedentary lifestyle. A further important mechanism might
be related to a decreased expression of endothelial nitric
oxide synthase that is caused from reduced local shear stress
as a result of lower blood flow from excessive sitting. Further
experimental studies will be required to determine the exact
mechanisms accounting for increased CVD risk during
prolonged inactivity in humans.
**Strengths. The main strengths of this study are the de-**
tailed measures we were able to take to minimize reverse
causality, the many potential confounders we included in
our models, and the objectively confirmed CVD events.
Other strengths include the nationally representative sample
that is expected to have adequate variability in terms of
primary and secondary exposures, and therefore it is appropriate to examine the relationships of interest.
**Study limitations. Screen time was self-reported. The TV**
and computer use questions have been shown to underestimate sedentary time when compared with accelerometry
(31). Although we have no information on the reliability
and criterion validity of the SHS03 screen time questions,
we observed the expected associations of screen time with
various sociodemographic variables, which provides convergent validity evidence of the screen time data. It is also
encouraging that a recent review (7) concluded that TV and
computer use time questions have the strongest reliability
and validity among sitting-related questions. Although
screen time is a partial indicator of overall sitting, TV and
computer use account for the overwhelming proportion of
leisure time sitting among British adults (32). Also, screen
entertainment time tends to be associated with excess calorie
consumption, but we were unable to account for dietary
intake, although our results were independent of BMI.
Finally, our explanatory analyses were limited by the small
sample size available, due to limited compliance with blood
measurements.

Conclusions

We found a deleterious relationship between recreational
sitting and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.
Our analyses suggest the relationship is independent of
physical activity, although further studies that employ objective measures of activity and sedentary time are required
to confirm this. We also provide evidence to suggest a role
of metabolic and inflammatory pathways in partly explaining the association between sitting and CVD risk. Further
experimental studies will be required to determine the exact


tary behavior guideline in public health recommendations
for CVD prevention.
