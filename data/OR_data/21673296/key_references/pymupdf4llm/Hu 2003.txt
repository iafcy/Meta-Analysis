reduction of sedentary behaviors. Television (TV) watching is a major sedentary behavior in the United States. In a
surveyconductedin1997,anadultmale
spent approximately 29 hours per week
watching TV, and an adult female spent
34 hours per week.[1] In recent decades,
in parallel with increasing obesity, there
has been a steady increase in the number of homes with multiple TV sets, videocassette recorders (VCRs), cable TV,
and remote controls, as well as the number of hours spent watching TV.[1]
Compared with other sedentary activities such as sewing, playing board
games, reading, writing, and driving a
car,TVwatchingresultsinalowermetabolicrate.[2] Constantexposuretofoodadvertisingleadstoincreasedfoodandcalorie intake and unhealthy eating

**Context Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have**
largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction
of sedentary behaviors.

**Objective To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, espe-**
cially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women.

**Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992**
to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses’ Health Study. The obesity analysis included 50277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and
were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed
questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer.

**Main Outcome Measures Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.**

**Results During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5%) of 50277 women who had a BMI**
of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI �30). Overall, we documented 1515 new
cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of
obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching
was associated with a 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-30%) increase in obesity and a 14% (95% CI, 5%-23%) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in
sitting at work was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 0%-10%) increase in obesity and a
7% (95% CI, 0%-16%) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at
home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9% (95% CI, 6%-12%) reduction in obesity and a
12% (95% CI, 7%-16%) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking
was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%-29%) reduction in obesity and a 34% (95%
CI, 27%-41%) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30% (95% CI,
24%-36%) of new cases of obesity and 43% (95% CI, 32%-52%) of new cases of
diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (�10 h/wk of TV
watching and �30 min/d of brisk walking).

**Conclusions Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watch-**
ing, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes,
whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk.
This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other
sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.

SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS AND RISK OF OBESITY AND DIABETES


**Diagnosis of Diabetes**
A supplementary questionnaire regarding symptoms, diagnostic tests, and hypoglycemic therapy was mailed to
women who indicated on any biennial
questionnaire that they had been diagnosed with diabetes. A case of diabetes
was considered confirmed if at least 1
of the following was reported on the
supplementary questionnaire: (1) classic symptoms plus elevated glucose levels (a fasting plasma glucose concentration �140 mg/dL [7.7 mmol/L] or a
randomly measured concentration of at
least 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]); (2) at
least 2 elevated plasma glucose concentrations on different occasions in the absence of symptoms (levels as above or
�200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L] after �2
hours of oral glucose tolerance testing); and (3) treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Our criteria
for diabetes classification are consistent with those proposed by the National Diabetes Data Group.[14]

The validity of this diagnostic procedure has been verified in a subsample
of this study population.[15] In addition,
another substudy assessing the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes suggested a very low rate of false-negative
results.[16]

**Statistical Analysis**
Person-timeforeachparticipantwascalculated from the date of return of the
1992 questionnaires to the date of confirmed type 2 diabetes (for diabetes
analysis only), the year of first reported
obesity (for obesity analysis only), death
from any cause, or June 1, 1998, whichever came first. Incidence rates of obesity or type 2 diabetes were obtained by
dividing the number of cases by personyears in each category of average time
spent on each sedentary behavior (eg,
TV watching). Relative risks (RRs) were
computed as the incidence rate in a specific category of TV watching divided by
that in the reference category, with adjustment for 5-year age categories. Tests
for linear trend across increasing categories of average time spent watching
TV were conducted by treating the categories as a continuous variable and as

has not been well studied, especially
among women. We therefore examined prospectively the relationship betweenseveralcommonsedentarybehaviors and incidence of obesity and type 2
diabetes in a large cohort of women.

**METHODS**
**Study Participants**
The Nurses’ Health Study cohort was established in 1976 when 121700 female
registerednursesaged30to55yearsand
residing in 1 of 11 US states responded
to mailed questionnaires regarding their
medical history and health practices; detailshavebeenpublishedelsewhere.[9] For
this study, we excluded women with diagnosed cardiovascular disease
(n=3102), cancer (n=9917), or diabetes (n=4373) in 1992. The final sample
for the diabetes analysis consisted of
68497 women. For the obesity analysis, we also excluded women who were
already obese (body mass index [BMI]
�30) in 1992 or earlier cycles, leaving
50277 women in the final analysis.

**Assessment of Sedentary**
**Behaviors and Physical Activity**
In 1992, participants were asked to report their average weekly time spent sitting at home while watching TV or
VCR, sitting at work or away from home
or while driving, and other sitting at
home (eg, reading, meal times, at desk).
They were also asked to report time
spent standing or walking around at
home or at work. The responses included 9 categories (ranging from 0
h/wk to �90 h/wk). In the current
analyses, 5 categories were coded consistently across all the 5 items (0-1, 2-5,
6-20, 21-40, and �40 h/wk).
In 1992, 1994, and 1996, participants were asked the amount of time
they spent on average per week on each
ofthefollowingphysicalactivities:walking, jogging, running, bicycling, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing
machine, lap swimming, squash/
racquetball, and tennis. They were also
asked about their usual walking pace,
specified as easy/casual (�2 miles per
hour[mph]),normal(2-2.9mph),brisk
(3-3.9 mph), or very brisk/striding (�4


mph). From this information, weekly
energyexpenditureinmetabolicequivalent hours (MET-hours) was calculated.[2] For example, brisk walking requires an energy expenditure of about
4 METs and is considered to be a moderate-intensity activity. In this cohort,
walking is the most common type of activity (60% of all women reported that
they walked �1 h/wk). Because the results using baseline and updated physicalactivitymeasuresweresimilar,wereported only baseline analyses.
The reproducibility and validity of the
physical activity questionnaire has been
described elsewhere.[10] In a representative sample (n=147) of participants in
the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort, the
2-year test-retest correlation for activity
was0.59.Thecorrelationbetweenphysical activity reported on 1-week recalls
and that reported on the questionnaire
was 0.79. The correlation between activity reported in diaries and that reported on the questionnaire was 0.62. In
a separate study on a population aged 20
to 59 years recruited from a university
community(n=103),thecorrelationbetween physical activity score on a very
similarquestionnaireandmaximumoxygen consumption was 0.54.[11] In a parallel cohort of men, average hours of TV
watching were significantly associated
with higher levels of leptin and lowdensitylipoproteincholesterolandlower
levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1.[12]

**Assessment of Obesity**
Bodyweightwasself-reportedinthebiennialquestionnaires.Self-reportedweights
were highly correlated with measured
weights (r=0.96; mean difference, 1.5
kg).[13] In 1976, the nurses were asked to
report their height to the closest inch.
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as
weightinkilogramsdividedbythesquare
of height in meters. Incidence of obesity
is defined as the transition from nonobese (BMI �30) in 1992 to a BMI of 30
or more at the end of follow-up in 1998.
Thus,onlyindividualswithaBMIofless
than 30 across all time points (between
1976and1992)wereincludedintheobesity analysis (n=50277).

cise (TABLE 1). However, the correlation between TV watching and physical activity levels was minimal
(r =−0.03). These women also had
higher intake of total energy, total and
saturated fats, red meat, processed meat,
refined grain products, snacks, sweets/
desserts, and lower intakes of fish, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
During 6 years of follow-up (282141
person years), 3757 women who were
not obese at baseline (7.5%) became
obese in 1998. Time spent watching TV
was positively associated with risk of
obesity (TABLE 2). The age-adjusted
RRs across categories of TV watching
(0-1, 2-5, 6-20, 21-40, �40 h/wk) were
1.0, 1.23, 1.42, 1.68, and 2.00, respectively (P for trend, � .001). Further ad

signing the middle score for the category as its value.
We used Cox regression to adjust estimated incidence rate ratios simultaneously for potential confounding variables. In the multivariate analyses of
onset of obesity, we adjusted for age
(�50, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, �65 years),
smoking (never, past, current 1-14, 1524, and �25 cigarettes/d), alcohol consumption (0, 0.1-4.9, 5-14.9, �15 g/d),
andphysicalactivity(METsinquintiles).
We further adjusted for dietary variables including total energy intake, total
fat, glycemic load, and cereal fiber (all in
quintiles). For multivariate analyses of
diabetes, our covariates included age,
smoking,alcoholconsumption,andfamily history of diabetes. Further analyses


adjusted for dietary intakes of polyunsaturated fat, glycemic load, cereal fiber, and trans fat (all in quintiles).[17]
We calculated the populationattributable risk to estimate the percentages of obesity and type 2 diabetes cases
in this population that are attributable
to the joint effects of 2 risk factors (either �10 h/wk of TV watching or �30
min/d walking or equivalent energy
expenditure).[18] _P=.05 was considered_
significant. Statistical analysis was performedusingSASstatisticalsoftware,version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

**RESULTS**
Women who spent more time watching TV were more likely to smoke and
drink alcohol and less likely to exer

SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS AND RISK OF OBESITY AND DIABETES


Sitting at work and other sitting at
home (last category only) were both associatedwithsignificantlyincreasedrisk
of diabetes in multivariate analyses adjusting for dietary and nondietary covariates (Table 3). Standing or walking around at home was associated with
a modestly lower risk of diabetes.
Tocomparethepredictiveroleofvarioussedentarybehaviorsandphysicalactivity, we conducted a multivariate
analysis including simultaneously these
behaviors (in continuous form), physical activity (4 METs/d, equivalent to 1
h/d of brisk walking), and nondietary
and dietary covariates. Among various
sedentary behaviors, time spent watchingTVwasmoststronglyassociatedwith
obesity risk (FIGURE 1). For each 2-h/d


justment for exercise levels and other
covariates did not appreciably alter the
RRs. Sitting at work or away from home
or driving was also significantly associated with elevated risk of obesity. In
contrast, time spent standing or walking around at home was associated
with a lower risk of obesity (multivariate RR comparing extreme categories, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.61-0.97; P for trend, �.001). Further adjustment for baseline BMI substantially attenuated the RRs. The multivariate RR comparing the extreme
categories of TV watching was 1.29
(95% CI, 1.01-1.66). These results suggest that women who watched more TV
were already on a trajectory to become obese at baseline.


During 6 years of follow-up (396900
person-years), we documented 1515
newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for age, average
time spent watching TV was significantly associated with increased risk of
type 2 diabetes (TABLE 3). The RRs
across categories of average hours spent
watching TV per week were 1.0, 1.10,
1.30, 1.53, and 1.98 (P for trend,
�.001). Further adjustment for dietary factors slightly attenuated the RRs.
As expected, these RRs were substantially attenuated after further adjustment for BMI (RR comparing extreme
categories, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.82-1.67),
suggesting that the increased risk of diabetes associated with TV watching was
largely mediated through obesity.

and the lowest TV watching category
(�6 h/wk watching TV), those who
were in the lowest of METs per week
and most sedentary category (�20 h/wk
watching TV) had a significantly increased risk of obesity (RR, 1.90; 95%
CI, 1.61-2.24) and type 2 diabetes (RR,
2.89; 95% CI, 2.21-3.79).
Weestimatedthat30%(95%CI,24%36%)ofnewobesitycasesand43%(95%
CI, 32%-52%) of type 2 diabetes cases
could be attributable to the joint effects
of 2 risk factors (either �10 h/wk of TV
watching or �30 min/d walking or
equivalent energy expenditure). Only
15% of participants in our cohort belonged to the joint low-risk group (defined as �10 h/wk of TV watching and
�30 min/d of walking or equivalent
energy expenditure).


increase in time spent watching TV,
there was a 23% (95% CI, 17%-30%) increase in obesity risk. In contrast, other
sitting at home or standing or walking
around home was associated with a significantly lower risk of obesity. Each
1-h/d increase in brisk walking was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 19%29%) reduction in obesity.
Watching TV was also most strongly
associated with elevated risk of type 2
diabetes (Figure 1). Each 2-h/d increment in time spent watching TV was
associated with a 14% (95% CI, 5%23%) increase in diabetes risk. Standing or walking around at home was associated with a lower risk of diabetes
(12% [95% CI, 7%-16%] risk reduction for each 2-h/d increment). Brisk
walking was strongly associated with


a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (34%

[95% CI, 27%-41%] risk reduction for
each 1-h/d increment).
To address the possibility that surveillance for diabetes may have varied
according to physical activity levels, we
did an analysis restricted to cases reporting at least 1 symptom of diabetes
at diagnosis. Results from this subgroup were not appreciably different
from those for the entire cohort. The
multivariate RRs across categories of averagehoursspentwatchingTVperweek
were 1.0, 1.09, 1.30, 1.44, and 1.70.
In multivariate analyses, we observed independent effects of TV watching and exercise levels on obesity and
type 2 diabetes (FIGURE 2). Compared
with women who were in the most active (the highest tertile of METs/wk)

**COMMENT**
In this large prospective cohort of
women, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were significantly
associated with risk of obesity and type
2 diabetes. Sedentary occupation reflected by long hours of sitting or standing at work was significantly associated with risk of obesity. In contrast,
even light activities such as standing or
walking around at home (which probably reflects household work) and brisk


walking were associated with a significantly lower risk of obesity and diabetes. Our study suggests that 30% of obesity cases and 43% of type 2 diabetes
cases can be potentially prevented by
following a relatively active lifestyle
(�10 h/wk TV watching and �30
min/d of brisk walking).
Our results are consistent with previous studies of TV watching in relation to obesity and weight gain in children[4,6,7] and adults.[19-22] They are also


consistent with our previous analysis
showing a positive association between prolonged TV watching and type
2diabetesamongmenintheHealthProfessionals Follow-up Study.[5] Our findings extend the literature showing that
moderate-intensity activity such as brisk
walking is strongly protective against
type 2 diabetes[15,23-29] and indicate a continuum in the relationship between
physical activity levels and obesity and
diabetes risk, and TV watching has the
highest risk for obesity and diabetes
among several sedentary behaviors.
There are at least 3 potential mechanisms for the observed positive association between TV watching and obesity
and diabetes risk.[30] First, TV watching
typically displaces physical activity and
thus reduces energy expenditure.[20,21] In
our study, women who spent more time
watching TV tended to exercise less, but
the effects of TV watching and exercise
on the development of obesity and diabetes were largely independent. Second, TV watching results in increased
food and total energy intake because individuals tend to eat while watching TV
despite their low physical activity levels.[3-5] Also, participants who spent more
time watching TV tended to follow an

unhealthy eating pattern.[5] Such an eating pattern is directly related to commercialadvertisementsandfoodcuesappearing on TV[31] and has been associated
with risk of obesity and diabetes.[32] Another potential mechanism is that TV
viewing results in lower energy expenditurecomparedwithothersedentaryactivities such as sewing, reading, writing,anddrivingacar.[2] Thecombinations
of these factors may explain our findings that TV watching is more strongly
associated with obesity than other sedentary behaviors.
Our findings could have important
public health implications. The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has
increased dramatically in the past several decades in the United States.[33] Althoughleisure-timephysicalactivitylevelsaregenerallylowintheUnitedStates,
there is no evidence that recreational
physical activity has declined in recent
decades.However,sedentarylifestylehas
become more prevalent and pervasive as
reflectedbythelargenumbersofTVsets,
VCRs, and remote controls per household and increasing time spent watching TV in the past several decades.[1] We
speculated that increasing sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, may
have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States. Given the
strong relationship observed between
sedentary lifestyle and obesity and diabetesrisk,publichealthcampaignstoreduce obesity and diabetes should not
only promote increasing exercise levels, but also decreasing sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged TV watching. Substantial health benefits can be
gained by even light to moderate activity such as doing household chores and
byengaginginsimpleandconvenientactivities such as walking.
The major strengths of this study include its large sample size, prospective
design, and detailed measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and a
multitude of dietary and nondietary covariates. However, the observational nature of this study cannot prove a causal
relationship between TV watching and
obesity because of the potential reciprocal relationship between TV watch

ing behavior and obesity. This issue
could be addressed in randomized clinicaltrialsamongadults.However,schoolbased intervention studies have already demonstrated that reductions in
TV watching were effective in preventing obesity among children.[8]
Inconclusion,ourdataprovidestrong
evidence that sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged TV watching, are directlyrelatedtoobesityanddiabetesrisk.
In contrast, even light- to moderateintensityactivitysubstantiallylowersthe
risk. While these findings lend further
support to current guidelines that promote physical activity, they also suggest the importance of reducing sedentary behaviors in the prevention of
obesity and type 2 diabetes.
