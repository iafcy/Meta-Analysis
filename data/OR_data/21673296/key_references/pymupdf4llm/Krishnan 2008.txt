 Physical Activity and Television Watching in Relation to Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

## The Black Women’s Health Study

Supriya Krishnan, Lynn Rosenberg, and Julie R. Palmer

Initially submitted March 24, 2008; accepted for publication October 1, 2008.

Few modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes have been documented in the high-risk population of US black
women. The authors used data from 45,668 black women aged 21–69 years, followed biennially from 1995 to 2005
in the Black Women’s Health Study, to estimate incidence rate ratios for type 2 diabetes comparing various levels
of physical activity and television watching. Cox proportional hazards models were used to control confounding
factors. During 10 years of follow-up, 2,928 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified. Vigorous activity
was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (Ptrend < 0.0001); the incidence rate ratio for �7 hours per week
was 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.59) relative to no activity. Brisk walking for �5 hours per week was
associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk (incidence rate ratio ¼ 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.92) relative to no walking.
Television watching was associated with an increased type 2 diabetes risk: The incidence rate ratio was 1.86 (95%
CI: 1.54, 2.24) for �5 hours relative to <1 hour of television per day, independent of physical activity. These
observational data suggest that black women might reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by increasing
their time spent walking or engaged in vigorous physical activity and by limiting television watching.

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the
United States and affects an estimated 20.6 million people
(1, 2). The burden of this disease is particularly large among
African-American women, among whom the prevalence is
almost twice that of non-Hispanic whites (2). Although epidemiologic studies support a role for physical activity in
preventing type 2 diabetes (3–15), there has been little attention focused on the impact of this factor in the high-risk
population of African-American women. A recent randomized clinical trial (Diabetes Prevention Program) showed
that an intensive lifestyle modification (healthy diet and
moderate physical activity of 30 minutes a day for 5 days
a week) reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 50% as
compared with placebo (10). We undertook to examine how
the actual levels of physical activity in a large population of
African-American women were related to type 2 diabetes


incidence. With detailed questionnaire data collected every
2 years from over 40,000 women in the Black Women’s
Health Study (BWHS), we were able to assess the influence
of vigorous activity, walking, and television watching on the
incidence of type 2 diabetes in black women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The BWHS, a collaborative project of Boston University
and Howard University, is an ongoing prospective follow-up
study of African-American women from across the United
States (16). The study began in 1995 when women aged
21–69 years were enrolled through postal questionnaires
mailed to subscribers of Essence magazine, members of
several professional organizations, and friends and relatives
of early respondents. The baseline questionnaire collected

information on demographics, medical and reproductive history, height, weight, physical activity, and cigarette and alcohol
use, among other factors. Dietary intake was assessed by using
a modified version of the NCI [National Cancer Institute]Block food frequency questionnaire (17, 18).
After exclusion of 5,500 women who had completed the
questionnaire but were outside the age range 21–69 years,
who had not completed the questionnaire satisfactorily, or
whose addresses were judged to be invalid, 59,052 women
comprised the cohort that has been followed. Biennial
follow-up questionnaires collect updated information on incident disease, weight, smoking, physical activity, and other
factors. Follow-up has averaged over 80% of the baseline
cohort over 5 completed questionnaire cycles.
Analyses are based on follow-up from 1995 through 2005,
with follow-up beginning at age 30 years. We excluded
women who did not reach the age of 30 years by the end
of follow-up (n ¼ 1,330); who reported a history of diabetes
(n ¼ 2,930) or gestational diabetes (n ¼ 636) at baseline;
who reported stroke (n ¼ 359), myocardial infarction (n ¼
447), or cancer (n ¼ 1,144) at baseline (whose questionnaire
assessment of physical activity and diet may not reflect longterm patterns because these conditions may have caused
modifications of physical activity level and diet); who were
pregnant at baseline (n ¼ 957); or who had missing data on
weight, height, or physical activity at baseline (n ¼ 5,581).
The final analysis cohort consisted of 45,668 women.

Case definition

Each follow-up questionnaire asked about new diagnoses
of diabetes during the previous 2-year period. Incident diabetes was reported by 2,928 women during follow-up.
We assessed the accuracy of self-reported diabetes among
a random sample of 227 women whose physicians provided
data from their medical records. The diagnosis of type 2
diabetes was confirmed for 218 (96%) of the women. Of
the remaining 9 women, 3 did not have diabetes, 2 had type
1 diabetes, 2 had gestational diabetes, 1 had steroid-induced
diabetes, and 1 was classified as having metabolic syndrome.

Exposure measurement

Physical activity data were obtained on each follow-up
questionnaire. Subjects were asked separate questions on
the number of hours per week spent on vigorous physical
activity (e.g., running, swimming), walking for exercise,
and walking to and from work. Response options were 0,
<1, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–9, and �10 hours per week. Participants were asked on the 2003 questionnaire to classify their
usual walking pace as casual/strolling (<2 mph), average/
normal (2–<3 mph), fairly brisk (3–<4 mph), and brisk/
striding (�4 mph) (1 mile ¼ 1.6 km). In our analysis of
walking and diabetes risk, we used data on walking pace
from the 2003 questionnaire to reflect their usual walking
pace at all time periods. We created a variable that grouped
participants into categories based on both walking pace (casual, average, or brisk (fairly brisk and brisk)) and amount
of walking, taking into account both walking for exercise
and walking to and from work. We created cumulative


average variables for each individual based on activity data
from each questionnaire that preceded the occurrence of
diabetes or end of follow-up; when data are available for
a number of different time periods, cumulative averages
give a better representation of long-term exposure, as compared with the standard follow-up approach of updating the
exposure variable for each time period (19). The number of
hours per day spent watching television was also assessed
in each questionnaire with possible response categories of 0,
<1, 1–2, 3–4, and �5 hours per day.
Physical activity assessment in the BWHS was validated
in a study conducted at the Howard University Cancer
Center (20). Actigraphs (activity monitors) were worn by
101 BWHS participants during their waking hours for 7
days. They also completed 7-day physical activity diaries
and completed the BWHS questions on physical activity.
Significant positive correlations were observed between
BWHS questionnaire data and actigraph measurements for
total activity (metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week), r ¼
0.28, P < 0.01; walking, r ¼ 0.26, P < 0.01; and vigorous
activity, r ¼ 0.40, P < 0.01. Correlations between the diary
data and the BWHS questionnaire data were significant for
total activity (MET-hours/week), r ¼ 0.32, P < 0.01, as well
as vigorous activity, r ¼ 0.41, P < 0.01.

Data analysis

Age- and time-stratified Cox proportional hazards models
were used to calculate incidence rate ratios, also known as
hazard ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (21). Personyears were calculated from baseline to the year of diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes, loss to follow-up, death, or the end of
follow-up in 2005, whichever came first. Incidence rate
ratios for diabetes were calculated for the levels of each
physical activity measure relative to the lowest level.
Time-varying covariates were reassigned every 2 years by
using the Anderson-Gill data structure (22). The AndersonGill data structure creates a new record for every follow-up
cycle at which the participant is at risk and assigns covariate
values reported for that specific questionnaire cycle. The
covariates included in the multivariable models were age
(continuous), questionnaire cycle, family history of diabetes
(biologic parents, siblings, or children), years of education
(�12, 13–15, 16, �17), household income in dollars
(�15,000, 15,001–25,000, 25,001–35,000, 35,001–50,000,
50,001–100,000, and >100,000), marital status (single,
married, divorced/separated/widowed), cigarettes smoked
per day (0, <15, 15–24, and �25), alcoholic drinks per
week (0, 1–6, 7–13, �14), energy intake in kilocalories
(quintiles), and coffee consumption in cups/week (<1, 1,
2–3, �4) (1 cup ¼ 236.6 ml) . We carried out analyses with
and without terms for body mass index (weight (kg)/height
(m)[2]) that we hypothesized to be in the causal pathway
between physical activity and type 2 diabetes risk. Tests
for linear trend across categories of physical activity variables were carried out by including in the regression model
an ordinal term for increasing levels of exposure. Departure
from the proportional hazards assumption was tested by
using a likelihood ratio test comparing models with and
without cross-product terms between exposure and age.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study
population by vigorous physical activity and television
watching. At baseline, 31.6% of the cohort reported no vigorous physical activity. Compared with women who exercised �7 hours per week, women who reported no vigorous
activity were older, had a higher mean body mass index,
smoked more, had a higher percentage of energy from fat,
and were less likely to walk for exercise. At baseline, 14.6%
of the population watched �5 hours of television per day.
Compared with women who watched <1 hour per day of
television, those who watched �5 hours per day were less
educated; had a higher mean body mass index, higher energy
intake, higher percentage of energy from fat, and greater use
of cigarettes and alcohol; and were less likely to participate
in vigorous physical activity or to walk for exercise. The
correlation coefficient for the relation between vigorous activity and television watching was �0.035 (P < 0.0001).
There were 2,928 incident cases of type 2 diabetes ascertained during 182,994 person-years of follow-up. In the
multivariable model, vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2).
The incidence rate ratio for �7 hours per week of vigorous
activity relative to 0 hours was 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.59) (Ptrend < 0.0001). When body mass
index was added to the model, the incidence rate ratio was
0.57 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.79) (data not shown). Brisk walking
was also associated with a reduced risk: The incidence rate
ratio for walking at a brisk pace for �5 hours per week


relative to no walking was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.92). With
inclusion of terms for body mass index in the regression
model, the incidence rate ratio was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.64,
1.19) (data not shown).
Television watching was positively associated with the
risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). The incidence rate ratio
was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.54, 2.24) for watching �5 hours per day
relative to <1 hour per day (Ptrend < 0.0001). In a multivariable model that included body mass index, the incidence rate
ratio was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.89) (data not shown).
The inverse association between vigorous physical activity and type 2 diabetes risk was present at all levels of body
mass index (Table 3), even among those with a body mass
index of �30, the World Health Organization definition of
obesity (23). The positive association of television watching
and risk of type 2 diabetes was also present at all levels of
body mass index. The association was strongest in those
with a body mass index of <25, among whom the incidence
rate ratio for watching �5 hours per day of television
was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.24, 5.02) relative to <1 hour per day
(Ptrend ¼ 0.01). The associations for vigorous activity and
television watching were similar among premenopausal and
postmenopausal women (data not shown).
Figure 1 shows the combined effect of vigorous physical
activity and television watching. The reference group was
those women who reported �3 hours per week of vigorous
activity and <1 hour per day of television watching. Type 2
diabetes risk increased with decreasing physical activity in
each category of television watching and increased with
increased television watching in each category of physical

activity and watching �5 hours per day of television was

DISCUSSION

In this large prospective study of black women, vigorous
physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of type


2 diabetes. Walking at a brisk pace, but not slow walking,
was also associated with a reduction in risk. The risk of type
2 diabetes was increased among women who spent an appreciable amount of time watching television, and this increase was apparent at every level of physical activity.
The present findings on vigorous physical activity in
black women are consistent with those reported for white
women in previous studies (4, 5, 7, 9, 12–14). Results from

the Diabetes Prevention Program trial showed that a lifestyle
intervention consisting of diet and physical activity was
effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes among all
racial subgroups, including African Americans (10). In the
Women’s Health Initiative observational cohort, there was
no significant association among African-American women,
but statistical power was limited because there were only
395 diabetic cases among the black women (13). The Women’s Health Initiative cohort included only postmenopausal
women, but this does not explain the difference between
their results and ours. We found an inverse association of
physical activity with diabetes in both pre- and postmenopausal women. The other epidemiologic studies that have
included an appreciable number of black women have been
cross-sectional in design (5, 6).
We had enough statistical power to assess the association
of physical activity and type 2 diabetes within strata of body
mass index, and we found that physical activity is beneficial
regardless of body mass index. Previous studies of physical
activity and diabetes that have assessed physical activity
within strata of body mass index have provided inconsistent
results (3, 4, 9, 12).
Our results showing that walking at a brisk pace is associated with a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes are consistent with findings on white women from the Nurses’ Health
Study (7). The Women’s Health Initiative did not find a sig

nificant association of walking with diabetes risk in black
women, but statistical power was limited (13).
The positive association between television watching and
type 2 diabetes risk in our study of black women is similar to
that found in 2 previous studies of white women (24) and
men (25). Importantly, this association was independent of
physical activity and other known risk factors for type 2
diabetes.

-----

Body mass index, which is influenced in part by levels of
physical activity and is a strong independent risk factor for
type 2 diabetes, may be an intermediate in the association of
physical activity and diabetes or a confounder of the association. When we controlled for body mass index in multivariable analyses, the association between physical activity
and type 2 diabetes was reduced slightly, but a strong inverse association still remained. In addition, the inverse
association of physical activity with diabetes risk was present at all levels of body mass index, including the <25
category of body mass index where confounding from body
mass index would be smallest. The latter 2 observations
suggest that confounding, if present, played a minor role
in the present study and that mechanisms other than body
mass index may also play a role in the reduction in risk.
The relation between type 2 diabetes and physical activity
may be mediated through increased insulin sensitivity due to
increases in levels of the glucose transporter protein GLUT-4
and muscle glycogen synthase activity, a decrease in serum
triglyceride concentration, and an increase in muscle capillary
network (15, 26). Physical activity can also lead to weight loss
or maintenance of a healthy weight (27), which in turn can
lead to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
The positive association between television watching and
type 2 diabetes might be explained by 2 mechanisms (28).
First, television watching is related to a lower expenditure of
energy, which in turn can lead to obesity, weight gain, and
increased risk of diabetes. Adjustment for body mass index
attenuated the incidence rate ratios in our study; this is
compatible with the association of television watching with
type 2 diabetes being at least partially mediated through
obesity. Another possible mechanism is that television
watching leads to a higher caloric intake and a relatively
unhealthy dietary pattern. Participants in our study who
watched more television had a higher energy intake and
a higher fat and carbohydrate intake as compared with those
who watched no television.
One of the main strengths of our study is the prospective
study design, which reduces the potential of recall bias. In
addition, the BWHS has high follow-up rates that reduce the
possibility of bias resulting from selective losses. The sample size was large, providing excellent statistical power to
assess effects overall and in subgroups. We were able to
adjust for a large number of possible confounding variables.
Physical activity was self-reported. Because we had repeated measures of physical activity, we were able to get
a better representation of long-term physical activity. Our
validation study showed significant correlations of questionnaire responses with diary and actigraph measurement of
physical activity. Nonetheless, measurement errors are
likely but should be nondifferential, which would move
estimates for the highest exposure categories toward the
null. To the extent that there was misclassification of exposure, the true association of activity with diabetes risk may
be even stronger than shown here.
Identification of type 2 diabetes cases was based on selfreport. A validation study indicated that type 2 diabetes was
reported with a high degree of accuracy. Some women with
undiagnosed type 2 diabetes were undoubtedly misclassified
as noncases, but the prevalence of undiagnosed disease was


likely to be low (29). Physicians arewellaware of the high risk
of diabetes among African-American women, and it seems
likely that BWHS participants were screened for the disease
duringthecourseofregularcheck-ups.Accesstohealthcareis
quitegood among BWHS participants: 93% reported that they
had health insurance in 1997, and 98% reported that they had
visited a physician/hospital in the past 2 years.
The BWHS participants were from 17 states across the
United States with approximately equal numbers living in
the Northeast, South, West, and Midwest. In addition, 97%
of the participants have completed high school or a higher
level of education. Among the US black female population
of the same ages, 83% have at least a high school education
(30). In this respect, our results should be applicable to most
US black women, except possibly the approximately 17%
who have not completed high school.
The present observational findings suggest that physical
activity may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in AfricanAmerican women, a population at high risk of the disease.
Recent recommendations for physical activity for adults include ‘‘moderate-intensity physical activities for at least 30
minutes on 5 or more days of the week’’ (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and ‘‘vigorous-intensity physical activity 3 or more days per week for 20 or more minutes
per occasion’’ (Healthy People 2010) (31). Like the majority
of adults in the United States, most African-American
women do not meet recommended levels of physical activity. Our results for vigorous activity and brisk walking suggest that levels approximating those recommended might
indeed be protective against type 2 diabetes. Regular brisk
walking may be easier to implement than vigorous physical
activity. Reducing sedentary behaviors, such as television
watching, or at least reducing the excess eating that often
accompanies it, might also be effective. A necessary first
step for the translation of scientific findings into behavioral
change is dissemination of the health information to those
affected, and the current results provide the basis for educating African-American women about the benefits of physical activity in preventing type 2 diabetes.
