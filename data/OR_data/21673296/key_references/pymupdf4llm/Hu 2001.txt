**Background: Television (TV) watching, a major sed-**
entary behavior in the United States, has been associated with obesity. We hypothesized that prolonged TV
watching may increase risk for type 2 diabetes.

**Methods: In 1986, 37918 men aged 40 to 75 years and**
free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer completed a detailed physical activity questionnaire. Starting from 1988, participants reported their average weekly
time spent watching TV on biennial questionnaires.


diabetes. After adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity levels, and other covariates, the RRs of diabetes
across categories of average hours spent watching TV per
week (0-1, 2-10, 11-20, 21-40, and �40) were 1.00, 1.66,
1.64, 2.16, and 2.87, respectively (P for trend, �.001).
This association was somewhat attenuated after adjustment for body mass index, but a significant positive gradient persisted (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.31;
_P for trend, .01)._

**Conclusions: Increasing physical activity is associated**
with a significant reduction in risk for diabetes, whereas
a sedentary lifestyle indicated by prolonged TV watching is directly related to risk. Our findings suggest the
importance of reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

### SUBJECTS AND METHODS

**SUBJECTS**

The Health Professional’s Follow-up Study (HPFS) began in
1986 when 51529 US health professionals (dentists, optometrists, pharmacists, podiatrists, osteopaths, and veterinarians), aged 40 to 75 years, answered a detailed questionnaire that included a comprehensive diet survey and items
on lifestyle practice and medical history.[16] Follow-up questionnaires were sent in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 to
update information on potential risk factors and to identify
newly diagnosed cases of diabetes and other diseases. We excluded from the present analysis men with a previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (n=4639), cancer (n=1638),
or diabetes (n=1796) at baseline. Participants with diagnosed cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline were excluded because these diagnoses may lead to change in physical activity levels. Participants who had missing information
on activity questions or reported implausible total energy intakeonthefoodfrequencyquestionnaire[17] (�3347or �17572
kJ/d) were also excluded (n=5538). We followed up the remaining 37918 men for incidence of type 2 diabetes during
the subsequent 10 years of the study.

**ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY**

Physical activity was assessed using mailed questionnaires at
baseline and every 2 years thereafter. Subjects were asked to
report the average amount of time they spent per week on
each of the following activities: walking, jogging, running,
bicycling, calisthenics or use of a rowing machine, lap swimming,squashorracquetball,andtennis.Theywerealsoasked
abouttheirusualwalkingpace,specifiedaseasyorcasual(�2
miles/h),normal(2-2.9miles/h),brisk(3-3.9miles/h),orstriding (�4 miles/h). From this information, weekly energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent hours (MET-hours) was
calculated.[10] Wedefinedanyphysicalactivityrequiring6METhours or greater (a 6-fold or greater increase above resting
metabolic rate) as vigorous. These activities included

fats and cereal fiber did not appreciably change the
results.
To minimize potential bias from subclinical disease, we conducted additional analyses in which we excluded cases of type 2 diabetes that occurred during the
first 2 years of follow-up. The multivariate RRs (without BMI) across quintiles of physical activity score were
1.00, 0.88, 0.75, 0.69, and 0.57 (P for trend, �.001). The
inverse association between total physical activity score
and diabetes risk was persistent in subgroup analyses according to age (�65 or �65 years), family history of diabetes, smoking (never or ever), and BMI (�25.0, 25.029.9, or �30.0 kg/m[2]) (Table 2). In particular, the
increased risks associated with family history of diabetes and obesity were substantially mitigated by increasing physical activity levels. To address the possibility that
medical surveillance may have varied according to physical activity level, we conducted an analysis restricted to
subjects reporting at least 1 symptom of diabetes at diagnosis (n=595). Results from this subgroup were simi

jogging, running, bicycling, calisthenics or use of a rowing
machine, lap swimming, squash or racquetball, and tennis.
In contrast, walking requires an energy expenditure of only
2 to 4.5 MET-hours, depending on pace, and was therefore
considered to be a moderate-intensity activity.
The reproducibility and validity of the physical activity
questionnaire was evaluated in a subsample (n=238) of participants in the HPFS cohort.[18] The Pearson correlation between moderate plus vigorous physical activity, assessed by
means of diaries for 4 weeks across different seasons, and that
reported on the questionnaire was 0.58. The correlation between vigorous activity score, assessed by means of the questionnaire, and resting pulse was −0.45; for pulse after stopping, the correlation was −0.41. In a separate study on a
population aged 20 to 59 years recruited from a university
community (n=103), the correlation between physical activity score on a similar questionnaire and maximum oxygen consumption was 0.54.[19] In a subsample of participants
in the HPFS cohort (n=466), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol level increased by 0.06 mmol/L (2.4 mg/dL) for
each increment of 20 MET-hours per week (P�.01).[20]
Starting from 1988, participants reported their average weekly time spent watching TV (including videotapes) on the biennial questionnaires. The 1988 questionnaire included 6 response categories (ranging from 0-1 to
�40 h/wk). Subsequent questionnaires included 13 response categories (ranging from 0 to �40 h/wk). In the present analyses, 5 categories were coded consistently across
all questionnaires (0-1, 2-10, 11-20, 21-40, and �40 h/wk).
In a subsample of participants in the HPFS (n=466), average hours of TV watching were significantly associated
with higher levels of leptin and low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol and with lower levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.[20]

**DIAGNOSIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES**

A supplementary questionnaire regarding symptoms, diagnostic tests, and hypoglycemic therapy was mailed to men

lar to those for the entire cohort (multivariate RRs without BMI in the model across quintiles of MET score were
1.00, 0.66, 0.65, 0.57, and 0.49; P for trend, �.001).
After adjustment for age and other covariates, we
observed a significant inverse association between MET
score for walking and risk for type 2 diabetes. The multivariate RRs across quintiles of walking score were 1.00,
1.02, 0.80, 0.76, and 0.72 (P for trend, �.001). This inverse association remained significant after adjustment
for vigorous exercise (RRs were 1.00, 1.06, 0.86, 0.82,
and 0.80; P for trend, .006). Independent of the number
of hours spent walking, walking pace was strongly associated with risk for diabetes. Compared with men whose
usual walking pace was easy or casual, multivariate RRs
were 0.68 for normal pace, 0.46 for brisk pace, and 0.39
for very brisk pace (P for trend, �.001).
Walking and vigorous exercise were associated with
comparable risk reductions for equivalent energy expenditure. When the walking and vigorous activity scores
were entered into the model as continuous variables si

who indicated on any biennial questionnaire that they had
been diagnosed with diabetes. A case of diabetes was considered confirmed if at least 1 of the following was reported on the supplementary questionnaire: (1) 1 or more
classic symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss,
hunger) plus 1 fasting plasma glucose level of at least 7.8
mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or random plasma glucose of at least
11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); (2) at least 2 elevated plasma
glucose concentrations on different occasions (fasting, �7.8
mmol/L [�140 mg/dL]; random, �11.1 mmol/L [�200 mg/
dL]; and/or �11.1 mmol/L [�200 mg/dL] after �2 hours
of oral glucose tolerance testing) in the absence of symptoms; or (3) treatment with hypoglycemic medication (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent). Because of potential associations between weight and physical activity, no body
weight criteria were used in the classification of type of diabetes for these analyses. Our criteria for diabetes classification are consistent with those proposed by the National
Diabetes Data Group[21] for 1986-1996. The validity of selfreport of diabetes has been verified in a subsample of 71
men from the HPFS cohort. A physician blinded to the information reported on the supplementary questionnaire and
reviewed the medical records according to the diagnostic
criteria. Of the 71 patients, 12 had incomplete records, eg,
absent laboratory data (n=2), or 1 set only of laboratory
data (n=9). Among the remaining 59 cases, the diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes was confirmed in 57 (97%). One patient
denied the diagnosis and another lacked evidence of diabetes in his submitted records. Similarly, 98% of diabetic
cases reported by the supplementary questionnaire were
confirmed by medical record review in a subsample of participants (n=62) in the Nurses’ Health Study.[22]

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Person-time for each participant was calculated from the
date of return of the 1986 (physical activity) or 1988 (TV
watching) questionnaires to the date of confirmed type 2
diabetes, death due to any cause, or January 1, 1996, whichever came first. Incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were obtained by dividing the number of cases by person-years in

multaneously, RRs associated with an increase in energy expenditures of 10 MET-hours per week were 0.89
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.96) for walking and
0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) for vigorous exercise.
Men who spent more time watching TV were more
likely to smoke and drink alcohol and less likely to exercise (Table 3). They were substantially heavier and
more likely to have hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. These men also had higher intake of total energy,
total and saturated fats, red meat, processed meat, French
fries, refined grain products, snacks, and sweets or desserts and lower intakes of fish, vegetables, fruits, and whole
grains.
After adjustment for age, average time spent watching TV was strongly associated with increased risk for
diabetes (Table 4). The RRs across categories of average hours spent watching TV per week (0-1, 2-10, 1120, 21-40, and �40) were 1.00, 1.62, 1.61, 2.22, and 3.35
(95% CI, 1.71-6.55, respectively; P for trend, �.001). After further adjustment for smoking, alcohol use, physi

each category of physical activity or average time spent on
watching TV. Relative risks (RRs) were computed as the
incidence rate in a specific category of MET score (ie, METhours per week) or TV watching divided by that in the reference category, with adjustment for 5-year age categories. Tests for linear trend across increasing categories of
MET score or average time spent watching TV were conducted by treating the categories as a continuous variable
and assigning the median score for the category as its value.
Both MET score or time spent watching TV were updated
every 2 years.
We used pooled logistic regression to adjust estimated incidence rate ratios simultaneously for potential confounding variables. In this approach, independent 2-year
blocks of person-time of follow-up are pooled for regression analysis, and the dependence of the incidence rates
on time is modeled nonparametrically with indicator variables. D’Agostino et al[23] have shown that the pooled logistic model is asymptotically equivalent to the Cox regression when the time intervals are short and the probability
of outcome in the intervals is low. Our covariates included age (40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and
�70 years), smoking (never, past, or current [1-14, 1524, and �25 cigarettes per day]), alcohol consumption (0-4,
5-9, 10-14, 15-29, and �30 g/d), parental history of diabetes, and history of hypercholesterolemia or hypertension at baseline. In additional analyses, we included body
mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters], in quintiles) in
the model to examine the degree to which the relation with
physical activity was mediated through BMI.
To examine whether the effects of physical activity on
diabetes were modified by important covariates, we conducted multivariate analyses according to categories of age
(�65 or �65 years), family history of diabetes (no or yes),
smoking (never or ever), and BMI (�25.0, 25.0-29.9, or
�30.0 kg/m[2]). To examine independent effects of physical activity and TV watching, we estimated RRs of diabetes according to joint classifications of these 2 variables.
In this analysis, both variables were classified into quartiles rather than 5 categories to have sufficient power.

cal activity, and other covariates, the positive association persisted (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.87;
95% CI, 1.46-5.65; P for trend, �.001). The significant
positive association persisted even after adjustment for
BMI (RR comparing extreme categories, 2.31; 95% CI,
1.17-4.56; P for trend, .01). Further simultaneous adjustment for intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated
fat, polyunsaturated fat, trans-fatty acids, and cereal fiber did not appreciably change the results (Table 4).
In multivariate analyses, we observed independent
effects of TV watching and physical activity levels
(Figure). Compared with men who were in the most active (�46 MET-hours per week) and the lowest TV watching category (�3.5 h/wk), those who were in the least
active (�10 MET-hours per week) and most sedentary
category (�15 h/wk watching TV) had a significantly increased risk for type 2 diabetes (RR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.874.55; P for interaction, .90). When total physical activity score and time spent watching TV were simultaneously
included in a multivariate model (without BMI), an in

**COMMENT**


In this large prospective cohort of men, greater leisure
time physical activity was associated with reduced risk
for type 2 diabetes. In contrast, a sedentary lifestyle, as
indicated by time spent watching TV, was significantly
associated with an increased risk for diabetes, inde

pendent of the effects of physical activity and body
weight.
Our findings extend the literature showing that
regular physical activity is associated with a substantial
reduction in risk for type 2 diabetes.[1-5,7,22] Our results
also suggest that the apparent beneficial effect of exercise is not confined to high-risk groups (eg, subjects
with �1 risk factors such as obesity and family history
of diabetes). Contrary to the belief that fitness and
physical activity might offset the adverse effects of obesity,[24] we found that men who were obese and physically active had a substantially increased risk for diabetes compared with those who were lean and inactive
(Table 2), although obese and inactive men were at

highest risk. In addition, we found that equivalent
energy expenditure from brisk walking or vigorous
exercise may confer comparable benefits. These findings are consistent with emerging evidence to support
the benefits of moderate-intensity activities in the prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.[8,25-27]
Since walking is an activity that is highly accessible,
readily adopted, and rarely associated with exerciserelated injury, these findings may have important public health implications.
The beneficial effects of vigorous exercise and walking on risk for type 2 diabetes are partly mediated by body
weight and body fat distribution. Leaner individuals have
a reduced risk for diabetes,[28-30] and physical activity facilitates weight loss and weight maintenance.[31] Furthermore, exercise may lead to loss in visceral fat,[32] which is
strongly associated with insulin resistance and the related metabolic syndrome. To the extent that exercise
causes individuals to have lower BMI than they would
otherwise, adjustment for BMI in regression models
constitutes statistical overcorrection and results in
underestimation of the true beneficial effect of physical activity.


In our study, prolonged TV watching was strongly
associated with risk for diabetes. These findings do not
necessarily imply that TV watching per se causes type 2
diabetes; rather, they suggest that a sedentary lifestyle substantially affects future risk for diabetes. There are at least
2 explanations for the observed positive association between TV watching and diabetes risk. First, TV watching is directly related to obesity and weight gain,[11-15,33]
probably due to lower energy expenditure (ie, less physical activity) and higher caloric intake. Second, participants who spent more time watching TV tended to eat
more red meat, processed meat, snacks, refined grains,
and sweets and fewer vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
Such an eating pattern, which is directly related to commercial advertisements and food cues appearing on TV,[34,35]
may adversely affect diabetes risk. In our previous study
of 466 men in the HPFS, average hours of TV watching
was significantly associated with increased levels of leptin and LDL cholesterol and lower levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, independent of physical activity levels.[20]
Because our cohort did not undergo uniform screening for glucose intolerance, some diabetes cases may have

Multivariate relative risks (RRs) for type 2 diabetes mellitus according to
categories of metabolic equivalent hours (MET-hours) per week and average
weekly time spent watching television (TV). Adjusted for the same covariates
as in Table 1 (body mass index not included in the model).


Our data provide further evidence that higher levels of
physical activity, including moderate-intensity exercise such as walking, are associated with a substantial
reduction in risk for diabetes. In contrast, sedentary
lifestyle indicated by prolonged TV watching is
directly related to diabetes risk. Although these findings lend further support to current guidelines[37,38] that
promote physical activity, they also suggest the importance of reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention
of diabetes.

been undiagnosed. However, misclassification would be
expected to be small compared with that in the general
population because of health professionals’ ready access
to medical care. For example, more than 85% of men in
our study visited a physician for a physical examination, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at least once between 1988 and 1990. In addition, when the analyses were
restricted to symptomatic cases of type 2 diabetes, the
findings were similar, suggesting that surveillance bias
according to activity level is unlikely. The diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes have recently changed[36] such that
lower fasting glucose levels (�7.0 mmol/L [�126 mg/
dL]) would now be considered diabetic. We used the criteria proposed by the National Diabetes Data Group[21] because all of our cases were diagnosed before January 1996.
If new criteria were used, some nondiabetic subjects would
have been classified as diabetic. However, this is unlikely to explain our results, because inclusion of diabetics in the nondiabetic group would have attenuated
the associations we observed.
