Background Television viewing (TV), a highly prevalent behaviour, is associated
with higher cardiovascular risk independently of physical activity.
The relationship with mortality, however, is relatively unknown.

Methods We examined the prospective relationship between TV time and
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality in a population-based
cohort [The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC), Norfolk] of 13 197 men and women {age [SD
(standard deviation)]: 61.5 � 9.0 years}. Participants were free
from stroke, myocardial infarction and cancer at baseline in
1998–2000 and were followed up for death ascertainment until
2009 (9.5 � 1.6 years). TV time, total physical activity energy
expenditure (PAEE), education level, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use,
participant and family history of disease and total energy intake
were self-reported; height and weight were measured by standardized procedures. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence interval
(CI)] for mortality were estimated per 1-h/day increase in TV.

Results Each 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with increased
hazard of all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.09; 1270 deaths)
and cardiovascular (HR ¼ 1.07, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.15; 373 deaths),
but not cancer mortality (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 0.98–1.10;
570 deaths). This was independent of gender, age, education, smoking, alcohol, medication, diabetes history, family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, body mass index (BMI) and PAEE.
They were similar when stratified by gender, age, education, BMI
and PAEE. The population-attributable fraction for all-cause mortality comparing the highest TV tertile (43.6 h/day) with the lowest
(<2.5 h/day) was 5.4%.

Conclusions These findings suggest that public health recommendations should
consider advising a reduction in TV time, a predominant leisure
activity in modern society, in addition to advocating physical
activity.

## Introduction
Sedentary behaviour (i.e. excessive sitting, as distinct
from insufficient physical activity) has increasingly
gained interest as a potential determinant of ill
health, particularly given its high prevalence (e.g.
55% of the waking day in the USA).[1] Television viewing (TV) time in particular has been reported as the
most widespread leisure-time sedentary behaviour of
adults.[2–4] Cross-sectional and prospective evidence is
accumulating for adverse associations between TV
time and several intermediate cardiovascular risk factors, including the metabolic syndrome and related
cardio-metabolic biomarkers,[5–13] obesity,[14,15] abnormal glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.[15–19]

Some cancers have also been associated with excessive levels of TV time.[20,21] These associations were
independent of physical activity and an adverse
effect of elevated TV time has been observed in physically active individuals.[13] Some physiological mechanisms supporting detrimental effects of sedentary
behaviour are also emerging.[19] Building on the available evidence, so far, two recent studies have examined whether TV time independently predicts specific
mortality endpoints (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and
cancer mortality), of which one only focused on cardiovascular mortality in men.[22,23]

The purpose of the present study was (i) to
examine the prospective association between TV
time and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and cancer in a relatively large
sample of healthy middle-aged Caucasian men and
women and (ii) to examine whether this association
is independent of total physical activity energy
expenditure (PAEE) and other potentially confounding variables.

## Methods
Study participants
EPIC-Norfolk is part of the 10-country collaborative
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition Study (EPIC). Between 1993 and 1997, a
cohort of 25 633 residents of Norfolk (UK), in the
age range of 45–79 years and recruited via participating general practitioners, agreed to participate.
The study design and cohort characteristics have
previously been described.[24] Between January 1998
and October 2000, participants were invited for a
follow-up assessment. At this follow-up, the EPIC
physical activity questionnaire (EPAQ2) was introduced as a more comprehensive physical activity
measure, which also included questions on TV time.
This examination constitutes the baseline for the current analyses. A total of 15 784 participants attended,
of whom 15 021 provided complete data for variables
included in the present study. Participants with a
self-reported baseline history of stroke (n ¼ 360),
myocardial infarction (n ¼ 488) or cancer (n ¼ 1075)


were excluded. As a result, 13 197 participants
(5729 men and 7468 women) were included. The
Norwich District Health Authority Ethics Committee
approved the study design and all participants
provided written informed consent.

Measures
Mortality
All EPIC-Norfolk participants are followed up for
mortality and the present study reports on follow-up
until 30 April 2009 (9.5 � 1.6 years). All individuals
have been flagged for death certification at the
Office of National Statistics (UK) with vital status
ascertained on the whole cohort. Coding of death certificates was executed by trained nosologists according to the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD). Cardiovascular death was defined as ICD
410–448 (ICD 9) or ICD I10–I79 (ICD 10) as the
underlying cause of death. Cancer death was defined
as ICD 140–208 (ICD 9) or ICDC00–C97 (ICD 10) as
the underlying cause.


TV time and PAEE
Participants completed the EPAQ2, providing information on their physical (in)activity in a disaggregated way (in and around the home, to work, at
work and during leisure time), using the past year
as a reference frame.[25] PAEE [metabolic equivalent
(MET) � h/week] in each domain was calculated by
multiplying participation (h/week) by the metabolic
cost of each activity (MET).[26] Total PAEE was calculated by summing energy expenditure of the different
(mutually exclusive) domains, as previously described
in detail.[27] Time spent viewing television and video
(h/week) was calculated by summing responses to
four questions about viewing before and after 6 pm
on week and weekend days. Repeatability of the
EPAQ2 was high both in terms of TV time and total
PAEE.[25] Comparison against minute-by-minute heart
rate monitoring and maximal aerobic capacity
(VO2max) suggested that the questionnaire is valid
for ranking individuals.[25] For ease of interpretation,
TV time and PAEE were expressed in h/day and
MET � h/day, respectively. The two measures were
mutually exclusive and weakly inversely correlated
(Spearman correlation: �0.18, P < 0.01).

Covariates
Education level (low, O, A, degree), social class
(manual, non-manual), smoking status (current,
former and never), alcohol consumption (U/week),
anti-hypertensive medication (yes, no), medication
for dyslipidaemia (yes, no), baseline history of myocardial infarction or stroke (yes, no), cancer (yes, no)
and diabetes (yes, no), family history of CVD (yes,
no) and cancer (yes, no) were self-reported using a
detailed health and lifestyle questionnaire.[24] Total
energy intake (kJ/day) was derived from a validated

130-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire.[28] Trained nurses measured height, weight and
waist circumference according to standardized protocols.[24] Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight/height[2] (kg/m[2]).


Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared by vital status
(independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests)
and by TV tertiles (lowest: <2.5, middle: 2.5–3.6,
highest: 43.6 h/day; one-way analysis of variance
and chi-squared tests).
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
examine the association between baseline TV time
(h/day) and all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. The proportional hazards assumption was
checked using Schoenfeld residuals and Kaplan–
Meier plots for all three outcomes. The Schoenfeld
residuals did not suggest evidence of deviations
from proportionality, and this was consistent with observations in the Kaplan–Meier plots. To examine linearity of the association between TV time and the
outcomes, unadjusted mortality rates [95% confidence
interval (CI)] per 10 000 person-years of follow-up
were plotted by 1-h TV-time increments.
Additionally, a log likelihood-ratio test examined
whether addition of a quadratic term for TV time to
the adjusted model (Model C) resulted in a statistically significant improvement in model fit. Based on
evidence for a linear association, hazard ratios (HRs)
(95% CI) per h/day increase in TV time were estimated, first adjusting for baseline age and gender
(Model A). Further adjustment (Model B) was made
for baseline education level, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, medication (hypertension and dyslipidaemia; not included for cancer mortality), diabetes
history and family history of CVD and cancer. We
then introduced baseline PAEE to the model to examine whether TV time was independently associated
with mortality (Model C).
To determine whether associations were modified
by gender, age (460, 460 years), education (low or
O, A or degree) or BMI (normal weight: <25, overweight or obese: 525 kg/m[2]), multiplicative interaction terms were included in Model C. Effect
modification by physical activity was examined by
including a (TV � total PAEEmedian split[) interaction]
term in Model C (cut-offs, total PAEE: 415.7,
415.7 MET h/day).
Continuous BMI and waist circumference were then
added (consecutively) to Model C, to examine a potential mediation effect of overall and central adiposity. By including total energy intake (kJ/day), a
potential mediation effect of diet was evaluated in a
subsample, excluding 21% of participants with missing data for total energy intake.
Finally, the population-attributable fraction
(PAF) for all-cause mortality associated with TV
43.6 (highest tertile) compared with <2.5 h/day


(lowest tertile) was calculated. PAF is the estimated
proportion by which mortality would be reduced in

� �

the entire population if the exposure were eliminated
(assuming causality). It was calculated using the
formula

Px �ðHR � 1Þ
PAF ¼ 100�
1 þ ðPx �ðHR � 1ÞÞ


where Px is prevalence of the exposure, and HR is the
hazard ratio of the highest compared with the lowest
TV tertile (derived from Model C including PAEE).
To minimize the potential effect of reverse causality,
analyses were repeated after additionally excluding
participants who died within the first 2 years of
follow-up. Analyses were conducted using the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version
15.0 (SPSS 15.0; SPSS, Inc., IL, USA) and
STATA10.0 (Stata, Corp., TX, USA). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

## Results
Descriptive characteristics
A total of 1270 participants (725 men and
545 women) died during 124 902 person-years of
follow-up (men: 53 330, women: 71 572). There were
373 cardiovascular deaths (men: 211, women: 162)
and 570 cancer deaths (men: 321, women: 249).
Descriptive baseline characteristics are shown by
vital status in Table 1. Participants who died from
any cause watched TV for on average 0.4 h/day more
than survivors. This difference was greater for cardiovascular mortality (0.6 h/day) and smaller, although
significant, for cancer mortality (0.3 h/day). Deceased
participants were also less physically active, and
showed a less favourable profile for several other
characteristics, including waist circumference and
BMI. Baseline characteristics by TV tertiles are
shown in Table 2, indicating that participants watching more TV scored less favourable for several
characteristics.


Cox proportional hazards regression
The increases found for unadjusted mortality rates per
10 000 person-years by 1-h increments in TV time
suggested a linear association between TV time and
all three mortality outcomes (Figure 1). There was no
significant improvement in model fit after adding the
quadratic TV term to the adjusted model (Model C),
for any of the three outcomes.
Results for the Cox regression (Table 3) showed that
TV time (h/day) was positively associated with
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality after
adjustment for age and gender (Model A). For
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, associations
remained significant after further adjustment for education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption,
medication for hypertension and dyslipidaemia,

diabetes history and family history of CVD and cancer
(Model B). These results were virtually unchanged
after further adjustment for total PAEE (Model C).
A 1-h/day increase in TV time was associated with
an increased hazard of death from CVD of 8% and
from all causes of 5%. Adjustment for social class
(2% missing) instead of education level did not materially change results in any of the analyses (data not
shown). Results were also materially unchanged after
excluding participants who died within the first
2 years of follow-up (data not shown).
Table 4 shows HRs (95% CI) for all-cause mortality
derived from Model C stratified by gender, age, education, BMI and PAEE. HRs were in the same direction and differences between subgroups were small.
Consistently, after including multiplicative interaction
terms in Model C in the total sample, interactions
among TV time and gender, age, education and BMI
were non-significant for all three outcomes. Also, no
significant interaction was found between TV and
total PAEE for all-cause (P ¼ 0.46), cardiovascular
(P ¼ 0.45) or cancer mortality (P ¼ 0.45), supporting
the similar association between TV and mortality between high and low physically active groups.
To examine whether central and general adiposity
mediated the associations between TV and mortality,
BMI and waist circumference were added to Model C.
The inclusion of BMI had virtually no effect on the
results for all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.09,
P ¼ 0.03), or cardiovascular mortality (HR ¼ 1.07,
95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.15, P ¼ 0.04; results for cancer mortality: HR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 0.98–1.10, P ¼ 0.20).
Adding waist circumference to Model C attenuated
the effect of TV on both all-cause (HR ¼ 1.04, 95%
CI ¼ 0.99–1.08, P ¼ 0.07) and cardiovascular mortality
(HR ¼ 1.07, 95% CI ¼ 0.99–1.15, P ¼ 0.06) to a marginally non-significant level (results for cancer mortality:
HR ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼ 0.97–1.09, P ¼ 0.31).
No evidence was found for a potential mediation
effect of diet. Comparable significant HRs per h/day
increase in TV time were obtained after including
total energy intake in Model C (n ¼ 10 431): all-cause:
HR ¼ 1.05, 95% CI ¼ 1.01–1.10, P ¼ 0.03; cardiovascular: HR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 1.02–1.20, P ¼ 0.02 and

PAEE (MET � h/day). Examination of the Schoenfeld residuals and the Kaplan–Meier plots indicated that the proportional hazards
assumption was reasonable for these data.

The PAF for all-cause mortality of being part of the
highest compared with the lowest TV tertile was 5.4%.
This suggests that 5.4% of deaths from all causes
could be reduced if those watching TV for
43.6 h/day would watch <2.5 h/day instead.

## Discussion
The results from this prospective population-based
cohort study suggest that high levels of TV time are
associated with an increased risk of death from all
causes and CVD. These effects are independent of
total physical activity and other relevant covariates
and are similar between low and high physically
active groups. These findings strengthen the available
evidence on independent detrimental effects of excess
TV time, previously observed in cross-sectional and
prospective studies on intermediate risk factors,
including cardio-metabolic biomarkers and the metabolic syndrome,[5–13] obesity,[14,15] abnormal glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.[15–18] They also extend
recent findings from a smaller population-based
sample of Australian adults suggesting a linear increase in risk for all-cause (284 cases) and cardiovascular mortality (87 cases), but not cancer mortality
(125 cases), with every 1-h increment in TV time,
independently of leisure exercise and other confounders.[22] Another recent study specifically focusing on
cardiovascular mortality in US men did not show an
independent association with TV time.[23]

Other previous studies have examined the association between daily sitting time and mortality.[29–31]

For example, a population-based study in 17 013


Canadian adults showed a progressively higher risk
for mortality across five groups of sitting time
(‘almost none of the time’ to ‘almost all of the
time’) from all causes and CVD (P for trend
<0.0001), but not cancer.[29] In a population-based
sample of 83 034 Japanese middle-aged adults, sitting
58 h/day was associated with an 18% higher risk for
premature death from all causes compared with sitting <3 h/day, independent of physical activity levels
in men, but not women.[31]

Assuming causality, 5.4% of deaths could be
reduced if those watching TV 43.6 h/day would
watch <2.5 h/day instead. For comparison, we
calculated the PAF for all-cause mortality
comparing those being part of the lowest PAEE
tertile (<12.8 MET � h/day) with the highest
(419.3 MET � h/day), which was 9.8%. Although the
public health effect of shifting from the highest to the
lowest TV tertile appears to be lower than that of
shifting from the lowest to the highest PAEE tertile,
an excess rate of 5.4% for total mortality is still substantial. Given the independence of the TV/mortality
and PAEE/mortality associations, substituting TV time
by physical activity may result in an additive reduction of mortality. TV time, however, increases with
increasing age but may also change over time.[2]

Therefore, the PAF for comparing the highest with
the lowest TV tertile as shown in this middle-aged
cohort may not generalize to younger populations.
Although watching TV is only one component of
overall sedentary behaviour, we specifically focused
on this behaviour for several reasons. First, it is
highly prevalent (e.g. one of the three main activities
in the UK besides sleeping and working),[2] and the
most frequently reported sedentary behaviour during
leisure time in UK,[2] the USA[3] and Australia.[4]


-----

Consequently, watching TV is likely a strong indicator
of overall leisure-time sedentary behaviour.[32]

Secondly, it is probably one of the sedentary behaviours that is most susceptible to voluntary change
compared with other types of prolonged sitting
(e.g. occupational sitting). Therefore, reducing TV
time is a potential target for behavioural change in
future intervention studies. Finally, TV might trigger
adverse pathways that are additional to those (physiological) pathways hypothesized for sitting per se.[19]

For example, a recent study demonstrated that exposure to snack-food advertisement during TV watching
triggered automatic eating behaviours that were
independent of hunger in children and adults.[33]

Potential pathways linking TV time to all-cause and
cardiovascular mortalities are likely to be diverse and
need further exploration. Some possible mechanisms
were examined within the current study. First of all,
extensive adjustment for PAEE diminishes the likelihood that our results can be explained by displacement of (even low intensity) physical activity.
Secondly, as previously suggested, high exposure to
high-caloric food advertisements increases (unconscious) snacking and the overall amount of food
consumed.[33,34] However, the effect of TV time on
mortality in our study was independent of total
energy intake. Given the amount of measurement
error usually associated with self-reported dietary
intake, we cannot exclude residual confounding by
dietary intake. Our results were, however, independent of overall adiposity (BMI). In contrast, central
obesity (i.e. waist circumference) might have a mediating role between TV time and mortality, although
the associations were only marginally non-significant
after adjustment for this variable. Causal inference
cannot be made, however, about the association
between TV time and all other variables measured
at baseline. Higher levels of adiposity may also lead
to increased TV time, as recently shown for objectively
measured total sedentary time.[35] Other pathways
include intermediate cardiovascular and metabolic
risk factors previously suggested to be independently
associated with TV time.[5–19] Current and future
studies examining pathophysiological processes that
are specific for sedentary behaviours and not just the
effect of absence of physical activity are an important
and emerging area of research, which may support the
current epidemiological evidence. One of these biological processes, shown in animal models, is the
acute drop in skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase activity
caused by muscle inactivity (absence of muscle contractions) and resulting in disruption of triglyceride
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism.[36]

Consistently, observations in free-living humans by
objective monitoring of body movement suggested
that regular interruptions in sedentary time are
beneficially associated with level of triglycerides,[37]

and urge the need for future epidemiological and
experimental studies further exploring these findings.


The present study has several strengths. The large
population-based sample enabled us to control for potential reverse causality by excluding participants with
relevant health conditions at baseline and by additionally excluding those who died within the first
2 years of follow-up. Furthermore, we were able to
adjust for non-categorized overall PAEE and not just
(categorized) time spent in leisure, or moderate to
vigorous physical activity, minimizing residual confounding. In addition to previously demonstrated criterion validity,[25] our PAEE measure has previously
also been shown to predict cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality in this cohort.[27] We also adjusted
our analyses for several relevant covariates, including
energy intake. However, the following study limitations should also be highlighted. First, TV time was
self-reported. Measurement error may have biased
the associations observed towards the null, leading
to an underestimation of the true associations.
Furthermore, as TV time was only measured at baseline, changes in this behaviour might additionally
have caused misclassification and, therefore, attenuation of the associations found. The self-report and
categorical nature of some covariates may have resulted in residual confounding. Some confounding
might still exist for other non-measured psychosocial
determinants of health, such as social network interaction/loneliness, which might be correlated with TV
time, especially in older individuals.[38] Finally, as we
excluded participants with baseline chronic disease to
minimize the possibility of reverse causality and increase internal validity, the associations found are
relative to this cohort of healthy middle-aged
Caucasians, and may not generalize to other populations. Large prospective studies, using repeated measurements with longer duration of follow-up and
preferably using objective measures of physical activity and sedentary time, are warranted to extend the
present results and confirm dose–response effects and
indicators of population health risk on different types
of mortality in different populations.
In conclusion, in this population-based cohort of
middle-aged Caucasians, higher levels of TV time
increased the risk for mortality from all causes and
CVD, independently of physical activity levels. Given
the high prevalence of excessive TV watching, resulting in a substantial PAF, these results indicate the
importance of public health recommendations aimed
at decreasing TV time and possibly overall sedentary
behaviour. These recommendations should be in addition to the established public health recommendations for physical activity.

� The findings from this large population-based cohort of middle-aged Caucasians indicate that each
1-h increment in TV time is independently associated with a 4 and 7% increased risk of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality, respectively.

� Given the high prevalence of excessive TV watching, recommendations aimed at decreasing TV time
might have a relevant impact on public health.

� As the associations found are independent of physical activity levels, these recommendations should
be in addition to the established public health recommendations for physical activity.
