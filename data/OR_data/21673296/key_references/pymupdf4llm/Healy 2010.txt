A highlight of this issue of _Revista Española de_
_Cardiología_ is the report of original research by
Martínez-Gómez et al,[1] in which they examine the
associations of objectively assessed sedentary time
(too much sitting, as distinct from too little exercise)
and body fatness with cardiovascular risk factors in
a subsample of 201 adolescent participants of the
Madrid AFINOS study. The key scientific features
of their investigation are the objective measurement
of ambulatory movement (and non-movement)
using accelerometers, from which they derive the
amount of time spent sedentary. In their study, they
conducted careful anthropometric measurements
to determine central and overall adiposity, and
measured a range of biomarkers of cardiovascular
risk. They report significant associations of time
spent sedentary and body fatness with biomarkers
of cardiovascular risk in this group of young people
aged 13 to 16 years.

**What is Sedentary Behaviour, as Distinct**
**From the Lack of Physical Activity?**

Sedentary behaviours are those pursuits which
generate very low energy expenditures.[2] They
include behaviours that involve sitting or reclining
(but not standing), and occur across the domains
of work (including paid and unpaid), travel, and
leisure-time. Time spent in these behaviours is
regarded as sedentary time. Common sedentary

behaviours, such as television (TV) viewing time,
sitting at school, and computer use have metabolic
equivalent (MET) values in the range of 1-1.5.[2] In
contrast, moderate-to-brisk-paced walking involves
an energy expenditure of some 3-5 METs; running
and vigorous sports can involve energy expenditures
of 8 METs or more.[2]
Research on physical activity and health has in
the main concentrated on quantifying the amount of
time spent in activities involving these higher levels
of energy expenditure (>3 METs), labeling those
with no participation as “sedentary.”[3] However,
this definition ignored the substantial contribution
that light-intensity (1.6-2.9 METs) activities make
to overall daily energy expenditure,[4] as well as the
potential health benefits of participating in these
light intensity activities, rather than being sedentary
(which from our perspective is prolonged sitting
time, as distinct from not engaging in physical
activity).[5,6] Furthermore, although individuals can
be both sedentary and inactive, there is also the
potential for high sedentary time and high exercise
time to co-exist, for example among athletes in
training who must spend significant amounts of
time in rest and recovery from intense physical
efforts. Physiologically, distinct effects are observed
between prolonged sedentary time and too little
exercise.[7] These findings have been supported by
population-based epidemiological research, which
has generally reported the associations of sedentary
time with health outcomes to be independent
of physical activity (exercise) levels. Indeed,
detrimental associations of TV viewing time with
cardiometabolic biomarkers have been observed
even in those that meet the public health guidelines
for physical activity (and would thus be considered
“active”).[8]
Increasingly, sedentary behaviours are ubiquitous
and environmentally-driven.[9] The economic,
social, and physical environments in which modern
humans now move very little and sit a great deal
within the contexts of their daily lives have been
evolving rapidly, and particularly so since the


-----

middle of the last century. These changes in personal
transportation, communication, workplace and
domestic entertainment technologies have been
associated with significantly-reduced demands for
human energy expenditure, because they all require
prolonged sitting. Such environmental and social
changes have been identified as the cause of the low
levels of physical activity that characterise people’s
usual ways of life in urban, suburban, and rural
environments.

**Adolescents as a Key Target Group**

In the 2003-2004 US National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), older
adolescents (16-19 years) were the second most
sedentary group on average, after older adults (≥60
years).[10] As young people begin to approach their
adult physical stature and move into adult-like daily
occupations (including long school hours) and social
roles, they become increasingly susceptible to these
pervasive influences to spend their time in sedentary
behaviours: or, too much sitting.
The study by Martínez-Gómez et al focuses on
this important socio-demographic group.[1] Their
findings raise significant concerns about the early
development of behaviour patterns and body habitus
attributes that may significantly increase the risk of
major chronic diseases (particularly type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and breast and colon cancer).
While these diseases may not manifest themselves
until later in adult life, it seems that not only the
behavioural basis, but also the biological precursors
for these chronic diseases may be established during
adolescence.
As Martínez-Gómez and colleagues highlight,[1]
the majority of studies that have examined the
relationship of sedentary time with cardiometabolic
health in children and adolescents have been
conducted under the framework of the European
Youth Heart Study (EYHS): a cross-sectional
population study investigating the personal,
environmental and lifestyle factors that may
influence cardiovascular disease risk factors in
children aged 9 and 15 years. The findings from
the current study build on those from the EYHS,
and extend them to examining significant health
risks among adolescents 13 to 16 years, as well as
additional biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein. It is
important now to broaden these findings beyond the
highly-informative cross-sectional findings that are
now reported, by following-up and reassessing these
young people as they transition through the various
stages of adolescence and beyond. Additionally, it is
important to further examine how the relationships
may vary by gender, by age, and by race/ethnicity,
and to examine how the relevant health behaviours


(such as diet, exercise, and sedentary time) may
interact.

**Building the Evidence Base: Extending**
**Beyond the Cross-Sectional Study**

Sedentary behavior research is in its early stages,
and is probably 20 years behind physical activity
research in terms of valid and reliable measurement,
and, understanding the behavioural determinants
and the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions.
Thus, it is important to build a solid base for this new
area of research through developing a more-extensive
body of epidemiological findings on how sedentary
behavior findings may be linked to a range of health
outcomes, within different population groups for
whom genetic, cultural, social, and environmental
exposures will be different in scientifically-important
ways.
However, it is also imperative that this new
field of research moves quickly to go beyond the
inherent logical limitations of cross-sectional
studies: to prospective study designs to examine the
long-term effects of sedentary behavior on health;
to experimental studies to further understand the
physiological mechanisms that may underpin the
findings; and, to intervention studies examining
the feasibility of changing sedentary behaviors, and
the associated health outcomes of any change.
Two recent, longitudinal studies have highlighted
the potential importance of sedentary behaviours
on health. In a follow-up of Australian Diabetes,
Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) participants
over 6.5 years, high levels of television viewing time
were significantly associated with increased all-cause
and cardiovascular disease mortality.[11] The adverse
consequences of prolonged sitting time have been
reinforced by follow-up findings on participants in
the Canada Fitness Surveys that have been carried
out since 1980s.[12] Those who initially reported that
they spent the majority of their day sitting had
significantly poorer long-term mortality outcomes;
importantly, the sitting time-mortality relationships
were apparent even among those who were physically
active, and were stronger among those who were
overweight or obese.[12]
As Martínez-Gómez et al argue, it seems likely
that there is a unique physiology of sedentary time,
within which biological processes that are distinct
from traditionally-understood exercise physiology
may be operating.[1] The groundbreaking laboratory
studies of Hamilton et al, provide important insights
into the possible mechanisms that may underlie the
associations observed.[7] In their series of studies,
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) regulation was identified
as a key pathway through which sedentary time
(involving prolonged postural unloading of large


-----

skeletal muscles) may impact on cardiometabolic
health. These studies also found that the cellular
processes initiated from sedentary time were unique
and qualitatively different from exercise-related
biological responses.[7] Mechanistic studies such as
these, identifying potential underlying mechanisms,
are a crucial element to the sedentary behavior and
health research field.
Intervention studies specifically targeting
reductions in sedentary time are primarily limited
to children, and often target specific sedentary
behaviours, such as television viewing time and
computer and electronic game use (for example,
the “switch-play” intervention by Salmon et al[13]).
Examining what changes are feasible, what are the
correlates of such changes, and the sustainability of
these changes, are important next steps in sedentary
behaviour research with adolescents, as well as with
children and adults.

**The Importance of Breaking-up Sedentary**
**Time**

In addition to examining the aggregate or
average sedentary time (either across the day, or in
specific domains such as the school or travel, or for
particular behaviours such as television viewing time,
computer use or study), there is also the potential
to further extend the scientific focus, by examining
how the sedentary time is accrued. In a study of 169
Australian adults, we demonstrated that breaks in
sedentary time (as distinct from the total volume
of time spent being sedentary) were shown to have
beneficial associations with metabolic biomarkers.[14]
Sedentary time may be considered to be
interrupted or broken if accelerometer counts rose
up to or above 100 counts per minute. Breaks
from sedentary time can involve activities such as
standing from a sitting position, or walking a step.
A higher number of breaks in sedentary time were
beneficially associated with waist circumference,
body mass index, triglycerides, and 2-hour plasma
glucose; these relationships were independent of
total sedentary time, moderate-to-vigorous intensity
activity time, and the average intensity of physical
activity.[14] Interestingly, patterns of sedentary
time accumulation (but not total sedentary time)
were shown to differ among 4 groups of adults
with various activity patterns (healthy group with
active occupation; healthy group with sedentary
occupation; group with chronic back pain; group
with chronic fatigue syndrome).[15]
These two findings suggest some interesting
directions for further studies with adolescents.
Examining, for example (as we have done with
adults), the associations of breaks in sedentary
time with biomarkers of cardiometabolic health


in adolescents would potentially be an important
contribution with significant implications for public
health, educational and urban-transport policies.
Based on the findings of our studies with Australian
adults, we would predict that among adolescents with
fewer breaks in their sedentary time, significantly
more-deleterious patterns of cardiovascular risk
would be observed.

**Future Directions: the Need for Accurate**
**and Reliable Measurement**

Accurate and reliable measurement of time
spent in sedentary behaviours is another key area
for further development. Although accelerometers
provide information about the time, duration, and
intensity of ambulatory movements (from which
estimates of sedentary time can be derived) they do
not provide detail on postural changes. Thus, sitting
or lying is not differentiated from standing still. The
introduction of free-living research inclinometers
(such as the ActivPAL) enables closer examination of
specific time spent in sitting and lying behaviours.[15]
An important next step in sedentary behavior
measurement is the integration of multiple
information sources, such as accelerometers,
inclinometers, GPS technology, and behavior logs:
preferably in a format that has a low participant
and analytic burden. Furthermore, the development
of valid and reliable questionnaires that measure
across multiple domains is necessary for population
surveillance of this ubiquitous behavior.

**Conclusion**

We congratulate Martínez-Gómez et al on
their well-conducted and important study.[1] While
there have been several studies that have set out
to identify the health consequences of sedentary
behaviour in adolescents, few have reported bloodderived biomarker outcomes. The combination
of objectively-assessed sedentary time as the main
exposure variable with an extensive set of biomarker
outcomes provides findings that are of great scientific
value.
These findings ought now to be replicated and
extended, and longitudinal and intervention trial
study designs need to be applied. As the science
develops, there will be considerably greater potential
for informing the public-health and other policy
changes that will reduce sedentary time (for example
mandatory breaks from sitting during school
hours; stronger public health recommendations on
avoiding prolonged sitting; traffic control in urban
environments to encourage walking and cycling).
In the current human environment of multiple and
ubiquitous opportunities to sit, there is the crucial


-----

need to develop a broader range of opportunities
for children, adolescents and adults to be more
physically active, and to have practical and realistic
ways to spend less time sitting within the normal
contexts of their daily lives.[16]
