Introduction


Abstract

Background: The aim of the present study was to examine whether the
amount of time spent watching television is a potential risk factor for incident diabetes and to what extent this association may be explained by
obesity.
Methods: We used data for 23 855 men and women from the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam Study. During an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants developed diabetes. Incident diabetes was identified on the basis of self-report and was
verified by contacting the patient’s attending physician. The amount of
time spent watching television was self-reported.
Results: The mean time that the participants who developed diabetes
watched television was 2.4 h ⁄ week, compared with 2.0 h ⁄ week for those
who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex,
educational status, smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, physical activity, the intake of various foods, and systolic blood pressure, the
adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes among participants who watched
‡4 h ⁄ day of television compared with those who watched <1 h ⁄ day was
1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17–2.27]. After additional adjustment
for waist circumference and body mass index, the hazard ratio was reduced
to 1.14 (95% CI: 0.81–1.61).
Conclusions: In the present study, the amount of time spent watching television was an independent predictor of incident diabetes only in models that
adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and systolic
blood pressure. The attenuation of the association after adjusting for anthropometric measures may represent an explanatory mechanism for our findings.

Inadequate physical activity is a well recognized risk
factor for diabetes. Most prospective studies of diabetes have generally examined the associations between
various forms of energy expenditure and incident diabetes. Less well understood is the association between


sedentary behavior and incident diabetes. In two large
cohort studies, the amount of television viewing was
found to be a significant independent risk factor for
developing diabetes.[1,2]

There are several reasons for focusing on the associations between television viewing and chronic conditions such as diabetes. First, cross-sectional and

prospective studies have linked the amount of television viewing with an increased risk of obesity, a major
risk factor for diabetes.[3,4] Second, television viewing
has been associated with obesity and diabetes independently of physical activity.[1,2] Thus, the act of television
viewing may denote more than the absence of physical
activity. Third, messages to promote physical activity
in the population may not only need to convince people to engage in adequate levels of physical activity
but may also need to discourage excessive sedentary
behavior. Finally, an increased risk of developing diabetes attributable to excess sedentary behavior has
potential implications for clinicians and public health
practitioners.
Few studies have examined the association between
television watching and incident diabetes prospectively.
Establishing these relationships in different countries
and cultures is important, because the differences in
attendant behaviors could affect the risk of adverse
outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was
to examine data from a large German prospective
study to address this association. Because the pathway
from excessive television viewing to incident diabetes is
likely to lead through obesity to a considerable extent,
we hypothesized that any increase in the risk of diabetes from excessive television viewing would be attenuated by adjusting for anthropometric measures.

Methods

Study population
In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam Study, Germany, men
aged 40–65 years and women aged 35–65 years were
the target of recruitment. In total, 27 548 subjects
(16 644 women and 10 904 men) from the general population joined the study between 1994 and 1998.[5] The
baseline examination included anthropometric measurements, a personal interview including questions on
prevalent diseases, a questionnaire on sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, and a food frequency
questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaires to identify
incident cases of diabetes mellitus have been administered every 2–3 years since. The response rates for each
of the waves of follow-up exceeded 90%. We also considered questionnaires that were part of the ongoing
fourth wave of follow-up and were sent out until
31 January 2005. By 31 August 2005, 90% had been
returned. Consent was obtained from all participants
in the study and approval was given by the Ethical
Committee of the State of Brandenburg, Germany.
Participants with diabetes at baseline were excluded
from the analyses. Self-reported diabetes mellitus at


baseline was evaluated by a physician using information on self-reported medical diagnoses, medication
records, and dieting behavior. Uncertainties regarding
a proper diagnosis were clarified with the participant
or the treating physician. A total of 23 855 participants (9167 men, 14 688 women) who had complete
information for the study variables were included in
the analyses.

Ascertainment of incident diabetes

Potentially incident cases of diabetes were identified
via self-reports of a diabetes diagnosis, diabetes-relevant medication, or dietary treatment due to diabetes.
All potentially incident cases were verified by questionnaires that were mailed to the diagnosing physician
asking about the date and type of diagnosis, diagnostic
tests, and treatment of diabetes. Only cases with a physician diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM;
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision: E11; http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/
icd10online/, accessed 27 July 2009) and a diagnosis
date after the baseline examination were considered as
confirmed incident cases of T2DM.

Assessment of television viewing

The amount of time each week that a participant spent
watching television was assessed with the following
question administered at baseline: ‘‘On average, how
many h ⁄ day did you watch television during the last
12 months?’’

Covariates

We included the following covariates from the baseline
data collection: age, sex, educational status, smoking
status, alcohol use, physical strain at work, physical
activity (h ⁄ week of walking, gardening, bicycling, and
performing sports), waist circumference, body mass
index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and
intakes of red meat, coffee, whole-grain bread, fruits
and vegetables, pizza, soda, cake, chips, dessert, total
energy, total fat, saturated fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Information on educational attainment,
smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, and
physical activity was assessed with a self-administered
questionnaire and a personal interview. The physical
activity questions, which were developed for the EPIC
study, included questions about bicycling (a common
mode of transportation in the Potsdam area), sports
activities, and gardening. The food frequency questionnaire in this study included 148 of the 158 food items

originally tested for the German cohorts of the EPIC
study.[6,7] Anthropometric measurement procedures followed standard protocols under strict quality control.

Statistical analyses

Differences in baseline characteristics by incident diabetes status were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
for continuous variables. Linear trends for continuous
variables across categories of time spent watching television were evaluated using linear regression analysis,
and trends for categorical variables were assessed with
the Cochran–Mantel–Haenzel test. Cox proportional
hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Age was
used as the primary time-dependent variable in all
models, with entry time defined as the subject’s age at
recruitment and exit time as the date of diagnosis of
diabetes, death, or return of the last follow-up questionnaire. All analyses were performed with sas release
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).


Results

During 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants (534
men, 393 women) developed diabetes. Television viewing time ranged from 0 to 12 h ⁄ day. The mean time
that participants who developed diabetes watched television was 2.4 h ⁄ day, compared with 2.0 h ⁄ day for
those who did not develop diabetes (P < 0.001).
Significant positive associations were noted between
the amount of time spent watching television and
age, the percentage of women, the percentage of participants who had an occupation requiring heavy or
very heavy physical strain, waist circumference, BMI,
SBP, the intake of alcohol and several foods, and
time (h ⁄ week) spent walking, gardening, and playing sport (Table 1). Furthermore, significant inverse
associations were present for the percentage of participants receiving a university education, the percentage of participants who never smoked, the intake
of whole-grain bread, fruits and vegetables, and
bicycling.

In proportional hazards analyses adjusted for sociodemographic variables, the HR for participants who
watched ‡4 h ⁄ day television was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.43–
2.78) compared with participants who watched
<1 h ⁄ day television (Table 2). Adjusting for behavioral variables, such as smoking, alcohol use, and
physical activity, reduced the HRs a bit. Additional
adjustment for macronutrients or various foods
resulted in additional small reductions in the HRs.
However, when the model was adjusted for waist circumference and BMI, the HRs were attenuated to the
point being non-significant.

Discussion

In the present study, the amount of time spent watching television was a significant predictor of incident
diabetes in analyses that adjusted only for sociodemographic factors and other lifestyle behaviors, including
physical activity. The attenuation of the HR after
adjustment for measured anthropometric variables is


consistent with a mechanism by which excessive television viewing increases obesity, which, in turn, increases
the risk for diabetes.
There are several limitations to the present study.
First, undiagnosed diabetes was not identified. However, our estimates of relative risk should be accurate
assuming that the association between the amount of
time spent watching television and incident diabetes
was similar in those with diagnosed and undiagnosed
diabetes. Second, the amount of time spent watching
television was self-reported and, thus, may be subject
to recall bias. Third, despite adjusting the results for a
substantial number of potential confounders, we may
not have included all relevant confounders. For example, information concerning each participant’s family
history of diabetes was not available. In addition, the
results may be subject to residual confounding.
Adults in many countries spend a substantial
amount of time watching television.[8,9] There are several negative implications on health associated with
watching an excessive amount of television. First,

watching television represents a potential lost opportunity to engage in activities that increase energy expenditure. Second, energy expenditure while watching
television is lower than that for other sedentary activities.[10] Third, the reduction in energy expenditure may
be compounded by increases in energy intake attributable to exposure to television commercials that may
spur additional eating, which increases energy intake
and possibly also the intake of foods of questionable
nutritional value.[11] Thus, reductions in the amount of
time that people watch television could yield substantial public health benefits. In pediatric populations,
interventions that reduce the amount of time spent
watching television have demonstrated a favorable
effect on obesity.[12]

Prudence dictates that people should limit the
amount of time they spend watching television and
dedicate at least some of this time to the pursuit of
activities that increase energy expenditure. To this
end, clinicians can inquire about the television viewing
habits of their patients, counsel them about the
negative impact excess television viewing can have on
their health, and suggest healthier alternatives. As part
of comprehensive public health efforts to promote
physical activity in the population, interventions
that motivate people to decrease their pursuit of
sedentary activities, such as television viewing, deserve
consideration.
