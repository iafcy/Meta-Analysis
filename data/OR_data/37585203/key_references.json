They also examined whether chronic family stress, father's expressed emotion, and parents' marital satisfaction mediated the relationship between parental psychopathology and adolescent outcomes. Mother's education, child's gender, and family income were covaried in all analyses. Results revealed that maternal depression and paternal depression had an additive effect on youth externalizing disorders. In addition, maternal depression interacted with both paternal depression and paternal substance abuse in predicting youth depression but not youth nondepressive disorders. Chronic family stress and father's expressed emotion appeared to mediate the relationship between parental psychopathology and youth depression.\n",

Results are based on 2427 subjects who completed the follow-up and for whom diagnostic information for both parents was available. DSM-IV mental disorders in respondents were assessed using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Information on depression in parents was collected as family history information from the respondents and from diagnostic interviews with parents of the younger cohort.\n## RESULTS\nOffspring with 1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.5) or 2 affected parents (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.1) had an increased risk for depression. They also had a higher risk for substance use (1 parent affected: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; both parents affected: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8) and anxiety disorders (1 parent affected: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9; both parents affected: OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8). There were no differences whether mother or father was affected. Parental depression was associated with an earlier onset and a more malignant course (severity, impairment, recurrence) of depressive disorders in offspring.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMajor depression in parents increases the overall risk in offspring for onset of depressive and other mental disorders and influences patterns of the natural course of depression in the early stages of manifestation.\n",

However, much less is known about the effects of paternal MDD on offspring psychopathology.\n## METHOD\nWe addressed this issue using a large community sample of parents and their adolescent and young adult offspring (n = 775). Parents and offspring were independently assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews. Offspring were interviewed three times from mid-adolescence to age 24 years.\n## RESULTS\nMaternal MDD was significantly associated with offspring MDD. Paternal MDD was also significantly associated with MDD in offspring, but only among offspring with depressive episodes of moderate or greater severity. These effects persisted after controlling for socio-economic status, family intactness, and non-mood disorders in both parents. Rates of MDD were particularly elevated in offspring of mothers and fathers with early-onset MDD, and offspring of fathers with recurrent MDD. The magnitude of the associations between MDD in parents and offspring was generally in the small-to-medium range.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results confirm previous findings of elevated risk of MDD in the offspring of depressed mothers. In addition, the results suggest that MDD in fathers is associated with increased risk of depression in offspring, but that it is limited to MDD episodes in offspring of moderate or greater severity.\n",

It is unclear whether depression in men at this time poses comparable risks. The present study set out to assess the association between depression in men in the postnatal period and later psychiatric disorders in their children and to investigate predisposing factors for depression in men following childbirth.\n## METHOD\nA population-based cohort of 10,975 fathers and their children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was recruited in the prenatal period and followed for 7 years. Paternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and later child psychiatric disorder (DSM-IV) with the Development and Well-Being Assessment.\n## RESULTS\nDepression in fathers in the postnatal period was significantly associated with psychiatric disorder in their children 7 years later (adjusted OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07-2.77), most notably oppositional defiant/conduct disorders (adjusted OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.04-3.61), after adjusting for maternal depression and paternal educational level. A history of severe depression and high prenatal symptom scores for depression and anxiety were the strongest predictors of paternal depression in the postnatal period.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDepression in fathers in the postnatal period is associated with later psychiatric disorders in their children, independently of maternal postnatal depression. Further research into the risks associated with paternal psychopathology is required because this could represent an important opportunity for public health intervention.\n",

Offspring were 1.28 times (95% CI, 1.08-1.51; P = .003) more likely to have depression at age 18 years for each standard deviation increase in maternal depression score antenatally, independent of later maternal depression. Postnatal depression was also a risk factor for mothers with low education, with offspring 1.26 times (95% CI, 1.06-1.50; P = .01) more likely to have depression for each standard deviation increase in postnatal depression score. However, for more educated mothers, there was little association (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.36; P = .42). Analyses found that maternal education moderated the effects of postnatal but not antenatal depression. Paternal depression antenatally was not associated with offspring depression, while postnatally, paternal depression showed a similar pattern to maternal depression.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe findings suggest that treating maternal depression antenatally could prevent offspring depression during adulthood and that prioritizing less advantaged mothers postnatally may be most effective.\n",

            "title": "The Influence of Paternal and Maternal Major Depressive Disorder on Offspring Psychiatric Disorders.",
            "abstract": "One of the largest known risk factors for the development of depression among youth is a family history (for a review see Beardslee, Gladstone, & O\u2019Connor, 2011). At least 15 million children live with a depressed parent (England & Sim, 2009) and the number of children exposed to parental depression is likely larger when considering the developmental span of childhood through adolescence. Adverse family environments are one of the most consistent identified risk factors for adolescent depression (Evans et al., 2005) and the importance of familial factors may contribute to depression among youth even more than the influence of peers. High rates of depression among offspring of depressed mothers have been well documented (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999; Halligan, Murray, Martins, & Cooper, 2007; Hammen & Brennan, 2003) with some studies suggesting depression in offspring is more closely related to depression in mothers than to depression in fathers (Connell & Goodman, 2002). In contrast, ecological models of developmental psychopathology suggest that parental influence on the child is not limited to mothers (e.g., Cicchetti & Toth, 1997). Yet, few studies examine the influence of paternal depression on offspring outcomes (Kane & Garber, 2004, 2009). A review published in 2005 found that only 25% of developmental psychopathology research examined data from mothers and fathers in predicting offspring outcomes. The few studies that have examined the role of a father\u2019s mental health on their offspring have documented small effect sizes. A recent meta-analysis documented an effect size of .24 for paternal depression on offspring mental health (Kane & Garber, 2004). This effect is considered small according to guidelines (Cohen, 1988; .2 = small, .5 = medium, .8 = large), but was larger than a previously documented effect size of .14. A recent study documented the influence of paternal depression on the mental health of offspring in a dataset of 22,000 children (Weitzman, Rosenthal, & Liu, 2011). Parental mental health problems and offspring emotional and behavioral problems were measured via parent self-report of their own mental health as well as their child\u2019s. Paternal mental health problems were associated with a 33 \u2013 70% increased risk of emotional or behavioral problems among offspring, whereas maternal mental health problems were associated with a 50 \u2013 350% increased risk when compared to offspring of parents without mental health problems. This recent and large study in particular suggests that the effect of paternal depression may be larger than expected, particularly when adequate samples can be captured. Exploration of the differential influence of paternal and maternal depression is warranted for theoretical reasons as well. For example, known mechanisms influencing the intergenerational transmission of depression such as genetic, environmental, and gene-by-environment pathways may differ based on whether the affected parent is the father or mother of the child. Parent-child interactions are one hypothesized mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of depression and mothers with a history of depression demonstrate high levels of criticism and emotional enmeshment with their offspring (Tompson et al., 2011). Fathers\u2019 parenting abilities are also influenced by depression, but less research has explored these mechanisms. Father-child conflict has been found to mediate the contribution of paternal depression on offspring\u2019s internalizing and externalizing symptoms (Kane & Garber, 2009). Depressed fathers\u2019 expressions of positive affect and verbal interactions with offspring have been found to be negatively related to offspring internalizing symptoms (Jacob & Johnson, 1997). In this same study, paternal expressions of approval were inversely related to offspring depressive symptoms. Thus, what is clear is that both paternal and maternal depression influence one\u2019s ability to effectively parent. However, the difference in roles of mothers and fathers may lead to a differential effect in the development of psychopathology among offspring. Differences in parent-child interactions between fathers and mothers offer just one theoretical rationale for including both parents when examining the intergenerational transmission of depression. These theoretical arguments for a differential role of fathers and mothers in offspring psychopathology provides a foundation for the current exploration. In addition, paternal depression and maternal depression may differentially influence the timing of psychopathology onset among offspring. Longitudinal twin data from 670 twin pairs ages 5\u201317 found that shared environmental effects more significantly influenced levels of depression among younger children (Scourfield et al., 2003), whereas heritability estimates rose during adolescence. Thus, the mechanisms of transmission may differ between fathers and mothers and these mechanisms may differentially influence the timing of disorder onset among offspring. We sought to contribute to the growing literature by examining the effect of paternal and maternal depression on offspring using a large sample of offspring carefully assessed with a clinical diagnostic interview conducted by a clinician blind to parental depression status within a longitudinal high risk study. Given the burden of the evidence, we hypothesized that maternal depression would more greatly influence offspring mental health (MDD, anxiety, and substance use disorders). We also examined level of offspring functioning as one way of measuring the influence of paternal and maternal depression. In addition, we conducted exploratory analyses of the effect of paternal and maternal depression on age of disorder onset. Our hypothesis was that maternal depression would influence young children more given the significance of the mother in the early rearing environment.",

Exposure variables were maternal and paternal history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or 'other' psychiatric diagnoses. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regressions.\n## RESULTS\nParental history of any psychiatric diagnosis increased incidence rates of outpatient (maternal: IRR 1.88, p < 0.0001; paternal: IRR 1.68, p < 0.0001) and inpatient (maternal: IRR 1.99, p < 0.0001; paternal: IRR 1.83, p < 0.0001) depression relative to no parental history. IRRs for parental history of non-affective disorders remained relatively stable across age groups, while IRRs for parental affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar) decreased with age from 2.29-3.96 in the youngest age group to 1.53-1.90 in the oldest group. IRR estimates for all parental diagnoses were similar among individuals aged \u2a7e41 years (IRR range 1.51-1.90).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nParental history of any psychiatric diagnosis is associated with increased incidence rates of unipolar depression. In younger age groups, parental history of affective diagnoses is more strongly associated with rates of unipolar depression than non-affective diagnoses; however, this distinction disappears after age 40, suggesting that parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder, confers risk for depression in middle life.\n",

Prevalence rates of parental psychopathology were based on (sub)clinical scores on the adult self report. Parent-offspring associations were investigated in multivariate analyses taking into account co-morbidity.

In addition, maternal ADH problems were associated with offspring ADH problems. Paternal anxiety and ADH problems scores were specifically associated with offspring internalizing and externalizing problem scores, respectively. Associations with offspring psychopathology were of similar magnitude for mothers and fathers and were not influenced by spousal resemblance. Our study shows that both fathers and mothers are at increased risk for psychiatric problems at the time of a child's evaluation and that their problems are equally associated with their offspring problems.

Although maternal depression is a risk factor for adolescent depression, evidence about the association between paternal and adolescent depression is inconclusive, and many studies have methodological limitations. We aimed to assess the association between paternal and adolescent depressive symptoms in two large population-based cohort studies.\n## METHODS\nWe used data for two-parent families from two representative prospective cohorts in Ireland (Growing up in Ireland [GUI]) and the UK (Millennium Cohort Study [MCS]). Parental depressive symptoms were measured with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in the GUI cohort when children were 9 years old, and the Kessler six-item psychological distress scale in the MCS cohort when children were 7 years old. Adolescent depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) at age 13 years in the GUI cohort and age 14 years in the MCS cohort. We analysed data using linear regression models, before and after adjustment for confounders, in both multiply imputed and complete case samples.\n## FINDINGS\nThere were 6070 families in GUI and 7768 in MCS. After all adjustments, a 1 SD (three-point) increase in paternal depressive symptoms was associated with an increase of 0\u00b724 SMFQ points (95% CI 0\u00b703-0\u00b745; p=0\u00b7023) in the GUI cohort and 0\u00b718 SMFQ points (0\u00b701-0\u00b736; p=0\u00b7041) in the MCS cohort. This association was independent of, and not different in magnitude to, the association between maternal and adolescent depressive symptoms (Wald test p=0\u00b7435 in the GUI cohort and 0\u00b7470 in the MCS cohort).\n## INTERPRETATION\nOur results show an association between depressive symptoms in fathers and depressive symptoms in their adolescent offspring. These findings support the involvement of fathers as well as mothers in early interventions to reduce the prevalence of adolescent depression, and highlight the importance of treating depression in both parents.\n## FUNDING\nDepartment of Children and Youth Affairs and Economic and Social Research Council.\n",

We tested a hypothesized moderator (ie, sex) and conducted path analysis to examine hypothesized mediators (ie, depression in the other parent, couple conflict, and paternal involvement and emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity in offspring at age 3.5 years) of the associations between both paternal and maternal depression and offspring depression. Data collection for the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children began in 1991 and is ongoing.

Paternal mean (SD) age at delivery was 29.6 (9.6) years. The offspring of fathers who had depression during the postnatal period were at increased risk of experiencing depression symptoms at age 18 years (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.053 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]).

The increased risk is seen in girls but not boys (interaction \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.095; P\u2009=\u2009.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe association between paternal depression in the postnatal period and depression in girls at age 18 years is partially explained by maternal depression. Couple conflict and paternal involvement were not found to play a role in the risk of transmission; this contrasts with the role that couple conflict was found to play in the risk of childhood behavior problems. Conduct problems in childhood appear to be a pathway for risk transmission between paternal depression and subsequent depression in offspring at age 18 years.\n",
