Abstract
Background—Depression is known to run in families, but the effects of parental history of other
psychiatric diagnoses on depression rates are less well studied. Few studies have examined the
impact of parental psychopathology on depression rates in older age groups.
Methods—We established a population-based cohort including all individuals born in Denmark
after 1954 and alive on their 10th birthday (N=2,976,264). Exposure variables were maternal and
paternal history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or ‘other’ psychiatric
diagnoses. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using poisson regressions.
Results—Parental history of any psychiatric diagnosis increased incidence rates of outpatient
(maternal: IRR = 1.88, p < .0001; paternal: IRR = 1.68, p < .0001) and inpatient (maternal: IRR =
1.99, p < .0001; paternal: IRR = 1.83, p < .0001) depression relative to no parental history. IRRs
for parental history of non-affective disorders remained relatively stable across age groups, while
IRRs for parental affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar) decreased with age from 2.29–3.96 in
the youngest age group to 1.53–1.90 in the oldest group. IRR estimates for all parental diagnoses
were similar among individuals 41+ (IRR range: 1.51–1.90).
Conclusions—Parental history of any psychiatric diagnosis is associated with increased
incidence rates of unipolar depression. In younger age groups, parental history of affective
diagnoses is more strongly associated with rates of unipolar depression than non-affective
diagnoses, however this distinction disappears after age 40, suggesting that parental
psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder, confers risk for depression in middle
life.

Introduction
Previous research has established definitively that unipolar depression runs in families.
Studies from clinical (Gershon et al. 1982; Mitchell et al. 1989; Orvaschel et al. 1988; Puig-
Antich et al. 1989; Weissman et al. 1982, 1984a; Weller et al. 1994; Welner & Rice 1988)
and community (Beardslee et al. 1988; Kendler et al. 1997; Klein et al. 2001, 2005; Low et
al. 2012) samples show that the odds of having a first-degree relative with depression are 2–
3 times higher among depressed individuals compared with control subjects. Prospective
studies following participants for between 1 and 20 years found that the risk of depression
among children of depressed parents was 2–3 times higher than the risk in children of
controls (Beardslee et al. 1996; Hammen et al. 1990; Lieb et al. 2002; Radke-Yarrow et al.
1992; Weissman et al. 1997, 2006).
These findings are consistent with results from twin studies, which suggest that depression is
around 30–40% heritable (Sullivan et al. 2000). Genetic studies also suggest, however, that
the underlying genetic architecture of depression may overlap with that of other psychiatric
diagnoses including anxiety (Cerda et al. 2010; Demirkan et al. 2011; Middeldorp et al.
2005), bipolar disorder (Lee et al. 2013; McGuffin et al. 2003) and schizophrenia
(Argyropoulos et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2013). This raises the possibility that parental history
of psychiatric diagnoses besides depression may also confer risk for depression in offspring.
While the majority of studies on the effects of parental psychopathology focused exclusively
on parental history of affective disorders (Beardslee et al. 1988; Billings & Moos 1986;
Hammen et al. 1990; Klein et al. 1988; Lieb et al. 2002; Orvaschel et al. 1988; Radke-
Yarrow et al. 1992; Weissman et al. 1984b, 1987, 1997, 2006; Welner & Rice 1988),
several studies found evidence suggesting that parental history of anxiety (Biederman et al.
2001; Low et al. 2012; Mitchell et al. 1989; Weller et al. 1994), bipolar disorder (Henin et
al. 2005), substance abuse (Todd et al. 1996; Welner & Rice 1988) and non-affective
psychosis (Dean et al. 2010) also confer risk for depression in offspring either alone, or
when comorbid with depression (Merikangas et al. 1988, 1994; Puig-Antich et al. 1989;
Weissman et al. 1984c).
Most of the studies examining the impact of parental psychopathology on offspring
depression risk focused on children (Billings & Moos 1986; Hammen et al. 1990; Weissman
et al. 1992) and adolescents (Beardslee et al. 1996; Weissman et al. 1997), but
epidemiologic evidence suggests that the average age of onset for unipolar depression is 32
years (Kessler et al. 2005). Because these studies did not evaluate the impact of parental
psychopathology during the peak timeframe for depression onset in offspring, they may
have failed to capture the full impact of parental psychopathology on depression risk. In
addition, they may have missed differences in the effects of parental history on depression
risk in older vs. younger individuals.
National registries provide an excellent source of data for addressing these types of research
questions because they include information on entire populations over long periods of time.
The Danish National Registry System (Thygesen et al. 2011) includes data on all inpatient
and outpatient treatment, as well as information linking parents and offspring, for 8 million
people. Previous studies have used this data to explore the effects of parental

psychopathology in one, both or neither parent (Dean et al. 2010) on mental illness in
offspring, as well as specificity of transmission (i.e. family aggregation) for mental disorders
in cases with onset in childhood or adolescence (Steinhausen et al. 2009). To our
knowledge, no previous study in either this or any other dataset has examined the specific
effects of a range of psychiatric diagnoses on offspring depression rates across age groups.
The goals of this study were to 1) examine the associations between parental history of
psychiatric diagnoses including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and
incidence rates of outpatient and inpatient unipolar depression in the Danish psychiatric
registry, 2) identify any differences in these associations across age groups and 3) evaluate
the extent to which these associations differ based on the gender of the parent (i.e. mothers
and fathers) and the gender of the offspring (male and female).
Methods
Data Sources
All live-born children and new residents in Denmark are assigned a unique personal
identification (CRS) number, which can be used to link information within and across
registers. Data for the current study were obtained from the Danish Civil Registry (Pedersen
et al. 2006, 2011), which contains information on sex, date of birth, place of birth, vital
status, and parents’ CRS numbers, and the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register
(Mors et al. 2011), which contains information on all psychiatric inpatient admission dates
and diagnoses since 1969 and all outpatient admission dates and diagnoses since 1995.
Psychiatric diagnoses are based on the International Classification of Diseases 8th Revision
(World Health Organization 1971) for admissions occurring between 1969 and 1993 and the
International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (World Health Organization 1994) for
admissions occurring after 1993. There are no private psychiatric inpatient facilities in
Denmark, which ensures that all psychiatric admissions are represented in the register.
Study Design
We established a population-based cohort that included all individuals born in Denmark in
1955 or later with links to both parents in the registries who were alive on their 10th
birthday. Only individuals born after 1955 were included in the study sample because these
individuals have a high probability of registered links to both parents in the Civil Registry.
We followed this cohort from their 10th birthday (at which point they became ‘at risk’ for
depression) or January 1, 1995, whichever came later, until the date of their first unipolar
depression diagnosis, the date of death, the date of emigration/disappearance or January 1,
2012, whichever came first.
Measures
Exposures—We created 2 categorical variables one for mothers and one for fathers -
where 0 = no psychiatric diagnosis, 1 = other psychiatric diagnoses (ICD-8 codes 290.0–
315.9 besides those in other categories; ICD-10 F-codes not included in other categories), 2
= anxiety (ICD-8 code 300 (excludes 300.4); ICD-10 codes F40, F41, F42), 3 = unipolar
depression (ICD-8 codes 296.0, 296.2, 298.0, 300.4; ICD-10 codes F32, F33), 4 = bipolar

disorder (ICD-8 codes 296 (excluding: 296.0, 296.2, 296.8), 298.1; ICD-10 codes F30, F31)
and 5 = schizophrenia (ICD-8 codes 295 (excluding: 295.7; ICD-10 codes F20). These
variables were hierarchical, meaning that parents were placed in the category of their most
severe diagnosis, and time dependent, meaning that if a parent was diagnosed with a
psychiatric disorder during the follow-up period, or received a more severe psychiatric
diagnosis during the follow-up period, he or she could switch from one level of the
categorical variable to another.
To illustrate what this hierarchical operationalization means in practice, a parent in the
depression category may have previously received an anxiety diagnosis, but he or she would
not have received a bipolar or schizophrenia diagnosis. Someone in the schizophrenia
category may have a previous history of other psychiatric diagnoses or they may not, but the
analyses will treat them the same as someone who only ever received a schizophrenia
diagnosis. To illustrate what we mean by time-dependent, if a mother received a diagnosis
of depression before her child was born, the child would contribute to the ‘mother with
depression category’ starting when he or she reached the age of 10 and became at risk for
unipolar depression. But if the mother went on to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia when
her child was 15, the child would contribute to the ‘mother with schizophrenia’ category
(and not the ‘mother with depression’ category) from that point onward.”
Outcomes—The primary outcomes of interest were the incidence rates of outpatient and
inpatient depression (ICD-10 codes F32, F33). Individuals admitted for inpatient and
outpatient treatment on the same day were included in the inpatient group.
Statistical analyses
We conducted survival analyses using Poisson regressions (Andersen et al., 1993), with the
logarithm of person-years as an offset variable. This method is equivalent to the Cox
regression under the assumption of piecewise constant incident rates (Andersen et al. 1993;
Laird & Olivier 1981). The exponentiated estimate in a Poisson regression is the incidence
rate ratio (IRR). Analyses were conducted using the GENMOD procedure in SAS software
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). P values were based on the Wald test statistic (p
< .05 was considered statistically significant), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
based on the assumption of the lognormal distribution of the IRR estimate.
We first examined the overall effects of having a mother or father with any psychiatric
diagnosis, after which we examined the effects of individual diagnoses separately by
including mutually exclusive dichotomous indicator variables in the analyses with 0 = no
psychiatric diagnosis as the reference category. All models were mutually adjusted for
maternal and paternal history of psychiatric diagnoses as well as sex, age in one year bands
(10, 11, 12, …, 60), calendar time in one year bands (1995, 1996, 1997, …, 2011), place of
birth (Capital (i.e. Copenhagen), suburb of capital, provincial city; city with more than 100
000 inhabitants, provincial town; city with more than 10,000 inhabitants and rural areas) and
maternal and paternal age at birth (<20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34 and 35 +). Age and calendar
time were treated as time-dependent variables, while all other variables were treated as fixed
variables.

We tested for statistically significant differences (i.e. interactions) in the effects of maternal/
paternal history of psychiatric diagnoses on the rates of outpatient and inpatient depression
for different age groups and between genders. We also tested for differences in the effect of
the interaction between age and parental gender on the rates of depression for outpatient vs.
inpatient and for males vs. females (i.e. three-way interactions).
Results
Characteristics of the study sample
Sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. The study sample included 2,976,264
individuals, 1,535,097 male (52%) and 1,441,167 female (48%). Of these, 61,939 (2%)
experienced an episode of unipolar depression after 1995: 47,562 (77%) outpatient and
14,377 (23%) inpatient. Average age of onset was 30.5 years (SD = 10.2 years) for
outpatient and 33.6 years (SD = 9.7) for inpatient cases. 65% of outpatient and 58% of
inpatient cases were female. Average age of first depression diagnosis was 30.28 years for
females (SD = 9.95) and 32.77 years for males (SD = 10.27).
Parental psychiatric diagnoses and rate of outpatient depression
Both maternal (IRR = 1.88, 95% CI [1.83, 1.93]; p < .0001) and paternal (IRR = 1.68, 95%
CI [1.63, 1.72]; p < .0001) histories of psychiatric diagnoses significantly increased the
incidence rate of outpatient depression relative to no maternal or paternal history of
psychiatric diagnosis. As shown in Table 2, the pattern of results for the different diagnostic
categories was similar for maternal and paternal history: Overall, parental history of
affective disorders (unipolar depression and bipolar disorder) had a greater impact on
incidence rates of outpatient depression than parental history of anxiety, schizophrenia, or
other psychiatric diagnoses. There was a statistically significant overall interaction between
the effects of maternal history and gender (χ2(5, N = 2,976,264) = 13.90, p = .02), and an
almost significant overall interaction between the effects of paternal history and gender
(χ2(5, N = 2,976,264) = 10.74, p = .06). With the exceptions of maternal history of
schizophrenia and ‘other’ diagnoses, parental history exerted a stronger effect on the
incidence rate of outpatient depression in males than in females (Table 2).
Parental psychiatric diagnosis and risk for inpatient depression
As with outpatient depression, having either a maternal (IRR = 1.99, 95% CI [1.90, 2.08]; p
< .0001) or a paternal (IRR = 1.83, 95% CI [1.74, 1.92]; p < .0001) history of any
psychiatric diagnosis significantly increased the incidence rate of inpatient depression. As
shown in Table 2, this pattern was similar for maternal and paternal history with respect to
other diagnoses, anxiety diagnoses and unipolar depression; however the effect of parental
history of bipolar disorder appeared stronger when the affected parent was the mother, and
the effect of parental history of schizophrenia appeared stronger when the affected parent
was the father. Parental history of schizophrenia and affective disorders had a greater effect
on the rate of inpatient depression compared to that of parental history of anxiety or other
diagnoses. There were no significant overall interactions between the effects of gender and
either maternal (χ2(5, N = 2,976,264) = 2.95, p = .71) or paternal (χ2(5, N = 2,976,264) =
4.09, p = .54) histories.

Parental history of psychiatric disorders by age group
There were no significant three-way interactions between the effects of age, parental history
and depression severity (outpatient vs. inpatient) for either maternal (χ2(25, N = 2,976,264)
= 36.18, p = .07) or paternal (χ2(25, N = 2,976,264) = 24.33, p = .50) history; therefore all
depression cases were analyzed together in subsequent analyses. Likelihood ratio tests
comparing models with parental history x age interactions that did not distinguish by parent
gender to models which did were statistically significant for both inpatient (LR χ2(41) =
88.77, p < .0001) and outpatient (LR χ2(89) = 297.27, p < .0001) cases, therefore we
continued to include separate variables for maternal and paternal history.
As shown in Figure 1, the effect of maternal history of affective disorders (unipolar and
bipolar depression) was strongest in the youngest age group and then decreased steadily with
offspring age. The effect of maternal history of anxiety was fairly stable across age groups,
while the effect of maternal history of schizophrenia was more variable, but still somewhat
stable across age groups. As shown in Figure 2, the effect of paternal history of affective
disorders was also strongest at younger ages and decreased over time, although this pattern
was less pronounced than for maternal affective disorders (particularly for paternal history
of unipolar depression). The effect of paternal anxiety was more variable, but more or less
constant across age groups, while the effect of paternal schizophrenia was lower at younger
ages and increased with age, peaking among individuals between the ages of 30 and 40
years old. After age 40, the effects of all maternal and paternal diagnoses were more or less
equal, ranging from 1.51 (95% CI [1.05, 2.18]) for paternal history of schizophrenia to 1.90
(95% CI [1.77, 2.04]) for maternal history of depression.
Discussion
Our goal in this study was to examine the associations between parental psychiatric
diagnoses (anxiety, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and incidence
rates of inpatient and outpatient unipolar depression by age and gender. The main findings
of the study are as follows: first, all parental psychiatric diagnoses increased rates of
inpatient and outpatient unipolar depression relative to no parental history of psychiatric
disorders. Second, the effect of parental history of affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar)
was strongest at younger ages, and decreased as the cohort aged, while the effects of
maternal and paternal history of anxiety and the effect of maternal history of schizophrenia
were more stable across age groups and the effect of paternal history of schizophrenia was
actually stronger when offspring were older. Finally, at younger ages the effect of parental
history of affective disorders was stronger than the effect of parental history of other
psychiatric disorders; however after age 40, the effects of the different parental diagnoses on
rates of depression were more or less equal.
To our knowledge, only two previous studies have examined the association between
parental psychopathology and depression risk among offspring of older ages: Dean et al.
(2010) used data from the Danish psychiatric registry to examine the impact of having 0, 1
or both parents with a history of non-affective psychosis, affective psychosis or ‘other’
diagnoses on psychopathology in offspring ages 14–42 and found a 1.52–2.91 fold increase
in rates of affective disorders associated with all three categories. Weissman et al. (2006)

followed 151 offspring of depressed parents from childhood until a mean age of 35 and
found a 3-fold increase in risk for depression among children of depressed parents relative to
children of controls. This is slightly larger than the effect of parental affective disorders
found in the present study, which was closer to a 2-fold increase. When we examined the
associations separately by age, however, we saw an approximately 3-fold increase in
depression rates for younger age groups, similar to that observed by Weissman and
colleagues. Weissman et al. (2006) also found evidence consistent with the current findings
that depression risk among the offspring of depressed parents was higher at younger ages,
although this effect was not statistically significant.
Parental history and age of onset of depression
The idea that parental history of depression is associated with earlier age of depression onset
is far from new: family studies suggested early on that the prevalence of depression was
higher among first-degree relatives of depressed individuals with an earlier age of onset
(Puig-Antich et al. 1989; Weissman et al. 1984d; Wickramaratne & Weissman 1998). One
such study (Weissman et al. 1984d) also found that the prevalence of depression in relatives
of depressed probands with an age of onset around 40 was almost equivalent that of the
relatives of control subjects, suggesting that the association between parental depression and
offspring depression risk may shrink to nothing as offspring approach middle life
(Weissman et al. 1984d). In the current study, parental history remained a statistically
significant risk factor for depression among individuals over 40; however the effect was
demonstrably attenuated relative to the effect in younger age groups. The effects of all types
of parental psychopathology on depression rates were roughly equal after age 40, which
raises the possibility that it may be parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one
disorder in particular, which confers risk for depression in middle life.
Parental history and depression severity
In addition to differences in average age of onset, several studies have found evidence
suggesting that parental history of depression is associated with greater severity of
depression in offspring (Lieb et al. 2002; Orvaschel et al. 1988). The results of the current
study were mixed in this regard: overall the effects of parental psychiatric diagnoses were
similar for inpatient and outpatient cases. The exception was parental history of
schizophrenia (particularly paternal history of schizophrenia), which had a stronger impact
on rates of inpatient depression than on outpatient depression. One possible explanation for
this is that a family history of schizophrenia confers risk for a more severe type of
depression, which is more likely to require inpatient treatment. Another possibility is that
individuals who exhibit psychotic features, and are therefore more likely to be treated in an
inpatient setting, may have received a depression diagnoses in error. Research suggests that
as many as 16% of individuals originally diagnosed with depression in the Danish registers
will receive a diagnosis of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder by their 10th contact with the
treatment system (Kessing 2005). Whether this indicates that the original diagnosis was
mistaken, or that depression may for some individuals represent a prodromal phase of
schizophrenia, is unclear from the data at hand.

Mechanisms of Transmission
Some of the association between parental psychopathology and depression is certainly due
to genetic factors, however there are other possible mechanisms through which psychiatric
disorders in parents can influence depression risk in offspring, particularly younger
offspring: Depression has been shown to negatively impact parenting behavior in both
mothers (Goodman 2007; Lovejoy et al. 2000) and fathers (Wilson & Durbin 2010), which
has in turn been shown to increase risk for depression in offspring (Browne et al. 1995).
Parental psychopathology, particularly depression, has also been shown to be associated
with marital discord and divorce (Burke 2003), which are associated with offspring
depression risk (Donahue et al. 2010). As with most of the parental history literature, the
majority of studies of psychosocial mechanisms have focused exclusively on parental
history of depression. A notable exception is a study by Johnson et al. (2001) in which the
authors demonstrated that maladaptive parental behavior mediated the association between a
wide array of parental psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, disruptive
behavior, personality disorders and substance abuse, and risk for psychiatric disorders
(including depression) in offspring. In addition, parental history of other psychiatric
disorders besides depression, particularly severe disorders like bipolar disorder or
schizophrenia which require extended periods of hospitalization, may expose children to
stressful circumstances including prolonged parental separation, which is associated with
depression later in life (Culpin et al. 2013; Roy 1985).
Parental history, depression and gender
Literature on the potential role of gender (both of the parent and of the offspring) as a
moderator of the effects of parental history of psychiatric disorders on offspring depression
risk is mixed. While some studies have found evidence to suggest that maternal
psychopathology has a greater impact on offspring risk than paternal psychopathology
(Johnson et al. 2006; Landman-Peeters et al. 2008; Low et al. 2012; Merikangas et al.
1988), other studies have found no evidence that the effect is different for mothers and
fathers (Dean et al. 2010; Kendler et al. 1997; Lieb et al. 2002; Weissman et al. 1987).
Similarly, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the effect of offspring gender:
several studies found evidence that parental psychopathology has a greater impact on
depression risk for girls (Klein et al. 1988; Landman-Peeters et al. 2008; Morris et al. 2014),
while others found no evidence of gender differences (Ohannessian et al. 2005). In this
study, we found a significant interaction between parental history and offspring gender, but
in the opposite direction from previous studies: parental history of affective disorders had a
greater effect on males than on females. This suggests that even if, as previous studies have
suggested, parental history has a greater impact on depression risk in girls than in boys,
parental history may have a greater impact on rates of treatment seeking for males than for
females (at least in cases of moderate depression). Stigma towards mental health treatment
seeking is generally higher among men than among women (Coppens et al. 2013). It is
possible that having a parent with a history of mental illness helps men to overcome their
stigma towards seeking treatment for their own depressive symptoms; however this theory
requires further study.

We also found a statistically significant three-way interaction between parental history,
offspring age and parental gender. This finding might be a simple statistical vagary;
however there is precedent from both the biological and behavioral literatures suggesting
that the impact of parental psychopathology on offspring depression risk at different ages
may vary depending on whether the affected parent is the individual’s mother or father.
From a biological perspective, studies on genetic imprinting in mice have found that the
same allele may be expressed differently depending on whether it was inherited from the
mother or the father (Garfield et al. 2011), and there is evidence in humans that gene
expression changes with age (Steegenga et al. 2014). From a behavioral perspective, a
mother is typically her child’s primary caregiver during childhood and adolescence,
therefore it is to be expected that mothers’ mental states will have a greater impact than
fathers’ on rates of depression in younger offspring.
Limitations
Several methodological considerations should be taken into account when interpreting these
results. First, only individuals who received treatment in a psychiatric facility (inpatient or
outpatient) were counted as cases. Psychiatric treatment in Denmark is free, so there are few
(if any) financial barriers to treatment. But individuals with milder symptoms may not have
been treated in psychiatric facilities either because a) they did not perceive their symptoms
as a mental illness and therefore did not seek treatment, or b) they chose to seek treatment
via their primary care provider. Additionally, individuals with very severe depression who
committed suicide without ever receiving treatment were also not included in the study
sample. As a result, the cases in this sample may not reflect the true underlying distribution
of depression severity within the Danish population.
Because the registry only includes outpatient data from 1995 onwards, some parents who
experienced moderate psychopathology before 1995 may have been misclassified. This is
more likely for disorders such as anxiety or depression which are often treated in an
outpatient setting. In addition, parents with anxiety and depression may have been less likely
to seek or receive treatment than parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, meaning
that misclassification may have been differential across psychiatric diagnoses. Finally,
although all models were mutually adjusted for maternal and paternal diagnoses, they did
not incorporate possible effects of psychiatric comorbidity in parents (i.e. depression and
anxiety vs. depression alone). Exploring complex effects of comorbid disorders in parents
on depression risk across the lifespan is beyond the scope of the current study, but would
likely be a fruitful line of inquiry for future research.
The fact that cases were defined by treatment introduces a potential source of bias into the
study, as the children of parents with a history of mental illness may be more likely to seek
treatment for depressive symptoms than the children of families without a history of mental
illness (Kendler 1995; Lieb et al. 2002). This may be particularly true for individuals with a
parental history of affective disorders, as they may be more likely to recognize their
symptoms as indicative of mental illness.

Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that parental history of any psychiatric diagnosis is
associated with increased rates of depression relative to no parental history of
psychopathology. The effect of parental history of affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar) is
strongest at younger ages, while the effects of parental history of anxiety appear stable
across age and the effect of paternal history of schizophrenia may actually be stronger at
older ages. After age 40, the effects of different parental diagnoses are similar in magnitude,
suggesting that it may be parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder
specifically, that confers risk for depression in middle life.

Effects of maternal history of psychiatric diagnoses on the rate of unipolar depression
(moderate or severe) by age group
Note. Maternal history of psychiatric diagnosis operationalized as a time-dependent,
hierarchical variable, meaning participants were classified based on the most severe
psychiatric diagnoses their mothers had received to date. Reference category = no maternal
psychiatric diagnosis. Vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Incidence rate ratio
estimates originate from a single analytical model which included both the mother’s and the
father’s hierarchical psychiatric diagnosis variable. Model adjusted for sex, calendar time,
place of birth and paternal psychiatric diagnoses.
