Abstract
This Taiwan study examined the associations of parental age and mental disorders with the offspring risks of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder
(BD). Children born between January 1991 and December 2004 in Taiwan were enrolled as the birth cohort (n = 4,138,151)
and followed up until December 2011. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the odds ratio (OR). The
advanced age effects were significant in ADHD (range of OR: 1.04 to 1.49) and ASD (range of OR: 1.35 to 2.27). Teenage
mothers, teenage fathers, and fathers ≥ 50 years had higher offspring risks of MDD (range of OR: 1.24 to 1.46); and teenage
mothers and fathers ≥ 50 years had increased offspring risks of BD (range of OR: 1.23 to 1.87). Both paternal and maternal
mental disorders were associated with higher risks of within-disorder transmission for ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD (range
of OR: 2.64 to 30.41). Besides, parents with one of these four mental disorders (ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD) might have
higher risk of cross-disorder transmission to at least one of the other three mental disorders in the offspring (range of OR: 1.35
to 7.15). Parental age and mental disorders had complex and nuanced patterns in association with offspring mental disorders.
