Family Functioning as Mediator in Predicting Youth
Depression
Maternal Depression (cid:3) Paternal Depression and Maternal De-
pression (cid:3) Paternal Substance Abuse were both significant in
predictingyouthdepression.Next,weexaminedwhetherdisrupted
family functioning might help to explain the mechanism for this
effect. Specifically, we followed the methods proposed by Baron
andKenny(1986)toassesswhetherfamilystress,father’sEE,and
marital conflict acted as mediators in the relationship between
parentalpsychopathologyandyouthdepression.
