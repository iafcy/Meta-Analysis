ABSTRACT
Background. There is a large literature indicating that the offspring of mothers with Major
Depressive Disorder (MDD) are at increased risk for depression. However, much less is known
abouttheeffectsofpaternalMDDonoffspringpsychopathology.
Method. We addressed this issue using a large community sample of parents and their adolescent
andyoungadultoffspring (n=775).Parents andoffspringwereindependentlyassessedwithsemi-
structured diagnostic interviews. Offspring were interviewed three times from mid-adolescence to
age24years.
Results. MaternalMDDwassignificantlyassociatedwithoffspringMDD.PaternalMDDwasalso
significantlyassociatedwithMDDinoffspring,butonlyamongoffspringwithdepressiveepisodes
ofmoderateorgreaterseverity.Theseeffectspersistedaftercontrollingforsocio-economicstatus,
familyintactness,andnon-mooddisordersinbothparents.RatesofMDDwereparticularlyelev-
ated in offspring of mothers and fathers with early-onset MDD, and offspring of fathers with
recurrent MDD. The magnitude of the associations between MDD in parents and offspring was
generallyinthesmall-to-mediumrange.
Conclusions. These results confirm previous findings of elevated risk of MDD in the offspring of
depressedmothers.Inaddition,theresultssuggestthatMDDinfathersisassociatedwithincreased
risk of depression in offspring, butthat it islimited to MDD episodes in offspring of moderate or
greaterseverity.
