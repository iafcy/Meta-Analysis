Intergenerational Transmission of Psychopathology
Minor Versus Major Parental Depression
Julie A. Leis, BS, and Tamar Mendelson, PhD
Abstract: This study used data from the National Comorbidity Survey to
investigate associations between: (1) maternal and paternal depression and
young adult offspring psychopathology, and (2) major and minor parental
depression and offspring psychopathology. Offspring of a depressed parent
were signiﬁcantly more likely to experience a psychiatric disorder by young
adulthood than offspring of nondepressed parents. Major and minor maternal
and paternal depression were associated with comparable increases in risk for
offspring 12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders and lifetime
substance use disorder. However, maternal major depression was associated
with a greater risk for offspring lifetime mood and anxiety disorder than
maternal minor depression. Risk for lifetime mood and anxiety disorder did
not differ by severity of paternal depression. These ﬁndings suggest that
parental depressive symptoms that do not meet major depressive disorder
criteria may nevertheless have signiﬁcant adverse associations with offspring
mental health.

O
ffspring of parents with histories of depression are at substan-
tially increased risk for developing a psychiatric disorder
themselves (Downey and Coyne, 1990; Gelfand and Teti, 1990).
Parental depression has been found to be associated not only with
offspring depression but also with higher rates of anxiety disorders,
such as phobia and panic disorder, and substance use disorders, such
as alcohol dependence (Lieb et al., 2002a; Weissman et al., 1997).
Furthermore, parental depression is associated with a more impair-
ing and protracted course of offspring disorder (Rohde et al., 2005).
Relatively severe manifestations of depression among parents (i.e.,
major depressive disorder) are a well-established risk factor for
offspring psychiatric disorder. However, the extent to which less
severe forms of depression (i.e., minor depression) confer risk
remains unclear.
Minor depression is deﬁned as the presence of at least 2 but
5 depressive symptoms plus clinically signiﬁcant distress and
impairment for 2 weeks (American Psychiatric Association,
1994). It has received increased attention of late, as research indi-
cates that individuals not meeting full criteria for major depression
exhibit functional impairment (Backenstrass et al., 2006; Wagner et
al., 2000), and that the economic costs and burden to society of
minor depression approach those of major depression (Cuijpers et
al., 2007). These ﬁndings are consistent with the spectrum hypoth-
esis of depression, which suggests that depressive syndromes exist
on a continuum of severity (Cuijpers et al., 2004; Kessler et al.,
1997; Rapaport et al., 2002), in contrast to a conceptualization of
major depression as categorically different from subthreshold de-
pressive states (Solomon et al., 2001).
Research conducted by Keller et al. (1986) examining clinical
characteristics of parental depression in relation to offspring impair-
ment was the ﬁrst to demonstrate that more severe parental depres-
sion was associated with poorer adaptive functioning and increased
psychopathology in offspring. Several more recent studies have
investigated the impact of severity of parental depression with
mixed ﬁndings. Two studies have demonstrated an association
between severity of parental depression and psychopathology in
child and adolescent offspring (Grigoroiu-Serbanescu et al., 1991;
Hammen and Brennan, 2003), whereas a study of the same relation-
ship in adult offspring found no association (Peisah et al., 2005).
However, this literature is limited in several ways. First, no
prior study has used the American Psychiatric Association (APA,
1994) criteria for minor depression. Second, the majority of inves-
tigations in this area have focused on maternal depression, with only
a small number including paternal depression (Phares and Compas,
1992; Connell and Goodman, 2002). Several studies have reported
that paternal depression increases risk for offspring disorder (Bren-
nan et al., 2002; Kane and Garber, 2004; Klein et al., 2005),
however, suggesting that fathers with depression should be included
in this work. Finally, prior studies have relied upon clinical or
community samples; the associations between severity of parental
depression and offspring psychopathology have not yet been exam-
ined with data from a United States nationally representative sample.
This study assessed the extent to which major and minor
parental depression are associated with psychopathology among
young adult offspring. Nationally representative data on 1255 young
adult participants in the National Comorbidity Study (NCS) were
analyzed. Parental depression was deﬁned so as to include both
maternal and paternal depression. Minor depression was deﬁned
according to standard criteria (APA, 1994). The probability of
mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders among offspring were
evaluated. We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) We predicted that having a
parent with major depression or a parent with minor depression
would each independently be associated with a higher probability of
12-month and lifetime mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder
among offspring when compared with having nondepressed parents.
(2) We predicted that the probability of 12-month and lifetime
psychiatric disorder among offspring would not be signiﬁcantly
greater for those whose parents had major depression, as opposed to
minor depression. These hypotheses were tested separately for
maternal and paternal depression.
METHODS
Participants
Data for these analyses were drawn from the NCS, a 2-part
epidemiologic study designed to estimate the prevalence of psychi-
atric disorders in a nationally representative sample (Kessler et al.,
1994). In part 1, trained interviewers administered standardized
questionnaires to a total of 8098 individuals aged 15 to 54 years in

the civilian population between September 1990 and February 1992.
In part 2, participants aged 15 to 24, those who reported having one
or more lifetime psychiatric disorders, and a 1 in 6 random sub-
sample of all remaining participants were administered a second,
more extensive interview, which included questions on self and
parental psychopathology (N  5877). A more detailed description
of the NCS study methodology is presented elsewhere (Kessler et
al., 1994).
Sample selection for this analysis was based on a 3-step
process. First, the sample was restricted to young adult participants
aged 18 to 29 who completed the second part of the interview (n 
1752). This age group was selected to ensure that participants had
passed through or entered the period of highest risk for onset of each
of the selected disorders (Kessler et al., 2005) and so as not to
confuse different developmental periods. Second, young adult par-
ticipants who reported history of parental substance use disorder
(n  408) were removed from the sample. Of the remaining 1344
participants, 210 reported a history of maternal depression, 96
reported a history of paternal depression, and 89 reported a history
of depression among both parents. Because the focus of the current
research is on the distinction between major depression and minor
depression, the 89 participants with 2 affected parents were removed
from the sample because of the complexity of teasing apart the effect
of major versus minor depression when both parents are depressed.
Thus, based on the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (APA, 1994) criteria for major depres-
sion and provisional criteria for minor depression, participants were
categorized according to their parents history of psychopathology as
follows: (1) those with parental history of minor depression in 1
parent only and no parental history of a substance use disorder (n 
116), (2) those with parental history of major depression in 1 parent
only and no parental history of a substance use disorder (n  190),
and (3) those with no parental history of depression or substance use
disorder (n  949). Participants who reported parental history of
anxiety disorder were not removed from the sample because of the
highly comorbid nature of anxiety and depression (Krueger, 1999;
Regier et al., 1998; Weinstock and Whisman, 2006).
Measures
Young Adult Psychiatric Disorder
Young adult 12-month and lifetime psychiatric disorder were
diagnosed based on the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria (APA, 1987) using
the World Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview (World Health Organization, 1990), a fully structured
diagnostic interview with adequate reliability and validity (Wit-
tchen, 1995). Three categories of 12-month and lifetime psychiatric
disorder were used in this study: mood disorder (major depression
and dysthymia), anxiety disorder (panic disorder, agoraphobia with-
out panic disorder, social phobia, simple phobia, and generalized
anxiety disorder), and substance use disorder (alcohol abuse no
dependence, alcohol dependence, drug abuse no dependence, drug
dependence). Composite variables indicating presence of disorder
from any of the 3 categories for 12-month and lifetime disorders
were created.
Parental Depression
History of parental depression was assessed using the Family
History Research Diagnostic Criteria Interview, a widely used,
reliable measure of family psychiatric history (Andreasen et al.,
1977). If a participant responded positively when asked, “Did your
father (mother) ever have periods lasting 2 weeks when he (she)
was depressed, down in the dumps, or blue most of the time?” the
interviewer went on to pose a series of 9 questions regarding
symptoms of depression that correspond to Criterion A of the
revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders major depressive episode. A symptom count score
was computed, representing the number of symptoms endorsed for
each parent. If 2, 3, or 4 symptoms were endorsed, the parent was
considered to have a history of minor depressive episode. If 5
symptoms were endorsed, the parent was considered to have a
history of major depressive episode.
Statistical Analysis
The September 9, 2008 version of the NCS public use data
was obtained from the Interuniversity Consortium in Political and
Social Research (Kessler, 2008). Data were weighted to adjust for
probability of selection and differential nonresponse as well as to
ensure the subsample was representative of the United States pop-
ulation according to NCS stipulations. For additional information on
weighting, see Kessler et al., 1994. Standard errors and signiﬁcance
tests were calculated using the Taylor linearization approach to
account for the complex survey design. Data were analyzed using
Stata software version 10.0 (Stata Corp., 2007).
The design-based Pearson chi-square test corrected for sur-
vey design and 1-way analysis of variance were performed to
compare the demographic characteristics of participants including
age, gender, race/ethnicity, level of education, income, employment
status, and marital status across the 3 parental depression categories.
The possibility of an over reporting bias associated with young adult
offspring mood disorder was also evaluated using the Pearson
chi-square test. Two sets of logistic regression models were ﬁt to
test our hypotheses. The ﬁrst set of models examined whether
having a parent with a history of major depression or a history of
minor depression increased the risk of 12-month and lifetime mood,
anxiety, substance use, or any disorder among offspring when
compared with having nondepressed parents. The second set of
models assessed whether risk for psychopathology was greater for
young adults whose parent had major depression when compared
with minor depression. Potential confounders including young adult
gender, race, highest level of education achieved and employment
status were controlled for in both models.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The study sample consisted of 1255 young adult offsprings
ranging in age from 18 to 29. The average age was 23.5 years
(SD  3.5) and 51% were men (n  635). The majority of the
sample was white (70%), 75% were employed, and 40% were
married or living with a partner. Approximately 25% of the young
adult participants had a parent with either minor (9%) or major
(15%) depression. Table 1 displays participant characteristics by
parental depression status (no parental depression, minor parental
depression, and major parental depression).
Over 45% of participants met criteria for any lifetime disorder
by young adulthood; 30% reported a substance use disorder, 22%
reported an anxiety disorder, and 13% reported a mood disorder.
Approximately 30% of participants met criteria for a 12-month
disorder. Among participants with a 12-month disorder, anxiety
disorders were most frequently reported (17%) followed by sub-
stance use (16%) and mood disorders (8%). For both lifetime and
12-month disorder and across all categories of disorder, prevalence
varied according to parental depression status. Twenty-seven per-
cent of participants whose parents had no lifetime history of depres-
sion met criteria for any 12-month disorder compared with 45% of
participants with parental history of minor depression and 48% of
participants with parental history of major depression (F  16.81,
p  0.000). Similarly, 42% of participants whose parents had no

lifetime history of depression met criteria for any lifetime disorder,
whereas 61% of participants with parental history of minor depres-
sion and 68% of participants with parental history of major depres-
sion met criteria for any lifetime disorder (F  17.75, p  0.000).
Assessing Participant Bias
The possibility that depressed participants would be more
likely to report a history of depression in their parents was assessed
by comparing rates of parental depression reported by young adult
participants with current versus remitted mood disorder. Participants
meeting criteria for 12-month mood disorder were no more likely
than those meeting criteria for lifetime but not 12-month mood
disorder to report parents as depressed versus nondepressed (F 
0.26, p  0.61), or to report parental history of major depression
versus parental history of minor depression (F  0.15, p  0.84).
Risk of Psychopathology Associated With Parental
Depression
The ﬁrst set of logistic regression models examined whether
having a parent with major depression or a parent with minor
depression increased the risk of lifetime or 12-month mood, anxiety,
or substance use disorder in young adult offspring when compared
with having nondepressed parents (Table 2). The ﬁndings provide
support for our ﬁrst hypothesis: parental depression was signiﬁ-
cantly associated with increased risk for lifetime and 12-month
young adult offspring psychopathology. When controlling for young
adult gender, race, highest level of education achieved and employ-
ment status, having a mother with depression was associated with
almost 3 times greater odds of any lifetime disorder by young
adulthood and having a father with depression was associated with
2 times the odds of any lifetime disorder by young adulthood
when compared with having nondepressed parents. Both maternal
and paternal depression were signiﬁcantly associated with increased
risk for lifetime and 12-month prevalence of mood, anxiety, and
substance use disorders among young adult offspring.
Risk of Psychopathology Associated With Major
Versus Minor Parental Depression
The second set of logistic regression models investigated
whether the risk for young adult offspring psychopathology was
greater for those with parental major depression when compared
with parental minor depression (Table 3). As predicted, risk of
12-month disorder did not differ signiﬁcantly between young adults
whose mother or father had minor depression versus those whose
mother or father had major depression. However, risk for a lifetime
mood or anxiety disorder was increased for participants with ma-
ternal major depression compared with maternal minor depression.
There were no signiﬁcant differences between maternal major de-
pression and maternal minor depression for lifetime history of
substance use disorder. Risk for lifetime young adult mood, anxiety,

depression.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the association of parental depression
with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders among young adult
offspring using nationally representative data. Consistent with pre-
vious research (Lieb et al., 2002a), maternal and paternal depression
were each associated with signiﬁcantly higher rates of lifetime and
12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders among off-
spring. Participants with a depressed mother were 2.5 times as likely
to experience a psychiatric disorder by young adulthood when
compared with participants with a nondepressed mother, and par-
ticipants with a depressed father were over 2 times as likely to
experience a psychiatric disorder when compared with those with
a nondepressed father. The association was most pronounced for

risk of mood disorders among participants with a depressed
mother, for whom mood disorder prevalence was over 3.5 times
greater than for those with a nondepressed mother. By contrast,
participants with a depressed father were approximately twice as
likely to experience a mood disorder when compared with those
with a nondepressed father.
This study also assessed whether severity of parental depres-
sion inﬂuenced the intergenerational transmission of psychiatric
disorders. Although major and minor parental depression were both
associated with increased risk of offspring psychiatric disorders
regardless of the parent’s gender, the relative inﬂuence of parental
major versus minor depression differed somewhat as a function of
parent gender. Risk of offspring psychopathology was not signiﬁ-
cantly lower for those whose parent had minor depression when
compared with those whose parent had major depression, with 2
exceptions relating to maternal depression severity. Maternal major
depression was associated with greater risk of offspring lifetime
mood and anxiety disorders than maternal minor depression. This
pattern of ﬁndings suggests maternal severity may inﬂuence off-
spring vulnerabilities selectively (i.e., offspring depression and anx-
iety but not substance use disorders), perhaps via maternal modeling
of speciﬁc emotion regulation strategies. We did not observe in-
creased offspring risk for any lifetime or 12-month psychiatric
disorders as a function of paternal depression severity, which may
reﬂect the fact that mothers generally take a more active role in
childrearing than fathers and are thus more inﬂuential in modeling
emotion regulation and coping skills. However, ﬁndings regarding
the relative inﬂuence of paternal minor versus major depression
should be interpreted with some caution given the relatively small
number of participants with a depressed father.
Our ﬁnding that parental depression across a spectrum of
severity is associated with psychopathology among offspring has
implications for the conceptualization of depression. The spectrum
or continuity hypothesis posits that diagnosable cases of depression
differ only in degree from symptoms of depression not meeting
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a
diagnosis (Solomon et al., 2001). In contrast, the categorical per-
spective suggests that there is a qualitative difference between
diagnosable depression and depressive symptoms (Solomon et al.,
2001). The fact that both major and minor parental depressions were
associated with offspring psychopathology indicates that subthresh-
old states have the potential to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence offspring
mental health outcomes. However, it is noteworthy that having a
parent with depression (vs. no parents with depression) was more
strongly predictive of offspring risk for psychopathology than was
the distinction between having a parent with major versus minor
depression.
This study has certain limitations. First, given the cross-
sectional design, we cannot establish the temporal relation between
parent and offspring disorder, and we cannot infer a causal pathway
between the former and latter. Second, ﬁndings regarding the asso-
ciation of paternal major and minor depression with offspring
psychiatric disorder should be interpreted with some caution given
that the number of participants reporting a depressed father was
considerably smaller than the number reporting a depressed mother.
Third, although the family history measure of parental depression
used in this study has adequate to good sensitivity for affective
disorders (Andreasen et al., 1977) and is commonly used for the
collection of data on family psychopathology (for example, Coryell
et al., 2000; Grekin et al., 2005; Johnson and Bennett, 1995), this
method has potential for some degree of measurement bias. Most
notably, informants with a history of psychiatric illness may have a
greater tendency to report psychiatric illness in a relative than
informants without such a history (Chapman et al., 1994; Kendler et
al., 1991). However, one study found no evidence of differential
sensitivity for parental psychopathology as a function of offspring
mental disorders (Lieb et al., 2002b), and another reported that the
family history method did not seem biased when assessing lifetime,
rather than current, depression (Zimmerman et al., 2006). In our
sample, reporting of lifetime parental depression—and of major
versus minor parental depression—did not vary based on whether
participants’ depression was current or remitted, suggesting that
current depression did not bias offspring recall of the presence or
severity of parental psychopathology. Although our ﬁndings should
be evaluated with those limitations in mind, this study provides a
preliminary assessment to guide further work on the inﬂuences of
parental major and minor depression on the intergenerational trans-
mission of psychopathology.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study indicate an association between
parental depression and increased risk of young adult offspring
psychiatric disorder and suggest that the inﬂuence of parental minor
depression may be signiﬁcant and in some cases comparable in
magnitude with that of parental major depression. At the same time,
the results suggest that severity of maternal depression may have
prognostic implications, given that maternal major depression dis-
played a particularly deleterious inﬂuence on risk for offspring
mood and anxiety disorders. Future research using clinical diagnos-
tic interviews to assess histories of maternal and paternal major and
minor depression will be critical in extending this work. Our
ﬁndings offer a preliminary indication that programs aiming to
prevent the intergenerational transmission of depression may do
well to target parental symptoms of depression, even if criteria for
major depressive disorder are not met, to limit risk to offspring.
Minor depression seems to be a mental health problem in its own
right, one worthy of clinical attention and continued research.
