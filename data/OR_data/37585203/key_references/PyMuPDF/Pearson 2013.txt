Abstract
Context—Some relatively small studies suggest that maternal postnatal depression is a risk factor
for offspring adolescent depression. However no large cohort studies have addressed this issue.
Furthermore only one small study has examined the association between antenatal depression and
later offspring depression. Understanding these associations is important to inform prevention.
Objective—To investigate the hypothesis that there are independent associations between
antenatal and postnatal depression with offspring depression; and that the risk pathways are
different, such that the risk associated with postnatal depression is moderated by disadvantage
(low maternal education) but the risk associated with antenatal depression is not.
Design—Prospective investigation of associations between symptoms of antenatal and postnatal
parental depression with offspring depression at age 18.
Setting—UK community based birth cohort (ALSPAC).
Participants—Data from over 4,500 parents and their adolescent offspring.
Main Outcome Measure—Diagnosis of offspring major depression, aged 18, using ICD-10.
Results—Antenatal depression was an independent risk factor. Offspring were 1.28 times (95%
CI 1.08 to 1.51, p=0.003) more likely to have depression at 18 for each s.d increase in maternal
depression score antenatally, independently of later maternal depression. Postnatal depression was
also a risk factor for mothers with low education, with offspring 1.26 times (95% CI 1.06 to 1.50,
p=0.009) more likely to have depression for each s.d increase in postnatal depression score.
However, for more educated mothers, there was little association (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36,
p=0.420). Moderation analyses found that maternal education moderated the effects of postnatal
but not antenatal depression. Paternal depression antenatally was not associated with offspring
depression, while postnatally paternal depression showed a similar pattern to maternal depression.
Conclusions—The findings suggest that treating maternal depression antenatally could prevent
offspring depression during adulthood and that prioritising less advantaged mothers postnatally
may be most effective.

Keywords
ALSPAC; depression; antenatal; postnatal; mechanisms; moderation
Depression in late adolescence is a major public health issue worldwide. It is associated with
substantial present and future morbidity and is predictive of depression persisting into
adulthood1. By late adolescence the prevalence rates are particularly high2 and the
depression can have a severe and persisting impact on socio-emotional functioning,
education and employment. The identification of early life risk factors is important to guide
prevention and intervention.
There is evidence that maternal postnatal depression (PND) is associated with problems in
later child development because of the impact of depression on care-giving 3;4. It may be a
period where suboptimal care-giving confers particularly high risk because of the infant’s
dependence on parents 4. To date, the association between PND and offspring depression
has been studied up to age 16 5;6. However, findings of an independent association with
offspring depression have been inconsistent1 and sample sizes have been relatively small. To
our knowledge, there have been no large published prospective cohort studies and no reports
into late adolescence.
Despite receiving less attention, emerging evidence suggests that antenatal depression
(AND) is associated with independent risks for child development 7;8. The mechanism for
this is unclear, but if it is causal, rather than being explained by the continuation of AND
postnatally, then the mechanisms for the transmission of risk from mother to foetus would
differ from those related to maternal depression during the child’s life. One explanation is
that cortisol, elevated in depression, passes through the placenta and directly alters fetal
neural development with long-term consequences 9. One small study found an association
between AND and offspring depression at age 16 6. However, the study did not have the
power to distinguish the effects of AND from maternal depression at later time points. No
studies have investigated the effects of AND on depression during late adolescence.
These findings raise two important questions: First, is there evidence that both AND and
PND are independently associated with an increased risk of offspring depression up to age
18, and if so which period carries the greater risk? However, given that AND often
continues and is the strongest predictor of PND10, large studies are required to provide
sufficient power to assess whether the risks associated with AND and PND are independent.
Second, is there evidence that any effects of AND and PND operate through different
mechanisms? One way to investigate whether the pathways by which AND and PND
influence offspring depression are different is to look at moderation effects. Moderation
operates by altering the pathway from exposure (maternal depression) to outcome
(adolescent depression), thus differential moderation would provide indirect evidence for
different and independent pathways.
Evidence suggests that associations between PND and negative child outcomes are
moderated by socio-economic status (SES): children whose mothers have the same degree
of PND, but who are from higher SES, are less likely to be adversely affected than children
of mothers from lower SES 3;11;12. Of the variables that constitute SES, maternal education
is most strongly associated with the quality of the home environment 13; 14. One explanation
for the moderating effects of SES is that education diminishes the association between
maternal depression and home environmental adversity 3;13;15;16, therefore mitigating any
adverse effects on offspring. This would not apply to the effects of AND if such effects
result directly from the biological consequences of AND in utero. In contrast, if any effect of

AND on offspring depression occurs only because AND continues postnatally, then
maternal education should moderate the antenatal effect.
Investigating paternal depression may also help to understand these pathways. For example,
there should be no effect of paternal AND on the child if AND has an effect through
biologically mediated pathways in utero; while paternal PND may have more similar effects
to maternal PND if effects operate through the home environment.
This study uses data from a large UK birth cohort. Several measurements of maternal and
paternal depressive symptoms were collected during the ante- and postnatal periods and a
validated interview measure of offspring depression was completed at age 18. Our questions
were:
1.
Is maternal AND and PND associated with offspring depression at age 18?
2.
Do AND and PND have independent effects on offspring depression? If so, are the
risks of different magnitude?
3.
Does maternal education moderate the effects of PND but not AND?
4.
Are the effects of AND, but not PND, unique to mothers?
DATA SOURCE
The sample comprised participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (ALSPAC). All pregnant women resident in the former Avon Health Authority in
south-west England, having an estimated date of delivery between April 1991 and December
1992, were invited to take part. The children of 15,247 pregnancies were recruited17. Ethical
approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and the
Local Research Ethics Committees, participants gave informed consent. Information on the
ALSPAC study is available on the web site: http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk17. Detailed
information has been collected on the cohort since early pregnancy, including regular self-
reported information from mothers and children and face to face assessments in research
clinics. The current study uses data from the child sample (singletons only) attending the
most recent research clinic.
SAMPLE
Our starting sample was those with maternal AND and PND data, n =8937. Outcome data
were available for 4566 adolescents at age 18. A sample with complete data across all
exposure, outcome and confounding variables (n=2847) was used to investigate main and
independent effects of maternal depression. Data was available on paternal depression and
education from a sample of 2475. To maximise power to examine magnitude of risk and
moderation all available data from exposures and outcomes were used for these analyses.
All missing data was imputed and all analyses were repeated using the same sample
(n=8937).
We imputed for missing data because if those with missing data are ignored it can result in
bias by making the assumption that data are missing completely at random 18. Full details of
the imputation method are given in eMethod1.
MEASURES
Parental Depression
Symptoms of maternal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale (EPDS) 19. The EPDS is a10 item self-report depression questionnaire validated for
Pearson et al.

use in the perinatal period because it avoids physical symptoms 19. It is validated for use
outside of the perinatal period and in men 20;21;22. Scores of >12 have a high sensitivity and
specificity in predicting clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder 21;22;23. We
primarily used the continuous scores to make full use of the variation in symptoms, although
we also used the >12 threshold to test for main effects.
Postal questionnaires, including EPDS measures, were administered at approximately 18
and 32 weeks antenatally and 8 weeks and 8 months postnatally. For the current study the
periods of interest were pregnancy (whilst mother and fetus are physiological attached) and
the first year postnatally (whilst the infant is heavily dependent on care-givers and exposed
to home environment). We averaged EPDS scores across the two available measures within
these a priori selected and theoretically defined periods, providing a more stable and reliable
estimate of levels during that period than would be obtained using one measure alone 24 as
used previously 25. The mean of the 18 and 32 weeks antenatal EPDS scores was taken as
the AND measure, and the mean of the 8 weeks and 8 months postnatal EPDS scores as the
PND measure. Analyses were repeated looking at the effect of each of the 4 EPDS measures
separately and individual EPDS scores had comparable effects to those reported for
averaged AND or PND scores.
As the EPDS is validated beyond the postnatal period, this same measure of maternal
depression was used repeatedly over the child’s life, allowing us to take account of later
maternal depression. We used the latest available measure of maternal depression when the
children were aged 12 (closest to the 18 year outcome) to account for later maternal
depression. To account for repeated exposure to maternal depression, a count of subsequent
depression episodes in the child’s life was derived (number of times the mother scored >12
on any of 6 EPDS measures from ages 1 to 12). This measure is only valid if all time points
are included. However, as most women only missed one or two of the EPDS questionnaires
we were able to impute this variable using data from EPDS scores at other time points.
Fathers also completed the EPDS at 18 weeks of pregnancy (paternal AND) and 8 months
postnatally (paternal PND).
Parent Education
Mothers completed questionnaires concerning their education and their partner’s education
at 32 weeks of pregnancy. Response categories were; minimal education or none,
compulsory secondary level (up to age 16), non-compulsory secondary (up to age 18), or
post-school university level education. Education up to age 16 (compulsory education only)
was categorised as low education and post 16 education as high. Low education was
relatively common (>50%). This socio-economic indicator was chosen a priori for
theoretical reasons (see introduction).
Adolescent Depression
Depression in the offspring was measured using the computerised version of the Clinical
Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R)26. The CIS-R is a computerised interview which
derives a diagnosis of depression according to ICD-10 criteria. The interview is fully
standardised and equally reliable whether conducted by a clinically trained interviewer or
self administered on the computerised version26;27;28. The CIS-R is designed for, and has
been widely used within, community samples including the National Surveys of Psychiatric
Morbidity and the 1958 birth cohort 28-31. A binary variable indicating a primary diagnosis
of major depression on the CIS-R or no such diagnosis was the outcome measure.

Confounding variables
Maternal characteristics identified in previous studies as being associated with maternal
depression 7 or education were obtained from maternal questionnaires administered
antenatally and the child’s life. These included maternal age (in years), social class (1-5),
parity, history of depression before pregnancy (self-report yes/no), smoking during
pregnancy, breastfeeding in the first year (none/ <3months/3 - 6 months/ >6 months), use of
non-parental child-care within the first 6 months (yes/no). Smoking is important because the
association between prenatal smoking and child psychiatric outcomes may reflect genetic
confounding32.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Main effects
To test main effects of both AND and PND, associations of AND and PND symptoms with
offspring depression were investigated in separate logistic regression models. Later
maternal depression and potentially confounding variables were then included into these
models.
Independent effects
To assess independent effects, both AND & PND were included into the same regression
model. The reported effects reflect the association between AND and offspring depression,
adjusted for PND and the association between PND and offspring depression adjusted for
AND. We also investigated independent effects, by repeating each main effect analysis,
excluding women reaching above thresholds for depression (>12) at the other timing (i.e.
women with PND were removed from the AND analyses). The interaction between AND
and PND was also investigated.
Heightened risk
In order to investigate whether the antenatal or postnatal period represents a time of
heightened risk to the child, analyses were conducted to disentangle the correlated aspects of
AND and PND from separable timing effects. A joint multi-level model of the outcome and
maternal depression trajectories across the antenatal and postnatal period was used 33. The 4
antenatal and postnatal EPDS scores were included, modelling repeated measures within
theoretically relevant ‘periods’ (period 1: pregnancy; period 2: first year postnatally) as
‘within period variation’ and this was accounted for in the model. Latent depression
trajectories were summarised by two parameters a) initial levels of maternal depression in
period 1 [the intercept] and b) the change in maternal depression levels across periods [the
slope] using a longitudinal random effects model. Parameters were allowed to vary across
individuals (random effects) and their dependence on the outcome estimated using the
Bayesian approach 33. If either the antenatal or postnatal period is a period of greater risk it
would be expected that there would be an effect of the change in depression across periods.
Moderating effects
Analyses were conducted to investigate whether maternal education moderated the
associations between both AND and PND and offspring depression. Analyses used
continuous exposure variables and compared models with and without interaction terms,
testing moderation effects of maternal education using likelihood ratio tests.
Paternal depression
We investigated the association between paternal AND and PND with offspring depression
at 18 and whether any effects were moderated by paternal education.

For the sample with complete exposure measures (n=8937), the mean maternal depression
score was 6.7 (s.d 4.7, range 0 to 29) antenatally and 5.5 (s.d 4.4, range 0 to 27) postnatally.
Measures of maternal depression were highly correlated with each other (correlations
ranging from 0.6 to 0.7). The number of women who exceeded thresholds for depression
antenatally (mean scores of >12 across the 2 antenatal time-points) was 1,034 (12%); and
postnatally was 664 (7 %). Associations between AND and PND with socio-demographic
confounding variables are given in eResults 1.
At 18 years, 4566 adolescents completed the CIS-R. A primary diagnosis of ICD-10
depression was given for 360 (8%): 3374 mothers of these adolescents had provided data on
all measures of depression during the antenatal and postnatal period and 3335 also had
maternal education data. Characteristics for the sample with complete CIS-R outcome and
maternal depression data compared to the rest of the ALSPAC sample are given in etable 1.
MAIN & INDEPENDENT EFFECTS
The univariable results provide evidence for main effects of both AND and PND scores on
offspring depression (Table 1, model 1). These results were replicated using binary EPDS
variables, derived using the clinical threshold > 12 (for AND: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.2,
p=0.047; for PND: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6, p=0.026). Both associations were
independent of later depression (model 2). There was little evidence that the association with
AND was subject to confounding by socio-demographic variables. However, the association
with PND was reduced once these variables were included (model 3). The association
between AND and offspring depression remained after including PND in the same model. In
contrast, the association with PND was substantially reduced once AND was included
(model 4). It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these results because the correlation
between AND and PND could result in over-adjustment34. Taking account of AND by
excluding women with antenatal depression diminished the association to a lesser extent
(model 5). There was no evidence for an interaction between AND and PND on adolescent
depression (p=0.32).
Results were comparable when using imputed data sets; main effect (model 1) of AND (OR
1.36 [95% CI 1.18 to 1.56] p<0.0001) and PND (OR 1.29 [95% CI 1.12 to 1.49] p=0.001).
Imputed data sets were used to investigate the impact of future episodes of maternal
depression. The number of episodes was associated with an increased risk of offspring
depression (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22, p=0.012). However, adjusting for this did not
diminish the effects of either AND (adjusted OR 1.30 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.55, p=0.001) or
PND (adjusted OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.45, p=0.012).
HEIGHTENED RISK
The intercepts of mothers’ depression trajectories from the antenatal to postnatal period
were positively associated with risk of offspring depression at 18; the OR for offspring
depression for a 5 point increase in initial depression scores was 1.58 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1).
However, the model did not provide evidence for an effect of change in maternal depression
from the antenatal to postnatal period, suggesting no difference in the magnitude of risk
associated with AND and PND. The OR for offspring depression for each 5 point reduction
in EPDS scores across periods was 0.77 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.8). Results were comparable after
accounting for missing data.
MODERATING EFFECTS
There was evidence for an interaction between PND and maternal education but no evidence
for an interaction between AND and maternal education (see table 2). Stratified analyses
Pearson et al.
Page 6
JAMA Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 February 20.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

provided evidence that the effect of PND was limited to mothers with lower education. In
contrast the effects of AND were present in mothers with both high and low education.
Sensitivity analyses using another SES indicator (income) found similar patterns of
moderation (results available on request). Results were comparable after imputing for
missing data. This pattern of moderation was replicated using a different approach,
investigating moderation of AND and PND in combined model (see eResults 2 and eTable
2).
PATERNAL DEPRESSION
There was no evidence for an association between paternal AND and offspring depression
(OR for a 5 point increase in EPDS score; 0.9 [95% CI 0.7 to 1.1], p=0.187) or that this
effect was moderated by paternal education (depression*education interaction p=0.742). In
contrast, there was evidence for an association between paternal PND and offspring
depression, however, this was limited to offspring of fathers with low education (low
education; OR 1.5 [1.1 to 2.0]; high education: OR 1.0 [0.7 to 1.3], depression*education
interaction p=0.048). Effects were comparable using imputed data.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the relative effects of depressive symptoms
antenatally and postnatally on offspring depression at 18. Initial analyses provided evidence
for associations between both AND and PND and adolescent depression, and these
associations remained after adjusting for later maternal depression. The unadjusted effects of
AND and PND did not suggest differences in the magnitude of risk to the offspring.
However, after taking account of PND and adjusting for other confounders AND remained
an independent predictor of outcome while the effect of PND (taking account of
confounding variables and AND) was considerably weakened. Moderation analyses
indicated that the effects of PND were moderated by maternal education, with only the
offspring of mothers with lower education showing increased risk of adolescent depression,
while adolescents whose mothers had higher education appeared unaffected. This
moderation by maternal education helps to explain the diminished overall postnatal effect
once maternal education was adjusted for. There was no evidence that antenatal effects were
moderated in this way. Paternal AND was not associated with offspring depression. In
contrast, paternal PND was associated with offspring depression, but this was limited to
those whose fathers had low education.
MECHANISMS
This study does not directly test the mechanisms of transmission of depression from mother
to adolescent. However, the findings of the moderation analyses and comparison of the
effects of paternal depression with maternal depression provide indirect evidence that the
pathways from AND and PND are different. Differential moderation of the effects of AND
and PND indicates that an important part of the pathway from maternal AND to adolescent
depression does not operate through AND continuing in to the postnatal period. Rather it
indicates the operation of a separate pathway. Furthermore, evidence that the antenatal, but
not the postnatal, effect was unique to mothers, further suggests different pathways.
Given that education is associated with several key environmental factors 13 and that
education moderated the effects of PND, this is consistent with an environmental
mechanism. Maternal education indicates multiple sources of psycho-social support (for
example, mothers with more education were more likely to use non-maternal childcare) and
positive home environments, particularly more positive and sensitive parenting 3;12, which
in turn are likely to be protective in the context of depression 35;36.
Pearson et al.

In contrast, the absence of any moderation by education antenatally is consistent with the
effects of AND operating through the biological consequences of depression in utero which
are unlikely to be mitigated by education and associated environmental advantages. This is
further supported by the absence of any effect of paternal AND on offspring outcome. To
directly test this hypothesis, future studies could measure indices of the dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocorticol axis such as cortisol or catecholamines, as well as
other physiological parameters antenatally 37. It is also important to note that due to the high
correlation between AND and PND, overall effects of AND include both timing-specific
effects and the effects of AND continuing postnatally.
It also remains possible that part of the intergenerational transmission of depression, both in
the antenatal and postnatal periods, reflects shared genetic risk 32;35. The current findings
suggest that any shared genetic risk associated with PND, but not AND, may be related to
maternal education.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS
The strengths of this study include the large sample, the long-term follow up, the repeated
measures of maternal depression and the availability of confounding and moderating
variables. As maternal depression was first measured 18 years earlier than the measure of
child depression, reverse causality is implausible.
There were a number of limitations of the study. Adolescents who attended the 18 year
assessment were more likely to come from families of higher SES than those in the original
sample. Although we cannot fully explain the role of selective attrition, the pattern of
missing data and analyses post imputation suggests that if anything attrition has led to an
underestimation of the size of the associations between maternal and offspring depression.
A further limitation was the lack of a measure of maternal depression when the child was 18.
However, we adjusted for maternal depression in early adolescence and this had little impact
on the effects of AND or PND. Furthermore, any effect would be common to both AND and
PND. There is no reason to believe later maternal depression would explain the differential
effects observed. It is also important to note that the maternal depression measure was a self-
report rather than a diagnostic interview. Importantly a clinical interview was used for the
offspring outcome.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, this study provides evidence that the risks associated with AND and PND are
different: AND is an independent risk factor for offspring depression whilst PND may only
be a risk factor in disadvantaged families. The findings have important implications for the
nature and timing of interventions aimed at preventing depression in the offspring of
depressed mothers. In particular, the findings suggest that treating depression in pregnancy,
irrespective of background, may be most effective. However, the association between PND
and risk of offspring depression appears to be greatest for children whose mothers have
lower education. Hence, there may be benefit in prioritising support of more disadvantaged
mothers. Further work is needed to understand why offspring of postnatally depressed
mothers from low education are particularly at risk.

FIGURE 2.
A: Predicted probability of offspring depression at 18 according to maternal depression
score during pregnancy, stratified by maternal education for the sample with exposures and
outcomes n=3335. B: as 1A with the exclusion of women who exceeded thresholds for
depression after birth n=3138. Antenatal depression is strongly correlated with postnatal
depression. Therefore, some of the effect of antenatal depression on child depression will be
mediated through a postnatal depression pathway. This indirect pathway from antenatal
depression would be moderated by education. As can be seen in figure 1B exclusion of
women with postnatal depression reduced any residual moderating effects on the association
between antenatal depression and child depression.
