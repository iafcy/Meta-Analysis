hyperactivity (ADH) problems. Prevalence rates did not 
differ between mothers and fathers. Parent–offspring asso-
ciations did not differ between girls and boys. Maternal 
anxiety was associated with all offspring problem scores. 
In addition, maternal ADH problems were associated with 
offspring ADH problems. Paternal anxiety and ADH prob-
lems scores were specifically associated with offspring 
internalizing and externalizing problem scores, respec-
tively. Associations with offspring psychopathology were 
of similar magnitude for mothers and fathers and were not 
influenced by spousal resemblance. Our study shows that 
both fathers and mothers are at increased risk for psychi-
atric problems at the time of a child’s evaluation and that 
their problems are equally associated with their offspring 
problems. The results emphasize the need to screen moth-
ers as well as fathers for psychiatric problems. Specific 
treatment programs should be developed for these families 
in especially high need.

Introduction
It is well established that psychiatric disorders run in fami-
lies. Moreover, the increased risk for psychopathology 
in parents or children is not confined to the disorder of, 
respectively, the children or the parents, but also extends to 
other disorders [1, 2]. These findings were mostly observed 
using a lifetime history of psychiatric illness approach. 
However, since ongoing psychopathology in parents can 
influence the course and treatment outcome of psycho-
pathology in children [3–7], knowledge about parental 
Abstract  Knowledge is lacking regarding current psy-
chopathology in parents whose children are evaluated in 
a psychiatric outpatient clinic. This especially accounts 
for fathers. We provide insight into the prevalence rates of 
parental psychopathology and the association with their 
offspring psychopathology by analyzing data on psychiat-
ric problems collected in 701 mothers and 530 fathers of 
757 referred children. Prevalence rates of parental psycho-
pathology were based on (sub)clinical scores on the adult 
self report. Parent–offspring associations were investigated 
in multivariate analyses taking into account co-morbidity. 
Around 20 % of the parents had a (sub)clinical score on 
internalizing problems and around 10 % on attention deficit

psychiatric problems at the time a child is suffering from a 
psychiatric disorder is also important.
So far, it has been shown that parents whose children 
are evaluated for psychiatric disorders at a child and ado-
lescent psychiatric outpatient clinic, are at higher risk for 
internalizing problems and disorders, such as anxiety and 
depression. Prevalence rates range from 18 to 68 % [8–17]. 
Far less information is available on parental externalizing 
problems and disorders, such as attention deficit hyperac-
tivity disorder and antisocial personality disorder, but the 
risk also seems increased [8–10, 12].
Information on paternal psychopathology is further lack-
ing. In many of the former studies far fewer fathers than 
mothers were included and in four the data were restricted 
to mothers [9, 11, 12, 14]. Still, several studies have indi-
cated that paternal psychopathology is also associated with 
offspring psychopathology [18]. In addition, paternal psy-
chopathology may influence the association between mater-
nal and offspring symptoms due to spousal resemblance. 
Kim-Cohen et al. [19] found that the association between 
maternal depression and offspring externalizing problems 
was diminished, although still significant, when paternal 
antisocial personality disorder was included in the analysis. 
In contrast, Marmorstein et al. [20] observed no attenuation 
of the effects of either major depression in mothers or anti-
social personality in fathers on major depression and con-
duct disorder in their offspring.
Finally, the majority of these studies selected children 
with specific diagnoses, i.e., depression [9, 17], anxiety [8, 
11], or ADHD/conduct disorder (CD) [10, 14–16]. Given 
that family studies clearly indicate that the associations 
between family members are not confined to the disor-
ders of the probands, only an offspring population with a 
broad range of psychopathology provides good insight into 
the association between psychopathology of parents and 
children.
The current study provides prevalence rates of current 
psychiatric problems in mothers as well as fathers of chil-
dren suffering from various psychiatric disorders. In addi-
tion, the associations between parental and offspring prob-
lems in these families are reported. Internalizing as well as 
externalizing problem scales were assessed in a large sam-
ple of parents at the time of the first appointment of their 
child in a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic. 
Similar problem scales were measured in parents and chil-
dren. The associations between the parental and offspring 
problem scores were analyzed within and across the differ-
ent syndrome scales and the analyses were performed sepa-
rately for boys and girls. Finally, we investigated whether 
the maternal and paternal problems were independently 
associated with offspring problems or whether these asso-
ciations were partly explained by spousal resemblance for 
psychiatric problems.
Methods
Participants
Data have been collected in three child and adolescent out-
patient clinics in The Netherlands (two in Amsterdam and 
one in Rotterdam). In these clinics, parents already rated 
the children’s problems using the child behavior checklist 
(CBCL) [21] as part of the standard clinical procedure at 
the first assessment. Families with children aged between 
6 and 18 years were included. In Amsterdam, first, a pilot 
study was carried out to examine how many parents are 
at risk for a psychiatric disorder at the moment of the first 
assessment of their child at a child and adolescent psy-
chiatric outpatient clinic. Out of the 176 mothers and 122 
fathers of 191 children that completed the adult self report 
(ASR) [22], 38.2  % of the mothers and 31.5  % of the 
fathers scored in the (sub)clinical range on at least one of 
the syndrome scales. Consequently, assessment of parental 
problems and, if necessary, further assessment and subse-
quent treatment, became the standard procedure. The total 
Amsterdam sample consists of 363 mothers and 235 fathers 
from 389 families, after exclusion of 35 families without 
consent for the use of the data for research and of 26 non-
biological parents. The study was approved by the Central 
Ethics Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects 
of the VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam. In the 
Rotterdam outpatient clinic, data were collected as part of 
the standard clinical procedure from the start. If parents 
reported (sub)clinical problems, psychopathology was fur-
ther assessed, and, if necessary, parents were referred to 
adult mental health services. Data were available for 338 
mothers and 295 fathers from 368 families, after exclusion 
from 29 non-biological parents. Family response rates, i.e., 
the percentage of families in which at least one parental 
questionnaire was completed, were 70 % in the Amsterdam 
and 60 % in the Rotterdam samples. In total, data were ana-
lyzed from 701 mothers and 530 fathers from 757 families.
The most common diagnoses in children in the Amster-
dam and Rotterdam cohort were ADHD (40 and 30  %), 
autism spectrum disorders (18 and 26 %), behavioral dis-
orders (11 and 9 %), anxiety disorders (17 and 24 %) and 
depressive disorders (12 and 4 %). These disorders are not 
mutually exclusive, i.e., children can have more than one 
diagnosis. The parental scores in the Amsterdam and Rot-
terdam cohort did not differ for the ASR syndrome scales 
(Wesseldijk et al. submitted). The parents from the Amster-
dam cohort were on average 3 years older and higher edu-
cated (Wesseldijk et al. submitted). This latter difference is 
in line with the known regional differences in educational 
achievement in the Netherlands, with people in Rotterdam 
having on average a lower education than in Amsterdam 
[23]. The children in the Amsterdam cohort were also on

average 1.5 years older than the children in the Rotterdam 
dam cohort. Parental and offspring age and parental educa-
tion were included as covariates in the analyses.
Measures
Demographical information on age, sex and educational 
achievement was obtained from the questionnaire. Educa-
tional achievement was analyzed in three categories, i.e., 
low (at most lower secondary schooling), intermediate (at 
most higher secondary schooling) and high educational 
achievement.
Behavioral and emotional problems in parents and chil-
dren were measured with the age-appropriate version of 
the questionnaires belonging to the Achenbach system of 
empirically based assessment (ASEBA), i.e., the CBCL 
[21] and the ASR [24]. In both generations, the DSM-ori-
ented syndrome scales were analyzed. For the children, the 
depressive, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADH), 
oppositional defiant and conduct problem scales were 
included and for the parents depressive, anxiety, avoid-
ant personality, ADH, and antisocial personality problem 
scales.
For both the CBCL and the ASR, thresholds for (sub)
clinical scores for each sex are provided in the manual. The 
thresholds for the subclinical and clinical scores reflect the 
93rd and 97th percentile, respectively, in men and women 
of the general population.
Analyses
To investigate potential response bias, we analyzed 
whether the children’s scores differed according to the par-
ticipation of the parents. We made four groups of children 
for boys and girls: (1) none of the parents participated, (2) 
both parents participated, (3) father participated, and (4) 
mother participated. Differences in mean syndrome scale 
scores between the four groups were analyzed with an 
ANOVA.
Based on the thresholds provided in the manual, the 
prevalence rates of fathers and mothers with (sub)clinical 
scores were calculated for each scale. These prevalence 
rates give an indication of how many parents are likely to 
suffer from clinically relevant psychiatric symptoms.
All other analyses were carried out on the continu-
ous scores of the DSM-oriented scales so that all avail-
able information on individual variation was used. 
Pearson’s correlations between parental and offspring 
problem scores were calculated within and across syn-
drome scales. This was followed by a multivariate multi-
group analysis in Mplus in which the problem scores in 
boys and girls were predicted by the maternal problem 
scores or the paternal problem scores (see Fig. 1). First, 
the analyses were performed separately for girls and boys. 
Next, it was tested whether there were sex differences by 
constraining the beta’s to be equal over the sexes. In these 
analyses, we made optimal use of the available parental

data since measures from families in which only one 
parent participated were also included. However, these 
analyses do not take into account spousal resemblance 
for psychopathology, which has been detected in the cur-
rent sample with correlations varying between 0.13 and 
0.30 within and across the syndrome scales (Wesseldijk 
et  al. submitted). To investigate whether the effects of 
maternal and paternal psychopathology can be explained 
by spousal resemblance, we also tested a model in which 
both the maternal and paternal scores were included that 
had a marginally significant effect (p < 0.10) in the first 
analyses. If these effects remain similar in the order of 
magnitude and significance, spousal resemblance does 
not explain the association with childhood psychopathol-
ogy. Age from parents and children and parental educa-
tion were included as covariates.
Results
Descriptives of participants and prevalence rates 
of parental psychiatric problems
Children in our sample scored higher than children from a 
population-based sample [25] and their scores follow the 
well-known pattern of girls scoring higher on internalizing 
problems and boys on externalizing problems (Table  1). 
Table 2 shows the mean CBCL scores for the four possi-
ble response patterns in the families: (1) both parents, (2) 
mother, (3) father or (4) none of the parents completed the 
ASR. Children whose parents did not participate did not 
generally score higher than children of whom both parents 
participated. Only two of the ten analyses showed a sig-
nificant between group difference in mean scores, i.e., for

depressive and conduct problems in girls. This appeared 
to be due to the group of girls of whom only the mother 
completed the ASR. These girls scored higher than the girls 
in the other three groups. Further analyses comparing the 
families in which one or two parents completed the ASR 
revealed that factors associated with psychopathology were 
more prevalent in the families in which only the mother 
completed the ASR. These were more often broken or sin-
gle parent families (65 % compared to 37 % of the families 
in which the father completed the ASR and to 15 % in the 
families in which both parents completed the ASR) and the 
level of education of the mother was lower (43 % in the 
lowest category compared to 26 and 21 %).
Around 25 % of the parents had a (sub)clinical score on 
one of the analyzed scales (Table 2). A (sub)clinical score 
on depressive problems was most prevalent with 13  % 
of the fathers and 15 % of the mothers scoring above the 
threshold (Table 1). These rates are clearly higher than the 
rate of 7 % (sub)clinical scores in the general population 
on which the cut-offs are based [24]. The percentages are 
also higher for avoidant personality and ADH problems. 
In total, 20 % of the mothers and 18 % of the fathers had 
a (sub)clinical score on the internalizing scales anxiety, 
depressive or avoidant personality problems. There were no 
significant differences between mothers and fathers.
Parent–offspring associations
Table  3 shows the correlations between the parental and 
offspring problem scores, separately for girls and boys 
and mothers and fathers. Almost all parent–offspring cor-
relations were significant and ranged between 0.15 and 
0.25. A notable exception was anxiety problem scores in 
girls which were neither associated with paternal ADH nor 
with maternal and paternal antisocial personality problem 
scores. This was also seen in boys, but only for mater-
nal and not for paternal problem scores. Another notable 
exception was conduct problem scores in boys, which were 
not associated with any of the paternal internalizing prob-
lem scores.
Subsequently, we performed the multivariate analyses 
predicting the offspring scores by maternal or paternal 
problem scores. Constraining the regression coefficients to 
be equal for boys and girls revealed no significant differ-
ences in the effects of the maternal (p = 0.99) and paternal 
scores (p = 0.90) on childhood psychopathology.
The results of the multivariate analyses indicate that the 
significant correlations found in the univariate analyses 
are mainly due to the high with-in person correlations for 
the problem scores. It becomes clear from Table 4 that in 
the analyses of the maternal problem scores, anxiety was 
associated with all offspring psychopathology with larger 
effect sizes for childhood anxiety and depression (~0.20) 
than for the externalizing problem scores (~0.15). In addi-
tion, maternal ADH was associated with offspring ADH 
with an effect size of 0.20. In the analyses of the paternal 
problem scores, anxiety was also associated with child-
hood internalizing psychopathology (effect sizes ~0.20), 
but not with externalizing psychopathology. Paternal ADH 
was associated with childhood ADH and OD (effect sizes

~0.20). There were no significant associations with child-
hood conduct problems.
The multivariate analyses including the maternal and 
paternal problems scores with a p value below 0.10 did not 
show substantial differences in the results. This indicates 
that the predictions as found in the separate analyses of the 
maternal and paternal problem scores not due to spousal 
resemblance in psychiatric problems.
Discussion
This study shows that parents whose children suffer from 
a variety of psychopathology have a higher risk of experi-
encing depressive, avoidant personality, and ADH problems 
than adults in the general population. In contrast to what is 
found in epidemiological studies in the general population, 
prevalence rates did not differ between sexes, i.e., mothers 
and fathers were equally affected with internalizing and 
ADH problems. Regarding the parent–offspring associa-
tions in problem scores at the time of a child’s diagnostic 
evaluation in a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient 
clinic, the similarities over the sexes are striking. The asso-
ciations are not different for boys and girls and maternal 
problems are as associated with offspring problems as pater-
nal problems. The only difference is that maternal anxiety 
is associated with all childhood problem scores while pater-
nal anxiety is only associated with childhood internalizing 
problems. Childhood externalizing problems are associated 
with paternal ADH problems and childhood ADH problems 
are associated with maternal ADH problems.
Overall, our results indicate the usefulness of screen-
ing parents on psychopathology when their child is evalu-
ated at a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic. 
For mothers, this screening should focus on internalizing 
problems, irrespective of the offspring psychopathology, 
and on ADH problems when the child experiences ADH 
problems. For fathers, the focus should be on internaliz-
ing problems when children are presented with internal-
izing problems and on ADH problems when children are 
presented with externalizing problems. Treatment pro-
grams should be developed specifically focused on these 
multiple affected families. The similarities in the results of 
mothers and fathers, both for the prevalence rates and for 
the associations with the offspring problems indicate the 
need to include fathers in such a screening and subsequent 
treatment.
Prevalence rates
The higher rates of (sub)clinical scores on the internaliz-
ing syndrome scales in fathers and mothers (20 %) are in 
line with other studies investigating current symptoms at 
the time of the first assessment of a child in an outpatient 
psychiatric clinic, although the percentages observed in the 
current study are somewhat lower compared to the previ-
ous studies [8–17]. In addition, we found that parents of 
children with psychopathology have a higher prevalence 
rate of (sub)clinical ADH problems, as suggested by one 
other study in mothers [16]. The equal rates of (sub)clinical 
scores on antisocial personality problems in comparison to 
the general population are in contrast to one earlier study

investigating parental antisocial personality [10]. The lack 
of increased antisocial personality problems and the some-
what lower percentages of internalizing problems may be 
related to the sample of children in which the data were 
collected. Most of the previous studies selected children 
based on one or two diagnoses, i.e., depression, or ADHD 
and/or conduct disorder. In the study showing higher rates 
of antisocial personality disorder in parents, for example, 
this was only true for children with conduct disorder with 
or without ADHD and not for children with only ADHD. 
Only two studies included children with a broad range of 
psychopathology, just as in the current study [12, 13]. The 
prevalence rate for parental internalizing disorders was 
comparable to ours in one study (18 %), but a lot higher 
(57 %) in the other study. Part of the difference with the 
latter study could be due to the demographic characteristics 
of the included parents. The sample of the study with simi-
lar estimates to ours is more comparable regarding socio-
economic status and age of the parents. Future studies col-
lecting data in families of children evaluated in a general 
child and adolescent outpatient clinic may shed more light 
on these large differences and identify which parents are 
especially at risk for psychopathology.
Parent–offspring associations in problem scores
The specificity observed in the father-offspring associations 
and the lack of associations with maternal externalizing 
problem scores may seem in contrast to large family stud-
ies which indicate that children of parents with psychopa-
thology are not only at risk for the disorder of the parent, 
but for a broad range of disorders and vice versa [1, 2]. One 
of these studies did not take the frequent co-morbidity of 
psychiatric disorders into account [1] which can result in 
significant correlations across disorders as illustrated by the 
many significant correlations in the univariate analyses in 
the current study. Three other important differences are that 
these family studies (1) investigated lifetime disorders in 
(2) population-based samples and (3) did not stratify their 
analyses by sex [1, 2]. The differences with the current 
results are therefore difficult to interpret.
The strength of the predictions of the offspring problem 
scores was similar for the paternal and the maternal prob-
lem scores (effect sizes ~0.20) and were not attenuated in 
the analyses including the problem scores of both parents 
simultaneously. This indicates that psychopathology in 
fathers and mothers are equally associated with offspring 
psychopathology agreeing with previous findings as sum-
marized in a review on the influence of paternal psycho-
pathology on their offspring [18]. By simultaneously ana-
lyzing the predictions of offspring scores by maternal and 
paternal problem scores, we also showed that the contri-
butions of the parents are independent of each other, thus 
not due to spousal resemblance which is also present in the 
current study population [correlations within and across 
syndrome scales varying between 0.13 and 0.30 (Wes-
seldijk et al. submitted manuscript)]. This has already been 
suggested before by studies focusing on depression and/or 
antisocial personality [19, 20, 26]. These results underline 
the importance of involving fathers in research.
Limitations
A few limitations should be kept in mind. Although this 
sample has one of the largest numbers of fathers included, 
the participation rate in fathers was still lower than in 
mothers. Our non-response analyses suggested that fami-
lies in which only the mothers participated were exposed 
to less favorable circumstances than the families in which 
both parents or only the father participated. This pattern 
of partly non-response in the fathers could have led to an 
underestimation of the prevalence rates for psychopathol-
ogy in fathers. It should still be kept in mind that part of 
these families are single parent families who are known to 
be at higher risk for adverse events.
It could be considered a limitation that all problem 
scores were based on parental ratings, either of the child 
(CBCL) or of the parents (ASR), and not on a more objec-
tive measure, such as clinical diagnosis. However, both the 
CBCL and the ASR problem scores are associated with 
psychiatric diagnoses. This has been repeatedly demon-
strated for the CBCL (see, e.g., [27, 28]). Further, a study 
in a subsample of the parents with a (sub)clinical score has 
shown that 71 and 74 % of, respectively, these fathers and 
mothers have a lifetime psychiatric mood or anxiety dis-
order according to the composite international diagnostic 
interview (CIDI) [29] or ADHD according to the Conners’ 
Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) [30]. The advantage 
of analyzing continuous scores is that they capture more 
information on the individual variation in the presence of 
psychiatric problems. This signifies that, for example, sub-
clinical comorbid symptoms that do not fulfill the crite-
ria for a DSM-IV diagnosis are reflected in a higher than 
average problem score. A strength is that the CBCL and 
the ASR are specifically designed to measure similar con-
structs over ages, which make them particularly suitable for 
studying associations between children and parents.
The disadvantage of having one parental measure, 
instead of two, of the child’s psychopathology is that it has 
been suggested that parental problems can influence the 
ratings of their child’s problems. In 75 % of the cases, the 
questionnaire was rated by the mother. Studies investigat-
ing the influence of parental mood symptoms on the assess-
ment of their children yielded discrepant results (see [31] 
for an overview). Overall, it is probably safest to say that 
parental mood symptoms may increase the parental report

of children’s problems, but only to a small extent. Our find-
ing that the association between paternal psychopathology 
and offspring psychopathology is of similar magnitude as 
the association with maternal psychopathology suggests 
that shared measurement variance is not of major influence 
to our results.
It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the 
mechanisms underlying the association between parental 
and offspring problems. Twin studies have shown that dif-
ferences in the susceptibility for psychiatric disorders or 
traits are substantially explained by genetic factors with 
an average heritability of 46 % [32]. For childhood pheno-
types, in contrast to adult phenotypes, an effect of the shared 
familial environment has also been found with estimates 
ranging from 10 to 30 % in meta-analyses of several meas-
ures of internalizing and externalizing problems [33]. For 
ADHD and related traits, shared environmental influences 
are consistently found to be absent [33]. Thus, in general, 
transmission of psychopathology from parents to children 
can go through genetic as well as environmental factors. 
Other study designs, such as adoption studies or extended 
twin designs (including parents of the twins or children of 
the twins) can further disentangle to what extent the asso-
ciation between parental and offspring psychopathology is 
due to genetic or environmental effects. A review of chil-
dren-of twins studies indicates that both effects can play a 
role, depending on the phenotype under investigation [34].
Our findings also do not imply a direction of effect, i.e., 
the association between parental and offspring problems is 
not necessarily entirely explained by the transmission of 
problems from parents to children. It has been shown that a 
successful depression treatment in mothers also results in a 
decrease of psychiatric problems in children [7]. However, 
the reverse has also been found, mothers whose daughters 
were treated for depression also showed an improvement 
of their depressive symptoms [35]. It should be noted that 
still a large group of children and mothers had continuing 
symptoms despite treatment of the mothers or daughters. 
Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate in which fami-
lies it is sufficient to only treat the admitted patient and in 
which families, all affected members should be treated at 
once.
Future steps
This study confirms that part of the families seen in a child 
and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic is in especially 
high need as not only the child, but also one or both par-
ents are affected. Future studies, involving both mothers 
and fathers, are warranted to further investigate the asso-
ciations between parent and offspring problems, not only 
concurrently, but also longitudinally, and to develop spe-
cific treatment programs for these families. The question 
also arises what the prevalence rates are of psychiatric 
problems in children whose parents are evaluated in a psy-
chiatric outpatient clinic. There have been several family 
studies investigating offspring psychopathology in parents 
with psychopathology. However, these mainly focused on 
lifetime disorders in the offspring [36]. Knowledge is lack-
ing regarding current psychopathology at the time a parent 
is evaluated for a psychiatric disorder. A study similar to 
ours, but performed in an adult psychiatric outpatient clinic 
and focusing on the current problems of the children can 
indicate for which disorders these children are at risk and 
inform further treatment studies.
