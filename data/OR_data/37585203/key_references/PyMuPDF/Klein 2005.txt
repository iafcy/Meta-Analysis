ABSTRACT
Background. There is a large literature indicating that the oﬀspring of mothers with Major
Depressive Disorder (MDD) are at increased risk for depression. However, much less is known
about the eﬀects of paternal MDD on oﬀspring psychopathology.
Method. We addressed this issue using a large community sample of parents and their adolescent
and young adult oﬀspring (n=775). Parents and oﬀspring were independently assessed with semi-
structured diagnostic interviews. Oﬀspring were interviewed three times from mid-adolescence to
age 24 years.
Results. Maternal MDD was signiﬁcantly associated with oﬀspring MDD. Paternal MDD was also
signiﬁcantly associated with MDD in oﬀspring, but only among oﬀspring with depressive episodes
of moderate or greater severity. These eﬀects persisted after controlling for socio-economic status,
family intactness, and non-mood disorders in both parents. Rates of MDD were particularly elev-
ated in oﬀspring of mothers and fathers with early-onset MDD, and oﬀspring of fathers with
recurrent MDD. The magnitude of the associations between MDD in parents and oﬀspring was
generally in the small-to-medium range.
Conclusions. These results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings of elevated risk of MDD in the oﬀspring of
depressed mothers. In addition, the results suggest that MDD in fathers is associated with increased
risk of depression in oﬀspring, but that it is limited to MDD episodes in oﬀspring of moderate or
greater severity.
INTRODUCTION
Numerous studies have reported that the school-
aged, adolescent, and young adult oﬀspring
of mothers with Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) exhibit elevated rates of MDD, as well
as a variety of non-mood disorders (Weissman
et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998; Goodman &
Gotlib, 1999). However, few data are available
on the risk of MDD and other forms of psycho-
pathology in the oﬀspring of depressed fathers.
This is probably due to the higher prevalence of
depression in women, the greater diﬃculty in
recruiting fathers for research, and the assump-
tion that mothers generally have a larger impact
on children due to their greater role in child-
rearing (Phares, 2002).
The few studies that have examined the risk
for MDD in oﬀspring of depressed fathers
have produced inconsistent results. Thus, some
studies have reported elevated rates of MDD in
oﬀspring of depressed fathers compared to oﬀ-
spring of controls (e.g. Orvaschel et al. 1988;
Nomura et al. 2001), but other studies have
failed to ﬁnd diﬀerences (e.g. Keller et al. 1986).

Most of this literature has relied on clinical
samples, which are not representative of de-
pression in the community (Costello, 1993).
Moreover, because women are more likely to
seek treatment fordepression than men(Moeller-
Leimkuehler, 2002), there may be even greater
bias in clinical samples of depressed fathers than
clinical samples of depressed mothers.
We are aware of only two studies that have
examined rates of MDD in both depressed
mothers and depressed fathers using large com-
munity samples. Lieb et al. (2002) reported that
both maternal MDD and paternal MDD were
associated with increased rates of MDD in
adolescent and young adult oﬀspring. A limi-
tation of this study, however, is that it relied
entirely on oﬀspring reports of parental psy-
chopathology for the older (age 18–24 years)
half of the sample, and conducted direct inter-
views with only one parent (generally the
mother) for the younger (age 14–17 years) half
of the sample. In contrast, Brennan et al. (2002)
found that maternal depression (MDD or dys-
thymia), but not paternal depression was as-
sociated with depression in oﬀspring. However,
Brennan et al.’s (2002) sample was limited to
families that were intact or where the oﬀspring
had substantial contact with the father, which
may have excluded some of the fathers with the
most signiﬁcant psychopathology. Moreover,
Brennan et al. (2002) included both biological
fathers and stepfathers in their sample.
A number of studies have also suggested that
particular characteristics of parental MDD, such
as severity, chronicity, recurrence, and early age
of onset, are associated with particularly elev-
ated risks in oﬀspring (Keller et al. 1986; Klein
et al. 1988; Warner et al. 1995; Hammen &
Brennan, 2003). However, most of these studies
have been limited to depressed mothers or have
combined depressed mothers and fathers. Hence,
it is not clear whether these ﬁndings apply to
paternal MDD or only to maternal MDD.
The present paper uses data from the Oregon
Adolescent Depression Project (OADP; Lewin-
sohn et al. 1993) to examine the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and rates
of psychopathology in their adolescent and
young adult oﬀspring in a large community
sample. In addition, we explored the associations
between the clinical features of maternal and
paternal MDD and rates of MDD in oﬀspring.
In previous papers from the OADP we re-
ported the results of a bottom-up family study
of the ﬁrst-degree relatives of the depressed and
non-depressed adolescents (Klein et al. 2001,
2002). This article extends our previous papers
by presenting a top-down high-risk study of
depressed and non-depressed parents, examining
psychopathology in the adolescent oﬀspring,
who have now been followed into early adult-
hood. Although top-down and bottom-up de-
signs are closely related, they can yield diﬀerent
results, as the groups of oﬀspring of depressed
parents and youngsters with depression exhibit
only partial overlap. This article also diﬀers
from our previous papers in that we focus ex-
clusively on parents rather than using all ﬁrst-
degree relatives, take the temporal relationship
between the onset of parent and oﬀspring
disorders into account, and include data on
oﬀspring through age 24 years.

senior high schools in western Oregon. A total
of 1709 adolescents (ages 14–18 years; mean age
16.6,
S.D.=1.2)
completed
the
initial
(T1)
assessments between 1987 and 1989. The par-
ticipation rate at T1 was 61%. Approximately 1
year later, 1507 of the adolescents (88%)
returned for a second evaluation (T2). Several
checks were conducted to assess the representa-
tiveness of the sample (see Lewinsohn et al. 1993
for details). Brieﬂy, adolescents who did and did
not participate in the T1 assessment were similar
on intactness of the family and family size, but
participants were more likely to be female, in a
higher grade, and their parental socio-economic
status was higher than non-participants. Of the
adolescents who participated in the T1 assess-
ment, those who also participated at T2 were
more likely to be female, came from larger
families, had a higher parental socio-economic
status, and were less likely to have had a T1
diagnosis of a disruptive behavior disorder, and,
for males only, a T1 substance use disorder,
compared to those who did not participate at
T2. However, among T1 participants, those who
did and did not participate at T2 were similar on
race, grade level, and all other T1 current and
lifetime diagnoses.
At age 24 years, all adolescents with a history
of MDD through T2 (n=360) or a history of
non-mood disorders through T2 (n=284), and a
random sample of adolescents with no lifetime
history of psychopathology through T2 (n=
457) were invited to participate in a third (T3)
evaluation. All non-white T2 participants were
retained in the T3 sample to maximize ethnic
diversity. Of the 1101 T2 participants selected
for a T3 interview, 941 (85%) completed the age
24 evaluation. The T2 diagnostic groups did not
diﬀer on the rate of participation at T3.
Parents
We assessed lifetime psychopathology in the
biological parents of the OADP participants in
the T3 evaluation. To supplement the direct in-
terviews and to ensure that at least some data
were available for parents who could not be di-
rectly interviewed, informant data were obtained
from the OADP participants, and, when parents
were not available for direct interview, from a
second informant (generally the co-parent or a
sibling). Of the 1101 oﬀspring selected for a T3
interview, diagnostic information on at least one
biological parent was available for 837 (76%),
including 837 mothers and 819 fathers. Of the
941 oﬀspring with T3 data, parent diagnostic
data were available for 801 (85%). In addition,
there were 36 oﬀspring with parent diagnostic
information who did not complete a T3 evalu-
ation. For these participants, oﬀspring data
were only available through T2.
Oﬀspring diagnoses were based on DSM-III-
R criteria (APA, 1987). Parent diagnoses were
based on DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994). All
oﬀspring with data on at least one parent were
included in this report except for oﬀspring of
parents with a history of a non-aﬀective psy-
chotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or dysthymic
disorder with no lifetime history of MDD
(n=62).
Only one child (the original OADP partici-
pant) per set of parents was included in the
analyses. Although we also have diagnostic data
on most siblings of the OADP participants,
these data were collected at only one point
in time using a diﬀerent diagnostic interview,
and the siblings had a wide range of ages.
Hence, siblings were not included in the present
report.
This article included data on 775 mothers, 758
fathers, and 775 oﬀspring. Direct interviews
were obtained from all of the oﬀspring, 74.6%
of the mothers and 46.4% of the fathers. Of the
parents who were not directly interviewed, we
obtained family history data from two or more
informants for 40.6% of the mothers and
66.5% of the fathers.
Diagnostic assessments
Oﬀspring
At T1, oﬀspring were interviewed with a version
of the Schedule for Aﬀective Disorders and
Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-
SADS; Orvaschel et al. 1982), which combined
features of the Epidemiologic and Present
Episode
versions,
and
included
additional
items to derive DSM-III-R diagnoses. At T2
and T3, oﬀspring were interviewed using the
Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation
(LIFE; Keller et al. 1987), which elicited de-
tailed information about the onset and course of
psychiatric disorders since the previous evalu-
ation. In the present paper, oﬀspring diagnoses

interviews through the last available follow-up
(which, in almost all cases, was T3).
To assess inter-rater reliability, independent
raters reviewed audiotapes of a random sample
of interviews (n’s ranged from 166 to 233). The
reliability of lifetime diagnoses was fair to ex-
cellent for MDD [Kappa (k) for T1, T2, and T3
was 0.86, 0.75, and 0.86 respectively], any anxiety
disorder (k for T1, T2, and T3 was 0.53, 0.66,
and 0.84 respectively), and any substance use
disorder (k for T1, T2, and T3 was 0.89, 0.84,
and 0.81 respectively).
Parents
Parents were interviewed using the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders,
Non-Patient Version (SCID-NP; First et al.
1996). All interviews were conducted without
knowledge of the oﬀspring’s diagnoses. Indepen-
dent raters reviewed audiotapes of 184 randomly
selected interviews. The inter-rater reliability of
lifetime diagnoses were excellent for MDD
(k=0.94),
any
anxiety
disorder
(k=0.90),
alcohol abuse/dependence (k=0.86), and drug
abuse/dependence (k=0.89).
Family history data were collected using the
Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC;
Mannuzza & Fyer, 1990), supplemented with all
items necessary to derive DSM-IV diagnoses.
Independent
raters
reviewed
audiotapes
of
242 randomly selected informant interviews.
The inter-rater reliability of lifetime diagnoses
were good to excellent for MDD (k=0.90),
any anxiety disorder (k=0.77), alcohol abuse/
dependence (k=0.90), and drug abuse/depen-
dence (k=0.82).
We examined the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of
informants’ reports by comparing FISC diag-
noses to SCID diagnoses for parents who had
both sources of data available. Sensitivity varied
according to the informant and target, but
speciﬁcity was consistently acceptable. With the
index oﬀspring as the informant, sensitivity and
speciﬁcity for MDD in mothers (n=523) was
0.45 and 0.85 respectively; sensitivity and speci-
ﬁcity for MDD in fathers (n=316) was 0.32 and
0.90 respectively. With another family member
as the informant, sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
MDD in mothers (n=59) was 0.30 and 0.80
respectively; sensitivity and speciﬁcity for MDD
in fathers (n=40) was 0.66 and 0.82 respectively.
The greater sensitivity of oﬀspring reports of
maternal than paternal MDD probably reﬂects
children’s greater contact with, and knowledge
of, their mothers than their fathers. The high
sensitivity of other family members’ reports of
paternal MDD probably reﬂects the fact that
the other family member informant was gener-
ally the mother, and mothers tend to have the
best knowledge of family members (Cohen,
1988).
Consistent with previous research (Kendler
et al. 1991; Chapman et al. 1994), sensitivity was
somewhat higher and speciﬁcity was somewhat
lower for informants who themselves had psy-
chopathology. For example, the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of oﬀspring reports of maternal
MDD (n=258) was 0.54 and 0.75 respectively,
for oﬀspring with a history of MDD themselves.
For oﬀspring with no lifetime history of MDD,
the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of oﬀspring reports
of maternal MDD (n=265) was 0.34 and 0.95
respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity and speci-
ﬁcity of oﬀspring reports of paternal MDD was
0.38 and 0.83 (n=144) for oﬀspring with a his-
tory of MDD, and 0.24 and 0.96 (n=172) for
oﬀspring with no lifetime history of MDD.
Finally, the correlations between informants’
reports of the age of onset of MDD on the FISC
and parents’ reports of age of onset of MDD on
the SCID for cases in which both the parent and
informant agreed on the presence of MDD were
0.43 for mothers (n=77, p<0.001) and 0.47 for
fathers (n=26, p<0.05).
As data were available from multiple in-
formants for most parents, we derived lifetime
DSM-IV diagnoses for the parents using the
‘best-estimate’ procedure (Leckman et al. 1982).
Two diagnosticians, from a team of four senior
clinicians, independently reviewed all infor-
mation from the SCIDs and FISCs without
knowledge of oﬀspring diagnoses, and made
best-estimate diagnoses for the parents using
the guidelines in Klein et al. (1994). The diag-
nosticians’ conclusions were then compared,
and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Inter-rater reliability of the independently de-
rived best-estimate diagnoses prior to the resol-
ution of discrepancies was excellent for MDD
(k=0.91),
any
anxiety
disorder
(k=0.94),
alcohol abuse/dependence (k=0.97), and drug
abuse/dependence (k=0.96).
Oﬀspring interviews at T3 and interviews with
relatives and informants were conducted by

telephone, which generally yields comparable
results to face-to-face interviews (Sobin et al.
1993; Rohde et al. 1997). Most of the inter-
viewers had advanced degrees in clinical or
counseling psychology or social work, and
several years of clinical experience. All inter-
viewers were trained in the use of the diagnostic
instruments and completed a minimum of
two supervised training interviews, achieving
k=0.80 or better for concordance between
their symptom ratings and those of the super-
visor.
Other diagnostic issues
As discussed below, the lifetime prevalence of
MDD through age 24 years in the OADP ado-
lescents and young adults was higher than an-
ticipated, probably due to the study’s intensive
surveillance (three comprehensive diagnostic
evaluations between mid-adolescence and early
adulthood). Thus, it is likely that many of the
MDD episodes that we detected were relatively
mild and transient (despite meeting full criteria
for MDD). In light of this possibility, we chose
to supplement DSM-III-R criteria for MDD
with a second, higher threshold, deﬁnition of
caseness that required at least a moderate
level of symptom severity and/or impairment.
Oﬀspring with only mild episodes of MDD were
counted as non-cases. Severity of MDD epi-
sodes in oﬀspring was coded using the DSM-III-
R/DSM-IV severity speciﬁers. Among oﬀspring
with a history of DSM-III-R MDD, the inter-
rater reliability for the distinction between mild
versus moderate, severe, or with psychotic fea-
tures was k=0.46 (n=213).
The clinical features of depression in parents,
derived using the best-estimate procedure, in-
cluded: (1) severity of depressive symptoms,
also assessed using the DSM-IV severity speci-
ﬁers and coded as mild versus moderate, severe,
or with psychotic features; (2) recurrent versus
single episode; (3) chronic, deﬁned as an episode
lasting at least 2 years or a history of dysthymic
disorder; and (4) age of onset, which, following
Weissman et al. (1984), we dichotomized into
f20 years versus 21 years or older. The results
were similar, but not quite as strong, using age
30 as the cut-oﬀ. Inter-rater reliability was
k=0.81 for severity; k=0.72 for recurrent;
k=0.57 for chronic; and k=0.81 for early-onset
(n’s ranged from 175–183).
For both oﬀspring and parents, the following
speciﬁc anxiety disorders were included in
deriving the category of any anxiety disorder:
panic disorder, agoraphobia without a history
of panic disorder, social phobia, simple/speciﬁc
phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, gen-
eralized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise
speciﬁed. For oﬀspring, diagnoses (assessed at
T1 and T2 only) of separation anxiety disorder,
overanxious disorder, and avoidant disorder of
childhood/adolescence were also included. The
following speciﬁc substance use disorders were
included in the any substance use disorder cate-
gory: alcohol abuse or dependence, sedative-
hypnotic-anxiolytic abuse or dependence, can-
nabis abuse or dependence, stimulant abuse or
dependence, opioid abuse or dependence, co-
caine abuse or dependence, hallucinogen/PCP
abuse or dependence, and polydrug dependence.
For oﬀspring and parents with multiple anxiety
or substance use disorders, the age of onset was
coded as the earliest condition in that group of
disorders.
To ensure that the temporal direction of the
associations between parental and oﬀspring
psychopathology was unambiguous, the onset
of the disorders in the parent that were included
as independent variables in any given analysis
had to have preceded the onset of the disorder in
their oﬀspring that served as the dependent
variable (if the oﬀspring had experienced that
disorder). In addition, we only considered
parents to have a disorder if the onset was prior
to the T1 assessment. If the parental disorder
ﬁrst appeared after the oﬀspring had developed
the disorder in the analysis or after the oﬀspring
entered the study at T1, it was considered
absent. This is a conservative approach that
should slightly attenuate the associations be-
tween parent and oﬀspring psychopathology.
Data analysis
Caucasian OADP participants with no history
of psychopathology through T2 were under-
sampled in the T3 follow-up, hence in all stat-
istical analyses these oﬀspring were assigned a
weight of 2.05 reﬂecting their probability of
being selected at T3. All participants with a
history of psychopathology through T2 and all
non-white participants were selected for the T2
assessment, hence were assigned a weight of
Oﬀspring of depressed parents
357

1.00. Although the analyses used weighted data,
the numbers and proportions of participants
presented in the tables are unweighted.
Rates of disorders in oﬀspring were examined
using Cox proportional hazards (PH) models.
Oﬀspring with diagnostic data on only one
parent (n=17) were excluded from analyses
requiring both parents. As we required that the
onset of a disorder in the parent preceded
the onset of that disorder in the oﬀspring, the
number of parents considered to have each dis-
order
varied
slightly
depending
on
which
disorder in oﬀspring served as the dependent
variable.
Analyses
were
conducted
using
SUDAAN (Shah et al. 1997).
RESULTS
Characteristics of parents and oﬀspring
The mean age of the oﬀspring at T1 was 16.6
years (S.D.=1.2); 41.7% were male, and 90.3%
were white. At T1, 55.6% lived with both bio-
logical parents, 32.9% lived with their mother
only, 7.8% lived with their father only, and
3.8% lived with neither biological parent. With
respect to diagnoses through T3, 50.5% of the
oﬀspring had a lifetime MDD; 20.8% had a
lifetime anxiety disorder; and 38.2% had a life-
time substance use disorder. The weighted
lifetime prevalence of MDD in the sample was
42.1%.
The mean ages of the mothers and fathers at
T1 were 40.7 years (S.D.=5.1) and 42.5 years
(S.D.=6.4) respectively. In 43.5% of the fam-
ilies, at least one parent had a 4-year college
degree. Of the mothers, 27.7% had a lifetime
MDD, 14.3% had a lifetime anxiety disorder,
and 19.1% had a lifetime substance use dis-
order. Of the fathers, 14.1% had a lifetime
MDD, 7.0% had a lifetime anxiety disorder,
and 43.4% had a lifetime substance use dis-
order. These rates only include parents with an
onset before T1 and prior to the onset of MDD
in their oﬀspring. Parents with a disorder that
onset after T1 or following the onset of MDD in
their oﬀspring were counted as non-aﬀected.
MDD in oﬀspring
We examined the eﬀects of parental MDD on
lifetime MDD through T3 in oﬀspring in several
stages. First, we examined the unadjusted or
minimally adjusted eﬀects of maternal and
paternal MDD and selected covariates on oﬀ-
spring MDD (see Table 2). The covariates in-
cluded oﬀspring gender, intactness of the family
(as indexed by whether the oﬀspring was living
with both biological parents at T1), whether one
or more parent had completed college by T1
(serving as a proxy for socio-economic status),
and maternal and paternal anxiety and sub-
stance use disorders. The analyses involving
oﬀspring gender, intactness of the family, and
parental education were unadjusted; the ana-
lyses involving maternal and paternal MDD,
anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder
controlled for whether the parent had received
a direct interview.
Female gender in oﬀspring, a non-intact
family,
lower
parental
education,
maternal
MDD, maternal substance use disorder, and
paternal substance use disorder were signiﬁ-
cantly associated with increased rates of MDD
in oﬀspring. In addition, there were non-signiﬁ-
cant trends for associations between paternal
MDD (p=0.065) and maternal anxiety dis-
orders (p=0.08) and oﬀspring MDD.
Next, we examined the independent eﬀects of
maternal and paternal MDD on oﬀspring
MDD after controlling for oﬀspring gender,
parental education, intactness of the family,
whether the parent had received a direct inter-
view, and maternal and paternal anxiety and
substance use disorders (see Table 2). Maternal,
but not paternal, MDD was signiﬁcantly as-
sociated with MDD in oﬀspring. Maternal and
paternal anxiety disorders and maternal sub-
stance use disorders did not make signiﬁcant
independent contributions to predicting oﬀ-
spring MDD. Paternal substance use disorders
was associated with MDD in oﬀspring at a
trend level (p=0.058).
More oﬀspring lived with their mothers than
fathers, hence the stronger eﬀect for maternal
MDD may have been due to greater exposure to
maternal depression. To test this, we examined a
model that included oﬀspring gender, the inter-
view status of each parent, maternal MDD,
paternal MDD, whether the oﬀspring lived with
their mother at T1, whether the oﬀspring lived
with their father at T1, and cross-product terms
for the interactions between living with each
parent at T1 and MDD in that parent. Neither
of the interactions approached signiﬁcance. In
addition, a higher proportion of mothers than
358
D. N. Klein et al.

fathers received direct interviews. To determine
if this accounted for the stronger eﬀects of ma-
ternal than paternal MDD, we tested a model
that included oﬀspring gender, the interview
status of each parent, maternal MDD, paternal
MDD, and cross-product terms for the interac-
tions between maternal and paternal interview
status with maternal and paternal MDD, re-
spectively. Neither interaction was signiﬁcant.#

for deﬁning MDD caseness in oﬀspring, we

# We also conducted several further analyses to explore the eﬀects
of gender and assortative mating. To explore whether the interaction
between oﬀspring and parent gender inﬂuenced rates of MDD in
oﬀspring, we tested a PH model that included main eﬀects for
maternal and paternal interview status, oﬀspring gender, maternal
MDD, paternal MDD, and cross-product terms for oﬀspring gen-
derrmaternal MDD and oﬀspring genderrpaternal MDD. Neither
interaction approached statistical signiﬁcance. To explore whether
paternal
psychopathology
moderated
the
association
between
maternal psychopathology and rates of MDD in oﬀspring, we tested
three PH models. In the ﬁrst model, we entered maternal and
paternal interview status, oﬀspring gender, maternal MDD, paternal
MDD, and a cross-product term for the interaction of maternal
MDDrpaternal MDD. This interaction did not approach signiﬁ-
cance. In the second model, we added ﬁve further variables: maternal
anxiety disorders, paternal anxiety disorders, and cross-product
terms for maternal MDDrpaternal anxiety disorders, maternal

None
of
the
interactions
approached signiﬁcance. In the third model, we replaced the main
eﬀects and interaction terms involving maternal and paternal anxiety
disorders in the previous model with the corresponding main eﬀects
and interaction terms for maternal and paternal substance use
disorders. None of the interactions approached signiﬁcance.
Oﬀspring of depressed parents

limited the MDD group to oﬀspring with at
least one lifetime episode of moderate or greater
severity. Oﬀspring with a history of only mild
episodes of MDD were treated as non-cases,
and combined with oﬀspring with no history of
MDD. Of the 392 oﬀspring in the sample with a
lifetime history of MDD, 291 (74.2%) had an
episode rated as at least moderately severe.
Using unweighted n’s, 47.4% (102/215) of the
oﬀspring of mothers with a history of MDD,
and 33.7% (189/560) of oﬀspring of mothers
with no history of MDD had at least one epi-
sode of MDD of moderate or greater severity.
Of oﬀspring of fathers with a history of MDD,
52.3% (56/107) had an episode of MDD of
moderate
or
greater
severity
compared
to
35.3% (230/651) of oﬀspring of fathers with no
history of MDD.
When we repeated the series of analyses
above examining the eﬀects of parental MDD
on oﬀspring MDD using this more restrictive
deﬁnition of caseness in oﬀspring, the eﬀects of
paternal MDD on oﬀspring MDD were stron-
ger and statistically signiﬁcant. In a multivariate
model that included maternal and paternal
interview status, oﬀspring sex, socio-economic
status, intact home, maternal and paternal
anxiety and substance use disorders, and ma-
ternal MDD, paternal MDD was signiﬁcantly
associated with moderate to severe MDD in
oﬀspring [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 95% conﬁ-
dence

1.03–2.14,
p=0.033].
Maternal MDD also made a signiﬁcant inde-
pendent
contribution
(HR

CI
1.04–1.95, p=0.028).
Anxiety and substance use disorders in oﬀspring
A number of studies have also reported elevated
rates of non-mood disorders in the oﬀspring of
depressed mothers and the oﬀspring of com-
bined samples of depressed mothers and fathers
(Weissman et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998;
Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). In order to extend
our analysis of the association between paternal
MDD
and
oﬀspring
psychopathology,
we
examined the associations between maternal and
paternal MDD and rates of anxiety and sub-
stance use disorders in oﬀspring. These associ-
ations, adjusted for parental interview status, are
presented in Table 3. Maternal MDD, but not
paternal MDD, predicted a signiﬁcantly higher
rate of anxiety disorders in oﬀspring. Neither
maternal nor paternal MDD were associated
with substance use disorders in oﬀspring. In
addition, maternal and paternal anxiety dis-
orders predicted oﬀspring anxiety disorders,
and
maternal
and
paternal
substance
use
disorders were associated with substance use
disorders in oﬀspring.
As a more stringent test of the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and non-
mood disorders in oﬀspring, we examined two
further PH models (see Table 3). The interview
status of each parent, oﬀspring gender, and
maternal and paternal MDD were included in
both models. The ﬁrst model examined the as-
sociations between maternal and paternal MDD
and anxiety disorders in oﬀspring, and included
maternal and paternal anxiety disorders as
covariates. In this model, neither maternal
MDD nor paternal MDD predicted anxiety
disorders in oﬀspring.
The second model examined the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and sub-
stance use disorders in oﬀspring, and included
maternal and paternal substance use disorders
as covariates. Neither maternal MDD nor
paternal MDD predicted substance use dis-
orders in oﬀspring.
Clinical characteristics of parental depression
Finally, we examined the associations between
selected
clinical
characteristics
of
parental
depression and rates of MDD in oﬀspring. The
analyses
were
conducted
separately
for
depressed mothers and depressed fathers, and
were limited to oﬀspring with a depressed
parent. Of the 215 depressed mothers in this set
of analyses, 66 (30.7%) had an early onset, 145
(67.4%) had recurrent episodes, 67 (31.2%) had
chronic episodes, and 184 (85.6%) had an epi-
sode of at least moderate severity. Of the 107
depressed fathers in this set of analyses, 26
(24.3%) had an early onset, 70 (65.4%) had
recurrent episodes, 33 (30.8%) had chronic epi-
sodes, and 91 (85.0%) had an episode of at least
moderate severity.
Oﬀspring of depressed mothers and fathers
with and without each clinical characteristic
were compared using univariate PH models (see
Table 4). Oﬀspring of mothers with early-onset
MDD, and oﬀspring of fathers with early-onset
MDD and recurrent MDD had signiﬁcantly
increased risks of MDD. In addition, there was
360
D. N. Klein et al.

a trend for a higher rate of MDD in the oﬀ-
spring of mothers with chronic MDD. The
eﬀects for maternal recurrent MDD, paternal
chronic MDD, and moderate to severe maternal
and paternal MDD were not signiﬁcant.
DISCUSSION
Many studies have demonstrated that the oﬀ-
spring of mothers with MDD are at increased
risk for depression. Much less, however, is
known about the association between paternal
MDD and oﬀspring depression. Using a large
community sample of parents and their ado-
lescent and young adult oﬀspring, we replicated
the ﬁnding that maternal MDD was signiﬁ-
cantly associated with MDD in oﬀspring. In
contrast, the association between paternal MDD
and oﬀspring MDD reached only a trend level
of signiﬁcance, and disappeared after controlling
for maternal MDD and selected demographic
covariates and parental non-mood disorders.
However, when a more stringent threshold for
deﬁning MDD in oﬀspring was employed, a
signiﬁcant association between paternal MDD
and oﬀspring depression was obtained, and we
found that MDD in both mothers and fathers
were independently associated with MDD in
oﬀspring. In addition, we found that early
MDD onset in both mothers and fathers, and
recurrent MDD in fathers were signiﬁcantly
associated with elevated rates of MDD in oﬀ-
spring.
We are aware of only two previous studies
that used large community samples of depressed
fathers as well as depressed mothers. Lieb et al.
(2002) reported that maternal and paternal
MDD were both associated with increased rates
of MDD in oﬀspring, whereas Brennan et al.
(2002) found that maternal depression, but not
paternal depression, was associated with de-
pression in oﬀspring. Our ﬁndings are partially
consistent with both of these studies. Using
DSM-III-R criteria for MDD in oﬀspring, we

found that the association between parental
MDD and oﬀspring depression was limited to
depressed mothers. However, when we raised
the threshold to require at least one MDD epi-
sode of at least moderate severity in oﬀspring,
we also found a signiﬁcant association between
paternal MDD and oﬀspring depression. These
ﬁndings raise the possibility that conﬂicting re-
sults in studies comparing the eﬀects of maternal
and paternal depression may reﬂect implicit
diﬀerences in the thresholds used to diagnose
MDD in oﬀspring, In addition, these results
suggest that future studies should examine the
data using several alternative approaches to case
deﬁnition.
We examined several possible explanations
for why there was an eﬀect for maternal MDD,
but not paternal MDD, in the primary analyses
using DSM-III-R criteria for MDD in oﬀspring.
First, more mothers than fathers received direct
interviews, and oﬀspring’s collateral reports of
maternal MDD were somewhat more sensitive
than reports of paternal MDD. Hence, it is
conceivable that our ﬁndings are due to more
accurate diagnoses of MDD in mothers than
fathers. However, the signiﬁcant associations
for maternal, but not paternal, MDD remained
evident after controlling for whether the parent
was interviewed, and there was no evidence of
interview status by parental diagnosis interac-
tions. Second, oﬀspring were more likely to
reside with their mothers than fathers, and
therefore, may have had greater exposure to
maternal than paternal depression. While we
did not assess the actual time spent with either
parent during episodes of parental MDD, we
did control for the eﬀects of residing with both
biological parents at T1 in the analyses. In ad-
dition, we examined interactions between resid-
ing with each parent and parental diagnoses of
MDD, and did not obtain signiﬁcant eﬀects.
Our secondary analyses revealed signiﬁcant
associations between both maternal MDD and
paternal MDD and MDD of at least moderate
severity in oﬀspring. Thus, it appears that the
association between maternal MDD and oﬀ-
spring MDD is evident throughout the range of
oﬀspring severity, whereas the association with
paternal MDD is limited to the more severe
cases of depression in oﬀspring. This has im-
portant implications for modeling the familial
aggregation of MDD, as it suggests that the
processes underlying the intergenerational trans-
mission of depression in mothers and fathers
may diﬀer, at least to some extent.
We also examined whether maternal and
paternal MDD were associated with increased
rates of non-mood disorders in oﬀspring. A
number of previous studies have found elevated
rates of anxiety and externalizing disorders in
the oﬀspring of depressed parents (Weissman
et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998; Goodman &

D. N. Klein et al.

Gotlib, 1999). However, few previous studies
have examined depressed mothers and fathers
separately or controlled for the eﬀects of non-
mood disorders in the depressed parent and the
co-parent. Consistent with the literature, we
found that prior to adjusting for the eﬀects of
parental non-mood disorders, maternal MDD
was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased
rate of anxiety disorders in oﬀspring. However,
after controlling for parental anxiety disorders,
this association disappeared. These ﬁndings
suggest that the elevated rates of non-mood
disorders reported in previous studies of the
oﬀspring of depressed parents may be due to the
direct transmission of these other disorders,
rather than the eﬀects of maternal MDD.
Alternatively, the eﬀects of maternal MDD on
oﬀspring anxiety disorders may be more easily
detected in younger samples, as some cases of
childhood anxiety disorders may subsequently
evolve into depression and not be reported in
assessments conducted in adolescence or young
adulthood.
Early-onset (<21 years of age) MDD in both
mothers and fathers was associated with a sig-
niﬁcantly increased risk of MDD in the oﬀ-
spring. In addition, the oﬀspring of fathers with
recurrent MDD exhibited an increased rate of
MDD. These data are consistent with a number
of twin (Kendler et al. 1999), family (Bland et al.
1986; Weissman et al. 1986), and oﬀspring
(Klein et al. 1988; Warner et al. 1995) studies
indicating that early-onset and recurrent MDD
are associated with greater familial aggregation.
Most of this work has been based on samples
of depressed mothers or combined samples of
depressed mothers and fathers. Our ﬁndings in-
dicate that the association between early-onset
and recurrent MDD in parents and increased
risk to oﬀspring also applies to depressed
fathers. Our design cannot tease apart genetic
from environmental eﬀects. Thus, we do not
know whether early-onset MDD in the parent is
associated with a greater genetic liability or
whether oﬀspring of parents with early-onset
MDD are exposed to parental depression at an
earlier age or for a longer period of time.
Unfortunately, we did not have suﬃciently de-
tailed data on the course of parental depression
and the periods in which the oﬀspring was living
with each parent to disentangle the eﬀects of
parental age of onset and recurrence from the
timing and duration of exposure of oﬀspring to
parental MDD.
Our ﬁndings appear to be inconsistent with
Hammen & Brennan’s (2003) recent report that
the severity of maternal depression was associ-
ated with risk for MDD in a large community
sample of adolescents. However, an important
diﬀerence is that our analyses were limited
to parents with MDD, whereas Hammen &
Brennan (2003) combined depressed and non-
depressed mothers and used a four-point sev-
erity scale that included no depression, minor/
subthreshold depression, mild/moderate MDD,
and severe/psychotic MDD. Thus, it is unclear
whether Hammen & Brennan’s (2003) ﬁndings
reﬂect diﬀerences between parents with mild/
moderate
versus
severe/psychotic
MDD
or
between the presence versus absence of parental
MDD.
The magnitude of the signiﬁcant associations
between parental MDD and oﬀspring psycho-
pathology was generally in the small-to-medium
range. This is consistent with the view that par-
ental depression is only one of many factors
contributing to the development of MDD in
oﬀspring (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). However,
due to the large sample and high prevalence of
MDD, the conﬁdence intervals were relatively
narrow, indicating that the hazard ratios were
estimated with a high degree of precision.
The lifetime prevalence of MDD through age
24 years in our sample of oﬀspring (weighted
prevalence=42%)
was
considerably
higher
than other epidemiological studies of depression.
For example, the estimated lifetime prevalence
of MDD through age 24 years in the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS; Kessler & Walters,
1998) was 21%. However, most epidemiological
studies are based on single-wave retrospective
assessments of predominantly adult samples. In
contrast, the prevalence of MDD in the OADP
is
based
on
three
diagnostic
evaluations
conducted over a 7–8 years period from mid-
adolescence to early adulthood. Interestingly,
the shape of the age of onset functions for ages
15–24 years in the OADP and NCS are very
similar, and both studies have relatively similar
12-month total incidence rates (7.6% and 6.6%
respectively) and 12-month prevalence rates
(9.9% and 12.4% respectively). This suggests
that the higher lifetime prevalence in the OADP
may be due to its prospective design and more
Oﬀspring of depressed parents

intensive surveillance. We suspect that this
resulted in the OADP detecting a number of
milder cases (e.g. less severe, shorter duration,
single episode) that are not identiﬁed in single-
wave retrospective designs covering a much
broader time period.
This study had a number of strengths, in-
cluding the use of a large community sample,
assessments of both mothers and fathers using
semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and re-
peated evaluations of oﬀspring. However, the
study also had a number of limitations. First,
there are limits to the generalizability of the
sample, as participants were predominantly
Caucasian and only adolescents who were en-
rolled in high school were included in the T1
sampling frame.
Second, the possibility of sampling bias must
be considered, as the participation rate at T1
was modest, and participants were more likely
than non-participants to be female and to come
from families with slightly higher socio-econ-
omic status.
Third, we were able to conduct direct inter-
views with only 75% of the mothers and 46% of
the fathers. In order to minimize sampling bias,
we chose to include parents who could not be
personally interviewed and derived diagnoses
for them using the family history method.
However, the sensitivity of the family history
method is limited, and informants’ reports may
be inﬂuenced by their own history of psycho-
pathology (Kendler et al. 1991; Chapman et al.
1994). In order to increase the sensitivity of
family history information and reduce the
eﬀects of informants’ biases, we attempted to
obtain data from two informants when a parent
was unavailable for interview. In addition, we
included interview status as a covariate in our
analyses, and tested for interactions between
interview status and parental MDD.
Fourth, the data on diagnoses and age of on-
set in parents and oﬀspring were retrospective,
although for the oﬀspring this limitation was
partially mitigated by multiple follow-up evalu-
ations.
Fifth, the inter-rater reliability of some clini-
cal features in parents and oﬀspring was only
moderate.
Sixth, we used a cohort of oﬀspring who
were followed from mid-late adolescence into
early adulthood. Although this increased the
homogeneity of the sample, the ﬁndings may
diﬀer for younger oﬀspring. For example, in a
recent
meta-analysis,
Connell
&
Goodman
(2002) reported that the associations between
maternal and paternal depression and oﬀspring
internalizing symptoms varied somewhat as a
function of the children’s age.
Seventh, we focused on psychiatric diagnoses
in oﬀspring. It is also important to compare the
associations between maternal and paternal
MDD and other domains of oﬀspring func-
tioning, such as interpersonal and academic/
vocational adjustment. Finally, we did not
attempt to examine the processes or mechan-
isms that underlie the intergenerational trans-
mission of MDD in this paper. We intend to
explore these issues in future reports.
