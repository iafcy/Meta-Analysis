Background: This article examines associations
between DSM-IV depressive disorders, their natural
course, other psychopathology, and parental major
depression in a community sample of adolescents and
young adults.
Methods: Baseline and 4-year follow-up data were
used from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopa-
thology Study, a prospective-longitudinal community
study of adolescents and young adults. Results are
based on 2427 subjects who completed the follow-up
and for whom diagnostic information for both parents
was available. DSM-IV mental disorders in respondents
were assessed using the Munich-Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview. Information on depression
in parents was collected as family history information
from the respondents and from diagnostic interviews
with parents of the younger cohort.
Results: Offspring with 1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.5) or 2 affected parents (OR,
3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.1) had an increased risk for depres-
sion. They also had a higher risk for substance use (1 par-
ent affected: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; both parents af-
fected: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8) and anxiety disorders
(1 parent affected: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9; both par-
ents affected: OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8). There were no
differences whether mother or father was affected. Pa-
rental depression was associated with an earlier onset and
a more malignant course (severity, impairment, recur-
rence) of depressive disorders in offspring.
Conclusions: Major depression in parents increases the
overall risk in offspring for onset of depressive and other
mental disorders and influences patterns of the natural
course of depression in the early stages of manifestation.

A
VAST NUMBER of studies
have investigated the asso-
ciation between depres-
sioninparentsandpsycho-
pathologyintheiroffspring.
Studiesusingthe“top-down”approachhave
consistently shown that offspring of
depressed parents have a substantially in-
creased risk for experiencing not only de-
pressive disorders, but also other psycho-
pathology, such as anxiety or substance-
usedisorders.1-17 Fromanotherperspective,
“bottom-up”studiesexaminingclinicallyre-
ferred depressed children and adolescents
have reported increased rates of depres-
sion and other forms of psychopathology in
their adult relatives.18-25
Although the association between pa-
rental depression and offspring psycho-
pathology seems to be sufficiently stud-
ied, there are several weaknesses of
previous research. Thus, with 2 excep-
tions,14,15 all studies have included af-
fected individuals (either parent or child)
in treatment as index probands. Because
of the effects of self-selection, treatment,
and help-seeking bias, these results may
not be representative of depressive disor-
ders in general.26 Further, most studies
have failed to consider diagnostic comor-
bidity within the affected parents, so it is
often not clear whether the reported as-
sociations are unique for parental depres-
sion or whether the associations may also
be explained by confounding comorbid
disorders in parents.15,27 Additionally, most
studies have focused on diagnostic status
in the mother or in either parent, and only
a few have evaluated associations sepa-
rately for affected mothers and fathers or
different levels of parental loading.2,3,7,17
A final, understudied issue is the natu-
ral course of depressive disorders in off-
spring of affected parents in terms of on-
set, severity, persistence, and risk of
recurrence. A precise picture of the natu-
ral course of depressive disorders in these
offspring requires prospective-longitudi-
nal designs. Although during the past de-
cade there have been methodologically

sound longitudinal studies of offspring of depressed par-
ents that suggest that parental depression leads to an ear-
lier onset as well as a more complicated course of depres-
sion in the offspring,7-10,13,14 none of them have used a
representative community sample to evaluate such spe-
cific course characteristics.
The present study examines, on the basis of a rep-
resentative community sample of adolescents and young
adults, the association of a history of major depression
in parents with depression and other mental disorders,
along with the course of depression in offspring in terms
of age of onset, severity, and impairment.
RESULTS
PREVALENCES
Study criteria for major depression were fulfilled by 42.1%
of mothers and 23.4% of fathers (Table 1). In 33.7%
and 16.0% of the sample, respectively, one (mother only,
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
Data come from the Early Development Stages of Psychopa-
thology Study (EDSP), a prospective-longitudinal study de-
signed to collect data on the prevalence, incidence, familial
risk and other risk factors, comorbidity, and course of men-
tal disorders in a representative sample of 3021 respondents
aged 14 to 24 years at baseline. These respondents represent
the offspring in this report. The EDSP consists of a baseline
survey, 2 follow-up surveys, and a family supplement. De-
tailed descriptions of the study are reported elsewhere.28,29
The baseline sample was drawn in 1994 from the govern-
ment registries in Munich, Germany, of registrants expected
to be 14 to 24 years of age at the time of the baseline inter-
view in 1995. Details about the sampling and representative-
ness of the whole EDSP sample, along with its sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, have been previously presented.28-30
A total of 3021 interviews were completed at baseline (T0;
response rate, 71%). The first follow-up study (T1) was con-
ducted only for respondents aged 14 to 17 years at baseline,
whereas the second follow-up study was conducted for all
respondents. In the first follow-up, which took place at an
average of 20 months after baseline, a total of 1228 inter-
views were completed (response rate, 88%). From the 3021
respondents of the baseline study, a total of 2548 interviews
were completed at the second follow-up (T2), which oc-
curedatanaverageof42monthsafterbaseline(responserate,
84%).
In the EDSP family supplement, direct diagnostic in-
terviews were conducted with the parents of the younger
cohort (the 14- to 17-year-olds at baseline).29 As we were
interested not only in familial psychopathology, but also
in early developmental information about the respon-
dents, primarily the mothers were interviewed. Fathers were
interviewed only if the mother was not available (de-
ceased or not locatable). The parents of 1053 adolescents
were interviewed directly (in 1026 cases the mother, in 27
cases the father; response rate, 86%).
The results reported in this article are based on the
2427 respondents who completed the whole study period
and for whom diagnostic information about psychopathol-
ogy in both parents was available. Throughout the article,
data are weighted by age, sex, geographic location, non-
contact, and nonresponse to match the distribution of the
sampling frame.29
DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF OFFSPRING
Diagnoses of the offspring are based on the DSM-IV 31 and
were assessed with the computer-assisted version of
the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view (M-CIDI32), an updated version of the World Health
Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view version 1.2.33 The reliability and validity of the M-
CIDI have been reported.34-36 Diagnostic findings were ob-
tained by using the M-CIDI/DSM-IV diagnostic algorithms.
In all assessments, interviews were administered by highly
trained clinical interviewers—mostly graduate students in
psychology. Most interviews were carried out in the homes
of the respondents.
The diagnoses considered in this article include de-
pressive disorders (major depression, dysthymia), bipolar
disorders (bipolar I and bipolar II disorders), anxiety dis-
orders (panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, ago-
raphobia without panic disorder, specific phobia, phobia
not otherwise specified, social phobia, generalized anxi-
ety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttrau-
matic stress disorder), and substance use disorders (alco-
hol abuse and dependence, nicotine dependence, and illicit
drug abuse and dependence). Descriptors of the severity
of depression (eg, number of depressive episodes, impair-
ment, treatment seeking) refer to the self-identified worst
episode of depression. Overall impairment due to depres-
sion was assessed by asking the respondents how much their
depression impaired daily life and activities during the worst
period.Socialrole–specificimpairmentwasassessedbyques-
tions in which respondents were asked how much during
the 4 weeks preceding the interview depressive symptoms
made them feel impaired in (1) daily activities such as work,
house work, or studies; (2) leisure-time activities; and (3)
social contact with family, friends, and colleagues.
At baseline, the lifetime version of the M-CIDI was
used. At each of the follow-up assessments, we applied the
M-CIDI interval version, which refers to the period of as-
sessment from the last interview until the present. For those
respondents aged 14 to 17 years at baseline, the complete
follow-up status from baseline to second follow-up is as-
sessed from the aggregation of information obtained from
the first and second follow-up interviews. For respon-
dents older than 17 years at baseline, the complete fol-
low-up status is assessed from the second follow-up ques-
tions, which cover the time between baseline and second
follow-up.
PARENTAL HISTORY
In a separate M-CIDI family history module administered
at baseline and second follow-up, respondents provided fam-
ily history information on all first-degree relatives. Family
history items were designed using a modified version of the
Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria37 as a model.
To obtain family history information about the same DSM-IV
diagnoses that are in the M-CIDI, M-CIDI stem questions

26.2%; father only, 7.5%) or both parents were affected.
Of the offspring, 19.5% reported at least 1 episode of ma-
jor depression by the second follow-up, and 3.8% ful-
filled criteria for lifetime dysthymia. Substance use dis-
orders were reported by 43.1% of the offspring when
nicotine dependence was included, and by 31.3% of the
offspring when nicotine dependence was excluded. Bi-
polar disorders were reported by 3.1%; and any anxiety
disorder, by 35.0% of the offspring. Depressive and anxi-
ety disorders were more common in female offspring than
in male offspring, while substance use disorders were more
common in male offspring than in female offspring. No
gender differences were found for bipolar disorders.
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARENTAL
DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
IN OFFSPRING
Compared with the offspring of nondepressed parents,
offspring of either 1 or 2 depressed parents reported
were used at baseline. Questions to determine whether the
relative sought professional help because of his or her re-
spective symptoms were also asked. In the second follow-
up, we used an extended version of the family history mod-
ule, which contained fully structured sections covering
DSM-IV criteria.
Parents of the younger cohort were independently as-
sessed with the M-CIDI in the EDSP family supplement,
providing direct diagnostic information about the inter-
viewed parent. Interviewers were blinded to the diagnos-
tic findings of the respective offspring. The parent M-
CIDI contained a module that provided family history data
for the noninterviewed parent and other family members
of the respondent.38,39
Family history status of major depression was deter-
mined by using all available diagnostic information about
the occurrence of any major depression episode in par-
ents. Diagnostic estimates for the parents of the younger
cohort took into account the family history data obtained
from the respondent as informant, as well as the M-CIDI
information and family history data obtained from the par-
ent interview.39 For the older cohort, for which no direct
parent interviews were available, we used only family his-
tory information obtained from the respondent. The accu-
racy of family history information was examined by com-
paring the diagnostic information obtained from the
respondents about their mothers, with the information ob-
tained from the mothers themselves. This was also achieved
by comparing the family history information obtained from
the respondents about their fathers, with the family his-
tory information obtained from the mothers about the fa-
thers. Overall, only moderate sensitivity (48% for the de-
tection in mothers, 63% for the detection in fathers), but
acceptable high specificity (68% for mothers, 85% for fa-
thers), was found for major depression. For this article, any
indication of a major depressive episode was accepted for
a positive diagnosis in parents. Therefore, the diagnostic
certainty should be interpreted on the “probable” level.39
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
As our goal was to examine the degree to which parental
major depression is associated with diagnostic outcomes
in children, parental major depression was the indepen-
dent variable. Main diagnostic outcomes were the off-
spring’s cumulative lifetime incidences of DSM-IV depres-
sive and other mental disorders at second follow-up, which
were calculated by adding baseline and follow-up inci-
dent cases.
For the analyses of associations between major de-
pression in parents and psychopathology in offspring, lo-
gistic regressions for binary responses (odds ratio [OR])
were used. For the analysis of impairment variables,
cumulative logistic regressions were used. Hereby, it is as-
sumed that the covariates are related to a shift on a latent
continuum that underlies the observed categories, and this
overall association is described with cumulative ORs
(CUMORs). This provides more statistical precision in es-
timates as compared with dichotomization.40
For quantitative outcomes of severity of depression that
were count variables (values of 0, 1, 2, ...; eg, the number
of depressive episodes), negative binomial regressions were
used. Hereby, the skewness of these variables is taken into
account, as well as overdispersion (when a variance is higher
than expected under the Poisson model for the dependent
variable conditional on the covariate values41). Associa-
tions are described by incidence rate ratios (ie, the factor
by which the mean differs from the mean in the compari-
son group).
Age-specific cumulative lifetime incidences were es-
timated with the Kaplan-Meier-method42 using age of on-
set information from the offspring. Statistical inferences are
based on the stratified Cox model for discrete time (ie, be-
fore testing for differences, different curves in strata de-
fined by birth year cohorts and sex of the offspring are cal-
culated nonparametrically42). The interaction term parental
major depressionage was added to the model when the
proportional hazards assumption was violated. The latter
was tested with Schoenfeld residuals.43 This was done to
see whether offspring with affected parents have an earlier
onset of the disorder under consideration. Such a model
provides hazard ratios (HRs) for the main effect of paren-
tal major depression and for the interaction effect with age.
An HR less than 1 for the interaction term indicates that
offspring with affected parents have an earlier onset than
offspring without affected parents. The age-specific HR for
the effect of parental major depression is given by the fol-
lowing:
HR (Age)=HR Main EffectHR Interaction Effectage
When Cox analyses were conducted with multiple anxi-
ety or substance use disorders, the age of onset of the chrono-
logically earliest disorder was used.
Analyses were performed using the Stata software pack-
age44 and applying the Huber-White sandwich matrix for
weighted data.45 Sex and age of offspring were controlled for
by including them as independent variables in the respec-
tive model. P .05 was considered statistically significant.
All associations were tested for interaction with sex of off-
spring, and in cases of significant effects, associations were
then separately determined for males and females. To pro-
tect for misleading results obtained by aggregating 2 co-
horts with different ascertainment strategies, all associa-
tions were tested for an interaction effect with age cohort.
In case of significance, analyses were run separately within
each cohort.

higher rates of depression and almost all other disorders
under consideration (Table 2). With few exceptions,
risks were similar in offspring with 1 vs 2 affected par-
ents. The exceptions were bipolar II, obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the
aggregated category of anxiety disorders, for which
risks were higher in offspring with 2 affected parents. In
general, adjusting for parental comorbidity yielded
similar results. Only the associations between parental
depression and alcohol dependence, agoraphobia, pho-
bia not otherwise specified, and social phobia in off-
spring failed to reach significance, suggesting that the
increased rates of these disorders in the offspring may
be due to comorbid disorders in the parents. In an effort
to exclude the hypothesis that the lack of differences
between 1 and 2 depressed parents could be explained
by coparental psychopathology in offspring with 1
affected parent, we additionally reran the analyses con-
trolling for coparental psychopathology. These analyses
yielded similar findings.
All parent-offspring associations were tested for dif-
ferences between male and female offspring. In general,
associations were comparable in size for sons and daugh-
ters. Interaction effects were found only as follows: among

offspring of 1 affected parent, only males had a higher
risk for panic disorder, while among offspring of 2 af-
fected parents, only females had a higher risk for spe-
cific phobia as well as for any anxiety disorder. The ex-
amination of interaction with cohort revealed that among
offspring of 2 affected parents, risk for agoraphobia was
increased only in the older cohort.
SEX OF AFFECTED PARENT
To examine whether the pattern of associations differed
by sex of the affected parent, analyses were conducted
after dividing offspring into those with an affected
mother only and those with an affected father only.
Compared with the offspring of nonaffected parents,
offspring of both groups had higher rates of depression
and other mental disorders (Table 3). Associations
were not different between maternal and paternal de-
pression.
With the exception of male offspring of affected
mothers having a higher risk for panic disorder, no no-
table differences in risks were found between male and
female offspring. The examination of interaction with the
cohort revealed only one effect: among the offspring of
affected fathers, risk for any substance use disorder (in-
cluding or excluding nicotine dependence) was in-
creased only in the younger cohort.

95% CI=2.9-24.6), whereas there was no such finding
when only 1 parent was affected (for interaction with age,
HR=1.0, 95% CI=0.9-1.0; for main effect from this model,
HR=2.5, 95% CI=0.6-9.5). Age of onset characteristics
were also examined separately for major depression and
dysthymia. Both disorders started earlier in offspring with
2 affected parents than in offspring without affected par-
ents (major depression: for interaction with age, HR=0.9,
95% CI=0.8-0.9; for main effect from this model, HR=9.2,
95% CI=2.7-31.3) (dysthymia: for interaction with age,
HR=0.9, 95% CI=0.7-0.9; for main effect from this model,
HR=29.9, 95% CI=5.0-176.1).
Because of restricted sample sizes in some specific
anxiety disorders, age of onset characteristics were de-
termined for the main diagnostic group of “any anxiety
disorder.” For anxiety disorders, no interactions be-
tween age of onset in offspring and parental depression
were found. Concerning substance use disorders, age of
onset characteristics were separately evaluated for
nicotine dependence, alcohol dependence, and abuse
or dependence of any illicit drugs. Offspring with 2
affected parents develop drug abuse or dependence
earlier (for interaction with age, HR=0.8, 95% CI=0.6-
0.9; for main effect from this model, HR=34.8, 95% CI
= 1.9-615.9) as compared with offspring without
affected parents. By contrast, the age of onset for nico-
tine dependence and for alcohol use disorders did not
vary by parental diagnostic status. All interaction
effects proved similar when adjusting for parental
comorbidity.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY
PARENTAL MAJOR DEPRESSION
As indicated by several clinical characteristics, severity
of depression was greater in offspring of affected par-
ents than in offspring of nonaffected parents. Overall, off-
spring of depressed parents reported higher persis-
tence, more depressive episodes, increased rates of
treatment seeking (Table 4), and also higher impair-
ments in social contacts and leisure activities (Table 5).
COMMENT
Consistent with most previous reports,* we found that
parental major depression increases offspring risk for
depression. Our results, however, are an extension of pre-
vious findings insofar as (1) parent-offspring associa-
tions were explored using DSM-IV criteria in a represen-

tative sample, (2) subjects were examined prospectively
across the period of risk of initial onset of depressive dis-
orders, and (3) the use of a large sample size promises
power benefits for the statistical analyses.
Depression in parents was associated not only with
offspring depression but also with other psychopathol-
ogy (ie, anxiety or specific substance use disorders). These
associations remained stable even after adjustment for
parental comorbidity. The literature contains mixed find-
ings regarding the specificity of the familial transmis-
sion of major depression.10,15,18,19,23,24 We found that within-
disorder associations (eg, parental depression with
depression in offspring) were in most cases, consider-
ably higher than cross-disorder associations (eg, paren-
tal depression with anxiety disorders in offspring), sug-
gesting a certain specificity of the parent-offspring
associations of depression. Nevertheless, our cross-
disorder findings also deserve attention. The higher risk
for nicotine dependence in offspring is especially inter-
esting as it has never before been reported. Previous stud-
ies46,47 found that early anxiety and depression predict
later nicotine dependence. Thus, familial transmitted anxi-
ety and depression in children might increase the risk
for subsequent nicotine dependence, or the familial as-
sociation might indicate shared etiologies48,49 for these 2
disorders.
Unlike most studies, we additionally examined as-
sociations by sex of the affected parent. Although it is
critical that the diagnostic procedures were not entirely
comparable between mothers and fathers, our findings
suggest that maternal and paternal depression affect male
and female offspring similarly. These results are in line
with those of other family genetic studies,3-5,7,15,17,19,20,50
which found no compelling evidence for substantial sex-
specific effects in the familial transmission of depres-
sion.
We also showed that the offspring of affected par-
ents experience a more malignant course of depression,
which that is manifested by a higher number of depres-
sive episodes, higher persistence, and higher treatment
seeking. These findings are consistent with observations
in clinical studies10,14 in which parental depression is
associated with higher illness severity in offspring. Fur-
ther, the literature provides some evidence that early-
onset depression may constitute a “familial subtype” of
depression.10 Overall, our finding that offspring of 2
affected parents have an earlier onset of depression sup-
ports this hypothesis; however, our results also indicate
a potentially differential influence of parental concor-
dance on this outcome. To our knowledge, this effect
has not been reported before, but it indicates that the
diagnostic status of both parents should be considered
in future studies.
In terms of parental loading, having 1 or 2 affected
parents seems to equally influence the offspring’s risk for
depression. Although one might expect a monotonic re-
lationship between the number of affected parents and
the same disorder in the offspring, our findings, to-
gether with the findings of other clinical studies7,17 do
not support such a hypothesis. Whatever the explana-
tion of this observation might be (eg, mobilization of pro-
tective factors when both parents are affected), this lack
of systematic effect of different parental loading sug-
gests that the familial transmission of depression does not
follow simple patterns. Beardslee et al51 and Rutter et al,52
who reviewed the research on genetic and environmen-
tal factors in this field, concluded that parental depres-
sion probably exerts its influence on offspring through
several genetic and environmental factors that most likely
interact in very complex patterns. An important topic for
future research would be to unravel these patterns of en-
vironmental and genetic influences that increase vulner-
ability53 for depression.
Our findings should be interpreted with caution be-
cause the inclusion of family history information might
have produced biased estimates of parental psychopa-
thology. One concern in this respect is the rather low sen-
sitivity of family history information.54-57 To increase sen-
sitivity, all available diagnostic information about probable
major depression in parents was used. This might ex-
plain the relatively high rate of depressive disorders in
parents. Another concern is whether family history in-
formation is influenced by the respondents’ diagnostic
status.58,59 We examined whether respondents with men-
tal disorders demonstrated higher sensitivity for paren-
tal psychopathology when compared with unaffected re-
spondents, but we found no evidence for biased estimates.
The use of family history information could also have
caused an underestimation of comorbidity among de-
pressed parents and, therefore, an attenuation of speci-
ficity. Further, different assessment stategies were used
for ascertainment of parental psychopathology in the 2
age cohorts. To protect for misleading results obtained
by aggregating both cohorts, all associations were tested
for interaction with age cohort. As we found only 2 co-
hort effects, the different ascertainment strategies prob-
ably did not systematically bias our findings. Although
the young age of our sample makes it rather unlikely that
onset of depression in offspring preceded the onset of de-
pression in parents, we cannot absolutely guarantee this
temporal ordering in all cases. This issue could not be
addressed in the analyses, as information about age of
onset in parents was not assessed in the family history
interviews. Finally, not all respondents have fully passed
through the entire risk period for onset of mental disor-
ders, but the inclusion of false-negative cases probably
resulted in diminished, rather than overestimated, asso-
ciations.
This study has once more demonstrated that off-
spring of depressed parents constitute an important high-
risk group. Our findings argue for specific prevention and
intervention efforts in those offspring. Specifically, the
early detection of mental health problems in offspring
of depressed parents seems to be crucial, as this would
allow the treatment of early manifestations of mental prob-
lems before they cause clinical impairment.
