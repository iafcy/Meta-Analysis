Objective—Postnatal depression in women is associated with adverse effects on both maternal 
health and children's development. It is unclear whether depression in men at this time poses 
comparable risks. The present study set out to assess the association between depression in men in 
the postnatal period and later psychiatric disorders in their children, and to investigate 
predisposing factors for depression in men following childbirth. 
Methods—A population based cohort of 10,975 fathers and their children from the Avon 
Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were recruited in the prenatal period and 
followed up for 7 years. Paternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale, and later child psychiatric disorder (DSM-IV) with the Development 
and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). 
Results—Depression in fathers in the postnatal period was significantly associated with 
psychiatric disorder in their children 7 years later (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.72, 95% confidence 
interval 1.07 to 2.77), most notably oppositional-defiant/conduct disorders (adj. OR 1.94, 95% 
confidence interval 1.04 to 3.61), after adjusting for maternal depression and paternal educational 
level. 
A past history of severe depression, and high prenatal symptom scores for depression and anxiety 
were the strongest predictors of paternal depression in the postnatal period. 
Conclusions—Depression in fathers in the postnatal period is associated with later psychiatric 
disorders in their children, independently of maternal postnatal depression. Further research is 
required into the risks associated with paternal psychopathology, as this could represent an 
important opportunity for public health intervention. 


 



The study of depression in women in the perinatal period has led to an increased 
understanding of its nature, course and causes, and has identified potential opportunities for 
screening and intervention. The importance of postnatal depression in women is now well 
recognised, in terms of its adverse effects on maternal health and also children's 
development 1-3. We do not yet know if depression in men at this time poses comparable 
clinical and public health concerns 4-6. Although direct evidence about the psychological 
well-being of men in this transition period is very limited, there are indirect indicators of 
increased risk. The most striking is the finding that the transition to parenthood is associated 
with a marked deterioration in marital quality 5, 7, 8. In addition, there is research 
suggesting that the mental health of fathers has an impact on children's psychosocial 
development 9, 10, but evidence is limited regarding the influence of paternal mental health 
in the early postnatal period 11, 12, which may be a time of particular vulnerability for the 
developing infant 13, 14. For example, we have previously shown in this cohort of families 
that depression in fathers in the postnatal period is independently associated with an 
increased risk of behavioral problems in their children at the age of 3 years 11. However, 
further systematic research on epidemiological samples is needed before intervention studies 
are pursued, because we do not yet know if the exposure to depression in fathers has 
persisting effects on children's development15, as has been found in mothers. This paper 
aims to test this novel developmental-clinical hypothesis by examining associations between 
depression in fathers in the postnatal period and children's psychiatric and wider 
psychological outcome at the age of 7 years. This is of particular significance in that it goes 
beyond considering behavioural problems in the early preschool years to examine 
diagnosable, and clinically significant, psychiatric disorder in older children. 


The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a longitudinal cohort 
study set up to collect comprehensive data on a large population sample of children and their 
parents from early pregnancy through childhood16. Pregnant mothers were recruited from 
the Bristol area of the UK. This is a mixed urban and rural population of approximately 1 
million, with both deprived and affluent communities represented. All pregnant women due 
to deliver their baby between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, were eligible. There 
were 13,822 women with live children 28 days after birth. 13,351 mothers agreed to 
participate in the study and were sent a questionnaire 8 weeks after the birth of their child. 
12,884 (96.5%) of the respondents had partners and more than 99% of these men were 
identified as the father of the child. Questionnaires were sent to mothers and fathers at 
regular points during and after pregnancy. Data were available for depressive symptoms for 
10,975 (85.2%) men at one or more time point - 9,846 (76.4%) men pre-natally, 8,332 
(64.7%) men at 8 weeks postnatal, 7,090 (55.0%) at 8 months and 6,101 (47.4%) at 21 
months. Data were available for 4,792 (37.1%) men from all four time points, and analyses 
were undertaken for this group, and for the sample of 10, 975 by imputing missing data (see 
below). All participants provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the 
ALSPAC Ethics and Law committee and local research ethics committees. 

Fathers were assessed in week 18 of their partners' pregnancy and at 8 weeks, 8 months and 
21 months after the birth of their infant. Their children were assessed at ages 6 years (81 
months) and 7 years (91 months) by maternal and teacher report. These two time points 


 


were used to provide information about psychiatric diagnoses for children as well as their 
broader psychological functioning. 
Main parental measures—The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used 
to assess symptoms of depression in both fathers and mothers. The EPDS is a well validated, 
widely used, self-report questionnaire that consists of ten items17. Although the EPDS was 
developed to screen for depression in women postnatally, it has been shown to be useful in 
the assessment of mothers outside the postnatal period and has been validated in men18, 19. 
Although the scale does not provide a diagnosis, scores of more than 12 do identify a likely 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder in women with a high specificity (95·7%) and 
sensitivity (81·1%)18. The EPDS has been used in a number of studies with men, although 
there is more limited information available regarding suitable cut-off levels for men 19. 
Estimates of sensitivity range from 71% to 86% and specificities range from 75% to 94%. 
We therefore used the cut-off of above 12 for both mothers and fathers for comparability, 
and describe the group that scored more than 12 as the depressed group in each case. 
The 8-item anxiety subscale of the Crown Crisp Experiential Index (CCEI) was used to 
assess anxiety symptoms. The CCEI is a validated self-report questionnaire and has been 
used in a number of studies 20, 21. A cut-off score of the top 15% has previously been used 
in research 21 and is used here to indicate a high level of anxiety. 
Main child measures—A questionnaire measure of children's emotional and behavioral 
functioning (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) was used at age 6 years (81 
months), and a structured psychiatric questionnaire (the DAWBA) at age 7 years (91 
months). 
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was completed by parents (mothers in 
97.6% of cases). It is a widely used and validated screening questionnaire with reasonable 
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.73), and retest stability (mean: 0.62)22, 23. It was 
developed from the Rutter questionnaires, which have been employed extensively since their 
use in a number of key epidemiological studies in the 1960's and 1970's 24. The SDQ 
consists of 25 questions, which divide into five subscales, (emotional problems, 
hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems, and a prosocial score). The first 4 subscale 
scores can be combined to give a total difficulties score, and all the subscales and the total 
score are used here. As the distributions of SDQ scores were significantly skewed in this 
population sample, the scores were categorized into strata of between 5 and 7 groups per 
subscale (the exact number of strata being dictated by the distribution of the data and the 
need to maintain the proportional odds assumption). 
The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was completed by parents 
(mothers in 97.8% of cases) and teachers when the children were 7 years old. The 
questionnaires inquire about psychiatric symptoms and their resultant impact to generate 
DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses 25, 26. As part of the questionnaires, parents and teachers 
are asked to provide written details of the nature of each of the symptoms, and how they 
impact on the child's functioning. The questionnaire responses are entered into a computer 
program that integrates the information and provides likely diagnoses where appropriate. 
These are then assessed by experienced clinical raters who decide whether to accept or 
overturn the computer diagnosis (or lack of diagnosis) in the light of their review of all the 
data. The DAWBA has been validated 25, and used in a National Survey of over 10,000 
children and adolescents in the UK 26. 
Other information obtained—Questions were also asked to obtain the following 
information: 1) Past history of severe depression and family history of depression – as 


 


reported by affected parent (yes/no response). 2) The age of the father at the time of the 
child's birth. 3) Paternal educational level (measured as a binary response, degree level 
education or not). 4) Crowding: a measure of the degree of crowding in each family's home. 
5) The number of other children in the family at the time of the child's birth. 

The analysis was undertaken in five stages. First, we estimated the prevalence of depression 
using a cut-off score of over 12 on the EPDS, and calculated median scores for depression in 
fathers at the four time points. Second, we examined whether any characteristics of father, 
mother or family structure (i.e. family size) predicted depression in fathers soon after the 
birth of their child (8 weeks). 
Third, we undertook univariable and multivariable analyses to examine the associations 
between postnatal depression (8 weeks) in fathers and later emotional and behavioral 
problems and psychiatric disorders in their children. We used logistic regression analyses to 
assess the association between paternal depression and child psychiatric outcome, and 
ordinal logistic regression to assess the association between paternal depression and the 
child's emotional and behavioral outcome (using SDQ scores). Prosocial scores were 
reversed (a higher score indicated fewer prosocial behaviors). Multivariable analyses were 
then undertaken for both sets of child outcomes to control for paternal educational level and 
depression in mothers. We also included other potential confounding variables in the 
preliminary models (socio-economic status, age of father, number of children in the family 
and crowding of accommodation), but these did not alter the associations seen over and 
above the effect of paternal educational level, and so were not used in the regression models 
presented here. We also conducted analyses separately for boys and girls, but no gender 
differences were found, and so results are presented for both genders combined. 
Fourth, we examined the child outcomes controlling for the effect of later depression in 
fathers to see if the associations seen were explained by later depression. We selected the 21 
month time point as this was the latest time for which we had data on paternal depression 
available. We undertook analyses for the whole sample and then separately for the sample 
with the small number of second twin births excluded (1%, n=114 of 10 024), to remove any 
effects of familial clustering. The results were not substantially different (1%-3% change in 
Odds Ratios), and so are reported for the whole sample. 
In the multivariable models, missing data on the confounding variables resulted in a 
significant sample loss (between 9% and 30% depending on the model). To account for any 
potential bias in the final adjusted estimates due to this dropout, we used a missing data 
imputation technique known as MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) 27 using 
the procedure in the STATA programme (Stata Corp) known as mvis 28. MICE uses an 
iterative multivariable regression technique to cycle through the dataset. Each variable in 
turn is treated as the ‘outcome’ and any missing data are predicted from the remaining 
variables, incorporating a random element to allow for the uncertainty in this variable's true 
value. The imputation was restricted to the confounding variables (maternal depression, 
paternal educational level, and later paternal depression). The main exposure (paternal 
depression at 8 weeks) and outcome variables (DAWBA or SDQ) were not imputed. Further 
detail on the MICE procedure is available on the Journal's Web site at www.jaacap.com 
through the ArticlePlus feature. 
Finally, given our previous finding of an association between paternal depression in the 
postnatal period and high levels of behavioral problems in children at age 3 years, we 
examined the data for continuities from ages 3 to 7 years. For the main clinical outcome 
(psychiatric diagnosis) we were unable to determine whether there were “new onset” cases 


 


following the earlier assessment at age 3 years, as similar psychiatric diagnostic assessment 
had not been undertaken at age 3 years. However, with the data available we were able to 
examine whether behavioral problems at age 3 mediated the relationship between paternal 
depression and Oppositional/Conduct disorder diagnoses at age 7 years. 

Questionnaires were completed about children's behavior at age 6 years for 8401 children; 
6075 (72.3%) of these had fathers who provided data on depression at 8 weeks postnatally. 
Psychiatric diagnoses were available for 8195 children and 5924 (72.3%) of these had 
fathers who participated at 8 weeks. Compared to participating families, those families 
where fathers did not participate at 8 weeks were more likely to come from lower socio- 
economic groups (Chi2 205.3, d.f. 6; p<0.01). The children in these families were no more 
likely to develop Oppositional/Conduct Disorders, although they did have higher rates of 
anxiety disorders (Odds Ratio 1.44, 95% Confidence Interval 1.11 to 1.87). The children of 
fathers with high depressive symptom scores 8 weeks postnatally were somewhat less likely 
to remain in the study at the 7 year follow-up (64.0% vs 70.5%; p=0.016), and this sub- 
group of fathers were more likely to be separated from their partners by the time their child 
was 8 months old (9.1% vs 2.4%; p<0.001). Depression scores in mothers and fathers were 
correlated at each time point (r=0.26-0.31; all p values<0.001). 
The median scores on the depression scale, and the proportion of participants with high 
scores, are shown in Table 1. Median scores and the percentage depressed in the group that 
answered all four questionnaires, are shown in the first two columns. In the third column the 
percentage depressed is shown when data were imputed for missing depression scores where 
fathers answered one or more questionnaire (total n=10,975). Although the proportion of 
fathers scoring >12 did not change significantly across the period, median prenatal scores 
were higher than those at 8 weeks postnatal (Willcoxon Signed Rank Test, Z=-7.821; 
p<0.001). 

A range of factors were found to independently predict depression in fathers in the postnatal 
period (see Table 2). These were: a past history of severe depression (as measured by father 
self-reported history), prenatal depression, prenatal anxiety, lower educational level, having 
other children, and maternal prenatal depression. 
Depression in fathers in the postnatal period and children's subsequent psychiatric 
disorders and emotional and behavioral functioning 
Depression in fathers in the postnatal period (8 weeks postnatal) was strongly associated 
with later psychiatric diagnoses in their children at age 7 years (see Table 3). The potential 
clinical significance of this is illustrated by the finding that 12% of the children of depressed 
fathers developed a psychiatric disorder, compared to 6% of those children whose fathers 
had not been depressed. Of the specific categories of disorder examined, a significant 
association was seen with Oppositional/Conduct Disorders. Following adjustment for 
maternal depression in the postnatal period and fathers' educational level, there remained a 
66% increase in the odds for any psychiatric diagnosis (OR 1.66 (1.05, 2.63); p=0.030) and 
a near doubling of the odds of oppositional/conduct disorders (OR 1.97 (1.08, 3.58); 
p=0.026) for children of depressed fathers. The comparable effects associated with maternal 
depression were a doubling of the odds for both outcomes - any psychiatric diagnosis (OR 
2.31 (1.73, 3.08)); oppositional/conduct disorders (OR 2.21 (1.47, 3.31)). 


 


Depression in fathers in the postnatal period was also associated with increased scores on 
the prosocial (reverse-scored), hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems and total 
problems scales of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 6 years (see Table 4). 
Following adjustment for the potential confounding effects of maternal depression and 
paternal educational level the associations with social difficulties remained: peer problems 
(OR 1.46 (1.13, 1.90);p=0.004) and prosocial problems (OR 1.29 (1.01, 1.66);p=0.045). 
This represents the increased odds ratio across each step-increase in score. By including 
questions on peer problems and prosocial behaviors, the SDQ gives a broader index of 
behavioral and social adjustment, and so complements the psychiatric diagnoses available 
from the DAWBA. In those domains where associations with paternal depression were 
found, the magnitude of effect was either smaller than that seen for maternal depression (e.g. 
Effect Sizes 0.19 vs 0.4 for conduct problems) or, in the case of peer problems, the same (ES 
0.28). 
We then controlled for the effects of later depression in fathers (at 21 months). Adjusting for 
this later depression (and imputing these data where missing) led to little attenuation in the 
associations between depression in the postnatal period and child psychiatric disorders (any 
psychiatric disorder (OR 1.72 (1.07, 2.77)) and specifically oppositional/conduct disorders 
(1.94 (1.04, 3.61)). A robust association with peer problems scores on the SDQ also 
remained (1.37 (1.04, 1.80)). 
Finally, we tested for continuity from behavioral problems at age 3 years to psychiatric 
diagnosis at age 7 years, and whether behavioral problems at age 3 mediated the relationship 
between paternal depression and Oppositional/Conduct disorder diagnoses at age 7 years. 
Children with Oppositional/Conduct Disorders at age 7 years had higher mean behavioral 
problem scores at age 3 years compared to those without these disorders - of about one full 
standard deviation difference in magnitude (Rutter conduct scale means (5.89 (S.D. 2.87) vs 
3.50 (2.27); p<0.001), and they were more likely to be in the group identified as having high 
levels of problems at age 3 years (39.8% vs 10.3%; OR 5.78 (4.39, 7.60); p<0.001). In 
addition, the relationship between paternal depression in the postnatal period and 
Oppositional/Conduct problems at age 7 years, was substantially mediated by child 
behavioral problems at age 3 years (adj. OR 1.58 (0.78, 3.19)). 

To our knowledge this is the first population cohort study to demonstrate a clear association 
between depression in fathers in the postnatal period and later psychiatric disorders in their 
children. This association is independent of maternal postnatal depression, psychosocial risk, 
and depression in fathers after the postnatal period, at 21 months. 
The findings highlight three important factors regarding depression in men in the postnatal 
period. First, depression in men is relatively common. Overall, the rates of depression found 
in this study are comparable with prevalence estimates from other studies using 30-day rates 
(e.g. 2.4% in men in the Australian National Survey 29), although lower than in studies that 
have used longer time frames (such as the 12 month prevalence rates of 6% seen in the 
National Comorbidity Study 30). There is a suggestion from these findings that depressive 
symptoms are even more common in the prenatal period than postnatally, although the 
proportion of fathers with very high scores changes little across this period. There has been 
limited previous work investigating the course of depression during the perinatal period, 
although some research suggests that men experience higher levels of stress prenatally, and 
that there is not a significant increase in symptoms thereafter 5. Similar patterns of 
depression have also been seen in women31. 


 


Second, depression in fathers in the postnatal period was strongly predictive of increased 
rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly oppositional defiant or conduct disorders, in their 
children 7 years later, as well as increased rates of social difficulties. These findings 
complement and contrast with the large number of studies examining the effect of postnatal 
depression in mothers on children's social, emotional and cognitive development 13, 15. 
Although our understanding of the father's role in child development has increased 
significantly in recent years 32, 33, there has been very little longitudinal research 
examining the association between paternal depression early in children's lives and their 
subsequent development 11, 12. This study is the first to demonstrate an association with 
psychiatric disorder, particularly oppositional defiant or conduct disorders. It is also notable 
that these are findings from a large, prospective study using a community sampling frame, 
and that maternal depression effects were controlled for in the analyses. 
Previous work has pointed to an increased risk of behavioral problems in children of fathers 
with depression 11, but the current findings point to a persisting, and clinically significant 
level of disturbance, with more significant implications for the future functioning of the 
children, and for society. Conduct problems at this age are strongly predictive of later 
serious conduct problems, increased criminality, and significantly increased societal costs34. 
Depression in fathers seems specifically related to behavioral and peer relationship 
difficulties, whereas maternal depression appears to be associated with a broader spectrum 
of child disturbance 3. This relative specificity of the link between paternal depression and 
more antisocial behavior in the child may reflect the father's role in socializing children, or 
an association between depression in fathers and more disruptive parenting. Depression, 
with core symptoms of low mood, lack of energy and loss of interest, is likely to severely 
disrupt the ability of any parent to undertake the tasks of parenting, particularly affecting the 
day-to-day interactions of parent and child 3, 9. It is unclear whether the very early days of a 
child's life are a particularly sensitive period during which the infant is more vulnerable to 
the effects of stressors such as parental depression 13, 35. The finding from this study, that 
paternal depression early in the child's life is associated with these persisting problems, even 
controlling for later paternal depression, raises the intriguing possibility that such a sensitive 
period might be operative, particularly in relation to the effects of parental depression. 
However, we were not able to control for concurrent depression at age 7 years, and so 
further research is required to test this question in more detail. 
Third, factors including a past history of depression (as measured by father self-reported 
history), and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the prenatal period, are strongly 
predictive of depression in the postnatal period in men. Prenatal depression in the female 
partners of these men was also related to an increased risk of postnatal depression in the 
men. The co-occurrence of depression in partners 11, 36 and the consequences of depression 
in one partner for the other are important factors for family functioning and the developing 
child 37. It may be that effects previously attributed solely to maternal depression are, in 
fact, partly accounted for by paternal effects or factors related to both parents38. The 
difficulties often experienced in researching men's health, such as relatively high attrition 
rates, lead to an under-involvement of men in research and so a poorer understanding of 
many men's health issues. This is perhaps particularly the case for psychiatric research 
(which has tended to ignore men's – and fathers' - health) and the study of family life and 
child development, undermining our understanding of these important issues. 
This study has a number of key strengths. It is based on a large population cohort study and 
so is free of the selection biases inherent in studying clinical populations. The data were 
collected prospectively. The psychiatric diagnoses in the children were based on a structured 
clinician assessment incorporating questionnaire data from parents and teachers. There are 
limitations to consider. First, the assessment of depression in the fathers was based on a 


 


questionnaire report (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)). However, the 
EPDS is the most widely used and validated questionnaire for depressive symptoms in the 
postnatal period, and has been validated in men as well as women. Misclassification is 
unlikely to be related to the outcome in such a way that a systematic bias would be 
introduced. Second, although the associations seen were robust when controlling for some 
important potential confounding variables, it remains possible that the findings are in part 
due to some other (unmeasured) confounding factors, such as early marital difficulties. 
Similarly, we were unable to control for depression in the father at ages 6 and 7 years, and 
so it is possible that some of the effect seen was due to concurrent effects of depression 
rather than depression early in the child's life. We were able to overcome this to some extent 
by controlling for depression at a later time point (21 months), and also by having mothers 
report on the children's functioning. While a later report of depression would have been 
ideal, the minimal attenuation seen when depression at 21 months was controlled for, does 
suggest that this may not have altered the findings. Third, there was significant attrition from 
the study over the time period studied. This is common across most longitudinal studies, but 
may have had an effect on the results seen. Fathers from lower socio-economic groups were 
less likely to participate in the study and so this may limit somewhat the generalizability of 
the findings. In addition those fathers with higher levels of depressive symptoms were more 
likely to provide incomplete data. However, this should have had the effect of making it 
more difficult to identify associations with paternal depression. We have attempted to 
overcome this problem by imputing missing data on confounding variables, including later 
depression. Such a strategy provides more robust estimates, and it is reassuring that similar 
findings were obtained when the same analyses were undertaken with and without the use of 
imputation. However, the attrition seen in this study does highlight an important point about 
researching men's health. It is generally more difficult to involve fathers (and men in 
general) in medical research, perhaps particularly that which involves the study of 
psychological factors. This has been one of the factors that have led to men being left out of 
many studies of child development, with a consequent under-estimation of their role and 
importance in family life. 
Overall this study highlights the importance of depression in men in the postnatal period. 
The findings suggest that depression may have an impact not only on the men themselves 
but also on the development of their children. Perinatal services, where they exist, currently 
focus on mothers. While we recognize the primacy of the maternal role, it is important to 
consider broadening the focus of such services. A wider family focus would encompass the 
common co-occurrence of depression in mothers and fathers. Although fathers do not have 
as much contact with perinatal services, such as obstetric and primary healthcare, it would 
be possible to involve them more actively – something that may have positive spillover 
effects for the mother. Screening questionnaires, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale, used here, are reasonable screening tools in men, as well as women. If the findings of 
the present study are confirmed in other populations, then the identification of depression in 
fathers could represent an important opportunity for prevention: to improve fathers' health, 
family functioning, and children's future psychiatric and social functioning39, 40. Given the 
strong association of postnatal depression in men with previous depression and depressive 
symptoms during their partner's pregnancy, fathers at risk could be identified.
