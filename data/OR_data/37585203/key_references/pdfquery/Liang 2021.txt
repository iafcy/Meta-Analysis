Abstract 
This Taiwan study examined the associations of parental age and mental disorders with the offspring risks of attention-deficit/ 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder 
(BD). Children born between January 1991 and December 2004 in Taiwan were enrolled as the birth cohort (n = 4,138,151) 
and followed up until December 2011. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the odds ratio (OR). The 
advanced age effects were significant in ADHD (range of OR: 1.04 to 1.49) and ASD (range of OR: 1.35 to 2.27). Teenage 
mothers, teenage fathers, and fathers ≥ 50 years had higher offspring risks of MDD (range of OR: 1.24 to 1.46); and teenage 
mothers and fathers ≥ 50 years had increased offspring risks of BD (range of OR: 1.23 to 1.87). Both paternal and maternal 
mental disorders were associated with higher risks of within-disorder transmission for ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD (range 
of OR: 2.64 to 30.41). Besides, parents with one of these four mental disorders (ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD) might have 
higher risk of cross-disorder transmission to at least one of the other three mental disorders in the offspring (range of OR: 1.35 
to 7.15). Parental age and mental disorders had complex and nuanced patterns in association with offspring mental disorders.

More than half of mental disorders start during childhood or 
adolescence, and mental disorders are the major contribu- 
tors to health-related disability in children and adolescence 
worldwide [1, 2]. According to the Global Burden of Dis- 
ease Study 2010 report, major depressive disorder (MDD) 
is the leading cause of the disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) in people younger than age 24 years, while autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) is the leading cause in children 
younger than age five years. The global burden of attention- 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is also significant, 
and ADHD is estimated to contribute to 491,500 DALYs 
in 2010 [2, 3]. Besides, suicide is one of the leading causes 
of youth mortality [2], and bipolar disorder (BD) is the sec- 
ond cause of first onset of lifetime suicide attempt among 
adolescents based on a national study in United States [4] 
and a meta-analysis addressing juvenile bipolar disorder and 
suicidality [5]. 
Among the risk factors for child and adolescent men- 
tal disorder, parental age and parental mental disorder 



 
 


have been suggested [6–10]. For example, epidemiologi- 
cal studies have suggested that offspring of older fathers 
(age ≥ 45 years) had increased risks of ADHD [6, 7], MDD 
[7], and BD [6, 7]; besides, offspring of older mothers 
(age ≥ 35 or > 40 vs age 25–29) had an increased risks of 
ASD [8], but not of ADHD, mood disorder, and psychotic 
disorder [9, 10]. A nationwide study in Danish reported 
that offspring of teenage parents had increased risks of 
several mental disorders, including MDD and BD [10]. 
On the other hand, the transgenerational transmission 
of mental disorder to offspring can be either in concord- 
ant association (within-disorder transmission, that is, 
developing the same disorder as their parent) or through 
broad-spectrum effects (cross-disorder transmission, that 
is, developing another mental disorder), although there is 
a strong tendency for within-disorder transmission [11, 
12]. For example, offspring of parents with MDD [11], BD 
[11], ADHD [12], and ASD [13] had higher risk for the 
same psychiatric disorder than controls {MDD, range of 
odds ratio [OR]: 1.91–42.13; BD, range of OR: 1.24–9.98; 
ADHD, hazard ratio = 45.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
[38.57, 52.78]; ASD, hazard ratio = 64.47, 95% CI [15.33, 
271.15]}. For cross-disorder transmission, a systematic 
review published in 2015 (including 76 studies) reported 
that children of parents with MDD had a 4.35-fold risk 
of developing BD (range of OR: 2.96–5.40), a 4.35-fold 
risk of developing conduct disorder/ADHD (range of 
OR: 1.59–10.78), and a 4.61-fold risk of developing non- 
specified mental disorders (range of OR: 2.05–9.75) [11]. 
Moreover, children of parents with BD had a 4.44-fold risk 
of developing MDD (range of OR: 1.24–9.98), a 6.10-fold 
risk of developing conduct disorder/ADHD (range of OR: 
0.29–17.00), and a 5.04-fold risk of developing non-spec- 
ified mental disorders (range of OR: 2.54–11.39). There 
are also studies examining cross-transmission on ADHD 
[12] and ASD [13], suggesting shared etiology for certain 
psychiatric disorders. 
To date, no study has simultaneously explored the effects 
of parental age and parental mental disorder on the risk of 
major psychiatric disorders in the offspring. We focused on 
two major neurodevelopmental disorders (ASD and ADHD) 
and two major mood disorders (MDD and BD) in child- 
hood and adolescence. We examined the relative influence 
of (maternal and paternal) older vs younger age with the 
four major mental disorders by using an Asian population- 
based database (four million offspring). We also investigated 
the risk of these four mental disorders in the offspring of 
parents with these four mental disorders. We hypothesized 
that paternal and maternal ages have different effects on 
these four mental disorders, and that these four mental dis- 
orders have different within- and cross-disorder transmis- 
sions. We believe our study findings may help make policy 
decisions regarding allocation of limited resources for the 
prevention and treatment of psychopathology in childhood 
and adolescence. 


The Taiwan's National Health Insurance, a mandatory 
universal health insurance program, offers comprehensive 
medical care coverage to all Taiwanese residents (more 
than 23 million people). The National Health Research 
Institute manages the National Health Insurance Research 
Database (NHIRD). The NHIRD consists of healthcare data 
from > 99% of the entire population of Taiwan. The National 
Health Research Institute audits and releases the NHIRD for 
scientific and study purposes. Individual medical records are 
anonymous to protect patient privacy and are linked based 
on each resident’s unique ciphered personal identification 
number. Comprehensive information of insured individuals 
is included in the database, such as demographic data, dates 
of clinical visits, diagnoses, and medical interventions. The 
registry for beneficiaries dataset included the demographic 
data (i.e., birthdate, sex, residence) of entire Taiwanese pop- 
ulation. A specialized dataset of mental disorders includ- 
ing all psychiatric medical records of insured individuals 
between 2001 and 2011 was used to identify individuals with 
mental disorders, including ADHD, ASD, BD, and MDD. 
Following the method of Chen et al. and Cheng et al., family 
kinships in the NHIRD were used for genealogy reconstruc- 
tion [13, 14]. Diagnostic codes used were based on the Inter- 
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clini- 
cal Modification (ICD-9-CM). The NHIRD has been used 
extensively in several epidemiologic studies [15–17]. This 
study was approved by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital 
institutional review board (2018-07-016AC). 

In this study, we enrolled children born between January 
1991 and December 2004 as the birth cohort and followed 
up until December 2011. The supplementary eTable 1 pro- 
vides the percentage of the recruited children to the entire 
study population between 1991 and 2004. Fathers and moth- 
ers of the enrolled children were identified for their age at 
childbirth with the subsequent risks of offspring mental 
disorders. We included both inpatients and outpatients and 
focused on four major mental disorders, including ADHD 
(ICD-9-CM code: 314), ASD (ICD-9-CM code: 299), BD 
(ICD-9-CM codes: 296 except 296.2, 296.3, 296.82 and 
296.9), and MDD (ICD-9-CM codes: 296.2 and 296.3). The 
diagnoses were made by board-certified psychiatrists. For 
the improvement of the diagnosis validity, the participants 



were required to visit the outpatient department at least 
thrice within one year. The level of urbanization (from level 
one, most urbanized region, to level five, least urbanized 
region) was also assessed for each participant in this study. 
A total of 4,138,151 live births in Taiwan between 1991 
and 2004 were enrolled and followed up until 2011. Table 1 
shows the paternal, maternal, and offspring demographics 
and characteristics. 

The F test was used for continuous variables and Pear- 
son’s χ2 test for nominal variables, where appropriate, for 
between-group comparisons. Logistic regression models 
were performed to examine the associations of parental age 
with the offspring mental disorders, with children whose 
parents were 25 to 29 years of age at the time of childbearing 
as the reference category [10]. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% 
CI was calculated from the logistic regression models, with 
adjustment of paternal age when considering the maternal 
age effects and vice versa. Besides, the model was adjusted 
for demographic data (children age, sex of children, income, 
and residence) and parental mental disorders (all ICD-9-CM 
classifications of mental disorders), because evidence sug- 
gested that sex, low socioeconomic status, and urbanicity 
were associated with the likelihoods of ASD and ADHD 
[18–20]. We also examined with the risk of mental disor- 
ders (ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD) in offspring of parents 
with mental disorders compared with controls of parents 
without mental disorder, after adjustment for demographic 
data (parental age at childbirth, sex of children, income, 
and residence). Continuous variables were presented with

tistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version

Software (SAS) version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 

We found a positive linear relationship between increasing 
parental age (paternal and maternal) and the risk of offspring 
ADHD (Table 2). Compared with parents aged 25–29 years, 
younger fathers (aged < 20 years) and younger mothers 
(aged < 20, aged 20–24) had lower risks of offspring ADHD; 
in contrast, the ORs gradually increased in the offspring of 
both fathers and mothers older than 30 years compared with 
parents aged 25–29 years. 
Positive linear relationships were also observed for 
paternal and maternal ages and the risk of offspring ASD. 
Compared with parents aged 25–29 years, younger fathers 
(aged < 20 and aged 20–24) and young mothers (aged < 20 
and aged 20–24) had lower risks of offspring ASD; in con- 
trast, the ORs gradually increased in the offspring of both 
fathers and mothers older than 30 years compared with par- 
ents aged 25–29 years. The supplementary eTable 2 and 

eTable 3 provided the detailed statistics of the results of the 
logistic regression models. In brief, paternal and maternal 
ages showed positive linear relationships with both ADHD 
and ASD in offspring. 
We observed different relationships between age and the 
risk of mood disorders for MDD and BD (Table 3). Com- 
pared with the offspring of parents aged 25–29 years, pater- 
nal age showed a U-shaped relationship, with the offspring 
of teenage fathers (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.12, 1.66]) and 
fathers ≥ 50 years (OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.11, 1.93]) having a 
higher risk of MDD. The offspring risks of MDD were lower 
for fathers aged 30–34 years (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.83, 
0.93]), aged 35–39 years (OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.73, 0.85]), 
and aged 40–44 years (OR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.71, 0.92]) com- 
pared with that of fathers aged 25–29 years. Teenage moth- 
ers had a higher offspring risk of MDD (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 
[1.10, 1.39]) compared with the 25–29 age category. The off- 
spring risk of MDD was decreased in mothers ≥ 30 years of 
age; however, only the category of mothers aged 30–34 years 
had a statistically significant lower offspring risk of MDD 
(OR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.86, 0.98]). 
On the other hand, both paternal and maternal ages 
showed U-shaped relationships for the risk of BD; however, 
the increased risks were observed only in fathers ≥ 50 years 
(OR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.33, 2.64]) and teenage mothers 
(OR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.04, 1.45]). In brief, younger parents

offspring risk for ADHD and MDD than the controls. The 
paternal MDD was associated with a higher offspring risk 
for ADHD and BD than the controls. The paternal BD was 
associated with a higher offspring risk for MDD than the 
controls. For cross-disorder transmission in mothers, the 
maternal ADHD was associated with a higher offspring risk 
for ASD, MDD, and BD. The maternal ASD was associated 
with a higher offspring risk for ADHD, MDD, and BD. The 
maternal MDD was associated with a higher offspring risk 
for ADHD and BD. The maternal BD was associated with 
a higher risk for ADHD, ASD, and MDD. In brief, among 
ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD, parents with one of these four 
mental disorders might have cross-disorder transmission to 
one of the other three mental disorders in the offspring. 

This is the largest population-based study examining the 
impact of parental age and mental disorders on the offspring 
risks of mental disorder. The principal findings were as fol- 
lows: (1) paternal and maternal ages showed positive lin- 
ear relationships with both ADHD and ASD in offspring; 
(2) parents < 20 years and fathers ≥ 50 years had higher 
offspring risks of MDD; (3) fathers ≥ 50 years and teenage 
mothers had increased offspring risks of BD; (4) both pater- 
nal (ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD) and maternal (ADHD, 
ASD, MDD, and BD) mental disorders were associated with 
higher risks of within-disorder transmission for ADHD, 
ASD, MDD, and BD; and (5) offspring of parents with one 
of these four mental disorders (ADHD, ASD, MDD, and 
BD) had a higher risk of cross-disorder transmission to at 
least one of the other three mental disorders. 
Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have provided 
strong evidence regarding the association of advanced pater- 
nal [21] and maternal [8] ages at childbearing with increased 
offspring risk of ASD, which is consistent our study find- 
ings. However, there are inconsistent results regarding the 
association of parental age with ADHD in offspring. Most 
population-based studies reported younger paternal [10, 
22, 23] or maternal [10, 22–25] ages being associated with 
increased offspring risk of ADHD, although some reported 
an increased offspring risk in older fathers [6, 10] or a lack 
of association between paternal age and ADHD in offspring 
[7]. In this study, both younger fathers (< 20 years) and 
mothers (≤ 24 years) at childbearing were associated with a 
decreased offspring risk of ADHD, while older fathers and 
mothers at childbearing were associated with an increased 
offspring risk of ADHD. The decreased risk in younger par- 
ents and the increased risk in older mothers have not been 
reported in previous studies, most of which were conducted 
in the Western countries. A meta-analysis reported that the 
prevalence of ADHD varies worldwide, which is associated 
with diagnostic criteria, source of information, requirement 
of impairment for diagnosis, and geographic origin [26]. In 
addition, in Taiwanese population, ADHD has been found to 
highly co-aggregate with ASD [12], which showed a positive 
linear relationship between parental age and offspring risk of 
ASD. Therefore, in Taiwanese population, there could be a 
monotonic positive linear relationship between parental age 
and offspring risk of ADHD. 
Population-based studies regarding the association 
between parental age and offspring mood disorders are 
limited. There was one study reporting an increased off- 
spring risk of MDD in younger parents and older fathers 
[10], which was consistent with our findings. The relation- 
ship between parental age and offspring BD is inconclusive. 
Our study found that teenage mothers and older fathers had 
increased offspring risks of BD, while the other age catego- 
ries had nonsignificant offspring risk of BD. Although our 
findings were completely consistent with a Danish popula- 
tion-based study [10], previous studies have reported various 
associations, such as a decreased risk in teenage parents, no 
association, a U-shaped relationship, a monotonic increase, 
and an increased risk in advanced parental age category [7]. 
The inconsistent findings may be related to challenges in 
differential diagnosis of BD [27, 28]. For example, the core 
symptom irritability of pediatric BD may also occur in ASD, 
MDD, ADHD, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant 
disorder [28]. Besides, it is suggested that diagnostic criteria 
of BD were not systematically applied in some clinical set- 
tings, leading to discrepancies between increasing billing 
diagnoses and a stable epidemiological prevalence of BD 
[28]. In brief, we suggested that younger parents and older 
fathers had higher offspring risks of MDD, while teenage 
mothers and older fathers had increased offspring risks of 
BD. 
We found that parent age effect on offspring risk of men- 
tal disorder might be different from that of parental mental 
disorder effect. The ORs of age effect on offspring risk of 
mental disorder range from 1.04 (95% CI [1.03, 1.05]) to 
2.27 (95% CI [1.93, 2.67]), with the largest OR of develop- 
ing ASD in children of older fathers (age 45–49 years and 
age ≥ 50 years). Besides, we found a lower risk of ADHD 
and ASD in offspring of teenage parents, and a lower risk of 
MDD in fathers aged between 30 and 44 years. However, the 
ORs of parental mental disorder effect on within-disorder 
transmission range from 2.64 (95% CI [2.33, 2.99]) to 30.41 
(95% CI [19.98, 46.27]), with the largest OR for offspring of 
mothers with ASD in developing ASD. The ORs of parental 
mental disorder effect on cross-disorder transmission range 
from 1.35 (95% CI [1.26, 1.44]) to 7.15 (95% CI [5.59, 
9.16]), with the largest OR for offspring of fathers with 
ADHD in developing ASD. A stronger tendency for within- 
disorder transmission than cross-disorder transmissions 
was similar to that of other studies [11–13]. A large-scale 



cross-disorder genome-wide meta-analysis investigated 
genomic relationships, novel loci, and pleiotropic mecha- 
nisms across 8 psychiatric disorders (including MDD, BD, 
ADHD, ASD) [29]. This study found that 109 loci at least 
affected 2 or more psychiatric disorders, and 23 loci had 
pleiotropic effects on 4 or more psychiatric disorders [29]. 
The authors concluded that these results highlight disparities 
between our clinically defined classification of psychiatric 
disorders and underlying biology. Integrating our findings 
and those of other studies suggested a complex within- and 
cross-disorder transgenerational transmission and differ- 
ent age effects on offspring risk of mental disorder, which 
require future comprehensive and extensive investigation. 
The finding of cross-disorder transmission suggests that 
cross-disorder approaches may be useful for studies explor- 
ing shared biological underpinnings between these mental 
disorders. However, early prevention programs are necessary 
for parents and their offspring in preventing offspring mental 
disorders and supporting them when their children devel- 
oped mental disorders. Targeting common pathophysiologi- 
cal and pathogenetic mechanisms may reduce the familiar 
risk of extending across different mental disorders. Besides, 
treatment can focus on alleviating the common predisposing 
factors for the development of various mental disorders, such 
as child abuse, physical maltreatment, lack of social sup- 
port, interpersonal conflict, and chronic economic disability. 
Future studies could examine the association of treatment 
of parental mental disorder and the common predisposing 
factors with the offspring risk of mental disorder. 
A strength of the current study is the sample size (four 
million participants). We used a nationwide population- 
based study and recruited all children born between Janu- 
ary 1991 and December 2004 as a birth cohort. We might 
avoid selection bias by using this representative sample. 
Therefore, our study findings may be generalizable to other 
non-Western populations. The second strength is that the 
Taiwan's National Health Insurance is low-cost and easily 
accessible. Therefore, most of the cases with clinical men- 
tal problems could be included. The third strength of this 
study is the validity of the diagnosis. All the diagnoses of 
mental disorders were made by board-certified psychiatrists 
and required these patients to visit the outpatient depart- 
ment at least thrice within one year. Fourth, our study is the 
first study to examine both parental age and parental mental 
disorder effects on the risk of mental disorders in offspring. 
Importantly, in addition to age and mental disorder of par- 
ents, several factors may also contribute to the development 
of mental disorder in offspring, such as maternal obesity 
[30], obstetric complications [31], personality disorder [32] 
or alcohol abuse [32]. Face-to-face interview would be nec- 
essary to further assess the complexity of risk factors for 
mental disorder in offspring. 
This study has several limitations. First, the prevalence 
of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD may have been underesti- 
mated. Only patients who sought medical consultation and 
treatment at least thrice within one year were included in 
this study. Second, the risk of MDD and BD may be under- 
estimated because MDD and BD may develop during adult- 
hood. In this study, the total follow-up duration was 21 years, 
and individuals with adult-onset MDD and BD may not have 
been diagnosed in our study sample. Third, several impor- 
tant psychosocial factors were not available in the NHIRD. 
For example, a study reported that the number of household 
members positively correlated with scores on good men- 
tal health [33]. Therefore, the interaction effects between 
parental age, parental mental disorders, and psychosocial 
factors on the offspring risk of mental disorders require 
further investigation. Fourth, the differences in diagnostic 
criteria between ICD and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (DSM) might be another source of bias. 
For example, a study reported that only 56% of patients met 
DSM-5 criteria of ASD in 150 patients with ASD diagnosed 
by the criteria of ICD-10 [34]. Five, we only examined four 
mental disorders. Maybe there are other distributions for 
parental and maternal risks when considering other men- 
tal disorders, which warrant future investigation. Sixth, the 
interactions between parental ages and parental mental dis- 
orders were not assessed in the regression models because 
so many interactions would be too complicated to be fairly 
interpreted. Whether the interactions between parental ages 
and parental mental disorders may need further investiga- 
tion. Finally, some information, such as level of education 
and immigrant status, was not available in the NHIRD and 
could, thus, not be controlled for. 

This is the first Asian population-based study to examine 
the complex effects of parental age and mental disorders on 
the offspring risks of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and BD using 
a sample of four million people from Taiwan. Our study 
suggest that psychiatrists should consider the risk of both 
within-disorder and cross-disorder familial transmission 
of major mental disorders, and the age of childbearing and 
the significant base rates of mental disorders in the general 
population. Psychiatrists should take these findings under 
consideration and offer information, social support, and pre- 
vention strategies no matter if the child was already born 
or if the parents want to have children. Parents with these 
mental disorders and their children need to get the oppor- 
tunity for prevention programs to prevent offspring mental 
disorders or to support them when their children developed 
mental disorders. Prevention strategies and social support 



for parents and children with mental disorders need to be 
implemented with a low threshold.
