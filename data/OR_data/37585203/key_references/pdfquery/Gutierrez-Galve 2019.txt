IMPORTANCE Paternal depression during the postnatal period has been associated with 
adverse child outcomes. Family environment has been reported as a pathway for risk 
transmission from fathers to children. The influence of paternal depression during the 
postnatal period on offspring depression remains to be clarified. 
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between paternal depression in the postnatal 
period and offspring depression and explore potential mediating and moderating factors that 
influence any association between paternal and offspring depression. 
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective study of a UK community-based birth 
cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) of parents and their adolescent 
offspring investigated associations between paternal depression during the postnatal period 
and offspring depression at age 18 years. We tested a hypothesized moderator (ie, sex) and 
conducted path analysis to examine hypothesized mediators (ie, depression in the other 
parent, couple conflict, and paternal involvement and emotional problems, conduct 
problems, and hyperactivity in offspring at age 3.5 years) of the associations between both 
paternal and maternal depression and offspring depression. Data collection for the Avon 
Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children began in 1991 and is ongoing. Data analysis for this 
study was conducted from June 2015 to September 2018. 

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Offspring depression symptoms at age 18 years, using 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision 
codes. 
RESULTS A total of 3176 father-offspring pairs were analyzed; of the children, 1764 were girls 
(55.5%) and 1412 (44.5%) were boys. Paternal mean (SD) age at delivery was 29.6 (9.6) years. 
The offspring of fathers who had depression during the postnatal period were at increased 
risk of experiencing depression symptoms at age 18 years (β = 0.053 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]). 
The association is mediated by maternal depression at 8 months after birth (β = 0.011 [95% 
CI, 0.0008-0.02]; 21% [0.011/0.053]) and conduct problems at 42 months after birth 
(β = 0.004; [95% CI , −0.00004 to 0.009]; 7.5% [0.004/0.053]). Couple conflict and 
paternal involvement do not mediate this association. The increased risk is seen in girls but 
not boys (interaction β = 0.095; P = .01). 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The association between paternal depression in the postnatal 
period and depression in girls at age 18 years is partially explained by maternal depression. 
Couple conflict and paternal involvement were not found to play a role in the risk of transmission; 
this contrasts with the role that couple conflict was found to play in the risk of childhood 
behavior problems. Conduct problems in childhood appear to be a pathway for risk transmission 
between paternal depression and subsequent depression in offspring at age 18 years.

4% and 5%. The incidence of depression increases af- 
ter puberty and is twice as high in girls as boys.1 The rate 
of depression increases with age from 5.7% among youth aged 
12 to 17 years to 7.4% among adults aged 18 to 39 years in the 
US population.2 A recent review study reported that the stron- 
gest risk factors for depression in adolescents are a family his- 
tory of depression and exposure to psychosocial stress.3 
The influence of maternal depression in the postnatal pe- 
riod on adolescent depression has previously been reported.4-6 
Mechanisms of risk transmission have also been investi- 
gated. Some longitudinal studies have suggested that the 
outcomes associated with early maternal depression are me- 
diated through exposure to later maternal depression or as- 
sociated psychosocial adversity.5,7-11 Insecure attachment to 
the mother in infancy was associated with depression in off- 
spring at age 16 years. In addition, marital conflict and ongo- 
ing maternal depression have been found to partially medi- 
ate the association of maternal postnatal depression with 
adolescent depression.4 
A recent longitudinal study12 using the Avon Longitudi- 
nal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort reported 
that offspring of mothers and fathers with depression in the 
postnatal period were more likely to develop depression at age 
18 years in families with low educational level. Conversely, hav- 
ing parents with depression in the postnatal period did not ap- 
pear to be a risk factor if parents had a high level of education.12 
However, the pathways for risk transmission between pater- 
nal depression and subsequent offspring depression still re- 
main to be determined. 
The moderating effect of sex on the association between 
maternal depression and offspring depression at age 18 years 
has been previously reported.13 Maternal antenatal depres- 
sion is associated with an increased risk of depression in girls, 
and maternal postnatal depression was associated with an 
increased risk of depression in boys.13 
There is, to our knowledge, very limited evidence regard- 
ing the potential influence of paternal depression in the post- 
natal period on the development of adolescent depression. 
However, there is clear evidence that paternal depression in 
the postnatal period is associated with subsequent child be- 
havioral and emotional problems at ages 4 years14 and 7 years.15 
We have previously reported on mechanisms of risk transmis- 
sion from paternal depression to child behavioral problems. 
We found that nearly two-thirds of the association between 
paternal depression and child outcomes were explained by the 
mediating roles of maternal depression and couple conflicts.16 
Using the same cohort, we sought in this study to explore 
the association between paternal depression in the postnatal 
period and offspring depression at age 18 years. We also aimed 
to explore key potential mediating and moderating factors in- 
fluencing the association between paternal and offspring 
depression.4 First, we hypothesized that paternal depression 
symptoms in the postnatal period would be associated with 
offspring depression symptoms at age 18 years. Second, we hy- 
pothesized that pathways for risk transmission from paternal 
depression to offspring depression at age 18 years would not 
differ from those seen in children with behavioral difficulties 
at age 42 months. Furthermore, emotional problems, con- 
duct problems, and hyperactivity at age 42 months would be 
pathways for risk transmission from paternal depression to off- 
spring depression. Finally, we hypothesized that the influ- 
ence of paternal depression could be stronger in girls than 
boys, because there is evidence17 suggesting the influence of 
a father’s involvement on later mental health problems in girls 
but not in boys. 

Participants 
The sample included participants from ALSPAC.18-20 The 
ALSPAC is an ongoing population-based cohort study in the 
Southwest of England. The ALSPAC recruited 14 541 pregnant 
women resident in Avon, United Kingdom, with expected dates 
of delivery between April 1, 1991, to December 31, 1992. An ad- 
ditional 713 children were enrolled during phases 2 and 3 of 
the study. The total sample size for analyses was 15 247 preg- 
nancies with 15 458 fetuses. Of this total sample, 14 775 (95.6%) 
were live births and 14 701 infants (95.1%) were alive at 1 year 
of age. Questionnaires were sent to mothers and fathers at regu- 
lar points during and after pregnancy. Detailed information 
about ALSPAC is available online (http://www.bris.ac.uk/ 
alspac), and the study website also contains details of all data 
in a fully searchable data dictionary (http://www.bristol.ac. 
uk/alspac/researchers/access/). 
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the 
ALSPAC law and ethics committee and local research ethics 
committees. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
study participants, including offspring at age 18 years. In this 
article, we focus on paternal depression during the postnatal 
period and offspring depression at age 18 years. 
Procedures and Measures 
Paternal Depression 
We used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to 
assess depression symptoms in mothers and fathers at 8 weeks 
and 8 months after the birth of their infants. The EPDS is a 10- 
item self-report questionnaire21 with a score range of 0 to 30 





Question What are the mechanisms of risk transmission from 
paternal depression during the postnatal period to offspring 
depression at age 18 years? 
Findings In this cohort study of 3176 father-offspring pairs, 
paternal depression in the postnatal period was associated with 
offspring depression at age 18 years and appears to exert its 
influence on later emotional problems in female children partially 
through maternal depression. Early conduct disorder in children 
appears to be a mechanism of risk transmission. 
Meaning Depression in fathers in the postnatal period has 
potential implications for family and child functioning into late 
childhood and adolescence; it should be addressed in perinatal 
services, and both parents should be considered when 1 presents 
with depression. 



points that was initially developed to screen for depression in 
women within the first 6 to 8 weeks after giving birth. It is also 
useful in the assessment of mothers through and beyond the 
first postnatal year and has been validated in men.22,23 Most 
studies using the EPDS use a cutoff score greater than 12 
points,14,24 although other studies have used other cutoffs (eg, 
9 points).25 We primarily used the continuous scores to make 
full use of all variation in symptoms. 
Offspring Depression 
Depression in the offspring was measured using the com- 
puterized version of the Clinical Interview Schedule– 
Revised (CIS-R).26 The CIS-R is a computerized interview 
that derives a diagnosis of depression according to Interna- 
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria, as well as symp- 
tom severity score for depression. The interview is fully 
standardized and equally reliable whether conducted by a 
clinically trained interviewer or self-administered on the 
computerized version.26-28 The CIS-R is designed for and 
has been widely used within community samples, including 
the National Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity and the 1958 
National Child Development Study.28-31 We used a total 
depressive symptom score derived by summing scores for 
depression, depressive ideas, fatigue, sleep, and concentra- 
tion problems, on a scale of 0 to 4 points (with depressive 
ideas scaled 0 to 5 points). 
Rutter Revised Preschool Scales 
Rutter Revised Preschool Scales32 were completed by moth- 
ers 42 months after the birth of their children. Each item 
describes a characteristic or behavior. Individual items com- 
bine to form 3 problem scales (emotional problems, conduct 
problems, and hyperactivity) and a prosocial behaviors 
scale. All problem behaviors combine to give a total prob- 
lems scale. 
Parental Age and Education 
Fathers and mothers reported their age at the time of the in- 
fant’s birth. Additionally, in week 32 of pregnancy, mothers 
were asked about the highest educational qualification of them- 
selves and their partners (who were typically the biological fa- 
ther of the infant). Education up to age 16 years (compulsory 
education only) was categorized as low education and educa- 
tion past age 16 years as high education. 
Couple Conflict 
At 8 months after the birth of their infant, mothers were asked 
about the relationships with their partners (as noted, typi- 
cally the biological father of the infant). A 9-item scale was 
used, which included questions such as “Do you get angry with 
your partner?” and “Does your partner listen when you want 
to talk about your feelings?” Possible answers range from “al- 
most always” to “never.” The scale was developed specifi- 
cally for the ALSPAC study and has been used in other 
research.33 A single factor structure (Cronbach α >.80 for ma- 
ternal and paternal data) explained the data, generating an 
overall measure of couple conflict. 
Paternal Involvement 
At 18 months after birth, mothers were asked how often their 
partners undertook 10 different activities with their child, in- 
cluding bathing, singing, reading, and putting him or her to bed. 
Responses were on a 5-point scale, from “never” to “every day.” 
A sum of all responses was the final score. 
Statistical Analysis 
Statistical analysis was carried out with Stata version 
12.0 (StataCorp) from June 2015 to September 2018. We 
calculated the prevalence of depression in adolescents, 
and then we conducted logistic regression analysis to assess 
the association of paternal depression with offspring 
depression. 
Bivariate correlations analyzed the degree of association 
between paternal depression at 8 weeks and 8 months after 
the birth, maternal depression at 8 weeks and 8 months 
after the birth, couple conflict, and paternal involvement; 
offspring emotional problems, conduct problems, and 
hyperactivity at 42 months; and offspring depression at age 
18 years. 
We conducted structural equation modeling to investi- 
gate hypothesized mediators between paternal and off- 
spring depression symptoms. The model included paternal 
depression at 8 weeks after the birth of the infant (indepen- 
dent variable), maternal depression at 8 weeks and 8 
months after the birth, paternal depression at 8 months 
after the birth, couple conflict, and paternal involvement, as 
well as offspring emotional problems, offspring conduct 
problems, and offspring hyperactivity at 42 months (media- 
tors) and offspring depression at age 18 years (dependent 
variable). We controlled for paternal education and age. We 
examined 2 types of associations between variables: (1) a 
direct association between paternal depression and off- 
spring depression; (2) an indirect association of paternal 
depression with offspring depression through each media- 
tor (Figure). Moderate to strong correlations were seen 
between paternal and maternal educ ation (r = 0.54; 
P < .001) and paternal and maternal age (r = 0.36; P < .001). 
Structural equation modeling was performed using maxi- 
mum likelihood estimation. Indirect associations were cal- 
culated using nonlinear combination of parameters (nlcom). 
To avoid relying on normality assumptions, a nonparamet- 
ric bootstrap with replacement, with 1000 replicates, was 
used. To investigate the moderating influence of sex on the 
association between paternal depression during the postna- 
tal period and offspring depression, we repeated the struc- 
tural equation modeling, stratifying by sex. 
We also assessed hypothesized mediators in the associa- 
tion between maternal depression at 8 weeks after the birth 
(independent variable) and offspring depression at age 18 years 
(dependent variable). Mediating factors were paternal depres- 
sion at 8 weeks and 8 months after the birth, maternal depres- 
sion at 8 months after the birth, couple conflict, and paternal 
involvement and offspring emotional problems, conduct prob- 
lems, and hyperactivity at age 42 months. We controlled for 
maternal education and age. Significance was set at P < .05, 
2-sided.

weeks and 8 months after the birth, paternal depression and couple conflict at 
8 months after the birth, and paternal involvement at 18 months after the birth. 
B, Offspring emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity were 
measured at age 42 months. CIS-R indicates Clinical Interview 
Schedule–Revised; EPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. 

Maternal postnatal depression was assessed in 11 833 of 13 351 
mothers (88.6%) and paternal depression in the postnatal pe- 
riod in 8431 of 12 884 fathers (65.4%). At age 18 years, 4566 ado- 
lescent offspring completed the CIS-R, and 235 of the 3165 ado- 
lescents (7.4%) with information about paternal depression at 
8 weeks after their birth had a primary diagnosis of depres- 
sion: 10 of 93 adolescents (10.8%) of fathers with depression 
and 225 of 3072 adolescents (7.3%) of fathers without depres- 
sion (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.78-2.98]). The influence of 
paternal depression symptoms on offspring depression 
symptoms is shown in the Table. Bivariate correlations are 
shown in the eTable in the Supplement. All variables were 
correlated. 
Models of Mediation 
A total of 3176 father-adolescent pairs were included in 
the path analysis. The total association of paternal depres- 
sion in the postnatal period with offspring depression at age 
18 years, after controlling for paternal education and age, 
was measured as a β value of 0.053 (95% CI, 0.02-0.09; 
bootstrapped 95% CI, 0.02-0.10; P = .004). This total 
association was explained by the indirect association of 
maternal depression at 8 months after the birth (β = 0.011

(β = 0.004 [95% CI, −0.001 to 0.009]; P = .12) did not 
explain this association (Figure). 
When stratified by sex, a total of 1764 girls and 1412 boys 
were included in the path analysis. The association between 
paternal depression symptoms and total symptoms of depres- 
sion in adolescents was stronger in girls than boys (paternal 
depression by sex interaction, β = 0.095; P = .01; girls at age 
18 years: β = 0.097 [95% CI, 0.04-0.15; bootstrapped 95% CI, 
0.04-0.15]; P < .001; boys at age 18 years: β = −0.002 [95% CI, 
−0.05 to 0.05]; P = .94). The total association of paternal de- 
pression with offspring depression in girls was explained by 
the indirect association with maternal depression at 8 months 
(β = 0.017 [bootstrapped 95% CI , 0.003-0.03]; 18% [0.017/ 
0.097]) and conduct problems at age 42 months β = 0.009 
[bootstrapped 95% CI, 0.0013-0.016]; 9.3% [0.009/0.097]). 
The association between paternal and offspring depression was 
not mediated by couple conflict and paternal involvement 
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Paternal depression during the 
postnatal period was not associated with offspring depres- 
sion in boys. 
We repeated the analysis using maternal depression at 8 
weeks after the birth of the infant as the exposure variable and 
offspring depression as the dependent variable. A total of 4062 
mother-adolescent pairs were included in the analysis. The 
total association of postnatal maternal depression with off- 
spring depression was defined by a β value of 0.097 (95% CI, 
0.07-0.12; P < .001). This was explained by the association with 
maternal depression at 8 months after the birth (β = 0.048 [95% 
CI, 0.012-0.084]; P = .009; 50% [0.048/0.097]) and mater- 
nal depression at 8 weeks after the birth (β = 0.03 [95% CI, 
0.007-0.053]; P = .01; 31% [0.03/0.097]) and minimally ex- 
plained by the indirect outcome of paternal involvement 
(β = 0.003 [95% CI, 0.0007-0.006]; P = .02; 3.3% [0.003/ 
0.097]) and conduct problems (β = 0.007 [95% CI, 0.0013- 
0.013]; P = .02; 7.2% [0.007/0.097]). Paternal depression and 
couple conflict did not explain this association (eFigure 2 in 
the Supplement). There was no sex interaction (β = 0.033; 
P = .21). 
This study explores the association of paternal depression 
symptoms at 8 weeks after the birth of an infant and depres- 
sion symptoms in that offspring at age 18 years in a large 
community sample. We also explored 8 potential environ- 
mental pathways that may explain this association. To con- 
duct pathway analysis, we used continuous measures of 
depression (ie, symptoms) instead of cases of clinical 
depression. Responses for a dichotomous variable are heav- 
ily skewed toward 1 response and comparison of 2 groups 
was not possible because too few participants met the 
threshold for clinical depression.33 
Our findings indicate that adolescent offspring of 
fathers who have depression during the postnatal period are 
at increased risk of experiencing depression symptoms at 
age 18 years, even after paternal age and education had 
been controlled for. The effect size is small, but it is still sig- 
nificant after 18 years of follow-up time. The increased risk 
is seen in girls but not boys. The mediating effect of mater- 
nal depression at 8 months explains one-fifth of the total 
association of paternal depression in the postnatal period 
with offspring depression, and conduct problems at age 3.5 
years explains almost one-tenth of this association. Con- 
versely, the total association of postnatal maternal depres- 
sion with subsequent offspring depression is minimally 
explained by paternal involvement and conduct problems. 
Our findings suggest that paternal depression during 
the postnatal period appears to exert its influence on late 
emotional problems in girls at least in part through maternal 
depression. Maternal depression has been previously asso- 
ciated with impaired parenting, particularly sensitive 
parenting.34 Mothers with depression may show less mater- 
nal responsiveness or sensitivity, less verbal and visual 
interaction, and more intrusiveness during interactions 
with their infants.35,36 
We had previously reported that couple conflict medi- 
ated the association between postnatal depression in fathers 
and child outcomes at 3.5 years after a birth.16,37 However, 
the role of couple conflict appears to be less important for 
offspring adolescents with depression than child behavioral 
problems. Paternal involvement was not found to play a role 
in the risk of offspring depression, although we did not have 
suitable data to explore the quality of parent-infant interac- 
tion. In addition, mediators were measured early in child life, 
and we did not measure these variables throughout the time 
period. 
Our group previously reported that boys were more vul- 
nerable to the influence of paternal depression than girls in their 
early years.14 However, we have found that girls with fathers 
with depression during the postnatal period are at risk of de- 
veloping depression after puberty, but such risk is not seen in 
boys. One study17 has reported an association between par- 
enting father–infant interaction and later emotional develop- 
ment only in girls. The association of paternal depression dur- 
ing the postnatal period through father-infant interaction might 
affect boys in the short term and girls in the longer term. In

this study, we were unable to include this pathway, because 
this was not assessed. 
The association between maternal depression and offspring 
depression differed from the patterns seen with fathers. Other 
studies have found these differences are explained by other fac- 
tors, such as maternal depression,9 mother-child interaction,34 
higher genetic loading in mothers,38-40 or transmission of cog- 
nitive style.41 Additionally, the association between maternal de- 
pression during the postnatal period and depression in offspring 
did not show a sex-specific outcome. A previous meta-analysis 
reported no differences by sex in the association between ma- 
ternal depression and internalizing problems.10 
In this study, we found that early-onset conduct problems 
in offspring mediated the association between depression in fa- 
thers during the postnatal period and depression in adoles- 
cents; however, early emotional problems did not explain such 
an association. This finding is consistent with previous re- 
search that reported conduct problems in early childhood are 
a strong risk factor for subsequent depression.3,42 
Strengths 
This study has a number of strengths. The sample size is large 
and based on a community sample, limiting the possibility of 
selection bias. This is a long-term follow-up study, with the 
proposed mediating factors measured at a point between the 
measured factor and outcome. Paternal depression was first 
measured 18 years earlier than the measure of offspring depres- 
sion; as a result, reverse causality is implausible. A clinical in- 
terview was used for the offspring outcome. 
Limitations 
There were a number of limitations of the study. Adolescents 
who attended the 18-year assessment were more likely to come 
from families of higher socioeconomic status than those in the 
original sample. A further limitation was the lack of a mea- 
sure of paternal depression when the child was 18 years. It is 
also important to note that the paternal depression measure 
was a self-report rather than a diagnostic interview. The use 
of questionnaires to assess father involvement with no di- 
rectly observed measures did not allow us to assess the influ- 
ence of paternal depression through parenting interactions. De- 
pression in the adolescents was assessed using a computerized 
interview. Any form of measurement has some limitations; 
however, rates of depression diagnoses yielded from the 
computerized CIS-R assessments are generally similar to those 
produced by other structured interview assessments.27,30 Fi- 
nally, the lag time between the mediator and the outcome vari- 
able was considerably larger than between the independent 
variable and the mediator. 

This study suggests that there is an association between depres- 
sion in fathers during the postnatal period and subsequent de- 
pression in girls at age 18 years. Such an association is ex- 
plained predominantly by the influence of maternal depression 
(21%). In contrast, the association between depression in moth- 
ers and adolescent outcome differs from that seen in fathers. 
Other research suggests that it may be better explained by other 
factors, including the association of depression with mother- 
infant interaction, genetic loading, and transmission of nega- 
tive cognitions. Early conduct disorder in children appears to be 
a mechanism of risk transmission between depression in fa- 
thers and subsequent depression at age 18 years. Overall, these 
findings highlight the importance of recognizing and treating de- 
pression in fathers during the postnatal period and considering
