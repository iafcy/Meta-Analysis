### Abstract

While an accumulating body of research has documented increased risk for psychopathology
among children of depressed fathers, most studies have used cross-sectional design and little is
known about offspring outcomes beyond childhood. Using prospective data from a community
sample (N = 395), we found that paternal depressive symptoms when children were in early
adolescence (age 13) predicted offspring depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 21, controlling
for baseline youth symptoms, maternal depressive symptoms, and other known correlates of
internalizing problems in early adulthood. Associations were not moderated by maternal
depressive symptoms or child gender. These results suggest that the unique and long-term effects
of paternal depression on children's risk for mood disorders may persist into adulthood.


Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for psychiatric disorders and
developmental difficulties (for reviews, see Beardslee, Versage, & Gladstone, 1998;
Downey & Coyne, 1990; Goodman & Gotlib, 2002; Hammen, 2008). A wealth of research
has documented significant associations between maternal depression and children's risk for
impaired cognitive functioning, major depression, clinical levels of depressive and anxiety
symptoms, and behavioral problems (for meta-analysis, see Goodman et al., 2011). Much
less attention has been directed toward the adverse effects of paternal depression on
children's psychological health (Phares, 1996; Phares, Duhig, & Watkins, 2002). To
illustrate, in a review of 514 articles related to child and parent psychopathology published

between 1992 and 2005, 45% included mothers only, 2% included fathers only, 25%
included both mothers and fathers and analyzed the data separately, and 28% included both
mothers and fathers but either failed to indicate parent gender or did not analyze the data
separately (Phares, Fields, Kamboukos, & Lopez, 2005). The lack of research on children of
depressed fathers is likely due to a number of factors, including the higher prevalence of
depression in women, the widespread assumption that fathers are relatively unimportant to
the social-emotional development of their children, and a historical tendency to attribute
children's psychological problems to mothers rather than fathers (Phares, Lopez, Fields,
Kamboukos, & Duhig, 2005). Another possible reason for the disproportionate focus on
maternal versus paternal depression is that fathers may be more difficult to recruit for
research on child development (e.g., Cassano, Adrian, Veits, & Zeman, 2006).

Recent evidence indicates that fathers have more influence on their children than previously
thought (Jaffee, Moffitt, Caspi, & Taylor, 2003). For example, social scientists have begun
to recognize the importance of paternal depression, both in terms of prevalence and in
relation to children's psychological functioning (for recent reviews, see Bradley & Slade,
2011; LeFrancois, 2012; Paulson & Bazemore, 2010; Ramchandani & Psychogiou, 2009).
Studies have shown that depression rates are not significantly different for mothers and
fathers during pregnancy (Field, Diego, & Hernandez-Reif, 2006) and that an estimated 21%
of fathers experience at least one episode of major depression by the time children reach 12
years of age (Davé, Petersen, Sherr, & Nazareth, 2010). A growing body of work has
demonstrated that, beginning in infancy and continuing throughout childhood, offspring of
depressed fathers are at elevated risk for a number of psychiatric problems (e.g., Field,
Diego, & Hernandez-Reif, 2010; Greene, Pugh, & Roberts, 2008; Gross, Shaw, Moilanen,
Dishion, & Wilson, 2008; Manning & Gregoire, 2006; Ramchandani et al., 2008,
Ramchandani, Stein, Evans, & O'Connor, 2005; Spector, 2006; Weitzman, Rosenthal, &
Liu, 2011). Two meta-analyses (Connell & Goodman 2002; Kane & Garber, 2004) have
associated paternal depression with children's risk for psychopathology; some evidence
suggests comparable effects of maternal and paternal depression on offspring outcomes
(e.g., Jacob & Johnson, 1997; Marchand & Hock, 1998). Less is known about how—or
under which circumstances—depression in fathers conveys risk to children.


Previous research on children of depressed fathers has been limited by several factors. For
example, the majority of studies have relied on cross-sectional data, thus precluding
inferences about causation and direction of effect. Of the few existing longitudinal studies,
most have not controlled for initial levels of child psychopathology, thereby limiting
conclusions about paternal depression as a risk factor for children's maladjustment. Another
methodological limitation of this literature has been a failure take into account
characteristics of the family environment that could confound statistical relationships
between paternal depression and poor child outcomes. For example, factors such as marital
discord and economic disadvantage are related to mental illness in parents and children
(Flouri, Mavroveli, & Tzavidis, 2010; Hops & Sherman, 2013; Reising et al., 2013); unless
these variables are controlled for, it is difficult to know whether offspring risk is a
consequence of paternal depression or whether the association between father and child
functioning is spurious and actually caused by a third variable. Likewise, with several
notable exceptions (e.g., Kane & Garber, 2009; Ramchandani et al., 2005; Weitzman et al.,

2011), little attention has been given to whether depression in fathers is a unique predictor of
children's adjustment or whether associations can be explained by the effects of maternal
depression.

It is well-established that depressive and anxiety disorders are highly recurrent conditions
that often emerge in adolescence or early adulthood (Abela & Hankins, 2009; Costello,
Foley, & Angold, 2006; Fergusson, Horwood, Ridder, & Beautrais, 2005; Merikangas et al.,
2010; Polanco-Roman & Miranda, 2012; Reinke, Eddy, Dishion, & Reid, 2012). Despite
this, research to date on paternal depression and children's risk for internalizing problems
has focused primarily on infancy and childhood, to the exclusion of risk transmission in
adolescence and beyond—perhaps because of the crucial roles parents play in young
children's cognitive and socioemotional development (see Stack & Poulin-Dubois, 1998). To
illustrate, the average age of children in studies reviewed for meta-analyses by Connell and
Goodman (2002) and Kane and Garber (2004) was 9.5 and 10.7 years, respectively. Of the
limited available data using older samples, several studies have reported increased rates of
depression and anxiety among adolescent offspring of depressed fathers (e.g., Beardslee,
Gladstone, Wright, & Cooper 2003; Brennan, Hammen, Katz, & Le Brocque, 2002; Kane &
Garber, 2009; Klein, Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, & Olino, 2004; Reeb & Conger, 2010). In
an investigation of parental depression and trajectories of psychopathology in previously
depressed adolescents, Rohde, Lewinsohn, Klein, and Seeley (2005) found that depression
in fathers was associated with offspring risk for psychosocial impairment—but not
depression—in early adulthood. Of the limited research on parental depression and youth
outcomes in adulthood, most studies have relied on offspring-report of parent
psychopathology, thus leaving open the possibility of shared method variance (see Lorenz,
Conger, Simons, Whitbeck, & Elder, 1991) and biased recall, especially among reporters
who were currently depressed (Patten, 2003).


In addition to the scarcity of longitudinal data and failure to examine the unique effects of
paternal depression beyond childhood, little attention has been given to factors associated
with better or worse offspring outcomes. One possible moderator of risk transmission
involves assortative mating, or the tendency for parents to be more similar to each other
phenotypically than would be expected if they were mated at random (Merikangas, 1982).
Compared to controls, depressed individuals are more likely to have a spouse with
depression (for meta-analysis, see Paulson & Bazemore, 2010), and some studies have
shown that the adverse effects of paternal depression on youth adjustment were exacerbated
by the presence of maternal depression (e.g., Brennan et al., 2002; Kahn, Brandt, &
Whitaker, 2004). Child gender has also been proposed to moderate the effects of parental
depression on children's mental health, although findings have been equivocal (for review,
see Sheeber, Davis, & Hops, 2002). Some results suggest that boys may be at higher risk for
psychopathology as a consequence of their fathers’ depression (Eberhart, Shih, Hammen, &
Brennan, 2006; Ramchandani et al., 2005), while other evidence indicates increased
vulnerability in girls, particularly among daughters reporting high father hostility (Reeb,
Conger, & Wu, 2010).

The central aim of the present study was to extend longitudinal research on children of
depressed fathers into early adulthood. Using prospective data from a community sample,

we examined the long-term effects of paternal depressive symptoms when children were in
adolescence (age 13) on offspring depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 21. In order to
account for the auto-contingency of offspring internalizing symptoms over time, children's
baseline symptoms were included as statistical controls in all models. Because research has
associated impaired family relationships, financial stress, and maternal depression with
young adults’ risk for internalizing problems (e.g., Wickrama, Conger, Surjadi, & Lorenz,
2010), our analyses also adjusted for the effects of hostile parenting, marital discord,
economic hardship, and maternal depressive symptoms. To minimize biases produced by
single sources of information (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2012), trained observer
and multiple family member reports of study variables were used. Based on the preceding
literature review, we hypothesized that paternal depressive symptoms would predict
offspring risk for depressive (H1) and anxiety symptoms (H2) in early adulthood, and that
effects would be exacerbated in the context of high levels of maternal depressive symptoms
(H3). Youth gender was also examined as a moderator of the association between father and
child psychopathology (H4).


### Method

**Participants and Procedure**


Our study sample was drawn from the Family Transitions Project (Conger & Conger, 2002),
which has followed a community sample of young adolescents from two-parent families into
adulthood. Due to the ethnic composition of the area at the study inception (approximately
1% minority families), all participants were White. At Time 1 of the current study (T1;
1989), the sample included complete data for 430 families, each with a child in the 7[th] grade
(M age = 12.61 years, SD = .55). At Time 2 (T2; 1997), youth were between the ages of 20
and 22 years (M = 20.66, SD = .55).

The median yearly income for families in the current analyses was $35,300 at T1, about
$3,500 less than married couples with children in the United States as a whole. Family per
capita income from all sources (e.g., wages, interest, business profits, etc.) averaged $8,120,
and total family income ranged from a net loss of $10,200 to $51,800. Ten percent of the
families in our sample had incomes below the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services poverty line ($12,100 for four-person families). The average age of fathers and
mothers at T1 was 40 and 38, respectively. Both parents averaged 13 years of schooling.
After listwise deletion of missing data, the final sample for the current analyses included 395
families (215 females, 180 males; 92% of the original sample). Compared to those with
complete data, families not included in the analyses did not significantly differ on any study
measure.


Participants were recruited through 34 schools in eight rural Iowa counties. Seventy-eight
percent of the eligible families (those containing a 7[th] grader and her/his two biological
parents) agreed to participate. Each year, participating families were visited by a
professional interviewer on two occasions. During the first visit, family members completed
a set of questionnaires related to physical and mental health, family processes, and economic
circumstances. During the second visit, families were videotaped as they engaged in a
structured interaction task described in the Measures section.

**Measures**


**Internalizing symptoms—Each family member reported on his or her psychiatric**
symptoms using subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis &
Unger, 2010), a multidimensional symptom inventory that assesses psychopathology on a
continuous spectrum and has demonstrated reliability and validity (e.g., Bonicatto, Dew,
Soria, & Seghezzo, 1997). The SCL-90-R Depression Scale (α = .87 for fathers; α = .86 for
mothers; α = .87 for offspring at T1, α = .92 at T2) is a 13-item index measuring the degree
to which respondents experience symptoms of depression, such as feeling hopeless about the
future, thoughts of ending their life, feeling lonely, and crying easily. One item indicating
loss of sexual interest was not included in the assessment of adolescent depressive
symptoms at age 13. The SCL-90-R Anxiety Scale (α = .83 for offspring at T1; α = .89 at
T2) includes 10 items measuring symptoms such as nervousness, tension and trembling,
panic attacks, and feelings of terror. Each item of the SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety
Scales is scored using a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). Items were averaged
into separate composite variables for depression and anxiety; higher scores indicate higher
levels of symptomatology.

**Observed parental hostility—At T1, family members were videotaped as they engaged**
in a 15-minute structured interaction task during which they sat at a table together and
discussed issues and disagreements they had cited as most problematic in a questionnaire
they completed earlier in the visit (e.g., parental expectations of children, household chores,
important family events). Videotapes were used to examine the quality of behavioral
exchanges between family members and were coded by independent observers who had
received 200 hours of training on rating family interactions. Hostile parenting behaviors for
mothers and fathers were assessed using the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scale (IFIRS;
Melby & Conger, 2001). Using a scale from 1 (the behavior is not at all characteristic) to 9
(the behavior is highly characteristic), observers rated each parents’ hostile, angry, critical,
disapproving, rejecting, and/or contemptuous behavior directed toward their adolescent
offspring. Interrater reliability estimates for the observations of parent hostility were
computed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) procedures (see Choukalas, Melby,
& Lorenz, 2000). The average ICCs for mother and father hostility were .29 and .66,
respectively.


**Marital instability—Marital instability was measured at T1 using the 5-item short form of**
the Marital Instability Index (Booth, Johnson, & Edwards, 1983), which has been found to
effectively discriminate between couples at high versus low risk for divorce. Mothers and
fathers each independently rated feelings (e.g., “has the thought of getting a divorce or
separation crossed your mind?”) and behaviors (e.g., “have you discussed divorce or
separation with a close friend?”) related to the probability that the marriage might end in
divorce. Possible responses ranged from 1 (never) to 4 (yes, within the last 3 months). The
alpha coefficients for wives and husbands were .85 and .82, respectively.

**Economic hardship—To estimate families’ economic situation, an income-to-needs ratio**
was calculated using guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
This measure was computed by dividing total family income from all sources by the poverty

threshold based on household size and number of children under 18 (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1990).


### Results

**Descriptive Statistics and Correlations**


Analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science, version 22 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA). Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations among study
variables are presented in Table 1. We first compared SCL-90-R depression and anxiety
scores with the United States normative data reported by Derogatis (1983). Depression
scores for mothers (M = 1.58, SD = .49) and fathers (M = 1.45, SD = .42) in our sample were
higher than those of the normative adult sample (M = 1.36, SD = .44), t(1,367) = 8.11, p < .
001 for mothers, t(1,367) = 3.47, p < .001 for fathers. At T1, adolescents in our sample had
slightly lower depression scores (M = 1.61, SD = .58) than the normative adolescent sample
(M = 1.80, SD = .69), t(1,199) = 4.72, p < .001. At T1, adolescents also had lower anxiety
scores (M = 1.49, SD = .51) than the normative adolescent sample (M = 1.66, SD = .62),
_t(1,199) = 4.72, p < .001. At T2, young adult offspring in our sample were slightly more_
depressed (M = 1.43, SD = .52) than the normative adult sample (M = 1.36, SD = .44),
_t(1,367) = 2.53, p = .012, while anxiety scores (M = 1.22, SD = .38) were lower than the_
normative adult sample (M = 1.30, SD = .37), t(1,367) = 3.60, p < .001. Consistent with
theoretical expectations, paternal depressive symptoms were significantly and positively
correlated with youth depressive and anxiety symptoms in early adulthood, thus justifying
the formal model testing that follows.


**Predictors of Youth Internalizing Symptoms in Early Adulthood**

Table 2 shows a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses used to examine the
effects of paternal depressive symptoms at T1 on youth depressive and anxiety symptom
outcomes at T2. Analyses were run separately for each outcome. To determine whether
paternal depressive symptoms had a unique influence on youth internalizing symptoms,
variables were entered in two steps. Step 1 included adolescent gender, previous symptoms
(type matched the dependent variable for each outcome), parental hostility, marital discord,
economic hardship, and maternal depressive symptoms. Next, in the full model, paternal
depressive symptoms were added; change in R[2] (ΔR[2]) was used to assess the magnitude of
association between paternal depressive symptoms and youth outcomes in early adulthood.


Results indicated good overall model fit for youth depression, F(9, 385) = 5.11, p < .001,
and anxiety outcomes, F(9, 385) = 2.65, p < .001. Consistent with previous research on
gender differences in the prevalence of depression (e.g., Van de Velde, Bracke, & Levecque,
2010), male offspring experienced fewer depressive symptoms than their female
counterparts (B = −.195, p < .001). Internalizing symptoms in adolescence were a significant
predictor of subsequent symptoms in young adulthood (B = .149, p < .001 for depression; B
= .092, p < .01 for anxiety); these results are similar to previous longitudinal findings
indicating high stability of mood disorders from adolescence into adulthood (Olino, Klein,
Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 2010; Roza, Hofstra, van der Ende, & Verhulst, 2003).

Consistent with results from Goodman et al. (2011) in their meta-analysis reviewing
associations between maternal depression and children's adjustment, maternal depressive
symptoms were a significant predictor of subsequent youth depressive symptoms (B = .094,
_p = .047). Maternal depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with offspring_
anxiety symptoms. Consistent with growing evidence indicating increased risk for
internalizing psychopathology among children of depressed fathers (e.g., Bögels, & Phares,
2008; Field et al., 2010; Greene et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2005; Kane & Garber, 2009;
Ramchandani & Psychogiou, 2009; Ramchandani et al., 2005, 2008; Reeb et al. 2010;
Spector, 2006, Wanless, Rosenkoetter, & McClelland, 2008), results show that paternal
depressive symptoms made significant contributions to children's depressive (H1; B = .117,
_p = .030) and anxiety symptoms (H2; B = .134, p = .002) in young adulthood, even after_
taking youth gender, previous symptoms, family functioning, economic hardship, and
maternal depressive symptoms into account.

A moderated regression framework (Aiken & West, 1991) was used to examine whether the
effects of paternal depressive symptoms on offspring internalizing symptoms varied as a
function of maternal depressive symptoms or child gender. In our statistical models (yi = β0
+ β1X1i + β2X2i + β3X3i + εi), the outcome variable yi (T2 youth outcome) was examined as a
function of independent variables in the model (X1 = paternal depressive symptoms; X2 =
maternal depressive symptoms or child gender), and the moderating effects indicated by an
interaction (X3 = X1 * X2). All continuous independent variables were grand mean centered.
After product terms were created, a hierarchical multiple regression equation was
constructed to test for moderator effects (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). Statistical
controls and predictor variables were entered first. Next, product terms were added to the
model and ΔR[2] was used to examine the significance of increment in explained variance
(Baron & Kenny, 1986). Contrary to our expectations (H3), maternal depressive symptoms
did not moderate the effects of paternal depressive symptoms on offspring depressive (ΔR[2 ]


= .001), t(384) = .52, ns, or anxiety symptoms (ΔR[2] = .003), t(384) = 1.11, ns. In addition,
The Paternal Depression × Youth Gender interaction term (H4) did not predict children's
depressive (ΔR[2] = .000), t(384) = .05, ns, or anxiety symptoms (ΔR[2] = .003), t(384) = −.71,
_ns. For the sake of brevity, nonsignificant coefficients from moderated multiple regression_
analyses are omitted from the reported results.


### Discussion

Fathers have been underrepresented in the literature on child psychopathology (Phares et al.,
2005). However, a growing number of studies have documented increased risk for mental
health problems among children of depressed fathers (for reviews, see Lefrancois, 2012;
Ramchandani & Psychogiou, 2009; Spector, 2006). The majority of this research has used
cross-sectional data and little attention has been given to the effects of paternal depression
on youth outcomes beyond childhood. Using longitudinal data from a community sample,
the central goal of this study was to examine the unique and prospective effects of paternal
depressive symptoms on offspring internalizing symptoms in early adulthood. Consistent
with conclusions drawn by Kane and Garber (2004) in their meta-analysis examining
associations between paternal depression and children's psychopathology, we found that
depressive symptoms in fathers predicted offspring risk for depressive and anxiety

-----

symptoms. These associations were significant after controlling for effects of baseline youth
symptoms, maternal depressive symptoms, and other potential confounding factors.

Research has only begun to examine the conditions under which paternal depression may
have more or less of an effect on child outcomes. Contrary to previous findings indicating an
interactive effect of maternal and paternal depression on child psychopathology (e.g.,
Brennan et al., 2002; Kahn et al., 2004), we found that associations between paternal
depressive symptoms and youth outcomes did not differ as a function of maternal depressive
symptoms. It is possible that the interactive effect of paternal and maternal depression may
vary across different developmental stages; this is an important question for future research.
Another proposed moderator of risk transmission is child gender (e.g., Goodman, 2007),
although findings from previous research on gender-specific vulnerability have been mixed
(Sheeber et al., 2002). In our analyses, associations between paternal depressive symptoms
and youth outcomes in early adulthood were similar for boys and girls. Future longitudinal
research is needed to identify the environmental factors and child characteristics associated
with better or worse outcomes among offspring of depressed fathers.


The present study extends research on children of depressed fathers in several important
ways. First, whereas the majority of existing data on children of depressed fathers have been
cross-sectional, this study used a prospective, longitudinal design that included baseline
youth internalizing symptoms as a statistical control. Therefore, our results reflect the
predictive effect of paternal depressive symptoms on change in youth symptoms across an 8year span from adolescence to early adulthood. Second, previous research on children of
depressed fathers has focused primarily on risk transmission in infancy and childhood; we
focused on offspring outcomes in early adulthood, which, for many individuals, is a highrisk period for the development of mood disorders (e.g., Olino et al., 2010). Third, not only
did this study find that paternal depressive symptoms predicted youth internalizing
symptoms above and beyond the effects of maternal depressive symptoms, but we also
showed that associations were significant after controlling for other known correlates of
father and child psychopathology, including parental hostility, marital discord, and
economic hardship. A fourth strength of the current study was the use of multiple
informants. In previous work, adult offspring have often been interviewed regarding the
presence of psychopathology in their parents, thus presenting potential bias due to shared
method variance.

Another contribution, as well as potential limitation, of the present study is the use of a
community sample. Much of the previous research on children of depressed parents has
relied on clinical samples, which may not be representative of the broader population of
depressed individuals (Goodman et al., 1997). Moreover, evidence indicates that individuals
with subdiagnostic depressive symptoms experience levels of psychological distress similar
to those experienced by those with diagnosed depression (e.g., Sheeber, Davis, Leve, Hops,
& Tildesley, 2007) and can benefit from clinical intervention (Allart-van Dam, Hosman,
Hoogduin, & Schaap, 2003). However, community samples may not include many
individuals experiencing diagnosable mood disorders; as such, further research on adult
offspring of depressed fathers using data from clinical samples and other high-risk groups is
warranted.

It is important to note several other limitations of the current study. First, results are limited
to White, two-parent families. Future research will benefit from including more diverse
populations, including single-parent, urban and minority families, and families with samesex parents. A second limitation, as well as potential strength, is that our measure of parental
hostility was based on observer ratings. Research has shown that children's perceptions of
family relations often do not correlate with observer report (e.g., Cook & Goldstein, 1993)
but are strongly related to their psychological adjustment (Forehand & Nousiainen, 1993;
Plunkett, Henry, Robinson, Behnke, & Falcon, 2007; Sheeber et al., 2007). However,
observational measures reduce the likelihood of shared method bias (see Richardson,
Simmering, & Sturman, 2009). Third, our analyses did not consider changes in families’
socioeconomic status over time, which have been associated with children's risk for
developmental psychopathology (Martin et al., 2010; Miller & Taylor, 2012; Singh &
Ghandour, 2012). For example, in our data, it is possible that changes in parents’
employment status over the course of the study could account for additional variance in
offspring internalizing symptoms in early adulthood. Despite this limitation, it is important
to note that we included families’ income-to-needs ratio, which has been shown to be a valid
indicator of economic hardship experiences (Bauman, 2002; Beverly, 2001; Iceland &
Bauman, 2007; Mayer & Jencks, 1989). Fourth, although our measures of young adult
outcomes captured changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms over time, we did not
include other potential consequences of paternal depression. For example, recent studies
using younger samples have found increased risk for behavioral problems in children of
depressed fathers (e.g., Gross et al., 2008; Marchand-Reilly, 2012).

A central challenge of future longitudinal research on children of depressed fathers will be
identifying the complex, interactive mechanisms that underlie the transmission of risk from
one generation to the next. Building on Goodman and Gotlib's (1999) model of
intergenerational depression transmission, Connell and Goodman (2002) proposed several
mechanisms by which paternal depression may be associated with children's increased risk
for psychopathology. First, the genetic contribution to internalizing psychiatric disorders is
high. For example, the heritability of depression is likely to be at least 31%–42% (Sullivan,
Neale, & Kendler, 2000), while an estimated 30%–50% of the variability in risk for anxiety
disorders is due to genetic factors (Gordon & Hen, 2004). Genotype variations could also
influence the transmission of risk for internalizing psychopathology through predispositions
to stress sensitivity (i.e., gene by environment interactions; see Rutter, 2003). Another
potential mediator of risk transmission involves family functioning. Families with a
depressed parent are less cohesive and express less care for each other than families with
non-depressed parents (Kaslow, Deering, & Racusin, 1994), and a growing body of work
has associated fathers’ depression with child neglect (Lee, Taylor, & Bellamy, 2012), a lack
of motivation to parent (Thomas & Kalucy, 2003), and hostile, intrusive, retaliatory, and
coercive parenting behaviors (Wilson & Durbin, 2010). While research to date on
interpersonal mechanisms of children's risk in relation to parental depression has focused
almost exclusively on mothers, some cross-sectional evidence has been consistent with a
mediational model of father–offspring conflict (Ge, Conger, Lorenz, Shanahan, & Elder,
1995; Kane & Garber, 2009). Taken together, theory and findings indicate that future
research is warranted on complex models of family processes in order to develop a more

comprehensive understanding of the role fathers play in the psychological development of
their children across the lifespan.

In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance of including fathers in research on
developmental psychopathology, providing evidence that the unique and adverse impact of
paternal depression on offspring mental health may extend well beyond the childhood years.
Interventions aimed at preventing or reducing youth risk for internalizing problems during
the transition to adulthood will benefit from future research on the additive and interactive
genetic and environmental factors that mediate the intergenerational transmission of risk for
psychopathology in children of depressed fathers. In addition, it is important to note that our
data do not indicate inevitable offspring maladjustment as a consequence of paternal
depression; further investigation of moderating factors is needed to understand the
conditions under which many children of depressed fathers are able to adapt to their
environment. Although the generalization of our findings to clinical populations is limited,
these results suggest that treatments and preventive interventions designed to alleviate the
antecedents and consequences of depression and anxiety disorders during the transition to
adulthood may benefit from an approach that incorporates the needs of the family as a whole
(LeFrancois, 2011; Reupert & Maybery, 2007). In this regard, clinicians may wish to
consider the careful screening of psychiatric symptoms among adolescents and young adults
whose fathers are depressed or have experienced depressive disorders in the past.
