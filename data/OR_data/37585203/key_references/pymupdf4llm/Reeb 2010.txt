### Abstract

This study examined the longitudinal relationship between paternal depressive symptoms, paternal
hostility, and adolescent functioning in a community sample of 451 families. Paternal depressive
symptoms were a strong predictor of adolescent outcome, even after controlling for family
demographic variables, maternal depressive symptoms, and previous adolescent symptoms.
Adolescent gender and perception of paternal hostility moderated this association such that
females reporting high paternal hostility were particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of
paternal depressive symptoms. Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms had an additive, rather
than interactive, effect on adolescent functioning. These results contribute to our knowledge of the
interpersonal processes by which depression runs in families and highlight the importance of
including fathers in developmental research on adolescent internalizing problems.

A considerable amount of research has documented the adverse effects of parental
depression (for review, see Goodman & Gotlib, 2002) and critical family interactions (e.g.,
Sheeber, Hops, & Davis, 2001) on the social and psychological development of adolescents.
These literatures have been limited by several factors. First, fathers have been dramatically
underrepresented in developmental research (for review, see Phares, 1992). Second, most
studies of paternal depression and offspring development have failed to control for the
effects of maternal depression (see Kane & Garber, 2004). Third, little is known about
gender differences in adolescent vulnerability to depressive family environments (Hammen,
1991). Finally, research on intergenerational psychopathology has predominately used
clinical samples and cross-sectional design. Controlling for maternal depressive symptoms
and previous adolescent symptoms, the present study used longitudinal data from a large
community sample to examine adolescent gender and perceptions of father hostility as
moderators of the association between paternal and adolescent functioning.


### Adolescent Depression

Depression is a prevalent and serious problem during adolescence. By age nineteen, 35% of
adolescent females and 19% of adolescent males will experience at least one episode of
clinical depression (Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 1998), which has been associated with
serious risks including substance abuse, suicide, and impaired academic achievement (Field,
Diego, & Sanders, 2001). Despite these risks and the fact that the onset of adult depression

often occurs in adolescence (Rao, Hammen, & Daley, 1999), data on the psychosocial
characteristics of depression during the teenage years are limited (see Essau & Petermann,
1999). For example, the majority of research on adolescent depression has relied on clinical
samples which are not representative of the general population of adolescents (Costello,
1993). Although diagnostic criteria and categorical approaches can be informative about
depression, power to detect effects may be compromised with dichotomous data. Research
has typically supported continuous approaches, indicating that there is no clear, discrete cutoff point separating seriously depressed individuals from those experiencing subclinical
depression with fewer than the required levels of symptoms for a clinical diagnosis (see
Hankin, 2006). A substantial proportion of adolescents experience subdiagnostic depressive
symptoms, which have a high recurrence rate and have been linked to a wide range of
psychopathology including major depression, anxiety disorders, substance use, and suicidal
behavior (Fergusson, Horwood, Ridder, & Beautrais, 2005; Lewinsohn, Solomon, Seeley, &
Zeiss, 2000).

The epidemiology of adolescent depression has consistently demonstrated that adolescent
girls experience significantly more depression than boys in both severity and frequency
(Hankin, Mermelstein, & Roesch, 2007); this gender difference persists across the lifespan
(Eaton et al., 1997). Considering the vast amount of work which has identified gender
differences in depression, surprisingly little research has examined the developmental
mechanisms through which adolescent girls come to be at greater risk than boys (Peterson,
Sargiani, & Kennedy, 1991). For example, few studies have examined whether risk for
intergenerational psychopathology in offspring of depressed parents varies as a function of
child gender (Goodman & Gotlib, 2002). Within this limited research, findings have been
equivocal. Davies & Windle (1997) found that boys were more susceptible than girls to
affectively ill family environments through middle childhood, with this pattern tending to
reverse during adolescence. In another study, the likelihood of adolescent girls being
currently depressed was unrelated to paternal depression, whereas adolescent boys were
more likely to be currently depressed if their father had a history of depression (Eberhart,
Shih, Hammen, & Brennan, 2006). Other work has failed to find gender differences in
offspring risk for intergenerational depression (e.g., Currier, Mann, Oquendo, Galfalvy, &
Mann, 2006).


### Father and Adolescent Adjustment

Research on child and adolescent psychopathology has historically focused on attributes of
the mother, limiting the understanding of fathers’ role in offspring development. However, a
growing body of work has associated paternal depression with adolescent risk for
psychological problems (for recent meta-analyses, see Connell & Goodman, 2002; Kane &
Garber, 2004). It appears that the degree of offspring risk associated with paternal
psychopathology is comparable to that associated with maternal psychopathology (Jacob &
Johnson, 1997; Phares, 1992). One limitation in this area of research is the dearth of studies
examining paternal depression and adolescent outcome after controlling for maternal
depression (Kane & Garber, 2004). Some data suggest that paternal mental health may
moderate the effects of maternal depression on child adjustment (for review, see Goodman
& Gotlib, 1999), although little is known about whether the reverse is true; that is, whether
the effects of paternal depression on offspring outcome vary as a function of maternal
depression.

The impact of parenting on adolescent adjustment is influenced by how adolescents perceive
their parents (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Powers, Welsh, & Wright, 1994). Adolescent report of
fathers’ behavior, for example, is strongly related to adolescent depression (Forehand &
Nousiainen, 1993; Plunkett, Henry, Robinson, Behnke, & Falcon, 2007; Sheeber, Davis,

Leve, Hops, & Tildesley, 2007). Some cross-sectional evidence indicates that fatheradolescent relations may moderate the impact of paternal psychopathology on adolescent
adjustment (e.g., Bosco, Renk, Dinger, Epstein, & Phares, 2003). In one longitudinal study,
adolescent perceptions of low closeness in the father-adolescent relationship elevated
adolescent risk in relation to fathers’ depressive symptoms (Reeb & Conger, 2009), although
specific mechanisms underlying this process (e.g., fathers’ expression of negative affect and
behaviors toward offspring) were not examined.

One process by which parental hostility may influence intergenerational risk for depression
is that depressed mood increases parents’ irritability, resulting in more hostility towards their
children and, in consequence, increased child adjustment problems. Parental depression has
been shown to increase the risk of parental hostility towards children (Conger et al., 1992),
and adolescents who experience less supportive and more conflictual relationships with their
fathers are at increased risk for clinical and sub-clinical depression (e.g., Sheeber et al.,
2007; Smetana, 1996). This process may be especially true for fathers. Low and Stocker
(2005) found that although both mother-child and father-child hostility were linked to
offspring maladjustment, only the fathers’ depressed mood was linked to children’s
internalizing problems indirectly through father-child hostility. Similarly, Parke and
colleagues (2004) found parent depression to be associated with hostile parenting for
mothers and fathers, but only paternal hostility was associated with higher levels of child
internalizing symptoms.


### Present Study

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prospective effects of paternal depressive
symptoms, paternal hostility, and adolescent gender on adolescent functioning while
controlling for other factors commonly associated with adolescent depression including
family demographic variables, prior adolescent depressive symptoms, and maternal
depressive symptoms. The first objective was to examine whether the impact of paternal
depressive symptoms on adolescent functioning is moderated by adolescent gender,
adolescent perception of father hostility, and/or maternal depressive symptoms. We
expected increased risk in females, adolescents reporting high paternal hostility, and
adolescents with mothers experiencing high levels of depressive symptoms (H1). The second
goal was to examine the three-way interaction of gender by paternal depressive symptoms
by paternal hostility. We hypothesized that adolescent girls would be more depressed than
boys at higher levels of paternal depressive symptoms when paternal hostility was high (H2).


### Method

**Participants and Procedures**


The sample includes 451 adolescents (236 female, 215 male) from two-parent intact families
in rural Iowa. The study began in 1989 when the 7[th] grade adolescents averaged 13.2 years
of age. Participants were from predominately middle- and lower-middle-class families who
resided on farms (34%), in non-farm rural areas (12%), or in small towns (54%). Due to the
ethnic composition of the area, all families were European-American. Of the original 451
families, approximately 95% of the sample remained in the study at Year 2. No significant
differences in parents’ age, family income, or mothers’ level of education were found
between participants remaining in the study compared to those who dropped out. Fathers not
in the analyses averaged 12.74 years of education compared to 13.57 for those who
remained in the study, a statistically significant difference (p < .05).

**Measures**

### Results


**Depressed mood—Parent and adolescent depressive symptoms were assessed using the**
self-reported 13-item SCL-90-R Depression Subscale (Derogatis, 1983). The SCL-90-R has
demonstrated reliability and validity as a measure of psychological distress and has been
used successfully in many studies of adults and adolescents (e.g., Essau, 2004). In our
sample, internal consistencies for SCL-90-R depression were satisfactory at Year 1 (fathers α
= .81; mothers α = .87; adolescents α = .79) and Year 2 (adolescents α = .89). Raw score
means for fathers (M = .45, SD = .42) and mothers (M = .60, SD = .50) were somewhat
higher than the mean for the normative non-patient sample (M = .36, SD = .44) reported by
Derogatis (1983). Adolescent depressive symptoms at Year 1 for boys (M = .57, SD = .54)
were not statistically different from those of girls (M = .67, SD = .63). At Year 2, girls’
symptoms (M = .56, SD = .48) were significantly higher than those of boys (M = .42, SD = .
45); t (1) = 3.05 (p < .001). At Years 1 and 2, both genders reported fewer symptoms than
the reported mean for the adolescent normative sample (M = .80, SD = .69).

**Paternal hostility—Adolescent perceptions of father hostility were assessed using the**
Father Hostility subscale of Conger’s (1989) Behavioral Affect Rating Scale (BARS), which
consists of twelve items on the problematic aspects of within-family social interaction. On a
7- point scale, responses range from 1 (never) to 7 (always) on items such as “how often
does he ignore you when you tried to talk to him”, “how often does he try to make you feel
guilty”, and “how often does he criticize you or your ideas”. Because our goal was to assess
paternal hostility and not physical abuse, one item was excluded (How often does your dad
hit, push, grab or shove you). The 11 items were averaged and scored so a high score
represented high hostility (α = 0.86).


Multiple regression analyses were performed to address the study objectives. In all analyses,
maternal depressive symptoms and prior adolescent symptoms were entered first to establish
temporal precedence and remove spurious sources of association between paternal and
adolescent functioning. All continuous independent variables were centered. Statistical
controls, including per capita family income, parental age, and parental education, did not
produce significant effects in any equation and, for the sake of brevity, are excluded from
the analyses reported here.

Consistent with the finding that depression during early adolescence can place individuals at
risk for increased subsequent depressive symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman,
1992), prior depressive symptomatology was a strong predictor of subsequent functioning (β
= .457; p < .001; see Model 1, Table 1). Maternal symptoms were also significantly
associated with subsequent adolescent symptoms (β = .114; p < .01), which was consistent
with a large body of research documenting psychological problems in offspring of depressed
mothers (for review, see Goodman & Gotlib, 2002). Finally, Year 2 adolescent depressive
symptoms were predicted by gender (b =−.099; p < .05), indicating significantly more
symptoms in girls. This finding was consistent with the existing literature on gender
differences in adolescent internalizing problems (e.g., Allgood-Merten, Lewinsohn, & Hops,
1990).

In Model 2, paternal characteristics and interaction effects were entered, accounting for a
significant proportion of the remaining variance (ΔR[2]= .030, p < .05). Our first hypothesis
(H1) was partially supported. As predicted, female offspring experienced more depressive
symptoms than did boys as a function of paternal symptoms (b=−.249; p < .05). Also
consistent with H1, the effect of paternal symptoms on adolescent symptoms changed
dramatically with degree of hostility (β = .159; p < .01); paternal depressive symptoms

posed significantly more risk when adolescents perceived higher hostility. Contrary to our
prediction, maternal depressive symptoms did not moderate the association between paternal
and adolescent functioning (β =−.051). The correlation between maternal and paternal
symptoms did not reach statistical significance (r = .073). Our findings suggest that maternal
and paternal depressive symptoms may have an additive, rather than interactive, effect on
adolescent functioning.

Controlling for all main effects and two-way interactions, the three-way interaction between
paternal depressive symptoms, father hostility, and adolescent gender was statistically
significant (b = −.278; p < .05). As suggested in Holmbeck (2002), post-hoc probing of this
moderational effect was conducted in which simple regression equations were generated,
one at each of the four combinations of gender and hostility at one standard deviation above
and below the mean (see Figure 1). Significance tests for each simple slope indicated that
only the slope for girls experiencing high paternal hostility was significantly different from
zero (b= .391; p < .001). Adolescent girls’ depressive symptoms tended to be highest when
levels of paternal depressive symptoms and father hostility were high (H2). The independent
variables in the full model collectively explained 30% of the variation in Year 2 adolescent
depressive symptoms.


### Discussion

This study adds to the literature by demonstrating a prospective association between paternal
depressive symptoms, adolescent perception of paternal hostility, and adolescent functioning
in a large community sample. Consistent with Phares (1997), our analyses indicate a
complex connection between paternal depression, father-child relations, and adolescent
adjustment. Paternal depressive symptoms were a strong predictor of adolescent outcome,
even after controlling for family demographic variables, maternal depressive symptoms, and
previous adolescent symptoms. Adolescent gender and perception of paternal hostility
moderated intergenerational risk for depression such that females reporting high paternal
hostility were particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of paternal depressive symptoms.


**Adolescent Gender and Paternal Hostility**

Relatively few studies have examined whether risk for psychopathology in offspring of
depressed parents varies as a function of child gender (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). Of the
studies which have included offspring gender, most examined only maternal characteristics.
There is modest support that adolescent daughters of depressed mothers are at particular risk
for depression (e.g., Fergusson, Horwood, & Lynskey, 1995). Cross-sectional research
examining offspring of depressed fathers indicate comparable risk for sons and daughters
(Currier et al., 2006; Lieb, Isensee, Hofler, Phister, & Wittchen, 2002). Longitudinal
findings from the present study, however, suggest that adolescent gender may play an
important role in determining whether paternal depressive symptoms are related to
adolescent functioning. Consistent with the proposal that girls’ differential vulnerability may
derive from socialization experiences that emphasize relationship-focused orientation (Hops,
1996), our data indicate that experiences within the father-adolescent relationship may
moderate daughters’ risk related to paternal depression. Future investigations should explore
the association between paternal characteristics and other psychosocial variables which may
contribute to increased risk for depression in girls including rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema,
2000), and the development of gender-related role expectations during early adolescence
(Hill & Lynch, 1983).


Paternal psychopathology is likely to influence offspring by altering patterns of parentadolescent interactions (see Cummings & Davies, 1994). Between age 11 and age 14,
adolescents’ positive perceptions of parent-child interactions often decline (McGue, Elkins,

_Fathering. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 July 28._

Walden, & Iacono, 2005), and some cross-sectional findings suggest that these perceptions
may moderate the effects of paternal psychopathology on adolescent outcome (Bosco et al.,
2003). Our data were consistent with these findings, indicating that adolescent girls’
vulnerability to paternal depression was heightened when paternal hostility was high, or at
least when they perceived it to be. Women tend to be more interpersonally oriented than
men (Feingold, 1994), which may, in part, explain the significant gender-specific interaction
between paternal depressive symptoms and hostility. The greater tendency of girls to
emphasize or value relationships may translate into risk for depressed mood in the context of
paternal depression and hostility. Results from the current analyses were also consistent with
evidence that perceptions of negative relationships with the opposite-gender parent may be
more strongly associated with adolescent maladjustment (Osborne & Fincham, 1996).
Integrating intrafamily stress exposure and perceptions of family conflict with genderspecific risk for adolescent depression will be an important area for future research.


**Limitations and Future Directions**

Despite its strengths, there were several limitations to this study that should be considered in
future research. First, extending this type of research to more diverse samples, including
single-parent as well as urban and minority families, will increase generalizability of
findings. Second, these variables were examined with self-report data; future work should
replicate these findings with multiple-informant and observational measures, as sources of
data may affect relationships between theoretical constructs (Compas, 1987). Finally, a
substantial proportion of the variance in the outcome measure remains unexplained by these
independent variables. Future research should explore additional genetic, biological, and
contextual variables that may precipitate or protect against the development of depression
during adolescence. In spite of these limitations, this study adds to our understanding of
intergenerational depression and has important applied implications including a number of
potential targets for behavior change that may promote resilience in adolescent offspring of
depressed fathers. For example, therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing family conflict,
particularly between fathers and daughters, may be especially helpful in preventing or
alleviating adolescent depression.

Earlier studies of family interactions and intergenerational psychopathology have typically
overlooked characteristics of the father (Phares, 1992) and have assessed concurrent
relations between paternal and child functioning, thus limiting inferences about temporal
order and direction of effect (see review by Kane & Garber, 2004). Results from this study
highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental research and contribute to
our understanding of the psychosocial mechanisms by which risk for depression is
transmitted across generations. We hope these results will lead to future research on fathers’
role in the development of adolescent psychopathology, and on how risk may be influenced
by intrafamily relationships and adolescent gender. Family-based preventative and treatment
interventions for adolescent depression will benefit from a more thorough understanding of
the direct and indirect paths through which paternal depression influences adolescent
development. It may be particularly important to help depressed fathers recognize their
psychological problems and pay special attention to family conflict as a mechanism by
which adolescent offspring inherit risk for depression.
