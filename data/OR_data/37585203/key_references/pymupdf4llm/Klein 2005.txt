ABSTRACT

Background. There is a large literature indicating that the offspring of mothers with Major
Depressive Disorder (MDD) are at increased risk for depression. However, much less is known
about the effects of paternal MDD on offspring psychopathology.

Method. We addressed this issue using a large community sample of parents and their adolescent
and young adult offspring (n=775). Parents and offspring were independently assessed with semistructured diagnostic interviews. Offspring were interviewed three times from mid-adolescence to
age 24 years.

Results. Maternal MDD was significantly associated with offspring MDD. Paternal MDD was also
significantly associated with MDD in offspring, but only among offspring with depressive episodes
of moderate or greater severity. These effects persisted after controlling for socio-economic status,
family intactness, and non-mood disorders in both parents. Rates of MDD were particularly elevated in offspring of mothers and fathers with early-onset MDD, and offspring of fathers with
recurrent MDD. The magnitude of the associations between MDD in parents and offspring was
generally in the small-to-medium range.

Conclusions. These results confirm previous findings of elevated risk of MDD in the offspring of
depressed mothers. In addition, the results suggest that MDD in fathers is associated with increased
risk of depression in offspring, but that it is limited to MDD episodes in offspring of moderate or
greater severity.


INTRODUCTION

Numerous studies have reported that the schoolaged, adolescent, and young adult offspring
of mothers with Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) exhibit elevated rates of MDD, as well
as a variety of non-mood disorders (Weissman
et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998; Goodman &
Gotlib, 1999). However, few data are available
on the risk of MDD and other forms of psychopathology in the offspring of depressed fathers.

This is probably due to the higher prevalence of
depression in women, the greater difficulty in
recruiting fathers for research, and the assumption that mothers generally have a larger impact
on children due to their greater role in childrearing (Phares, 2002).
The few studies that have examined the risk
for MDD in offspring of depressed fathers
have produced inconsistent results. Thus, some
studies have reported elevated rates of MDD in
offspring of depressed fathers compared to offspring of controls (e.g. Orvaschel et al. 1988;
Nomura et al. 2001), but other studies have
failed to find differences (e.g. Keller et al. 1986).

Most of this literature has relied on clinical
samples, which are not representative of depression in the community (Costello, 1993).
Moreover, because women are more likely to
seek treatment fordepression than men(MoellerLeimkuehler, 2002), there may be even greater
bias in clinical samples of depressed fathers than
clinical samples of depressed mothers.
We are aware of only two studies that have
examined rates of MDD in both depressed
mothers and depressed fathers using large community samples. Lieb et al. (2002) reported that
both maternal MDD and paternal MDD were
associated with increased rates of MDD in
adolescent and young adult offspring. A limitation of this study, however, is that it relied
entirely on offspring reports of parental psychopathology for the older (age 18–24 years)
half of the sample, and conducted direct interviews with only one parent (generally the
mother) for the younger (age 14–17 years) half
of the sample. In contrast, Brennan et al. (2002)
found that maternal depression (MDD or dysthymia), but not paternal depression was associated with depression in offspring. However,
Brennan et al.’s (2002) sample was limited to
families that were intact or where the offspring
had substantial contact with the father, which
may have excluded some of the fathers with the
most significant psychopathology. Moreover,
Brennan et al. (2002) included both biological
fathers and stepfathers in their sample.
A number of studies have also suggested that
particular characteristics of parental MDD, such
as severity, chronicity, recurrence, and early age
of onset, are associated with particularly elevated risks in offspring (Keller et al. 1986; Klein
et al. 1988; Warner et al. 1995; Hammen &
Brennan, 2003). However, most of these studies
have been limited to depressed mothers or have
combined depressed mothers and fathers. Hence,
it is not clear whether these findings apply to
paternal MDD or only to maternal MDD.
The present paper uses data from the Oregon
Adolescent Depression Project (OADP; Lewinsohn et al. 1993) to examine the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and rates
of psychopathology in their adolescent and
young adult offspring in a large community
sample. In addition, we explored the associations
between the clinical features of maternal and
paternal MDD and rates of MDD in offspring.

a random sample of 457 white adolescents with no history of
psychopathology was also targeted for inclusion.
b Families with one or more parents with a history of a nonaffective psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or dysthymic disorder
with no lifetime history of MDD were excluded. For one of the excluded families, information was available for only the biological
mother.

In previous papers from the OADP we reported the results of a bottom-up family study
of the first-degree relatives of the depressed and
non-depressed adolescents (Klein et al. 2001,
2002). This article extends our previous papers
by presenting a top-down high-risk study of
depressed and non-depressed parents, examining
psychopathology in the adolescent offspring,
who have now been followed into early adulthood. Although top-down and bottom-up designs are closely related, they can yield different
results, as the groups of offspring of depressed
parents and youngsters with depression exhibit
only partial overlap. This article also differs
from our previous papers in that we focus exclusively on parents rather than using all firstdegree relatives, take the temporal relationship
between the onset of parent and offspring
disorders into account, and include data on
offspring through age 24 years.

senior high schools in western Oregon. A total
of 1709 adolescents (ages 14–18 years; mean age
16[.]6, S.D.=1[.]2) completed the initial (T1)
assessments between 1987 and 1989. The participation rate at T1 was 61%. Approximately 1
year later, 1507 of the adolescents (88%)
returned for a second evaluation (T2). Several
checks were conducted to assess the representativeness of the sample (see Lewinsohn et al. 1993
for details). Briefly, adolescents who did and did
not participate in the T1 assessment were similar
on intactness of the family and family size, but
participants were more likely to be female, in a
higher grade, and their parental socio-economic
status was higher than non-participants. Of the
adolescents who participated in the T1 assessment, those who also participated at T2 were
more likely to be female, came from larger
families, had a higher parental socio-economic
status, and were less likely to have had a T1
diagnosis of a disruptive behavior disorder, and,
for males only, a T1 substance use disorder,
compared to those who did not participate at
T2. However, among T1 participants, those who
did and did not participate at T2 were similar on
race, grade level, and all other T1 current and
lifetime diagnoses.
At age 24 years, all adolescents with a history
of MDD through T2 (n=360) or a history of
non-mood disorders through T2 (n=284), and a
random sample of adolescents with no lifetime
history of psychopathology through T2 (n=
457) were invited to participate in a third (T3)
evaluation. All non-white T2 participants were
retained in the T3 sample to maximize ethnic
diversity. Of the 1101 T2 participants selected
for a T3 interview, 941 (85%) completed the age
24 evaluation. The T2 diagnostic groups did not
differ on the rate of participation at T3.

Parents
We assessed lifetime psychopathology in the
biological parents of the OADP participants in
the T3 evaluation. To supplement the direct interviews and to ensure that at least some data
were available for parents who could not be directly interviewed, informant data were obtained
from the OADP participants, and, when parents
were not available for direct interview, from a
second informant (generally the co-parent or a
sibling). Of the 1101 offspring selected for a T3
interview, diagnostic information on at least one


biological parent was available for 837 (76%),
including 837 mothers and 819 fathers. Of the
941 offspring with T3 data, parent diagnostic
data were available for 801 (85%). In addition,
there were 36 offspring with parent diagnostic
information who did not complete a T3 evaluation. For these participants, offspring data
were only available through T2.
Offspring diagnoses were based on DSM-IIIR criteria (APA, 1987). Parent diagnoses were
based on DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994). All
offspring with data on at least one parent were
included in this report except for offspring of
parents with a history of a non-affective psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or dysthymic
disorder with no lifetime history of MDD
(n=62).
Only one child (the original OADP participant) per set of parents was included in the
analyses. Although we also have diagnostic data
on most siblings of the OADP participants,
these data were collected at only one point
in time using a different diagnostic interview,
and the siblings had a wide range of ages.
Hence, siblings were not included in the present
report.
This article included data on 775 mothers, 758
fathers, and 775 offspring. Direct interviews
were obtained from all of the offspring, 74[.]6%
of the mothers and 46[.]4% of the fathers. Of the
parents who were not directly interviewed, we
obtained family history data from two or more
informants for 40[.]6% of the mothers and
66[.]5% of the fathers.

Diagnostic assessments
Offspring
At T1, offspring were interviewed with a version
of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADS; Orvaschel et al. 1982), which combined
features of the Epidemiologic and Present
Episode versions, and included additional
items to derive DSM-III-R diagnoses. At T2
and T3, offspring were interviewed using the
Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation
(LIFE; Keller et al. 1987), which elicited detailed information about the onset and course of
psychiatric disorders since the previous evaluation. In the present paper, offspring diagnoses
are lifetime diagnoses derived from direct


-----

interviews through the last available follow-up
(which, in almost all cases, was T3).
To assess inter-rater reliability, independent
raters reviewed audiotapes of a random sample
of interviews (n’s ranged from 166 to 233). The
reliability of lifetime diagnoses was fair to excellent for MDD [Kappa (k) for T1, T2, and T3
was 0[.]86, 0[.]75, and 0[.]86 respectively], any anxiety
disorder (k for T1, T2, and T3 was 0[.]53, 0[.]66,
and 0[.]84 respectively), and any substance use
disorder (k for T1, T2, and T3 was 0[.]89, 0[.]84,
and 0[.]81 respectively).

Parents
Parents were interviewed using the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders,
Non-Patient Version (SCID-NP; First et al.
1996). All interviews were conducted without
knowledge of the offspring’s diagnoses. Independent raters reviewed audiotapes of 184 randomly
selected interviews. The inter-rater reliability of
lifetime diagnoses were excellent for MDD
(k=0[.]94), any anxiety disorder (k=0[.]90),
alcohol abuse/dependence (k=0[.]86), and drug
abuse/dependence (k=0[.]89).
Family history data were collected using the
Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC;
Mannuzza & Fyer, 1990), supplemented with all
items necessary to derive DSM-IV diagnoses.
Independent raters reviewed audiotapes of
242 randomly selected informant interviews.
The inter-rater reliability of lifetime diagnoses
were good to excellent for MDD (k=0[.]90),
any anxiety disorder (k=0[.]77), alcohol abuse/
dependence (k=0[.]90), and drug abuse/dependence (k=0[.]82).
We examined the sensitivity and specificity of
informants’ reports by comparing FISC diagnoses to SCID diagnoses for parents who had
both sources of data available. Sensitivity varied
according to the informant and target, but
specificity was consistently acceptable. With the
index offspring as the informant, sensitivity and
specificity for MDD in mothers (n=523) was
0[.]45 and 0[.]85 respectively; sensitivity and specificity for MDD in fathers (n=316) was 0[.]32 and
0[.]90 respectively. With another family member
as the informant, sensitivity and specificity for
MDD in mothers (n=59) was 0[.]30 and 0[.]80
respectively; sensitivity and specificity for MDD
in fathers (n=40) was 0[.]66 and 0[.]82 respectively.
The greater sensitivity of offspring reports of


maternal than paternal MDD probably reflects
children’s greater contact with, and knowledge
of, their mothers than their fathers. The high
sensitivity of other family members’ reports of
paternal MDD probably reflects the fact that
the other family member informant was generally the mother, and mothers tend to have the
best knowledge of family members (Cohen,
1988).
Consistent with previous research (Kendler
et al. 1991; Chapman et al. 1994), sensitivity was
somewhat higher and specificity was somewhat
lower for informants who themselves had psychopathology. For example, the sensitivity and
specificity of offspring reports of maternal
MDD (n=258) was 0[.]54 and 0[.]75 respectively,
for offspring with a history of MDD themselves.
For offspring with no lifetime history of MDD,
the sensitivity and specificity of offspring reports
of maternal MDD (n=265) was 0[.]34 and 0[.]95
respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of offspring reports of paternal MDD was
0[.]38 and 0[.]83 (n=144) for offspring with a history of MDD, and 0[.]24 and 0[.]96 (n=172) for
offspring with no lifetime history of MDD.
Finally, the correlations between informants’
reports of the age of onset of MDD on the FISC
and parents’ reports of age of onset of MDD on
the SCID for cases in which both the parent and
informant agreed on the presence of MDD were
0[.]43 for mothers (n=77, p<0[.]001) and 0[.]47 for
fathers (n=26, p<0[.]05).
As data were available from multiple informants for most parents, we derived lifetime
DSM-IV diagnoses for the parents using the
‘best-estimate’ procedure (Leckman et al. 1982).
Two diagnosticians, from a team of four senior
clinicians, independently reviewed all information from the SCIDs and FISCs without
knowledge of offspring diagnoses, and made
best-estimate diagnoses for the parents using
the guidelines in Klein et al. (1994). The diagnosticians’ conclusions were then compared,
and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Inter-rater reliability of the independently derived best-estimate diagnoses prior to the resolution of discrepancies was excellent for MDD
(k=0[.]91), any anxiety disorder (k=0[.]94),
alcohol abuse/dependence (k=0[.]97), and drug
abuse/dependence (k=0[.]96).
Offspring interviews at T3 and interviews with
relatives and informants were conducted by


-----

telephone, which generally yields comparable
results to face-to-face interviews (Sobin et al.
1993; Rohde et al. 1997). Most of the interviewers had advanced degrees in clinical or
counseling psychology or social work, and
several years of clinical experience. All interviewers were trained in the use of the diagnostic
instruments and completed a minimum of
two supervised training interviews, achieving
k=0[.]80 or better for concordance between
their symptom ratings and those of the supervisor.

Other diagnostic issues
As discussed below, the lifetime prevalence of
MDD through age 24 years in the OADP adolescents and young adults was higher than anticipated, probably due to the study’s intensive
surveillance (three comprehensive diagnostic
evaluations between mid-adolescence and early
adulthood). Thus, it is likely that many of the
MDD episodes that we detected were relatively
mild and transient (despite meeting full criteria
for MDD). In light of this possibility, we chose
to supplement DSM-III-R criteria for MDD
with a second, higher threshold, definition of
caseness that required at least a moderate
level of symptom severity and/or impairment.
Offspring with only mild episodes of MDD were
counted as non-cases. Severity of MDD episodes in offspring was coded using the DSM-IIIR/DSM-IV severity specifiers. Among offspring
with a history of DSM-III-R MDD, the interrater reliability for the distinction between mild
versus moderate, severe, or with psychotic features was k=0[.]46 (n=213).
The clinical features of depression in parents,
derived using the best-estimate procedure, included: (1) severity of depressive symptoms,
also assessed using the DSM-IV severity specifiers and coded as mild versus moderate, severe,
or with psychotic features; (2) recurrent versus
single episode; (3) chronic, defined as an episode
lasting at least 2 years or a history of dysthymic
disorder; and (4) age of onset, which, following
Weissman et al. (1984), we dichotomized into
f20 years versus 21 years or older. The results
were similar, but not quite as strong, using age
30 as the cut-off. Inter-rater reliability was
k=0[.]81 for severity; k=0[.]72 for recurrent;
k=0[.]57 for chronic; and k=0[.]81 for early-onset
(n’s ranged from 175–183).


For both offspring and parents, the following
specific anxiety disorders were included in
deriving the category of any anxiety disorder:
panic disorder, agoraphobia without a history
of panic disorder, social phobia, simple/specific
phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise
specified. For offspring, diagnoses (assessed at
T1 and T2 only) of separation anxiety disorder,
overanxious disorder, and avoidant disorder of
childhood/adolescence were also included. The
following specific substance use disorders were
included in the any substance use disorder category: alcohol abuse or dependence, sedativehypnotic-anxiolytic abuse or dependence, cannabis abuse or dependence, stimulant abuse or
dependence, opioid abuse or dependence, cocaine abuse or dependence, hallucinogen/PCP
abuse or dependence, and polydrug dependence.
For offspring and parents with multiple anxiety
or substance use disorders, the age of onset was
coded as the earliest condition in that group of
disorders.
To ensure that the temporal direction of the
associations between parental and offspring
psychopathology was unambiguous, the onset
of the disorders in the parent that were included
as independent variables in any given analysis
had to have preceded the onset of the disorder in
their offspring that served as the dependent
variable (if the offspring had experienced that
disorder). In addition, we only considered
parents to have a disorder if the onset was prior
to the T1 assessment. If the parental disorder
first appeared after the offspring had developed
the disorder in the analysis or after the offspring
entered the study at T1, it was considered
absent. This is a conservative approach that
should slightly attenuate the associations between parent and offspring psychopathology.

Data analysis
Caucasian OADP participants with no history
of psychopathology through T2 were undersampled in the T3 follow-up, hence in all statistical analyses these offspring were assigned a
weight of 2[.]05 reflecting their probability of
being selected at T3. All participants with a
history of psychopathology through T2 and all
non-white participants were selected for the T2
assessment, hence were assigned a weight of


-----

1[.]00. Although the analyses used weighted data,
the numbers and proportions of participants
presented in the tables are unweighted.
Rates of disorders in offspring were examined
using Cox proportional hazards (PH) models.
Offspring with diagnostic data on only one
parent (n=17) were excluded from analyses
requiring both parents. As we required that the
onset of a disorder in the parent preceded
the onset of that disorder in the offspring, the
number of parents considered to have each disorder varied slightly depending on which
disorder in offspring served as the dependent
variable. Analyses were conducted using

SUDAAN (Shah et al. 1997).

RESULTS
Characteristics of parents and offspring
The mean age of the offspring at T1 was 16[.]6
years (S.D.=1[.]2); 41[.]7% were male, and 90[.]3%
were white. At T1, 55[.]6% lived with both biological parents, 32[.]9% lived with their mother
only, 7[.]8% lived with their father only, and
3[.]8% lived with neither biological parent. With
respect to diagnoses through T3, 50[.]5% of the
offspring had a lifetime MDD; 20[.]8% had a
lifetime anxiety disorder; and 38[.]2% had a lifetime substance use disorder. The weighted
lifetime prevalence of MDD in the sample was
42[.]1%.
The mean ages of the mothers and fathers at
T1 were 40[.]7 years (S.D.=5[.]1) and 42[.]5 years
(S.D.=6[.]4) respectively. In 43[.]5% of the families, at least one parent had a 4-year college
degree. Of the mothers, 27[.]7% had a lifetime
MDD, 14[.]3% had a lifetime anxiety disorder,
and 19[.]1% had a lifetime substance use disorder. Of the fathers, 14[.]1% had a lifetime
MDD, 7[.]0% had a lifetime anxiety disorder,
and 43[.]4% had a lifetime substance use disorder. These rates only include parents with an
onset before T1 and prior to the onset of MDD
in their offspring. Parents with a disorder that
onset after T1 or following the onset of MDD in
their offspring were counted as non-affected.

MDD in offspring
We examined the effects of parental MDD on
lifetime MDD through T3 in offspring in several
stages. First, we examined the unadjusted or
minimally adjusted effects of maternal and


paternal MDD and selected covariates on offspring MDD (see Table 2). The covariates included offspring gender, intactness of the family
(as indexed by whether the offspring was living
with both biological parents at T1), whether one
or more parent had completed college by T1
(serving as a proxy for socio-economic status),
and maternal and paternal anxiety and substance use disorders. The analyses involving
offspring gender, intactness of the family, and
parental education were unadjusted; the analyses involving maternal and paternal MDD,
anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder
controlled for whether the parent had received
a direct interview.
Female gender in offspring, a non-intact
family, lower parental education, maternal
MDD, maternal substance use disorder, and
paternal substance use disorder were significantly associated with increased rates of MDD
in offspring. In addition, there were non-significant trends for associations between paternal
MDD (p=0[.]065) and maternal anxiety disorders (p=0[.]08) and offspring MDD.
Next, we examined the independent effects of
maternal and paternal MDD on offspring
MDD after controlling for offspring gender,
parental education, intactness of the family,
whether the parent had received a direct interview, and maternal and paternal anxiety and
substance use disorders (see Table 2). Maternal,
but not paternal, MDD was significantly associated with MDD in offspring. Maternal and
paternal anxiety disorders and maternal substance use disorders did not make significant
independent contributions to predicting offspring MDD. Paternal substance use disorders
was associated with MDD in offspring at a
trend level (p=0[.]058).
More offspring lived with their mothers than
fathers, hence the stronger effect for maternal
MDD may have been due to greater exposure to
maternal depression. To test this, we examined a
model that included offspring gender, the interview status of each parent, maternal MDD,
paternal MDD, whether the offspring lived with
their mother at T1, whether the offspring lived
with their father at T1, and cross-product terms
for the interactions between living with each
parent at T1 and MDD in that parent. Neither
of the interactions approached significance. In
addition, a higher proportion of mothers than

limited the MDD group to offspring with at
least one lifetime episode of moderate or greater
severity. Offspring with a history of only mild
episodes of MDD were treated as non-cases,
and combined with offspring with no history of
MDD. Of the 392 offspring in the sample with a
lifetime history of MDD, 291 (74[.]2%) had an
episode rated as at least moderately severe.
Using unweighted n’s, 47[.]4% (102/215) of the
offspring of mothers with a history of MDD,
and 33[.]7% (189/560) of offspring of mothers
with no history of MDD had at least one episode of MDD of moderate or greater severity.
Of offspring of fathers with a history of MDD,
52[.]3% (56/107) had an episode of MDD of
moderate or greater severity compared to
35[.]3% (230/651) of offspring of fathers with no
history of MDD.
When we repeated the series of analyses
above examining the effects of parental MDD
on offspring MDD using this more restrictive
definition of caseness in offspring, the effects of
paternal MDD on offspring MDD were stronger and statistically significant. In a multivariate
model that included maternal and paternal
interview status, offspring sex, socio-economic
status, intact home, maternal and paternal
anxiety and substance use disorders, and maternal MDD, paternal MDD was significantly
associated with moderate to severe MDD in
offspring [Hazard ratio (HR) 1[.]49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1[.]03–2[.]14, p=0[.]033].
Maternal MDD also made a significant independent contribution (HR 1[.]42, 95% CI
1[.]04–1[.]95, p=0[.]028).

Anxiety and substance use disorders in offspring
A number of studies have also reported elevated
rates of non-mood disorders in the offspring of
depressed mothers and the offspring of combined samples of depressed mothers and fathers
(Weissman et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998;
Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). In order to extend
our analysis of the association between paternal
MDD and offspring psychopathology, we
examined the associations between maternal and
paternal MDD and rates of anxiety and substance use disorders in offspring. These associations, adjusted for parental interview status, are
presented in Table 3. Maternal MDD, but not
paternal MDD, predicted a significantly higher
rate of anxiety disorders in offspring. Neither


maternal nor paternal MDD were associated
with substance use disorders in offspring. In
addition, maternal and paternal anxiety disorders predicted offspring anxiety disorders,
and maternal and paternal substance use
disorders were associated with substance use
disorders in offspring.
As a more stringent test of the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and nonmood disorders in offspring, we examined two
further PH models (see Table 3). The interview
status of each parent, offspring gender, and
maternal and paternal MDD were included in
both models. The first model examined the associations between maternal and paternal MDD
and anxiety disorders in offspring, and included
maternal and paternal anxiety disorders as
covariates. In this model, neither maternal
MDD nor paternal MDD predicted anxiety
disorders in offspring.
The second model examined the associations
between maternal and paternal MDD and substance use disorders in offspring, and included
maternal and paternal substance use disorders
as covariates. Neither maternal MDD nor
paternal MDD predicted substance use disorders in offspring.

Clinical characteristics of parental depression
Finally, we examined the associations between
selected clinical characteristics of parental
depression and rates of MDD in offspring. The
analyses were conducted separately for
depressed mothers and depressed fathers, and
were limited to offspring with a depressed
parent. Of the 215 depressed mothers in this set
of analyses, 66 (30[.]7%) had an early onset, 145
(67[.]4%) had recurrent episodes, 67 (31[.]2%) had
chronic episodes, and 184 (85[.]6%) had an episode of at least moderate severity. Of the 107
depressed fathers in this set of analyses, 26
(24[.]3%) had an early onset, 70 (65[.]4%) had
recurrent episodes, 33 (30[.]8%) had chronic episodes, and 91 (85[.]0%) had an episode of at least
moderate severity.
Offspring of depressed mothers and fathers
with and without each clinical characteristic
were compared using univariate PH models (see
Table 4). Offspring of mothers with early-onset
MDD, and offspring of fathers with early-onset
MDD and recurrent MDD had significantly
increased risks of MDD. In addition, there was

effects for maternal recurrent MDD, paternal
chronic MDD, and moderate to severe maternal
and paternal MDD were not significant.

DISCUSSION

Many studies have demonstrated that the offspring of mothers with MDD are at increased
risk for depression. Much less, however, is
known about the association between paternal
MDD and offspring depression. Using a large
community sample of parents and their adolescent and young adult offspring, we replicated
the finding that maternal MDD was significantly associated with MDD in offspring. In
contrast, the association between paternal MDD
and offspring MDD reached only a trend level
of significance, and disappeared after controlling
for maternal MDD and selected demographic
covariates and parental non-mood disorders.


However, when a more stringent threshold for
defining MDD in offspring was employed, a
significant association between paternal MDD
and offspring depression was obtained, and we
found that MDD in both mothers and fathers
were independently associated with MDD in
offspring. In addition, we found that early
MDD onset in both mothers and fathers, and
recurrent MDD in fathers were significantly
associated with elevated rates of MDD in offspring.
We are aware of only two previous studies
that used large community samples of depressed
fathers as well as depressed mothers. Lieb et al.
(2002) reported that maternal and paternal
MDD were both associated with increased rates
of MDD in offspring, whereas Brennan et al.
(2002) found that maternal depression, but not
paternal depression, was associated with depression in offspring. Our findings are partially
consistent with both of these studies. Using
DSM-III-R criteria for MDD in offspring, we

found that the association between parental
MDD and offspring depression was limited to
depressed mothers. However, when we raised
the threshold to require at least one MDD episode of at least moderate severity in offspring,
we also found a significant association between
paternal MDD and offspring depression. These
findings raise the possibility that conflicting results in studies comparing the effects of maternal
and paternal depression may reflect implicit
differences in the thresholds used to diagnose
MDD in offspring, In addition, these results
suggest that future studies should examine the
data using several alternative approaches to case
definition.
We examined several possible explanations
for why there was an effect for maternal MDD,
but not paternal MDD, in the primary analyses
using DSM-III-R criteria for MDD in offspring.
First, more mothers than fathers received direct
interviews, and offspring’s collateral reports of
maternal MDD were somewhat more sensitive
than reports of paternal MDD. Hence, it is
conceivable that our findings are due to more
accurate diagnoses of MDD in mothers than
fathers. However, the significant associations
for maternal, but not paternal, MDD remained
evident after controlling for whether the parent
was interviewed, and there was no evidence of
interview status by parental diagnosis interactions. Second, offspring were more likely to


reside with their mothers than fathers, and
therefore, may have had greater exposure to
maternal than paternal depression. While we
did not assess the actual time spent with either
parent during episodes of parental MDD, we
did control for the effects of residing with both
biological parents at T1 in the analyses. In addition, we examined interactions between residing with each parent and parental diagnoses of
MDD, and did not obtain significant effects.
Our secondary analyses revealed significant
associations between both maternal MDD and
paternal MDD and MDD of at least moderate
severity in offspring. Thus, it appears that the
association between maternal MDD and offspring MDD is evident throughout the range of
offspring severity, whereas the association with
paternal MDD is limited to the more severe
cases of depression in offspring. This has important implications for modeling the familial
aggregation of MDD, as it suggests that the
processes underlying the intergenerational transmission of depression in mothers and fathers
may differ, at least to some extent.
We also examined whether maternal and
paternal MDD were associated with increased
rates of non-mood disorders in offspring. A
number of previous studies have found elevated
rates of anxiety and externalizing disorders in
the offspring of depressed parents (Weissman
et al. 1997; Beardslee et al. 1998; Goodman &


-----

ff p g f p p


Gotlib, 1999). However, few previous studies
have examined depressed mothers and fathers
separately or controlled for the effects of nonmood disorders in the depressed parent and the
co-parent. Consistent with the literature, we
found that prior to adjusting for the effects of
parental non-mood disorders, maternal MDD
was significantly associated with an increased
rate of anxiety disorders in offspring. However,
after controlling for parental anxiety disorders,
this association disappeared. These findings
suggest that the elevated rates of non-mood
disorders reported in previous studies of the
offspring of depressed parents may be due to the
direct transmission of these other disorders,
rather than the effects of maternal MDD.
Alternatively, the effects of maternal MDD on
offspring anxiety disorders may be more easily
detected in younger samples, as some cases of
childhood anxiety disorders may subsequently
evolve into depression and not be reported in
assessments conducted in adolescence or young
adulthood.
Early-onset (<21 years of age) MDD in both
mothers and fathers was associated with a significantly increased risk of MDD in the offspring. In addition, the offspring of fathers with
recurrent MDD exhibited an increased rate of
MDD. These data are consistent with a number
of twin (Kendler et al. 1999), family (Bland et al.
1986; Weissman et al. 1986), and offspring
(Klein et al. 1988; Warner et al. 1995) studies
indicating that early-onset and recurrent MDD
are associated with greater familial aggregation.
Most of this work has been based on samples
of depressed mothers or combined samples of
depressed mothers and fathers. Our findings indicate that the association between early-onset
and recurrent MDD in parents and increased
risk to offspring also applies to depressed
fathers. Our design cannot tease apart genetic
from environmental effects. Thus, we do not
know whether early-onset MDD in the parent is
associated with a greater genetic liability or
whether offspring of parents with early-onset
MDD are exposed to parental depression at an
earlier age or for a longer period of time.
Unfortunately, we did not have sufficiently detailed data on the course of parental depression
and the periods in which the offspring was living
with each parent to disentangle the effects of
parental age of onset and recurrence from the


timing and duration of exposure of offspring to
parental MDD.
Our findings appear to be inconsistent with
Hammen & Brennan’s (2003) recent report that
the severity of maternal depression was associated with risk for MDD in a large community
sample of adolescents. However, an important
difference is that our analyses were limited
to parents with MDD, whereas Hammen &
Brennan (2003) combined depressed and nondepressed mothers and used a four-point severity scale that included no depression, minor/
subthreshold depression, mild/moderate MDD,
and severe/psychotic MDD. Thus, it is unclear
whether Hammen & Brennan’s (2003) findings
reflect differences between parents with mild/
moderate versus severe/psychotic MDD or
between the presence versus absence of parental
MDD.
The magnitude of the significant associations
between parental MDD and offspring psychopathology was generally in the small-to-medium
range. This is consistent with the view that parental depression is only one of many factors
contributing to the development of MDD in
offspring (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). However,
due to the large sample and high prevalence of
MDD, the confidence intervals were relatively
narrow, indicating that the hazard ratios were
estimated with a high degree of precision.
The lifetime prevalence of MDD through age
24 years in our sample of offspring (weighted
prevalence=42%) was considerably higher
than other epidemiological studies of depression.
For example, the estimated lifetime prevalence
of MDD through age 24 years in the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS; Kessler & Walters,
1998) was 21%. However, most epidemiological
studies are based on single-wave retrospective
assessments of predominantly adult samples. In
contrast, the prevalence of MDD in the OADP
is based on three diagnostic evaluations
conducted over a 7–8 years period from midadolescence to early adulthood. Interestingly,
the shape of the age of onset functions for ages
15–24 years in the OADP and NCS are very
similar, and both studies have relatively similar
12-month total incidence rates (7[.]6% and 6[.]6%
respectively) and 12-month prevalence rates
(9[.]9% and 12[.]4% respectively). This suggests
that the higher lifetime prevalence in the OADP
may be due to its prospective design and more

intensive surveillance. We suspect that this
resulted in the OADP detecting a number of
milder cases (e.g. less severe, shorter duration,
single episode) that are not identified in singlewave retrospective designs covering a much
broader time period.
This study had a number of strengths, including the use of a large community sample,
assessments of both mothers and fathers using
semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and repeated evaluations of offspring. However, the
study also had a number of limitations. First,
there are limits to the generalizability of the
sample, as participants were predominantly
Caucasian and only adolescents who were enrolled in high school were included in the T1
sampling frame.
Second, the possibility of sampling bias must
be considered, as the participation rate at T1
was modest, and participants were more likely
than non-participants to be female and to come
from families with slightly higher socio-economic status.
Third, we were able to conduct direct interviews with only 75% of the mothers and 46% of
the fathers. In order to minimize sampling bias,
we chose to include parents who could not be
personally interviewed and derived diagnoses
for them using the family history method.
However, the sensitivity of the family history
method is limited, and informants’ reports may
be influenced by their own history of psychopathology (Kendler et al. 1991; Chapman et al.
1994). In order to increase the sensitivity of
family history information and reduce the
effects of informants’ biases, we attempted to
obtain data from two informants when a parent
was unavailable for interview. In addition, we
included interview status as a covariate in our
analyses, and tested for interactions between
interview status and parental MDD.
Fourth, the data on diagnoses and age of onset in parents and offspring were retrospective,
although for the offspring this limitation was
partially mitigated by multiple follow-up evaluations.
Fifth, the inter-rater reliability of some clinical features in parents and offspring was only
moderate.
Sixth, we used a cohort of offspring who
were followed from mid-late adolescence into
early adulthood. Although this increased the


homogeneity of the sample, the findings may
differ for younger offspring. For example, in a
recent meta-analysis, Connell & Goodman
(2002) reported that the associations between
maternal and paternal depression and offspring
internalizing symptoms varied somewhat as a
function of the children’s age.
Seventh, we focused on psychiatric diagnoses
in offspring. It is also important to compare the
associations between maternal and paternal
MDD and other domains of offspring functioning, such as interpersonal and academic/
vocational adjustment. Finally, we did not
attempt to examine the processes or mechanisms that underlie the intergenerational transmission of MDD in this paper. We intend to
explore these issues in future reports.
