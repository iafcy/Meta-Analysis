group effect remained stable over the period of 12 months. Further, sleep-related cognitions,
safety behaviours, depression and somatization significantly decreased in the treatment group
compared with the control group. On all sleep diary parameters, medium to large effects were
revealed within the treatment group. Anxiety did not decrease significantly from pre- to postassessment. For all measures except somatization and anxiety significant within-group effects
were found at 12-month follow-up assessment indicating long-lasting effects. Conclusions:
This study adds evidence to the literature on unguided online interventions for insomnia, and
indicates that online CBT-I can have substantial long-term effects on relevant sleep-related
outcome parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that sleep-related cognitions and safety
behaviour can be successfully altered with an unguided CBT-I intervention.

**Introduction**

Insomnia has become a major public health concern, with far-reaching consequences for
the health and well-being of affected people. In Western countries, sleep complaints are
reported by one-third of the adult population, and 6–10% meet the diagnostic criteria for
insomnia disorder (Ohayon, 2011). Negative consequences of insomnia are diverse and include
daytime fatigue, reduced daytime performance, mood impairments, physical complaints, and
neuropsychological consequences such as difficulties with concentration and memory (Katz
and McHorney, 2002; Léger et al., 2002). Moreover, evidence shows that insomnia often
precipitates, exacerbates or prolongs a broad range of medical complaints such as mental
or physical illnesses (Baglioni et al., 2010, 2011; Fernandez-Mendoza and Vgontzas, 2013;
Pigeon et al., 2012; Roth and Roehrs, 2003; Spiegelhalder et al., 2012).
Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment with moderate
to large effects on measures of sleep continuity and on subjective insomnia severity in general
(Irwin et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2009; Trauer et al., 2015; Van Straten et al., 2017). Despite the
fact that evidence-based treatments exist and despite the negative impacts of sleep disturbances,
insomnia often remains unrecognized and untreated (Morin et al., 2006b). When insomnia
symptoms are reported to professionals (usually to a primary care physician), treatment is
normally limited to pharmacotherapy even though hypnotic medications can have severe side
effects (Kripke et al., 2002).
In recent years, scalable and low-threshold internet-based self-help treatments have been
developed for addressing a broad range of mental disorders and behavioural problems. Most
internet-based treatments target disorder-specific perpetuating factors, such as dysfunctional
behaviours, through CBT-based exercises and techniques. These techniques and exercises are
either guided or unguided (Barak et al., 2008). Such internet-based self-help tools have also
been developed and tested for insomnia. One meta-analysis found eleven published randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) which had tested the effect of internet-delivered CBT-I (Zachariae
et al., 2016). The global effect size (Hedge’s g) was high, with 1.09 (CI 0.74–1.45) for insomnia
severity and satisfactory for a broad range of secondary outcomes such as sleep onset latency,
wake after sleep onset, or total sleep time. The meta-analysis included studies on guided and
unguided interventions. The degree of personal clinical support was found to be associated
with a larger effect size for sleep efficiency at post-treatment and a larger reduction on insomnia
severity at follow-up assessment. However, some studies on unguided interventions reported


-----

high effect sizes as well. One web-based treatment called Sleepio (Espie et al., 2012) uses an
animated avatar that provides all the content of the programme audio- and video-based with no
clinical support needed. Sleepio was tested against a placebo and a treatment-as-usual group.
High effect sizes on the primary outcome (sleep efficiency) were found when the treatment
group was compared with both control groups.
Nevertheless, none of the 11 RCTs included in the meta-analysis reported long-term followup data. Only one recently published trial reported 12-month follow-up data of an online CBT-I
intervention (indicating enduring effects; Ritterband et al., 2017). The intervention was a fully
automated, interactive and tailored web-based treatment called SHUTi that included sleep
restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene and relapse prevention.
Although treatment effects seem substantial in online CBT-I, it has remained unclear if
they are equivalent to traditional face-to-face approaches. Two recent studies compared online
CBT-I against a CBT-I programme delivered face-to-face, and found conflicting results: Lancee
et al. (2016) found that a face-to-face CBT-I treatment was superior to an online CBT-I
intervention, whereas Blom et al. (2015) found that their online CBT-I intervention was noninferior, compared with a face-to-face treatment group.
Furthermore, it remains unclear which perpetuating factors that are hypothesized in
theoretical models of insomnia are successfully targeted in online interventions. Conventional
CBT-I, delivered face-to-face, mainly includes psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, stimulus
control, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques and cognitive restructuring of unhelpful
thoughts and beliefs about sleep (Morin, 2006). The effects of the behavioural components of
CBT-I (i.e. stimulus control and sleep restriction) are well established (Morin et al., 2006a).
Moreover, evidence shows that cognitions are also an important target for interventions (Harvey
et al., 2007). Compared with healthy subjects, insomnia patients report more dysfunctional
thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep (Morin et al., 1993), and such dysfunctional
cognitions play an important role in theoretical models of insomnia (Espie, 2002; Harvey, 2002;
Lundh and Broman, 2000). Harvey (2002) suggests that attentional and perceptual processes,
together with maladaptive beliefs and behaviour, contribute to the perpetuation of insomnia.
According to this model, attentional processes include the monitoring of internal and external
sleep-related threats, such as indicators of not getting enough sleep and of not functioning
well during the day. Harvey (2002) postulates that these sleep-related threats lead to safety
behaviours. Safety behaviours are maladaptive coping strategies (e.g. staying in bed longer
than usual) that are executed to avoid the negative consequences of poor sleep. Harvey et al.
(2007) suggest that such safety behaviours can be problematic for two reasons: first, safety
behaviours may prevent patients from experiencing a non-confirmation of the feared negative
consequence, and second, such behaviours may increase the probability that the anticipated
negative consequences occur.
Cognitive and attentional biases as well as safety behaviours can be addressed and
successfully altered in conventional, face-to-face CBT-I (e.g. Harvey et al., 2007). However,
only a few studies have investigated whether cognitions and safety behaviours can be
successfully altered in online interventions as well. Lancee et al. (2015) found that
dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and safety behaviours were reduced after a guided online
intervention for the treatment of insomnia. However, evidence on the successful delivery of
cognitive techniques is scarce, particularly with respect to unguided internet-based treatments.
The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of an unguided internet-based treatment,
‘mementor somnium’, whichinvolves behavioural andcognitivetechniques for thetreatment of

insomnia. Aside from testing the general efficacy of the program, this study examines whether
effects are stable over a long follow-up period and aims to determine whether cognitions and
safety behaviour can be successfully altered using a virtual sleep coach.

**Method**

_Participants_

All participants were self-recruited via a study website. The link to the webpage was spread
via e-mail, newspapers, clinics and clinical practitioners in Switzerland, Austria and Germany.
People who expressed their interest in participation received an e-mail with study information
and informed consent. Once written informed consent was given, participants received a link
with screening questionnaires consisting of self-report measures and demographic questions.
Inclusion screening criteria were: fluency in German, at least 18 years of age, having access
to a computer and internet, and a minimum of 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien
et al., 2001). Exclusion criteria were working in shifts, ongoing psychological treatment,
suicidality, psychotic disorder, alcohol abuse, a score higher than 19 on the Beck Depression
Inventory revised (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) or suffering from a sleep disorder other than
insomnia. Screening questionnaires were used for the following sleep disorders: obstructive
sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome and parasomnia. If the screening was positive, participants
were excluded from the study. Medication was only an exclusion criterion if the dose was
changed before or during the treatment or if signs of an abusive intake existed. Participants
were asked if they took any medication. If that was the case, they were asked if they recently
had changed the dose; in addition, screening questions concerning medication abuse were
asked. If the screening was positive or if the dose had changed, people were excluded from
the study. In the study information, participants were explicitly instructed not to change their
regular medication or, otherwise, to report any changes in medication immediately to the study
coordinator.

_Study design and procedure_

An RCT with two parallel arms was conducted: an online CBT-I group (treatment group),
and a waiting list control group. After completion of the screening questionnaires, eligibility
for inclusion was determined in a structured clinical interview by trained interviewers with at
least a bachelor’s degree in psychology. In the clinical interview, DSM-V criteria for insomnia
disorder were checked. Participants who did not meet the criteria were excluded from the
study. The interview took place via telephone. In total, 323 people showed interest in the study,
120 officially registered and completed the pre-study screening, and 56 participants met the
inclusion criteria. The flowchart of the recruitment process, randomization, and assessments
at pre-, post- and follow-up is presented in Fig. 1.
Participants were assigned to either the intervention or the waiting list condition in a 1:1 ratio
using blocked randomization with 10 participants per block. Randomization was conducted by
an independent person who had no contact with the participants. The interviewers were blinded
to the randomization list. Sample size was calculated based on a power analysis performed
with G*Power (Faul et al., 2009). Based on other studies (Zachariae et al., 2016) a large effect

size of f 0.5 for treatment effects was expected; with a power of 80% and a significance level
=
of p < .01 a minimal sample size of 40 participants (20 in each group) was calculated.
Duration of the intervention was 6 weeks. Information from screening was used as a baseline
measure. Outcome measures at post-treatment and follow-up (12 months) were obtained
electronically via a link to the online questionnaires sent to participants’ e-mail addresses.
Participants in the waitlist-condition received access to the treatment upon completion of the
post-assessment. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee Zurich. The trial
was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02629913 and Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal.

_Measures_

The ISI (Bastien et al., 2001) was used as the primary outcome measure. This self-report
questionnaire consists of seven items scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores
indicating a higher degree of symptoms and perceived impact of sleep difficulties. Items are
summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 28. A total score of 0 to 7 is defined as normal, 8 to
14 as sub-threshold insomnia, 15 to 21 as moderate insomnia and above 21 as severe clinical
insomnia (Bastien et al., 2001).
In the treatment group a sleep diary was used to measure process parameters. The sleep
diary consisted of a morning and evening report. The morning report followed the guidelines
of a sleep expert consensus on sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012). The evening report was a
slightly adapted version of the short evening report of the German Society of Sleep Medicine
(Liendl and Hoffmann, 1999). Participants received e-mail reminders if they did not fill in
the sleep diary. Moreover, sleep diary completion was automatically checked whenever the
participant logged into the program, and participants could only continue the online treatment
after adding missing reports for the prior three days. The following main parameters were
calculated from the morning report of the sleep diary: sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after
sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time (TST). In the evening report,
participants rated ‘overall sleep restfulness’ (restfulness) and ‘overall daytime performance’
(daytime performance) on a scale from 0 to 100.
The Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ; Tang and Harvey, 2004)
was used to measure sleep-related cognitions. This instrument consists of 10 statements,
and participants rate their agreement with each statement on a 10-point scale. The Sleeprelated Behaviours Questionnaire (SRBQ; Ree and Harvey, 2004) was used to measure
safety behaviour. The questionnaire consists of 32 items that assess insomnia-related safety
behaviours. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, adding to a sum score from 0 to 128.
Finally, to assess secondary symptoms, two well-established questionnaires were administered:
the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) for depression, and the Brief
Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18; Derogatis, 2001), using only the subscales somatization (BSIS) and anxiety (BSI-A).

_CBT-I intervention_

The online intervention ‘mementor somnium’ consists of six fully automated sessions of
CBT-I; every session contains different modules including psychoeducation, sleep restriction,
relaxation, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring and changing sleep-related behaviours. A
detailed description of the module content is provided in Table 1. The six treatment sessions

Sleep information Psychoeducation: basic information about sleep and 20 min
insomnia. The aim is to correct common misconceptions
about sleep which may contribute to the perpetuation of
insomnia

Practical exercise Learned knowledge is applied by taking on the role of a sleep 15 min
expert who must give advice to a patient suffering from
insomnia. Symptoms of the patient are similar to the
symptoms of the user

Insomnia vicious Introduction to an individual vicious cycle that can 15 min
cycle contribute to the perpetuation of the insomnia disorder

Sleep schedule Introducing sleep restriction. The average total sleep time of 15 min
the last week is introduced as the new bedtime (sleep
window). Shortest sleep window is 6 hours. When the
average sleep efficiency of the past 7 days is >85%, the
sleep window can be extended by 15 min. The aim of this
module is to increase sleep pressure, which can improve
sleep efficiency

Relaxation Introduction to the progressive muscle relaxation technique. 20 min
The aim is to decrease physical and mental tension in order
to enhance sleep onset latency and waking after sleep onset

Sleep behaviour Introduction to sleep hygiene rules and to the stimulus 20 min
control technique. The aim is to rebuild an association
between sleeping and bed by classical conditioning

Thoughts Cognitive restructuring. In an adaptive dialogue, different 20 min
typical thoughts that insomnia patients often have are
discussed. The aim is to identify dysfunctional
sleep-related thoughts and replace them with
sleep-compatible cognitions

Daily decisions Typical sleep-related safety behaviour is presented in 15 min
vignettes. Different options of how to react to these
vignettes are given. The user has to decide on one option
which is later commented on by the animated sleep coach.
The aim is to demonstrate that reducing safety behaviour
can have positive effects on sleep

Graduation The content of the different modules is briefly repeated and 15 min
tested in a quiz. The time after this intervention is planned

were delivered chronologically, with a minimum waiting period of 48 hours between sessions.
Participants were guided through the intervention by an animated sleep coach, which provided
audio information supported by dynamic and interactive graphical content. At the beginning
of the intervention, participants set goals on which they received continuous feedback based

on the sleep diary data. A unique feature of the intervention is its tailored dialogue with the
animated sleep coach. The coach asks questions throughout the treatment course, and delivers
content based on the user’s response behaviour.

_Statistical analyses_

Baseline group differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were analysed
using independent t-tests (two-sided) and Pearson χ [2]-tests. To evaluate the effect of treatment
on study outcome measures, linear mixed-effects analyses (using Restricted Maximum
Likelihood as the estimator) were conducted. This statistical procedure is recommended for
clinical trials with incomplete data (Beunckens et al., 2005). Treatment (mementor somnium
versus wait-list control), time (pre- and post-assessment), and the interaction of Treatment
Time were entered as fixed factors, subject as a random factor, and ISI, APSQ, SRBQ,
×
BDI-II, BSI-A and BSI-I as dependent variables in separate analyses. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d)
were calculated for changes within the treatment group from baseline to post- and follow-up
assessment. Between-group effect sizes were calculated by using the mean pre/post-assessment
change in the treatment group minus the mean pre/post-assessment change in the control group,
divided by the pooled pre-assessment standard deviation as recommend by Morris (2008).
Changes in sleep diary data were tested within the treatment group by using dependent t-tests
(two-sided). For each of the six treatment weeks, daily sleep diary data were averaged to a
weekly mean. As missing data could have influenced sleep diary and follow-up scores, multiple
imputation was employed (Sterne et al., 2009). For the missing scores, ten separate datasets
were generated. Pooled t-test results were reported. To evaluate whether any baseline variables
were associated with treatment response, a logistic regression analysis was computed entering
baseline variables as predictors and the ISI remission criterion as the dependent variable.
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23 and R.

**Results**

_Participant characteristics_

All demographic results for the different groups are reported in Table 2. For the analysis
of group differences at baseline, independent sample t-tests were calculated. Significant
differences were revealed for the ISI (t (54) 2.25, p .03) and BDI-II (t (54) 2.23,

All participants of the control group and 25 participants of the treatment group completed
the post-assessment (93%). All participants that completed the post-assessment, plus one
who had missed post-assessment, completed the 12-month follow-up assessment (94% of
all participants). The participant flow chart with detailed information is presented in Fig. 1.

_Treatment effects_

Results of the statistical analyses are presented in Table 3. For the main outcome parameter, the
ISI (Insomnia severity), a significant group time interaction effect was found, indicating a
×
marked improvement from pre-assessment to post-assessment in the treatment group and little
change in the control group. The between-group effect size and the within-treatment-group
effect size were large.
Apart from the statistically significant change on self-rated insomnia severity, results also
indicated a clinically significant improvement on the remission criterion of an ISI score lower
than 8 (Bastien et al., 2001). At post-treatment, 56% of the participants in the treatment group
had achieved remission, compared with 11% in the control group. A Pearson chi-squared test
revealed a significant difference between the two groups on the remission criterion (χ [2] (1, n
=
56) 11.89, p < .01). None of the baseline variables predicted whether participants achieved

remission (χ [2] (6, n 52) 5.485, p .48).

For all sleep diary parameters, significant within-treatment differences between week 1 and
week 6 were found, with effect sizes ranging from d 0.45 to d 1.48. SOL and WASO
= =
were reduced on average by 19 and 31 min, respectively. TST increased an average of 35 min.
Statistical results of all pre–post differences (week 1 to week 5) are given in Table 4.
For the sleep-related cognitions and safety behaviours, significant group time interaction
×
effects emerged, indicating substantial improvements from pre- to post-assessment in the
treatment group compared with the control group. In addition, there were significant group
×
time interaction effects on depression and somatization (BDI-II and BSI-S). In contrast to the
other results, no significant group time interaction effect on anxiety was revealed for the
×
pre- to post-assessment comparison.
Large between-group and large within-treatment group effect sizes occurred for depression
and sleep-related cognitions. For safety behaviour, somatization and anxiety small to medium
between-group and small to medium within-treatment-group effect sizes occurred. For anxiety,
95% confidence intervals of the within-treatment-group effect size included 0 indicating nonsignificance.

_Stability of treatment group effects_

A large within effect size between pre-assessment and follow-up regarding insomnia severity
was found, indicating a long-lasting primary treatment effect. The same pattern occurred for
sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviour and depression, with medium to large effect sizes.
This indicates that secondary effects of the intervention were long-lasting as well. Statistical
results of all pre- to follow-up differences are presented in Table 3.

**Discussion**

In this study, an unguided internet-based self-help intervention for insomnia (CBT-I) was
compared with a waitlist control group. On the primary endpoint of self-reported insomnia
severity, large between- and within-treatment group effect sizes and a significant interaction
between the treatment and control group were observed, indicating a marked improvement
on insomnia severity for the treatment group compared with the control group. The treatment
effect was stable over a long follow-up period (12 months). This outcome appears comparable
to therapist-delivered CBT-I (Riemann and Perlis, 2009) and to similar unguided CBT-I
interventions (Espie et al., 2012; Ritterband et al., 2009). This study adds evidence to the
literature on unguided internet interventions for insomnia and demonstrates that internet-based
CBT-I can have substantial long-term effects on insomnia severity.
Interestingly, attrition rates were extremely low in this study (6–7%) compared with other
studies, in which rates were 14–48% (Lancee et al., 2012, 2015). Thus, delivering CBT-I with a
virtual sleep coach, including dynamic and interactive graphical content through an advanced
web-based technology, might have a positive impact on the retention rate.
Taking a closer look on secondary outcome parameters, it was remarkable that the anxiety
score of the BSI-18 did not change significantly from pre- to post-assessment, even though
insomnia symptoms were already drastically reduced at post-assessment. There was a trend
towards a significant effect at follow-up assessment, but the confidence interval still included 0
at the lower end (–0.18 to 0.94). Other studies had already revealed a close link between
insomnia and anxiety disorder and highlighted a bidirectional association between these
conditions (Jansson-Fröjmark and Lindblom, 2008). Therefore, it can be assumed that the
non-significant effect could be due to the small sample size, reflecting a power problem.

_Treating insomnia online and automated_ 299

Furthermore, in line with previous studies, we found a substantial effect on depression
symptoms. The symptom improvement measured with the BDI-II was significantly stronger
in the intervention group compared with the control group. The same pattern occurred for
the somatization score of the BSI. Remarkably, the treatment effect size on depression was
still large at the 12-month follow-up assessment, indicating long-lasting transfer effects of
internet-based CBT-I on depression.
Apart from testing the effectiveness of the internet-based self-help program, this study
examined to what extent cognitions can be successfully altered with an unguided self-help
intervention. The analyses showed a significant decrease of sleep-related worries and fears in
the treatment group compared with the control group. These results indicate that the online
intervention (mementor somnium) successfully modified maladaptive cognitions that have
been shown to play an important role in perpetuating insomnia (Harvey, 2002). Furthermore,
the intervention led to an adaptation of sleep-related safety behaviours in the treatment group,
compared with the control group. Lancee et al. (2015) reported a medium within-group effect
size (d .61) of their guided online intervention on sleep-related safety behaviour. This finding
=
seems to be comparable to our own.

_Limitations_

Several limitations of the study must be mentioned. First, the small sample size did not allow
for more sophisticated analysis for power reasons. With a bigger sample, it would have been
possible to divide users into sub-samples and detect possible outcome mediators for them (e.g.
improvements in safety behaviours or sleep-related cognitions). Second, the waitlist controlgroup did not have access to the sleep diary; this made it impossible to test for interaction
effects on sleep diary parameters. Third, we did not include objective measurements (e.g.
polysomnography) as outcome parameters due to the cost of such procedures. However, it
should be noted that subjective measurements are standard in most RCTs for insomnia, and
especially from the patient’s point of view it is uncertain whether objective sleep parameters
are more meaningful for measuring treatment effects of CBT-I (Buysse et al., 2006).
Despite these limitations, this study adds an important piece of evidence to current literature,
showing that the burden of insomnia in the population can be addressed sustainably using fullyautomated CBT-I.
