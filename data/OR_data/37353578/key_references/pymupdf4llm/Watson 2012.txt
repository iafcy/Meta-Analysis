### Abstract

**Background:** Addressing the obesity epidemic requires the development of effective, scalable interventions. Pedometers and
Web-based programs are beneficial in increasing activity levels but might be enhanced by the addition of nonhuman coaching.
**Objectives:** We hypothesized that a virtual coach would increase activity levels, via step count, in overweight or obese individuals
beyond the effect observed using a pedometer and website alone.

**Methods:** We recruited 70 participants with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m[2] from the Boston metropolitan
area. Participants were assigned to one of two study arms and asked to wear a pedometer and access a website to view step counts.
Intervention participants also met with a virtual coach, an automated, animated computer agent that ran on their home computers,
set goals, and provided personalized feedback. Data were collected and analyzed in 2008. The primary outcome measure was
change in activity level (percentage change in step count) over the 12-week study, split into four 3-week time periods. Major
secondary outcomes were change in BMI and participants’ satisfaction.
**Results:** The mean age of participants was 42 years; the majority of participants were female (59/70, 84%), white (53/70, 76%),
and college educated (68/70, 97%). Of the initial 70 participants, 62 completed the study. Step counts were maintained in
intervention participants but declined in controls. The percentage change in step count between those in the intervention and
control arms, from the start to the end, did not reach the threshold for significance (2.9% vs –12.8% respectively, _P = .07)._
However, repeated measures analysis showed a significant difference when comparing percentage changes in step counts between
control and intervention participants over all time points (analysis of variance, P = .02). There were no significant changes in
secondary outcome measures.
**Conclusions:** The virtual coach was beneficial in maintaining activity level. The long-term benefits and additional applications
of this technology warrant further study.

### Introduction

With 65% of US adults being overweight, and a third meeting
the criteria for obesity [1], health professionals have been
spurred to develop innovative strategies to address this epidemic.
A major driver of obesity is inadequate physical activity [2],
with only a quarter of US adults engaging in the recommended
amount of weekly physical activity [3].

Motivational coaching, personalized feedback, goal setting, and
patient education have been used successfully to bring about
long-term changes in diet and activity [4,5]. Delivering these
components via traditional means, however, such as face-to-face
interactions with a clinician, is costly and difficult to scale up.

New technologies have shown promise as effective, accessible,
and inexpensive solutions. Pedometers, wearable devices that
capture step count, can increase activity levels by up to 2000
steps per day [6]. In addition, the use of the Internet to
communicate information to individuals may allow population
health interventions to be delivered, and widely disseminated,
at relatively low cost [7-10].To date, several Internet-based
interventions have demonstrated reductions in weight through
a combination of self-monitoring, education, and motivational
messaging [11-13].

Such interventions may be enhanced by the addition of a coach,
to promote accountability and adherence to an exercise program.
In the helping professions there is a well-documented association
between the quality of the professional–client relationship and
outcomes [14]. The psychotherapy literature describes this
working alliance as the trust and belief that the helper and patient
have in each other as team members in achieving a desired
outcome [15,16].

Coaching need not be carried out face-to-face; indeed, formal
and informal e-coaching models have been demonstrated to be
beneficial in promoting activity and weight loss [17,18].
Furthermore, a coach need not be human; recent research into
the use of embodied computer agents has shown that participants
can successfully form a working alliance relationship with a
nonhuman agent or, simply put, a virtual coach [19].

In our study we sought to understand the effectiveness of virtual
coaching compared with the use of a pedometer and website
alone in improving activity levels in overweight or obese
participants. We hypothesized that use of a virtual coach would
increase their activity levels, in the form of step count, beyond
the effect observed using a pedometer and website alone.

### Methods

##### Eligibility Criteria

Participants were between 20 and 55 years old (inclusive); had
a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m[2] (inclusive);
were fluent in spoken and written English; had a primary care
physician; had access to a personal computer with an available
USB port, speakers, and Internet access; and either answered
no to all 7 questions on the Physical Activity Readiness
Questionnaire (PAR-Q) or obtained written permission from
their primary care physician to take part in the study. The


PAR-Q is a validated screening tool designed to identify adults
with medical problems that might preclude them from safely
initiating an exercise regimen [20].

##### Setting

Recruitment took place in Boston, Massachusetts, USA through
advertisements in local newspapers, on a local website
(Craigslist), at health care facilities, and through broadcast
emails within the hospital email network. All study visits took
place at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.

Recruitment commenced in June 2008 and took 3 weeks. Data
were collected and analyzed in 2008. The study was reviewed
and approved in July 2007 by the institutional review board of
the Massachusetts General Hospital. This trial was registered
on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00792207).

##### Interventions

At an initial visit, all potential participants were weighed and
measured using a waist-high, stand-on bariatric scale (Detecto,
capacity 600 × 0.2 lb; Cardinal Scale Manufacturing Company,
Webb City, MO, USA) and a mechanical wall-mounted
stadiometer, both maintained by Massachusetts General Hospital
Biomedical Engineering. Following confirmation of eligibility
and consent, the participant was randomly assigned to the
intervention or control arm of the study.

All participants were provided with the pedometer (ActiPed;
FitLinxx, Norwalk, CT, USA) and instructed to wear it at all
times over the 12-week study period, apart from when bathing
or sleeping. The ActiPed device is a highly accurate activity
monitor, worn on the shoe, which contains an accelerometer
and tracks steps [21]. The device wirelessly transmits activity
data to a USB receiver on a participant’s desktop computer,
where it is then relayed over the Internet to a database on a
secure computer server (Figure 1). All participants were given
access to the pedometer manufacturer’s password-protected
ActiHealth website to view graphs of their activity levels over
time and set personal goals.

In addition, those in the intervention arm of the study were
provided access to the virtual coach, a computer-animated
exercise advisor that runs using software installed on users’
home computers. The virtual coach is entirely automated and
follows an algorithm-driven script, using simulated face-to-face
conversation, including verbal and nonverbal
relationship-building behaviors modeled on best practices from
studies of patient–provider health communication with the goal
of establishing a working alliance [19]. The scripts used by the
virtual coach were developed through an interdisciplinary
collaboration involving physicians, computer scientists, and
exercise trainers to ensure adherence to best practices. The script
employs behavioral and social cognitive strategies demonstrated
in the literature to promote exercise behavior change. These
strategies include goal setting, shaping, self-monitoring, positive
reinforcement, problem solving, education, and social support

[22,23].

The virtual coach software was integrated with the database
containing the participants’ activity data to allow tailored
interactions according to each participant’s adherence to step


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Watson et al


count goals. The interactions all followed a structured pattern,
starting with greeting and social interaction, proceeding to
review of pedometer step count, feedback and goal setting, tips
on activity or diet, and commitment to date of next interaction,
and ending with encouragement and farewell. However, both
the dialogue structure and the format and content of individual
utterances were tailored based on each user’s progress in the
system (eg, whether they had progressed past baseline), their
current status (eg, whether they had met their short-term goals),
and discourse context (eg, whether they had just asked the virtual
coach a question or asked for help). As a result, those who had
not met their activity target would have a different interaction
at the same time point in the study from those who had met their
goals. Users had to select from a series of answer options, as
the system was not designed to handle free-text responses.

Software modules were significantly tested by the development
team, followed by several end-to-end pilot tests of the
intervention prior to deployment.


Intervention participants were instructed to meet with the coach
three times a week throughout the study. These interactions
lasted approximately 5 to 10 minutes per session. The 12-week
program focused on building rapport and establishing baseline
activity levels, followed by tips to increase activity, daily
personalized goal setting, and advice about maintaining a healthy
diet and activity level after the study concludes.

To ensure compliance and minimize loss of data throughout the
12-week study period, study staff contacted participants either
if no step data were received or if those in the intervention arm
did not talk to the virtual coach for 7 consecutive days. At the
final visit, participants were weighed and measured and asked
to complete several surveys.

Participants were provided with gift cards for attendance at each
study visit. The technology was provided at no charge, although
all participants were required to have a computer with Internet
access.

##### Primary and Secondary Outcomes

The primary end point of this study was the percentage change
in step count between those in the intervention and those in the
control arms, from the start of the study compared with the end
of the study. To evaluate the percentage change in step count,
we divided the 12-week study into four 3-week time periods
(P1, P2, P3, P4). Secondary end points were changes in weight,
BMI, 7-day physical activity recall, physical activity stage of
change, self-efficacy and exercise benefits and barriers, and
satisfaction with the program [24-27]. Satisfaction was measured
using a combination of novel questions regarding the activity
monitor and standardized questions from the Working Alliance
Inventory to assess the strength of social bond between
intervention participants and the virtual coach [16].


##### Sample Size

This study was designed to detect a difference of 12 in the
percentage change in step count between intervention and
control participants from P1 to P4. This number was determined
following a priori discussions with clinical experts and was
thought to represent a clinically significant change in steps
assuming a baseline of between 5000 and 7000 steps per day.
To have an 80% power to detect such a difference, assuming a
standard deviation of 16, a type I error level of .05, and a
dropout rate of 20%, a total sample size of 70 was required.

##### Randomization

Random numbers were generated (using Microsoft Excel;
Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and assigned
control or intervention status on a 1:1 basis with a block size
of four. Sealed, ordered envelopes were prepared by one
investigator, who was not involved in participant enrollment,


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Watson et al


containing information about group assignment and opened
only after the participant consented. Due to the nature of the
intervention, study staff and participants were not blinded to
group assignment over the course of the study.

##### Statistical Analysis

We compared continuous outcomes between groups using a
Student _t test (for normally distributed outcomes) and the_
Wilcoxon rank sum test (for nonnormally distributed outcomes
and rank measures). Differences in proportions between groups
were compared by using chi-square tests or Fisher exact test
when appropriate. All calculations were performed with SAS
version 9.1 (The SAS system for Windows; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA). We calculated average step counts for each 3-week
period of time (period) by dividing the total number of steps
recorded in the period by the number of days data were received.
Days with a recorded step count of <100 were noted as missing
data for the day, as this low level of activity was more likely to
reflect the ActiPed being carried in a bag or moved in a house
than actually being worn. Participants with no data for a period

**Table 1.** Baseline demographics of study participants


were noted as missing for this period. The analysis was
conducted both examining only those participants with data for
each period and including those who had missing data points
in one, or more than one, period. A 2-sided P value of .05 was
considered statistically significant. Average values are
represented as mean (SE) unless otherwise stated.

### Results

##### Outcomes

Figure 3 shows the average step count per period according to
group. The average step count in the control group fell
significantly from 7174 in P1 to 6149 in P4 (P = .01). In
contrast, the intervention participants’ mean step count did not
change significantly from P1 (6943) to P4 (6943 vs 7024,
respectively, P = .85).

Figure 4 charts the percentage change in mean activity levels
for each period relative to period 1, only including participants
with data for each period (30 control and 27 intervention). The
difference seen between groups between P1 and P3 was
statistically significant (P = .02), whereas the differences
between P1 and P2, and between P1 and P4 did not meet criteria
for significance (P = .12 and .07, respectively). A repeated


measures analysis of variance, incorporating all data points from
this figure, demonstrated that the percentage change in step
count across all study periods was significantly different in the
intervention versus control arms (P = .02).

We repeated this analysis including those participants who had
data missing from one or more of the periods (eg, all
completers). The changes from P1 to P2, P3, and P4 were not
significant in this analysis (P = .14, .18, and .07 respectively).
Due to the shifting sample size in this analysis it was not
possible to perform a repeated measures analysis of variance
on these data.

There were no statistically significant changes in secondary
outcome measures. Mean reduction in BMI was 0.04 and 0.25
in control and intervention participants respectively (P = .44)

##### Participants’ Adherence to Protocol

The mean number of days that step data were recorded over the
course of the study was 73/84 (87%) for the control group and
71/84 (85%) for the intervention group (P = .64). Intervention
participants had a mean number of sessions per participant over
the course of the study of 28.9 (range 3–63, recommended 36).
The mean number of visits per week fell from 2.8 in week 1 to
1.9 in week 12, although this change was not statistically
significant (P = .08). There was no significant correlation
between the number of sessions intervention participants had
with the coach and their performance, in terms of either absolute
step increase, absolute step count, or slope of step count change
during the intervention.


##### Participant Benefits and Satisfaction

Both intervention and control participants reported having
benefited from taking part in the study (28/30, 93% and 28/31,
90% respectively, _P = .67). Self-reported changes by_
intervention and control participants included exercising more
frequently (25/29, 86% vs 21/29, 72%, P = .19) and improved
diet and eating habits (13/29, 45% vs 6/29, 21%, _P = .05),_
respectively.

Intervention participants were asked specific questions regarding
their interactions with the virtual coach: 18/31 (58%) agreed
that the coach motivated them to become more active and 27/31
(87%) reported feeling guilty if they skipped an appointment
with the coach.

### Discussion

In this trial, providing overweight participants with access to a
virtual coach in addition to a pedometer and website appeared
to sustain step count over the course of the 12-week study, while
step counts in control participants decreased from the start to
the end. The percentage change in step count between those in
the intervention and those in the control arms, from the start of
the study compared with the end of the study, did not reach the
threshold for significance (P = .07). However, repeated measures
analysis found a significant difference when comparing
percentage changes in step counts between control and
intervention participants over all time points (P = .02).

These findings suggest that virtual coaching may be a useful
adjunct to existing automated applications designed to promote
activity, such as pedometers and online Web programs, and
affects participant behavior over and above physiologic
monitoring and text- and graph-based feedback. The virtual
coach provides an interactive relationship, which is absent in
the use of a pedometer or website alone. Previous research has
shown that participants can form a social bond with a computer
agent, even though they are aware that the agent does not
represent an actual human [14]. We observed a somewhat
dichotomous response to the virtual coach with some
participants reporting negative emotions, such as guilt, anger,
or frustration. Some of these emotions may actually promote
activity, with the coach functioning as an external conscience
or source of accountability, whereas others may erode the
effectiveness of the relationship. Although we were not able to
demonstrate significant difference in activity based on
participants’reactions to the coach, the observed trend suggests
that dissatisfaction negatively affects the ability of the coach to
promote increased activity. Further investigation into which
segments of the patient population are most responsive to this
form of automated coaching would allow us to maximize the
impact of this intervention.

Figure 4 depicts a decline in activity in controls at the end of
the study relative to their activity over the first 3 weeks. It
appears that, rather than comparing which interventions increase
activity by the largest amounts over extended time periods,
interventions should be measured in terms of how well they
promote sustained activity over time. Study participants, like
the general population, are likely to be most motivated when
commencing an activity regimen; maintaining this commitment
over time is the challenge. Our study demonstrates that the
decline in activity observed in control participants may be
overcome through virtual coaching over a 12-week time period.
In fact, the mean daily step counts in the last 3 weeks of the
study were around 800 steps higher in intervention participants
than in control participants, although this difference was not
statistically significant. Given that pedometers have been
demonstrated to increase step count by around 2000 steps per
day [6], this suggests that virtual coaching might offer an
additional increase in steps compared with pedometers alone.
Longer study would be required to assess the effectiveness of
virtual coaching over extended time periods.


Developing effective, automated self-management programs,
that offer a relationship and personalized feedback, may prove
essential to developing scalable solutions to deal with large
populations faced with chronic disease. Technology-based
solutions are becoming increasingly feasible as the proportion
of Americans with access to cell phones and the Internet rises:
current adoption estimates are 85% and 79%, respectively [28].
Internet-based health behavior-change programs may have more
potential in the area of weight management than in many other
health-related areas [29], as obese people are more likely to
participate in follow-up because of a personal and
nonstigmatizing approach via the Internet. Internet-based
physical activity and weight-management programs have been
shown to promote behavior change [30], particularly in
occupational health settings [31], but the results haven’t always
been consistent. A randomized trial of an Internet-based
weight-management intervention among military personnel had
shown benefits by preventing weight gain [32]. Studies should,
however, assess the quality and appropriateness of the tailored
advice. For example, a study by Slootmaker et al [33] evaluated
the feasibility and effectiveness of a 3-month intervention in
which office workers were provided with a personal activity
monitor coupled to simple and concise Web-based tailored
physical activity advice. They observed no significant
intervention effect in the physical activity outcomes at the
8-month follow-up. Whether Internet-based interventions are
more effective in helping people sustain their weight loss than
in promoting new weight loss is an area of active inquiry [34].

Equitable access to technology is still a further concern, as
groups most affected by obesity, such as minorities and
low-socioeconomic status groups, are least likely to have access
to technology [35]. Even low-cost, text messaging-based
interventions delivered on cell phones have shown positive
short-term behavioral outcomes [36]. Therefore, providing
access to computers at local libraries or creating coaching
applications that run on cell phones may be helpful strategies
to bridge this divide [37-39].

This application may also be of value in tackling weight and
activity issues among the pediatric or adolescent population.
These groups are avid users of new technology and may be
receptive to automated Web-based programs. To reduce the
prevalence of overweight and obesity in these populations, it
may also be necessary to decrease time spent in sedentary
behaviors, such as leisure-time Internet and computer use [40].
Previous projects in these populations have primarily focused
on school-based interventions, although the need to develop
and evaluate Internet-based approaches has been flagged as a
priority area for research [41].

There were several limitations to this study. Our study
participants were primarily white, college-educated women. As
a result, it may be difficult to generalize our findings to the
wider population of overweight or obese patients who may be
less comfortable taking a more active role in managing their
health or in using technology. We do not have access to baseline
step counts for study participants. We did, however, survey
participants about baseline activity levels and found no
significant difference. The step counts observed in the first few
weeks after enrollment likely reflect an increase from baseline


-----

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Watson et al


step counts for both intervention and control participants. It is
also difficult to compare the results of this intervention with
other pedometer-based programs because, unlike many
commercially available pedometers, the ActiPed does not give
participants immediate feedback on their current step count.

The length of the study was 12 weeks: ideally benefits of an
activity or weight-loss program would be assessed over a longer
time period. If this study were to be repeated over a longer time
period, the coaching algorithm would need to be expanded to
allow for a more variable series of interactions to maintain
participants’interest. Some of our participants reported finding
the coach repetitive even over a 12-week time period.
Conducting the study over a longer period of time, or with more
participants, would allow for more robust assessment of highly
relevant secondary outcome measures, such as decrease in BMI.

Finally, study staff contacted both intervention and control
participants if they were noncompliant with the use of the
pedometer or virtual coach, or if they were experiencing
technical difficulties. There was more contact with the
intervention participants (51 calls) than with control participants
(31 calls). This likely reflects the fact that the intervention group
had two different technologies to operate. This difference in
contact may have had some bearing on the observed effects
over the course of the study, but we think this is likely to be
minor, as contact was not related to level of step count.

Virtual coaching has many applications beyond promoting
activity. Coaching is increasingly recognized as an important
component in the management of chronic conditions, such as
diabetes and heart disease, and in the promotion of healthy

behaviors, such as adherence to medication [42]. Given the
growing burden of chronic disease and the shortage of providers

[43], such applications may prove useful adjuncts to
conventional office-based care. By linking data from home
monitoring devices such as scales, blood pressure cuffs, or
glucometers to automated coaching programs, health
practitioners could encourage patients to develop better
self-management skills. Clinician input could be provided if
predefined triggers were alerted. Physicians have been slow to
adopt information technology tools [44] due to concerns around
reimbursement, data overload, and clinical outcomes, so
thoughtful integration within existing workflow, including
electronic medical record integration, would be necessary to
ensure participation.

Broader changes in the health care payment system, such as the
shift from visit-based to outcome-based reimbursement, may
promote adoption of this type of care-delivery platform by
clinicians. Pay-for-performance initiatives promote provider
innovation around care delivery. An online coaching platform
could be used, either as an adjunct to traditional care or as a
stand-alone self-management program for patients.

##### Conclusion

In this study we demonstrated a sustained level of activity in
overweight participants provided with a virtual coach in addition
to a pedometer and Web-based feedback, compared with a
decline seen in those provided with a pedometer and Web-based
program alone. Further work should examine the long-term
benefits of virtual coaching and the extension of this application
to a wider patient population.
