**Abstract**
**_Background The Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY_**
(Ally) app is a smartphone application that combines financial incentives with chatbot-guided interventions to
encourage users to reach personalized daily step goals.
**_Purpose_** To evaluate the effects of incentives, weekly
planning, and daily self-monitoring prompts that were
used as intervention components as part of the Ally app.
**_Methods_** We conducted an 8 week optimization trial
with _n = 274 insurees of a health insurance company_
in Switzerland. At baseline, participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs.
charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of
the study, participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping

planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not
receiving a self-monitoring prompt. Primary outcome
was the achievement of personalized daily step goals.
**_Results Study participants were more active and healthier_**
than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives
increased step-goal achievement by 8.1%, 95% confidence
interval (CI): [2.1, 14.1] and, only in the no-incentive control group, action planning increased step-goal achievement by 5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2, 10.4]. Charity incentives,
self-monitoring prompts, and coping planning did not
affect physical activity. Engagement with planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts was low and 30%
of participants stopped using the app over the course of
the study.
**_Conclusions_** Daily cash incentives increased physical
activity in the short term. Planning interventions and
self-monitoring prompts require revision before they
can be included in future versions of the app. Selection
effects and engagement can be important challenges for
physical-activity apps.

There is univocal evidence for a curvilinear dose–response relationship between physical activity and health
(1), with the greatest health benefits seen in inactive individuals who become more active. While the current
physical-activity guidelines for adults recommend at
least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical


-----

activity per week (2), studies suggest that some of the
health benefits of physical activity can be achieved with
presumably less intensive activities such as walking (3).
Walking is a common and safe type of activity that can
be performed by individuals of all ages largely independent of time and location (4). Consequently, walking
is a suitable target behavior for many physical-activity
interventions.
Today, the widespread adoption of smartphones and
activity trackers enables objective monitoring of walking
and provides new opportunities for interventions on a
large scale. Smartphone apps, for example, facilitate the
delivery of health interventions to thousands of individuals at low cost and require minimal human support (5).
If effective, these stand-alone interventions could have a
substantial impact on public health. Unfortunately, recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials reported only small effects for these types of interventions
(6, 7). For example, the summary effect of stand-alone
physical activity apps was estimated at 477 steps per day,
95% confidence interval (CI): [−230, 1,183] (7).
One approach to developing interventions that are
more effective is to conduct so-called optimization trials,
that is, evaluating the effects of single-intervention components and their combinations (8), before finalizing
and testing the complete intervention in a randomized
controlled trial. Results of optimization trials provide
valuable data for refinement of interventions and guarantee that every component of an intervention contributes to its overall effectiveness. Klasnja et al. proposed
the microrandomized trial (MRT) (9), an optimization
trial design for mobile-health interventions. MRTs use
repeated randomization (microrandomization) of participants to different versions and/or the presence and
absence of individual intervention components over the
course of the intervention. This enables the estimation
of the time-averaged and time-varying main effects of
single-intervention components on proximal (shortterm) outcomes, as well as the interaction effects of
two (or more) intervention components. In this paper,
we present the results from an optimization trial that
evaluated the main effects and interactions of three
intervention components of a smartphone app to promote walking, using both baseline randomization and
microrandomization.

## Theoretical Background

Health-behavior theories can guide the development of
interventions by identifying the intervention targets that
are most likely to lead to behavior change. Some healthbehavior theories, such as the Health Action Process
Approach (10), differentiate between _motivational pro-_
_cesses that predict behavioral intentions to change and_


_volitional processes that subsequently translate intentions_
into actual behavior. Volitional processes are especially
important with regard to mobile health (mHealth) apps
because users of such apps typically report preexisting
intentions to change (11).
Self-regulation of behavior or action control is a central volitional process that ensures alignment of one’s
own behavior with set behavioral goals. Self-regulation
comprises the adoption of a reference value for behavior
in the form of a behavioral goal, monitoring goal progress (i.e., evaluating one’s ongoing performance relative to the reference value), and reacting according to
the evaluation (i.e., increasing effort if one’s performance is below the reference value) (12). Previous research
demonstrated that physical-activity interventions that
support self-regulatory processes have been found to
be significantly more effective than other interventions
(13), making self-regulation an attractive intervention
target. Due to the smartphone’s innate capability to passively measure physical activity, smartphone apps can be
an excellent tool to monitor goal progress and support
self-regulation of physical activity.
Planning or formulating implementation intentions is
another volitional process that helps to realize intentions
to change. Making specific plans about behavior change
can support the initiation of goal-directed behavior and
enable its execution by insulating it from tempting alternatives or competing goals. Two types of planning are
considered important: action planning, that is, specifying
when, where, and how to perform the target behavior,
and coping planning, that is, planning how to overcome
barriers and deal with setbacks (10). A meta-analysis
of 24 randomized and quasirandomized trials has confirmed the positive effect of such “planning interventions” on physical activity (14).
Naturally, the intention to change is a prerequisite
for the effectiveness of volitional intervention strategies. However, the large attrition rates observed for
many mHealth apps (15) suggest that intentions may
diminish over time and volitional intervention strategies need to be supported by intervention strategies
that target motivation. Regulatory changes, such as
the Affordable Care Act in the USA, have facilitated
the use of financial incentives to motivate health behaviors (16). As a consequence, the interest in financial incentives as a behavior change strategy has surged
among researchers and practitioners alike and, today,
many employers and health insurance companies
offer incentive-based health promotion programs (16).
Conditional financial incentives (i.e., incentives directly tied to the achievement of behavioral goals) may
boost motivation (and subsequent behavior change) by
altering the associated outcome expectancies, that is,
beliefs about positive and negative consequences of behaviors (10). Indeed, previous randomized studies have


-----

reported significant positive effects of financial incentives on physical activity (17). However, self-determination theory (18) predicts that external rewards reduce
intrinsic motivation, if they are perceived as controlling
the target behavior. In previous studies, rewards have
reduced intrinsic motivation in interesting tasks (e.g.,
games or puzzles) in samples of children and students
(19). If applied to health behavior, such effects would be
detrimental because intrinsic motivation has been associated with maintained health-behavior change (20).

## Research Objectives and Hypotheses

We evaluated three intervention components of the
Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally) app:
(a) incentives for meeting daily step goals, (b) weekly
planning, and (c) daily self-monitoring prompts, that
is, short reminders to continue monitoring progress and
achievement of daily step goals. Intervention components are described in detail below. We hypothesize that
all intervention components encourage participants to
walk. Further, we assume an interaction between motivational and volitional intervention components.
Specifically, we hypothesize that the effects of planning
and self-monitoring prompts will be greater if they are
accompanied by incentives. As a secondary objective, we
explore the effects of incentives on intrinsic motivation.
A further goal of this study was to collect smartphone
sensor data to predict participants’ states of receptivity,
that is, moments in time where participants are more
likely to react to intervention push notifications. Results
relating to the prediction of participants’ states of receptivity will be reported in a separate publication.

## Methods

In this section, we briefly describe the app used in this
study, the study design, the randomization of intervention components, and the statistical analyses. More detailed descriptions are available in the study protocol
(21). The statistical analysis approach is described in
detail in the [Supplementary Material (Sections I and](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
[II). This study was conducted in collaboration with a](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
health insurer in Switzerland to accompany the development of a large-scale prevention program focused
on physical activity and targeted at the general population. We collected data from October to December
2017 in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. We
obtained informed consent from all individual participants included in the study. The ethical review board of
ETH Zurich approved all study procedures. The study
is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03384550). The


anonymized data set and the analysis script for the
primary analyses from this study are available online:

**The Ally App**

The Ally app is a research app developed in 2017 to help
people increase and maintain their physical activity. Ally
aims at supporting physical-activity behavior change by
means of a dashboard that visualizes steps per day in
daily and weekly overviews as depicted in Fig. 1 (middle
and left) and by providing additional interventions via
a chatbot interface as depicted in Fig. 1 (right). We designed Ally as a chatbot because evidence suggests that
computers framed as humans are perceived as social
actors, which results in fundamentally social relationships (22), and that a therapeutic alliance, or the physician–patient relationship, is linked to treatment success
in medical studies (23) and psychotherapy (24).
After the mobile app has been installed, Ally welcomes
each participant personally, tracks physical activity using
the smartphone’s built-in accelerometer, and guides participants through physical-activity interventions using
chat-based interactions. Every time Ally initiates a conversation, a push notification appears in the status bar
and on the lock screen of the participant’s smartphone,
prompting the participant to chat with Ally. Participants
can respond to Ally by selecting one of several predefined
answer options (Fig. 1, right), which, in return, triggers
a response by Ally according to specified conversational
rules. Every day, the Ally app sets a personalized activity
goal based on each participant’s past activity data. Using
the adaptive approach described by Adams et al. (25),
daily step goals correspond to the 60th percentile of the
step-count distribution of the past 9 days. Consequently,
step goals are set slightly above the participant’s current
average activity level. To facilitate the maintenance of
physical activity, step goals are capped at 10,000 steps per
day, which approximates the World Health Organization’s
physical activity recommendations (26).
Ally was developed using the MobileCoach platform
[(www.mobile-coach.eu), an open-source server-client](http://www.mobile-coach.eu)
software for the design of ecological momentary assessments and digital health interventions (27). We supported both common mobile platforms, that is, Google’s
Android and Apple’s iOS, to reach a market share of
99.3% in Switzerland (28). On Android, Ally obtains all
physical activity-related information from GoogleFit, a
health-tracking platform developed by Google. On iOS,
the same information is obtained from the HealthKit, an
application programming interface for health apps provided by Apple. The Ally app requires Android version
4.0 or higher or an iPhone model 5 or newer.

**Study Design**

The study consisted of a 2 week run-in and baseline
period and a 6 week intervention period. Data was collected from participants’ smartphones via the Ally app
and from two online questionnaires at the beginning and
at the end of the study. Participants received 10 Swiss
Francs (CHF; approximately equal to US$10) for participation in the study and completing both questionnaires.
We invited 30,000 insurees of the health insurance
company to participate in the study via an email invitation. Interested insurees could click on a link in the
invitation email to be forwarded to an online survey platform where they were screened for eligibility. Eligibility
criteria were: (a) German speaking, (b) aged 18 years or
older, (c) enrolled in a complementary insurance program, (d) being free of any medical condition that prohibits increased levels of physical activity, (e) not actively
using an activity tracker or a comparable smartphone
app, and (f) not working night shifts. Eligible insurees
could subsequently obtain detailed information about
the study goals and procedures, provide consent to participate, and enroll in the study. After enrollment, participants completed the first online questionnaire and
received a six-digit code, together with instructions on
how to download and install the Ally app. Participants
had to enter the code once upon first opening the Ally app
to connect survey data and app data and to ensure that


only study participants were using the app. The baseline
period started once participants had installed the app.
During this period, Ally counted and displayed steps per
day and sent occasional messages that were unrelated
to physical activity to foster participants’ interest in the
study. However, the app’s dashboard did not display any
information related to financial incentives and the app
sent no intervention-related messages. Two weeks after
sending out the invitation emails, the baseline period
ended and the 6 week intervention period started for all
participants. During the intervention period, the Ally
app set daily step goals and delivered interventions to
support step-goal achievement.

**Intervention Components and Randomization**

Because the MobileCoach version used in this study requires dissemination time points for chatbot dialogs to
be known a priori, randomization for all intervention
components (including sequences of microrandomized
component delivery) was performed in advance upon enrollment of participants in the study. The Ally chatbot
delivered intervention prompts at random times during
the day within prespecified time windows. The random
timing allows to observe participants’ reaction to intervention notifications in a wide variety of contexts,
thereby facilitating the prediction of participants’ states
of receptivity from smartphone sensor data, a secondary


-----

goal of this study (see above). A detailed overview of
the intervention components, including their behavior
change techniques (29), randomization, and delivery, is
[available in the Supplementary Material (Section IV).](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)

_Incentives_

At the beginning of the study, we randomized participants to receiving either one of two types of financial
incentives (cash incentives or charity incentives) or to
a no-incentive control group for the duration of the
study, with a randomization probability of .33 for each
group. Participants in the cash-incentive group received
CHF 1 for each day they reached their personalized step
goal. Participants in the charity-incentive group earned
the same amount, which was donated automatically to
a charity organization of the participant’s choice. We
chose the amount of CHF 1 per day because the lowest
incentive value that has produced significant changes in
physical activity in previous studies is around US$ 1 per
day (≈ CHF 1 per day) (17).

_Planning_

Every Sunday, participants received an action-planning
intervention (specifying date, time, and location of up
to three brisk walks for the upcoming week), a copingplanning intervention (anticipating up to three barriers
for physical activity and planning counter-strategies for
the upcoming week), or no planning intervention. Ally
sent brief reminders to participants on days when a brisk
walk was planned or if a barrier for physical activity
was anticipated. Ally sent planning interventions according to a uniform and strongly balanced intervention
schedule that controlled for time and carryover effects
during the 6 week intervention period. At the beginning
of the study, we randomized participants to one of the
nine different sequences of the intervention schedule
that determined the order of planning and control conditions during the study. To guarantee balance between
the sequences, we used blocked randomization with a
block size of 9 and a randomization probability of 0.11.
Ally delivered planning interventions on Sundays at a
random time between 10 am and 6 pm.

_Self-monitoring prompts_

Ally supports participants’ self-monitoring with brief
reminder messages that include the daily step goal, the
difference between the user’s current step count and
the goal, and an estimation of walking minutes needed
to reach the goal. Additionally, the reminder messages
included an actionable tip on how to increase daily
step counts (e.g., “you can add a few steps simply by
walking during everyday activities, for example when
making a phone call, listening to music or brushing


your teeth”). For each day from Monday through
Saturday, we randomly assigned participants to either receive or not receive a self-monitoring prompt
(probability 0.50). Participants selected to receive a
self-monitoring prompt received a randomly selected
prompt from a pool of 18 different prompt conversations. Ally delivered self-monitoring prompts at a
random time between 10 am and 6 pm.

**Outcomes**

The primary outcome of this study was the proportion of
participant days that daily step goals were achieved. We
investigated steps per day, obtained from participants’
smartphones, as a secondary outcome. Smartphones are
capable of accurately measuring physical activity in controlled and uncontrolled settings (30), but smartphones
may underestimate absolute step counts in free-living
conditions because they are not always continuously
carried (31). We measured participants’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation using the Behavioral Regulation for
Exercise Questionnaire-2 (32).

**Statistical Analyses**

To evaluate the effect of each intervention component
and the interactions of interest, we aggregated outcomes
to the time scale of randomization of the respective
intervention component. That is, to estimate the effect
of incentives, randomized once at baseline, we compared
participants’ total proportion of step goals achieved (calculated over the complete intervention period) between
the incentive groups using a linear regression model with
incentive group membership represented by dummycoded variables. For planning interventions, randomized
weekly, we compared participants’ weekly proportion
of step goals achieved (calculated separately for each of
the 6 weeks of the intervention period) for the various
planning conditions. For self-monitoring prompts, randomized daily, we compared the binary daily indicator
of step-goal achievement for days when self-monitoring
prompts were either present or absent. To estimate the
treatment effects of planning interventions and selfmonitoring prompts, we followed the analysis approach
by Boruvka et al. (33) for data from microrandomized
trials. This method produces unbiased causal treatment
effects in situations where treatments are repeatedly randomized and covariates are time varying. In our case,
this method simplifies to an analysis using generalized
estimating equations (GEE) (34) with an independent
covariance structure. As in multilevel modeling, GEE
models account for the nested structure of longitudinal
data. We estimated intervention effects on participants’
step counts using the same analysis approach.


-----

We estimated all effects in a complete case analysis
using available data only. We conducted sensitivity analyses for missing data (intention-to-treat analysis) and
for adjustment of covariates of physical activity (adjusted intention-to-treat analysis). Covariates included
in all adjusted models were age, gender, baseline step
count, smartphone operating system, and employment.
In addition, we adjusted longitudinal models for linear
time trends and a binary indicator for weekend days. We
investigated time-varying effects of microrandomized
intervention components by adding the interaction between interventions and day in study (for self-monitoring
prompts) and week in study (for planning exercises) to
the model. To account for missing data, we assumed
missing data to be “missing at random” (MAR) and used
multiple imputation to create 10 complete data sets. We
then fitted models to each complete data set separately
and pooled the results over all data sets using Rubin’s
rules (35). All analyses were prespecified (21).
We conducted a priori power analyses using a
simulation-based approach that assumed a proportion of
step goals achieved of 50% without interventions, intervention main effects on step-goal achievement of 15%,
and interaction effects of 5%. Based on these assumptions, we determined that we needed a sample size of 220
to detect interaction effects with a power of 1-β = .80,
assuming a type-1 error rate of 5%. We conducted all
analyses in R, version 3.5.1 (36).

## Results

**Sample**

Of all 30,000 invited insurees, 749 were screened for eligibility and 382 were classified as eligible and provided
consent to participate. Of those, _n = 274 completed_
the baseline survey, installed the Ally app, and were
randomly assigned to a group and to interventions as
described above (Fig. 2). Due to technical errors, six participants did not always receive the interventions they
were assigned. Like all participants, we analyzed these
six participants according to their randomized intervention schedules. Comparisons of participants’ baseline
step counts (Table 1) with large-scale step count data
from physical activity app users in Switzerland (37), and
of SF-12 component summary scores with the German
12-item Short Form norm sample (38), indicate that (on
average) participants in our study were healthier and
more active than the general population. On average,
participants walked 6,336 steps per day (standard deviation [SD] = 2,701) during the baseline period and significantly increased their average daily step count by
438 steps, 95% CI: [134, 742], during the intervention
period. However, a graphical illustration of participants’

step counts over time suggests a curvilinear increase
of step counts that starts already during the baseline
period and stabilizes around 2 weeks into the interven[tion period (Supplementary Material, Section IV). The](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
proportion of participants using the Ally app declined
over the course of the study. At the end of the study, 83
of 274 participants (30.3%) had stopped using the Ally
app. Participants who stopped using the app differed significantly from participants who continuously used the
app with regard to steps per day recorded during the
intervention period (4,441 steps [SD = 2653] vs. 6,979
steps [SD = 2,909]) but not with regard to other characteristics, including steps per day at baseline (5,916
steps [SD = 2,544] vs. 6,408 steps [SD = 2,727]; see the
[Supplementary Material, Section IV).](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)

**Incentives**

Averaged over all study days in the intervention period,
participants in the cash-incentive group had an 8.1%
greater probability of reaching their daily step goals, 95%
CI: [2.1, 14.1], than control-group participants. Charity
incentives were associated with a 6.9% greater probability
of goal attainment, 95% CI: [1.0, 12.8], but this effect
was no longer statistically significant after adjusting the
analysis for missing data. We observed that incentives
had similar but statistically not significant effects on participants’ step counts. Participants in the cash-incentive
group walked on average 783 steps more, 95% CI: [−135,
1,701], than participants in the control group, and participants in the charity-incentive group walked 602 steps
more, 95% CI: [−305, 1,509], than participants in the

group differences with regard to extrinsic and intrinsic
types of motivation were small and statistically not sig[nificant (Supplementary Material, Section IV).](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)

**Planning**

Out of three possible plans, participants articulated
0.6 action plans and 0.4 coping plans per week on
average. Neither action-planning nor coping-planning
interventions significantly affected weekly proportions of step goals achieved or weekly average steps


per day when averaged over incentive conditions
(Table 2). Adding the interaction between planning exercises and incentive types revealed larger effects from
both planning exercises in the no-incentive control
group and decreased effects in the cash- and charityincentive groups, although neither main effects nor
interactions were statistically significant. However,
when adjusting the effect estimates for covariates and
missing data, there was a statistically significant main
effect of action planning on step-goal achievement in
the no-incentive control group (5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2,
10.4]) that decreased significantly in the cash-incentive
group (interaction term: −7.1%, 95% CI: [−14.0, −0.1])
and not significantly in the charity-incentive group
(interaction term: −4.9%, 95% CI: [−11.8, 2.0]). The
interactions between planning exercises and week in
study were statistically not significant. Models of steps
per day revealed no meaningful or statistically signifi[cant main effects and interactions (Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
[Material, Section II).](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)

**Self-monitoring prompts**

As with the planning interventions, the effect of selfmonitoring prompts was statistically not significant for
daily step-goal achievement or steps per day (Table 2)
when averaged over incentive conditions. When adding
the interaction effect between incentive conditions and
self-monitoring prompts to the model, the main effect of
self-monitoring prompts in the incentive control group
and the interaction terms were statistically not significant. Results were similar in models of steps per day
(see [Supplementary Material, Section II). In the com-](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
plete case analysis, we found a statistically significant
linear change in the effect of self-monitoring prompts
on step-goal achievement over time, leading to a statistically significant positive effect of self-monitoring
prompts around 4 weeks into the study. However, this
time-varying effect was not robust to sensitivity analyses.

**Exploratory Analysis**

Effects of planning interventions and self-monitoring
prompts likely depend on whether participants engage with the respective intervention content. The
MobileCoach platform used for intervention development allowed us to monitor whether participants
responded to the initial intervention-related message
from the Ally chatbot. In our study, response rates
to intervention conversations varied between 40.6%
for coping-planning exercises and 55.4% for selfmonitoring prompts. The low response rate may provide a possible explanation for the negligible effects of
planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts in
our prespecified analysis because this analysis averages

effects over all participant days irrespective of participants’ engagement with the intervention. We, therefore, decided to conduct an exploratory analysis of the
intervention components’ main effects with recoded
treatment indicators that differentiate whether a participant engaged with the intervention content or not
(see [Supplementary Material Section III for details).](http://academic.oup.com/abm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/abm/kaaa002#supplementary-data)
This analysis was not prespecified. Here, we define “engagement with the intervention” as responding to the
first message of the chatbot in an intervention-related
conversation. To adjust for possible confounding in this
analysis, we added known covariates of physical activity to the model.
Compared to not receiving a self-monitoring prompt,
engaging with self-monitoring prompt conversations
was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of step-goal achievement (5.5%, 95% CI: [2.7,
8.2]) and significantly higher step counts (405 steps,
95% CI: [189, 621]). Conversely, not engaging with selfmonitoring prompt conversations was associated with


a significantly lower probability of reaching daily step
goals (−9.3%, 95% CI: [−13.0, −5.6]) and lower step
counts (−754 steps, 95% CI: [−1,077, −431]). Likewise,
compared to not receiving a weekly planning exercise,
engaging with action-planning and coping-planning
conversations was associated with a higher proportion
of step-goal achievement—which was statistically significant for action planning (3.9%, 95% CI: [0.2, 7.6])
but not for coping planning (3.5%, 95% CI: [−0.03,
7.0])—and associated with significantly higher step
counts for both planning exercises (action planning:
421 steps, 95% CI: [127, 715]; coping planning: 475
steps, 95% CI: [128, 822]). Not engaging with planning
conversations was associated with a lower proportion
of step goals met, but this difference was not statistically significant (action planning: −2.0%, 95% CI: [−6.5,
2.5]; coping planning: −3.4%, 95% CI: [−7.3, 0.5]). Not
engaging with planning conversations was also associated with lower step counts, which was statistically
significant for coping planning (−579 steps, 95% CI:


-----

[−942, −216]) but not for action planning (−250 steps,
95% CI: [−701, 201]).

## Discussion

This optimization trial quantified the effects of three different physical-activity interventions of a smartphone
application to promote walking. Daily cash incentives—
but not charity incentives—promoted the achievement
of personalized step goals during the 6 week intervention
period. This result is in line with previous research that
has reported positive effects of cash incentives on physical activity (17) and contributes to the existing research
on charity incentives, which has so far reported mixed results (39, 40). We found that cash and charity incentives
had no effect on participants’ self-reported levels of intrinsic motivation, although activity levels and intrinsic
motivation at baseline were high. Previously, low baseline
levels of behavior and low levels of intrinsic motivation
have been used to explain missing effects of incentives on
intrinsic motivation in studies of health behaviors (41).
The results from this study, however, suggest that incentives can affect behavior without undermining intrinsic
motivation even if baseline levels of intrinsic motivation
and behavior are high. Presumably, the incentives in our
study were too small to be perceived as “controlling” by
participants and, consequently, did not reduce intrinsic
motivation.
We found no meaningful and statistically significant
effects for the remaining interventions: self-monitoring
prompts, action planning, and coping planning. This
result contrasts with previous research that reported
positive effects of similar intervention prompts (42)
and planning interventions (14) on physical activity.
However, action planning appeared to be an effective
intervention for participants who did not receive financial incentives but had no effect for participants in either of the incentive groups. These interaction effects can
possibly be explained by the high baseline activity levels
of study participants. Specifically, study participants
may have had only limited room for increasing their daily
physical activity in response to both interventions. Thus,
in addition to cash incentives, action planning can be a
powerful intervention, although effects of both components may not fully unfold if offered simultaneously.
This study also revealed important limitations of both
planning exercises and self-monitoring prompts that, together with absent main effects, suggest that these components should be revised if they are to be included in
future versions of the app. Most importantly, participants
responded only to roughly half of the self-monitoring
prompt and planning conversations that were initiated
by the Ally chatbot, ultimately limiting the potential of
both interventions to affect behavior. Indeed, engaging


with self-monitoring prompt and planning conversation
was associated with increased walking in our exploratory
analysis. Although this finding is in line with a possible
true intervention effect, it may also reflect the effect of
unobserved confounding variables. For example, the
time that participants carried their smartphone could affect both recorded step counts and responding to intervention conversations. In fact, the significantly lower
step counts, which were associated with ignoring selfmonitoring prompt and coping planning conversations,
can most plausibly be explained by the presence of confounding variables. Thus, while the exploratory analyses
remain inconclusive regarding effects of coping planning
and self-monitoring prompts, they illustrate that reaching
and engaging participants can be a major challenge for
smartphone-based physical activity interventions.
A further limitation of planning exercises and selfmonitoring prompts in the present study was that they
were delivered to participants at random times, which
may have contributed to the limited engagement with the
interventions. One possible strategy to increase engagement with the interventions is to use intelligent notification management algorithms that use smartphone sensor
data to predict opportune moments for intervention
delivery, that is, moments when participants will most
likely react to a smartphone push notification. In fact,
research in the field of interruptibility has revealed that
the application of such algorithms increases the response
rate to smartphone notifications (43). As a consequence,
tailoring the delivery of self-monitoring prompts and
planning exercises to those opportune moments could
increase the intervention’s likelihood of success.
In addition, the low number of action and coping
plans completed by participants indicate that planning
interventions may have been too great a burden for participants. Indeed, planning up to three brisk walks per
week or planning coping strategies for potential barriers requires a considerable amount of participants’
time and cognitive resources. In our follow-up survey,
around 35% of participants found the planning exercises difficult to complete, supporting the conclusion
that the burden of planning interventions has prevented
at least some participants from completing their weekly
plans. Furthermore, 50% of participants indicated that
they would prefer to plan their activity or coping strategies on a daily basis rather than a weekly basis. Thus,
one way to reduce the burden of planning interventions
could involve prompting participants to plan one activity
or coping strategy daily, for example, prior to days with
typically lower step counts.
Because the Ally app, like most mHealth apps, collects
and visualizes data and provides feedback and an easy
way to monitor goal progress, it holds inherent value for a
health-conscious and motivated subgroup of the population (11). Indeed, baseline characteristics indicate that our


-----

study attracted individuals who were more active, educated,
and healthy than the general Swiss population. In addition,
a considerable proportion of participants stopped using
the app over the course of the 8 week study, although attrition appeared to be somewhat lower compared to similar
studies of mHealth apps (42, 44). Interestingly, participant
attrition was similar in the different incentive groups, suggesting that incentives tied to behavior do not necessarily
promote engagement with the app. Unfortunately, selection
effects and lack of sustained participant engagement can
limit the health impact of physical activity apps (and other
health apps) considerably. Future research, therefore, needs
to identify effective strategies for reaching more vulnerable
populations and engaging health-app users in the long term.
There are some limitations to the present research. To
begin with, the selective sample in our study may limit
the generalizability of the reported intervention effects.
For example, there may be no interaction effect between
action planning and incentives in less-active populations.
Furthermore, we were not able to separate increases in
step counts from increases in the time that participants
were carrying their smartphone. It is possible that the
reported intervention effects reflect, at least partly, increases in the time the smartphone was carried. Lastly,
although all participants indicated upon enrollment that
they were not using any comparable apps or devices for
tracking physical activity, we cannot exclude that such
apps or devices were used or that participants primarily
used the Apple Health or GoogleFit applications that
were required for the Ally app to obtain step counts.
Use of such additional apps or devices could potentially
affect the use of the Ally app and the effectiveness of
interventions.

## Conclusion

Daily financial incentives seem to be a suitable intervention as part of the Ally app. Notification-dependent interventions, that is, planning exercises and self-monitoring
prompts, are limited by low engagement of participants
with the interventions and high intervention burden and,
therefore, require revision. Selection effects and attrition
appear to be important challenges that can restrict the
health impact of physical-activity apps.
