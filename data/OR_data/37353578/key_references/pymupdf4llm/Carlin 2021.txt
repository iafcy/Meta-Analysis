### Abstract

**Background:** Intelligent personal assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become increasingly integrated into
the home setting and, therefore, may facilitate behavior change via novel interactions or as an adjunct to conventional interventions.
However, little is currently known about their potential role in this context.
**Objective:** This feasibility study aims to develop the Intelligent Personal Assistant Project (IPAP) and assess the acceptability
and feasibility of this technology for promoting and maintaining physical activity and other health-related behaviors in both
parents and children.

**Methods:** This pilot feasibility study was conducted in 2 phases. For phase 1, families who were attending a community-based
weight management project were invited to participate, whereas phase 2 recruited families not currently receiving any additional
intervention. Families were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (received a smart speaker for use in the family
home) or the control group. The IPAP intervention aimed to promote positive health behaviors in the family setting through
utilization of the functions of a smart speaker and its linked intelligent personal assistant. Data were collected on recruitment,
retention, outcome measures, intervention acceptability, device interactions, and usage.
**Results:** In total, 26 families with at least one child aged 5 to 12 years were recruited, with 23 families retained at follow-up.
Across phase 1 of the intervention, families interacted with the intelligent personal assistant a total of 65 times. Although device
interactions across phase 2 of the intervention were much higher (312 times), only 10.9% (34/312) of interactions were coded as
relevant (related to diet, physical activity or well-being). Focus groups highlighted that the families found the devices acceptable
and easy to use and felt that the prompts or reminders were useful in prompting healthier behaviors. Some further intervention
refinements in relation to the timing of prompts and integrating feedback alongside the devices were suggested by families.
**Conclusions:** Using intelligent personal assistants to deliver health-related messages and information within the home is feasible,
with high levels of engagement reported by participating families. This novel feasibility study highlights important methodological
considerations that should inform future trials testing the effectiveness of intelligent personal assistants in promoting positive
health-related behaviors.

### Introduction

The high incidence of childhood obesity has been well
documented, with 29% of children aged 2 to 15 years in England

[1] and one-fourth of children living in Northern Ireland [2]
classified as overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately
one-fifth of children in the United Kingdom meet the
recommended guideline of at least 60 minutes per day of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [3,4]. The associated
risk of developing obesity-related comorbidities earlier in life
means that schoolchildren are a key target population for the
promotion of sustainable healthy behaviors [5].

Interventions to promote healthy behaviors in children have
largely focused on the school setting [6,7], with only 7% of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeted at the home setting

[6]. The influence of parents and other family members on health
behaviors in children is well established [8,9]. Research has
highlighted the need for interventions that target children within
the home environment [10], which encourages positive
behaviors before children progress into adolescence and develop
more autonomy over their health choices and the influence of
the family context wanes [10]. Family-based interventions
typically involve target children and at least one other family
member, typically a parent [11]. Without the involvement of
family members in interventions, long-term behavior change is
unlikely to be sustained in children [12]. A recent meta-analysis
identified 19 family-based interventions targeting physical
activity, with 66% of included studies reporting a positive effect
on physical activity [12]. This is in contrast to the lower levels
of effect noted in reviews of school-based interventions [13,14].
Family-based interventions that target diet alongside physical
activity appear to be more effective in reducing BMI z-score
when compared with diet-only or physical activity–only
interventions; however, the evidence is considered to be of low
certainty [6]. Furthermore, interventions that target the family
psychosocial environment and emphasize the child as the agent
of change warrant further investigation [12].

Alongside family involvement, incorporating technology within
the family setting has been identified as a potential means of
enhancing the effectiveness of interventions targeting childhood
obesity [15,16] and may also present further opportunities to
increase the reach of interventions [16]. There has been a rapid
increase in interventions adopting technology, as it can provide
a cost-effective means of providing information and feedback
alongside existing interventions or can function as a stand-alone
intervention [17,18]. Children and adolescents have been
described as digital natives, having been exposed to technology
for most of their lives [19]. This coupled with high levels of
smartphone ownership (78% of adults) and broadband
connections (80% of homes) [20] highlights the potential of
internet-based technologies for changing health behaviors.

Researchers and practitioners have used technology to change
how we deliver interventions (eg, moving from print-based
information to web-based resources) and how we incorporate


behavior change techniques within interventions. To date,
interventions using interactive electronic media [18] or
web-based management programs [21] have demonstrated some
potential for weight management; however, studies were
generally of a lower quality and largely conducted in the United
States [18]. A recent systematic review identified 8 eHealth
interventions (comprising internet-based interventions, voice
prompts, or telemedicine) whereby parents or guardians were
the agents of change [16]. Included studies did not report a
significant effect on BMI or BMI z-score; however, half of the
interventions reviewed found significant improvements in
physical activity–related or dietary-related outcome measures

[16].

There is a strong need for research studies to target the family
setting [22]. Innovative interventions are required [23], with
the aim of improving both parents’ and children’s behaviors.
In addition, there is a need for interventions to include more
detailed process evaluation with their methodology to further
understand the reasons why certain interventions are, or are not,
effective in this setting [6]. Intelligent personal assistants (eg,
Amazon Alexa) represent an efficient, low-cost method of
delivering individualized behavioral interventions, with the
potential for scaling at the population level [24]. Unlike other
technologies such as wearable devices (pedometers, Fitbit, etc),
which have been a primary focus for research studies in recent
years, little is known about the potential role that intelligent
personal assistants can play in positively influencing
health-related behaviors [25].

This study (1) outlines the development of the GetAMoveOn+
Intelligent Personal Assistant Project (IPAP), (2) compares the
acceptability of intelligent personal assistants alongside an
existing intervention or as a stand-alone intervention, and (3)
evaluates the potential of intelligent personal assistants for
promoting and maintaining physical activity and other
health-related behaviors in both parents and children.

### Methods

##### Study Design

IPAP was a 12-week RCT conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 was
an RCT that evaluated the effect of a home-based intelligent
personal assistant intervention on obesity-related behaviors (diet
and physical activity) in families attending a community-based
weight management project.

Phase 2 was an RCT that evaluated the effect of the home-based
intelligent personal assistant in families not attending a weight
management project. Randomization for both phases of
recruitment took place at the family level, with families (a parent
and 1 or 2 children) randomly allocated to an intervention or
control group. Randomization was performed by a university
staff member who was independent of the research team. Sealed,
opaque envelopes were used to randomly assign families to a
study arm.

##### Participants

Families were eligible to participate when at least one child
(aged 5-12 years) and one parent or adult responsible for their
care consented to participate in the study. Given the nature of
the intervention, access to internet connection with their home
(Wi-Fi) and ownership of one smart device within the home
(eg, a tablet or smartphone) or access to a computer or laptop
to enable the family members to interact with the home-based
intelligent personal assistant was required. The adult and child
or children taking part in the study also had to live within the
same household. No restrictions were placed on the family type.
No inclusion criteria were placed on parents or children in
relation to any medical condition. Participants were asked to
notify the research team of any related issues that might affect
participation in the intervention. No issues that limited or
affected participation or resulted in adverse events were
reported.

##### Recruitment

 Phase 1

All families (n=16) attending a community-based obesity
prevention project, Safe Wellbeing Eating & Exercise Together
(SWEET) as a family, were invited to participate in the study.
The SWEET project is a community-based obesity prevention
and management program aimed at children and families across
a number of sites (community organizations, healthy living
centers, etc) in the Western Trust area of Northern Ireland. It
aims to work with families in areas of high economic deprivation
and targets lifestyle characteristics, such as dietary habits,
physical activity, and mental well-being. Families are recruited
to the SWEET project via social media sites, flyer distributions
in schools, and local paper advertisements. Before approaching
families, permission was obtained from the Healthy Lifestyle
Coordinator of the Healthy Living Centre where the project was
being delivered. Members of the research team attended the
first session of the project and provided a verbal overview of
the research study. Written informed consent was obtained from
all parents or guardians, and written parental consent and child
assent were obtained for each child. Phase 1 of the study was
conducted from January to April 2019.

##### Phase 2

Phase 2 was subsequently undertaken to further assess the
acceptability of intelligent personal assistants as a stand-alone
intervention. Potentially eligible families (as mentioned earlier)
were invited to take part in the study (not restricted to those
attending the SWEET project) through a number of recruitment
strategies. Local community group leaders were contacted and
asked to provide permission for a member of the research team
to approach families (parents) at relevant events, for example,
parent or child groups, youth club, sports training sessions etc.
Similar to phase 1, prospective families were provided with a
verbal overview of the study and detailed written information
on the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all
parents or guardians, and written parental consent and child
assent were obtained for each child. Efforts were made by the
research team to ensure families in phase 1 and phase 2 were
recruited from similar community groups to avoid any potential


sampling bias. Phase 2 of the study was conducted from May
to August 2019. Families were only able to participate in one
phase, that is, families who took part in phase 1 were not eligible
to take part in phase 2.

##### Intervention Selection

A smart speaker (Amazon Echo) and its linked intelligent
personal assistant (Amazon Alexa) were chosen as the tools for
intervention delivery in this study. A market survey (n=2274)
highlighted that 33% of respondents based in the United States
and the United Kingdom owned a smart speaker [26]. Among
these, Amazon’s devices were the most popular.

Intelligent personal assistants can perform a range of basic home
assistant functions, including playing music, setting alarms,
checking the weather, and searching for information. Users can
also personalize the devices by adding apps or _Skills, which_
further the device’s capabilities [25]. Research has shown that
_health and fitness apps are readily available for devices, with_
health education and fitness training apps the most common
types of _health and fitness apps [25]. The IPAP intervention_
involved using the existing features and skills developed for
Amazon Echo devices.

##### Intervention Description and Protocol

Following the completion of baseline measurements, families
recruited to both phase 1 and phase 2 of the study were randomly
allocated to either the intervention group (receive an intelligent
personal assistant) or the control group (continue as usual
without the provision of additional technology within the home).
The IPAP intervention aimed to promote positive health
behaviors in the family setting through the utilization of the
functions of a smart speaker and its linked intelligent personal
assistant. Each family in the intervention arm of the study
received a smart speaker (Echo Dot, third generation, Amazon
2018 release) for use in the family home for the duration of the
intervention (12 weeks).

The research team set up an individual user account for each
family, creating a new email and password, not linked to the
family’s other email accounts (for security purposes). Each
family was provided with their log-in detail, meaning that the
research team and family members could both access the
accounts during the intervention period. Each family was
provided with a detailed information sheet on how to set up and
use the device and were instructed to contact a member of the
research team for support or troubleshooting throughout the
intervention period.

The research team was able to remotely access the devices and
set weekly tasks, prompts, and reminders for family members.
The prompts and reminders provided by the research team were
developed in line with recommendations for the management
of childhood obesity [27] and based on current public health
recommendations in relation to physical activity [28] and dietary
habits [29]. Examples of weekly prompts or reminders and
potential ways in which the family could interact with the device
are shown in Table 1. For phase 1, the intervention content from
the device was aligned to the topics covered at each week of
the SWEET program, ensuring that the message was appropriate
for the target population. Families received one specific


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Carlin et al


reminder or prompt per day, which was repeated at a number
of times throughout the day to maximize reach. Reminders or
prompts were delivered in the morning (before work or school)
and in the evening. Families were asked to advise the research


team of the most convenient times to receive the prompts or
reminders. Families were also encouraged to inform the research
team if they were missing the prompts or reminders. In these
instances, the timings were revised.


**Table 1.** Examples of intervention components delivered by the intelligent personal system.

Intervention component and type of interaction Interaction content

**Diet**

Skill Ask Vitality [device-based skill] to give you a recipe—pick a simple meal and have a go
cooking with Alexa

Task Plan your shopping list for the week and add foods to your list using Alexa

Tip Fruit and vegetables that are fresh, frozen, or tinned all count toward your 5-a-day

Reminder How much water have you had today?

**Physical activity**

Skill Use Alexa to find some fun games that can help you be active

Task Kids, do 10 star jumps every morning

Tip You should aim to be active daily—try going for a 30-min walk on most days this week

Reminder Have you been for a walk as a family this week?


In addition, families were informed that the devices were to be
used as a health promotion tool within the home setting and
were free to add their own reminders at times convenient to
them and had complete autonomy over what Skills (apps) they
wanted to enable on their devices. A specific _Skill was not_
developed for this intervention; rather, families were signposted
to search for _Skills under the topics of Health and Fitness,_
Lifestyle, Sport, Cooking, and Recipes. Within this, families
could choose the skills most suitable for their children’s age
and interests. In addition to the preprogrammed messages
controlled by the research team, families were instructed that
they were free to use the devices for other general functions,
not specific to the research project.

Families were informed during the recruitment and throughout
the intervention that the research team would also be able to
view and manage their user accounts. Families were also made
aware that all interactions with the device would be noted by
the research team, including interactions that may not be linked
to the goals of the intervention, for example, asking the
intelligent system nonrelated questions.

##### Outcome Evaluation Measures

Within this pilot feasibility study, we aimed to evaluate the
potential of intelligent personal assistants for promoting and
maintaining physical activity and other health-related behaviors
in both parents and children. Data collection was carried out at
local community centers or at the university by trained
researchers, and all participant outcome measures were assessed
at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks).

##### Physical Activity

Physical activity was measured using an ActiGraph GT3
accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC). Participants (parent and child
or children) were instructed to wear the device on the waist for
7 consecutive days, removing it only for bathing, water-based
activities such as swimming, and when asleep. During the


measurement periods, participants were asked to keep a family
log of when they wore the accelerometer and took it off. A
sampling epoch of 15 seconds was used for data collection.
Periods of ≥60 minutes of zero counts were classified as
nonwear and were removed. Cutpoints were used to estimate
time spent in sedentary behavior and light-, moderate-, and
vigorous-intensity physical activity for adults [30] and children

[31]. The primary outcome was total physical activity (light,
moderate, and vigorous physical activity combined). Secondary
accelerometer outcomes included data provision and the
proportion of participants meeting the recommended guidelines
for physical activity [28]. Participants who provided at least
three weekdays of at least 480 minutes of data between 5 AM
and 11.59 PM were included in the analysis. Families were
given an incentive at each time point for returning the devices
(GBP £20 [US $27] One4All voucher).

##### Health Outcomes

Height (nearest 0.1 cm) and weight (nearest 0.1 kg) were
measured according to standardized protocols. BMI was
calculated and converted to BMI z-scores using the World
Health Organization AnthroPlus software (version 1.0.4).

##### Family Eating and Activity Habits

Behaviors related to eating and activity habits were assessed
using the Revised Family Eating and Activity Habits
Questionnaire (FEAHQ-R). The FEAHQ-R is a 32 item
self-report instrument designed to assess changes in eating and
activity habits of family members as well as obesogenic factors
in the overall home environment (stimulus and behavior
patterns) related to energy balance [32]. The questionnaire was
completed by one parent on behalf of themselves, their spouse,
and their child. Summary scores were calculated for physical
activity, eating style, stimulus exposure (eg, unhealthy snacks
at home), and eating related to hunger. A reduction in scores
signifies improvements across all domains.

##### Process Evaluation

 Device Interactions and Usage

The research team was able to access each family’s account via
their log-in details and view each interaction with the device
across the intervention period. An interaction was defined as
any engagement with the device made by a parent or child, in
addition to the reminders and information provided by the device
from the research team. A copy of all interactions was
downloaded from the device website and anonymously stored.
The research team recorded the number of interactions and the
type of interaction. Interactions were primarily coded as relevant
(related to physical activity or diet or well-being) or nonrelevant
(ie, not related to the intended purpose of the intervention), with
relevant interactions further coded based on their theme. For
example, “How many portions of fruit and vegetables per day
should I eat?” was recorded as a relevant interaction and
subcoded under Healthy-eating question. Waking up the device,
controlling volume, and prompts such as Next song were not
recorded as interactions for the purposes of this study. In
instances where the device was not able to provide a transcript
of the voice command received, the device registered this
interaction as, “Text not found. Click here to listen to the
recording.” The research team did not listen to the voice
recordings or include these in the interaction analysis. It was
not possible for the research team to distinguish whether a parent
or child interacted with the device.

##### Intervention Acceptability

A record of any technical issues in relation to the smart speaker
was held by the research team. All parents in the intervention
arm of phase 1 and phase 2 were invited to participate in focus
group discussions. These discussions focused on the
acceptability of the intelligent personal assistants, intervention
fidelity, any challenges that arose during the intervention, and
suggestions for future improvements. Owing to practical issues
(timing and location), it was not possible to facilitate focus
groups with all parents, so these were replaced with
semistructured interviews. One focus group (n=4 parents) and
3 semistructured interviews (n=3 parents) were conducted with
participating parents in the intervention arm of the study. All
discussions were audiorecorded. The mean duration of the
recordings was 26 (SD 20) minutes.

##### Ethical Considerations

Participants were provided with detailed instructions on the use
of the device and the functionality of the device, that is, what
the device is capable of doing and picking up. The mute or
temporality disable functions of the device were also highlighted
to families. These instructions were developed using the


manufacturer’s instructions. As these devices were present
within the home and accessible to both parents and children, a
protocol was developed to consider the potential issue of
disclosure and unintended collection of data. No such issues
were observed during the intervention period. The search history
of the device was kept confidential, and the device was not used
for any other purpose during the intervention, for example,
recording information or conversations within the home. This
pilot feasibility study was approved by the Ulster University
Research Ethics Committee and was registered retrospectively
(ISRCTN16792534).

##### Data Analysis

 Quantitative Analysis

Frequencies, percentages, means, and SDs were used to describe
data related to recruitment, retention, outcome measures,
intervention acceptability, device interactions, and usage. Data
analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows (version 25;
SPSS Inc).

##### Qualitative Analysis

Focus groups and semistructured interviews were transcribed
verbatim and analyzed thematically, following a deductive
approach [33]. Following familiarization with the data, each
transcript was reviewed for meaningful quotes and
systematically coded by a member of the research team.
Potentially relevant codes were grouped together to develop
themes, which were reviewed to ensure representativeness.
These themes were then reviewed by a member of the research
team to ensure that the themes were representative of the coded
excerpts. Coding and reviewing of themes were repeated
independently by a second member of the research team.

### Results

##### Recruitment and Retention

 Phase 1

A total of 16 families attending the SWEET project were invited
to participate in the IPAP study (Figure 1). Of the 16 families
approached, one family was excluded for not meeting the
inclusion criteria and 4 families failed to respond to the initial
invitation. Of the 6 families allocated to the intervention, 2
families did not set up the device. Of those allocated to the
control arm, one family was absent for follow-up measurements,
whereas a further 2 families discontinued the SWEET project
and subsequently this study as well. Participant characteristics
are described in Table 2. All adult participants were categorized
as overweight or obese at baseline.

with all families retained at follow-up. Participant characteristics
are described in Table 2. Overall, 80% (12/15) of adult
participants were categorized as overweight or obese at baseline.

##### Outcome Evaluation Measures

 Physical Activity

In phase 1, 91% (10/11) of adults and 69% (11/16) of children
met the minimum inclusion criteria for accelerometer wear time.
At baseline, the mean valid wear time was 720 (SD 90.3) and
657.2 (SD 47.8) minutes per day for adults and children,
respectively. At follow-up, the proportion of participants
meeting the minimum inclusion wear time dropped to 55%
(6/11) of adults and 19% (3/16) of children. In phase 2, 86%
(13/15) of adults and 89% (16/18) of children met the minimum
inclusion criteria for accelerometer wear time. At baseline, mean
valid wear time was 782.1 (SD 63.2) and 695.4 (SD 36.3)
minutes per day for adults and children, respectively. At
follow-up, the proportion of participants meeting the minimum


inclusion wear time remained at 87% (13/15) of adults and
dropped to 72% (13/18) of children, indicating greater
compliance to the accelerometer outcome measure in phase 2
of the IPAP study.

Of those who fulfilled the minimum wear time criteria, 70%
(7/10) of adults and 36% (4/11) of children achieved the
recommended physical activity guidelines at baseline for phase
1, compared with 77% (10/13) of adults and 38% (6/16) of
children in phase 2 of the study. Owing to the small sample
size, statistical testing was not undertaken to assess changes in
physical activity before and after intervention (Table 3).
Adherence to the accelerometer protocol may have been affected
by the timing of the intervention and follow-up measurements
coinciding with school holidays.

##### Family Eating and Activity Habits

Questionnaire data were provided by 85% (22/26) of adult
participants at all time points. In phase 1, positive improvements
in scores for eating style were observed for adults (−1.75, SD
2.06) and children (−0.50, SD 2.81) in the intervention group,


with increases observed in the control group. In phase 2, there
was a slight improvement in both the activity level score and
stimulus exposure and control for children in the intervention
group, with all other summary scores increasing across the
intervention period (Table 4).

##### Process Evaluation

 Device Interactions and Usage

Across phase 1 of the intervention, families who received a
smart speaker on average interacted with the intelligent personal
assistant (Alexa) 65 times. Waking up the device, controlling
volume, and prompts such as Next song were not recorded as
interactions for the purposes of this study. _Other (including_
general knowledge questions and jokes) and _Music were the_
most frequently observed interactions across the intervention
period. Overall, 42% of all device interactions were coded as
relevant in phase 1 (ie, related to diet, physical activity, or
well-being). Reminders or prompts involved the family setting
their own reminders. Examples of _Skills (diet) and_ _Skills_
_(physical activity) used by families across the intervention period_
included fitness skills, recipe skills, and active game skills.
During phase 1, the prompts or reminders provided by the


research team aligned with the topics and tasks the families
were covering in the SWEET project.

In phase 2, families did not attend the SWEET project, but the
intervention content largely reflected the prompts or reminders
provided to families in phase 1. Device interactions across phase
2 of the intervention were much higher, with families interacting
with the device 312 times across the intervention period
(equivalent to 31.3 interactions per week). Only 11% of
interactions were coded as relevant (related to diet, physical
activity, or well-being). Of the interactions that were coded as
relevant, the most frequent interactions were when families
asked questions about nutrition (healthy eating) or used Skills
related to healthy eating, for example, recipes or healthy eating

##### Intervention Acceptability

the offset of these discussions, parents acknowledged the
prominent role of technology in their family’s everyday lives
and the need to use it in a positive way:

_Technology is there, and it can be used for good and_
_evil. And it’s not going to go away. The way they are_
_growing up, they can’t avoid it really so might as well_
_try and use it for good. [Family 4, male]_
_...they are probably more motivated by it_

_[technology], so it probably is the future for the_
_younger generation... [Family 6, female]_
Parents commented that the intelligent personal system
motivated the child to engage with the intervention:

_It actually motivated her quite a bit, because she was_
_saying “mummy, we need to go for a family walk_
_now...or I need to eat my fruit or...” [Family 6,_
female]
Families found the intervention content acceptable and discussed
how the prompts or reminders encouraged them to change their
behaviors in a fun way (Table 5). Families also highlighted how
they used other features, such as the skills for recipes or home
workouts (Table 5).

Families highlighted several ways to increase engagement with
the intervention, including further suggestions on how to use
the device within the home and more personalization of the
prompts or reminders. The timing of prompts or reminders was
a key component of the intervention delivery, and families noted
practical issues with this, in addition to the importance of
ensuring that families were at home when the device was
interacting with them (Table 5). Parents suggested incorporating


other technologies alongside the intelligent personal system to
facilitate this:

_If it was connected to your phone, like a phone_
_reminder as well, because Alexa’s in the house._

[Parent 2, female]
In addition, families felt that the device needed to be linked to
some type of feedback to increase accountability and provide
families with opportunities to log their healthy eating or physical
activity (Table 5).

Parents felt that the intelligent personal assistants played an
additive role in encouraging children to be healthier and could
work alongside other types of intervention:

_I still think you need the traditional ways of activity_
_rather than reliance on a device. [Family 6, female]_
_...if there was an intervention or like, if there were a,_
_a class or some sort of, erm, programme that was_
_with, sent home with families and Alexa reminded_
_you to do it... [Family 6, female]_
In terms of concerns about having a smart speaker within the
home, most parents commented that they were cautious of both
increasing engagement with technology and the potential issues
with social media and young people (Table 5). These concerns
regarding internet access or social media were more prominent
from parents than issues specific to the intelligent personal
assistants themselves:

_...he’s downloading games and I don’t know what_
_they are—I would be quite worried; not so much that_
_it’s listening, I wouldn’t worry about Alexa listening,_
_it’s not gonna hear anything in my house. [Parent 7,_
female]

**Findings related to intervention delivery**

Device setup “It was easy to set up and easy to use. Quite interesting but, and the prompts were very good.” [Family 1,
female]

Prompts or reminders from the re-   - “We got a prompt, quick do 10 sit ups, and I’m like come on children, everyone on the floor, let’s do
search team it! It was some craic [fun] like, and everybody just downed the phones and going to do that challenge.
They loved it.” [Family 3, female]

                   - _“The whole jist of it was brilliant, like the wee prompts it tells you...try this or try that, you know it’s_
just planting that wee seed in your head and when that wee seed’s planted, obviously you are gonna
try aren’t you, so I think it is a great thing.” [Family 2, female]

Using other device features    - “...the easy access to the workouts so that you could just do it at a time whenever it suited you.”

[Family 6, female]

                   - “There were a couple of occasions where we asked Alexa for a healthy recipe to make something so
we made a chilli one day and we asked Alexa for a recipe ‘cos we were prompted by the device about,
you know, healthy, eating healthily and stuff...” [Family 5, male]

                   - “[Child name] was new-fangled with it, she was more into the music in it, bopping about but it got
her active too, she was asking me how to do this, and will you do this ‘Flossing’...it was good from
that point of view you know.” [Family 2, female]

                   - “Even her homeworks, she was going out and asking, she was asking me how to spell this, I said ask
Alexa, just to get her doing things for herself.” [Family 3, male]

Overall device usage   - “We probably could have utilised it much more but it’s just the pure fact if we had more time. Erm,
and the fact that we were away from it all day long and then we came in, in the evening, it’s usually
kind of a race, get the dinner made and...” [Family 6, female]

                   - “...but after, like, a week or so they kind of almost forgot it was there and maybe that was our fault,
we didn’t encourage them to use it as much, erm, but the prompts I think were a good idea.” [Family
5, male]

**Findings related to intervention optimization**

Timing of prompts or reminders   - “I think there was a couple of technical glitches where the timing wasn’t right because we didn’t seem
to get the prompts and we used Alexa a lot like, we do ask a lot of questions and stuff but, erm, it
didn’t seem to prompt us; maybe we were out at the time.” [Family 4, male]

                   - “You know, if we weren’t at home..., I don’t know how many prompts there were.” [Family 7, female]

Lack of feedback provided   - “...but what it would say to me, ‘Have you had your five a day?’ Do I shout back, ‘Yes,’ or, ‘Alexa,
yeah,’ I don’t know what way to answer...” [Family 7, female]

                   - “If you had to log what you did, you know, because it’s fair enough, erm, you could say, ‘Right, go
for a family walk,’ but you know, then they come back and say, ‘Well how many kilometres did you
do?’ or whatever...to close the loop.” [Family 6, female]

Concerns   - “I just worry about that whole side of technology, erm, never mind Alexa but all social media, erm,
in terms of how, how that can be utilised against them and I suppose that’s a worrying thing for me
as a parent...” [Family 6, female]

                   - “I think if you find the right balance where, you know, I don’t like the idea of my kids being constantly
engaged to technology but I can see the benefit of, of that via a prompt or something like that but, you
know, I wouldn’t want them to be constantly going to Alexa...” [Family 3, male]

Increasing device usage   - “You know, I think they would maybe be set challenges to do because I think if they’ve, just can get
an app and do so much, I’m not sure that they’ll benefit from it.” [Family 6, female]

                   - “I think if it was maybe a wee bit more personalised...I don’t actually know what I was supposed to
be doing with Alexa, you know...and maybe it was in the documentation somewhere, maybe there was
a letter written somewhere that I didn’t see, that I didn’t read.” [Family 7, female]


##### Practical Considerations

Most families were able to set up their user accounts and link
these to the smart speaker device. Overall, 2 families did not
set up their devices in phase 1 of the study. Of these families,
one parent noted that they could not set up the device because
they shared the house with another family who did not want the
device used, and the other family failed to respond to follow-up
instructions from the research team, meaning they did not


receive the intervention content. All families in phase 2
successfully set up and used the device.

The smart speakers had to be online to allow the research team
to set up reminders or prompts and refresh information on the
family’s interactions with the device. The 2 families in phase
2 had their devices set to Offline for extended periods, limiting
the volume of interaction managed by the research team. A
further family in phase 2 registered the device with their own

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Carlin et al


personal Amazon account for 2 weeks during the intervention
period; therefore, the research team was unable to set prompts
or reminders or access information on the family’s interactions
with the device over this period. A protocol was also put in
place to cover the potential issue of disclosure of information
and unintended collection of data; however, no scenarios arose
within this study.

### Discussion

##### Principal Findings

To our knowledge, this is the first study to outline the
development and usage of intelligent personal assistants to
promote positive health-related behaviors within the home
setting. Given the constraints that exist within current
family-based interventions, including time and travel restraints

[10], moving toward novel interventions that incorporate
web-based learning may help improve engagement and attrition

[10]. Within this pilot feasibility study, we assessed the
acceptability and feasibility of using intelligent personal
assistants alongside more traditional intervention approaches
or as a stand-alone intervention tool. This feasibility study
demonstrated that using intelligent personal assistants to deliver
health-related messages and information within the home was
feasible, with high levels of engagement from participating
families. This work also highlighted methodological
considerations and opportunities for intervention improvement
moving forward.

To date, there is a paucity of research on both the development
of interventions using this technology and the potential
effectiveness of such interventions. An ongoing study is
examining the role of a voice coach intervention (Amazon
Alexa/Echo) on increasing levels of physical activity among
overweight and obese cancer survivors [24]. In addition, Public
Health England has used intelligent personal assistants (Amazon
Echo) to encourage parents to adopt healthy behaviors around
breastfeeding [34] by providing parents with general information
and tailored advice based on the age of their child. This study
highlighted for the first time that families found this type of
intervention approach acceptable and feasible within the home
setting. Most families assigned to the intervention were able to
set up and initialize their devices and engage with the intelligent
personal assistant across the intervention period. Focus groups
and interviews with parents highlighted that the prompts or
reminders were particularly useful and commented that the
intervention encouraged the family to be healthier in a fun way.

Recent research has highlighted the plethora of _Health and_
_Fitness–related apps available for smart speakers [25], with_
health education, fitness and training, and nutrition the most
frequently occurring of these apps. For the purposes of the IPAP
intervention, prompts or reminders provided by the research
team were based on the devices’ existing functionality, and
families were instructed to use the features already developed
for these smart speakers. High levels of interaction were
observed across the intervention period, with a higher volume
of interactions in phase 2. Setting reminders or prompts, asking
questions about nutrition, and using physical activity and


nutrition apps (Skills) were the most common relevant
interactions across the intervention period.

The mean frequency of device interactions across phase 2 was
much greater (312 vs 65), but a higher proportion of interactions
were coded as relevant in phase 1 (42% vs 11%). This provides
important insights into how families used the devices and
suggests that linking the devices to an ongoing intervention, as
with phase 1, may be more directive in terms of prompting
families to use the device for health-related interactions. The
issue of families not adequately implementing intervention
components has been highlighted in similar feasibility work
evaluating the use of a web-based intervention to encourage
families to increase their physical activity [23]. Within this
study, families were provided with written instructions and
reminders on how to interact and engage with the intelligent
personal assistants. Parents highlighted several ways to improve
engagement with the intervention, including incorporating
challenges, providing feedback, and clearer guidance from the
intervention facilitators on how to use the device within the
home. Within this feasibility study, the intervention facilitators
were members of the research team. Given the important role
of facilitators in terms of intervention outcomes [35], providing
families with more guidance and training before the intervention,
and ongoing support during the intervention, may improve the
family’s utilization of the device [23].

Given the small sample size in this study, it was not possible
to statistically compare the effectiveness of these 2 intervention
approaches. As the families in phase 1 were already attending
the SWEET project, the results from phase 1 and phase 2 could
not be combined. A recent systematic review highlighted that
most family-based eHealth interventions combined technology
with other types of delivery, for example, face-to-face
counseling, nutrition lessons, and so on, and from this literature,
it is difficult to ascertain the exact effect of the eHealth
component versus other approaches [16].

The development and feasibility testing of the intervention
identified several important methodological considerations.
First, the research team was not able to control the content, or
indeed validity, of the responses families received when they
asked for information on healthy eating or physical activity. At
present, there is limited insight on whether these apps are
developed based on evidence-based guidelines or available
materials [25]; therefore, assessing the accuracy of educational
information provided by these devices would be an important
methodological consideration moving forward. Indeed, a
previous study examining the provision of medical advice from
these devices highlights the importance of cautioning users not
to use such technologies in place of medical advice without
consulting with their health care provider first [36]. Second,
families noted that the intervention in its current format did not
provide any opportunities for feedback or accountability with
limited options for families to log their healthy eating or physical
activity. Moving forward, studies should explore the potential
of linking these intelligent personal assistants with other
technologies to monitor behaviors, set goals, and provide
feedback [37,38], which may help improve the effectiveness of
technology-based interventions [39].

The implementation of the intervention was dependent on a few
factors. An important practical consideration was the capacity
of the research team to access the family’s device remotely. If
the device was switched off or the family had Wi-Fi connection
issues, the delivery of the intervention was affected, as the
research team was unable to set new reminders and prompts
during these periods. During the focus group and interview
discussions, parents highlighted how the timing of the prompts
or reminders may have affected their adherence to the
intervention. Although attempts were made to tailor the
intervention to suit the schedules of individual families, future
studies using similar intervention components should seek to
provide families with further guidance and ownership in relation
to managing the devices themselves.

##### Strengths and Limitations

The IPAP study adopted a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary
approach to explore the role of intelligent personal assistants
within the home environment to promote and maintain physical
activity and other health-related behaviors in families. The
intervention development and evaluation used novel methods
to capture intervention engagement, addressing key
recommendations for research in this field to adopt appropriate
methodologies that enable interventions to be effectively

evaluated [17]. This study developed the intervention content
and tested its feasibility in line with the best practice for
intervention development [40]. Owing to the small sample size,
no statistical analysis was undertaken at this stage to evaluate
the effectiveness of the intervention. Accelerometer compliance
was low during phase 1 of the study, despite the use of
incentives to encourage adherence. In addition, device usage
was much lower across phase 1. Given that these families were
already taking part in the SWEET project at the time, they may
have felt overburdened with data collection.

##### Conclusions

This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of a
family-based intervention using intelligent personal assistants.
This novel intervention has highlighted important
methodological considerations and provides important
suggestions to further optimize the potential of intelligent
personal assistants to promote positive health-related behaviors
in the home setting. This work will inform future pilot and fully
powered studies to build upon this feasibility work and test
whether such interventions are effective at changing
health-related behaviors, including physical activity and healthy
eating.
