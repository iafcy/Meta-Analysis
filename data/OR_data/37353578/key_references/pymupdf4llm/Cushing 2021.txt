Abstract


Objective The present nonrandomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a tailored text message intervention for increasing adolescent physical activity, as compared with passive monitoring. Methods Forty adolescents (13–18 years old)
received either a tailored text messaging intervention (Network Underwritten Dynamic Goals
Engine [NUDGE]; N ¼ 20), or participated in an attention-control condition (N ¼ 20), for 20 days.
Physical activity was measured for all participants via continuous accelerometry. Frequency analyses were conducted on program usage and satisfaction ratings to evaluate feasibility and acceptability, and multilevel models were used to evaluate the efficacy hypotheses. Results The vast
majority of participants (90%) reported being very or mostly satisfied with the NUDGE program
and rated their enjoyment as above average. The intervention group was estimated to spend an average of 20.84 more minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity relative to the
attention-control group (b ¼ 20.84, SE ¼ 8.19). Exploratory analyses revealed that the intervention
group also engaged in 82 fewer minutes of sedentary time per day on average, although this effect
was not significant due to the large variability in sedentary time (b ¼ �81.98, SE ¼ 46.86).
Conclusions The NUDGE tailored text messaging intervention was feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in increasing physical activity in this sample. Findings warrant additional evaluation of
NUDGE as both a standalone physical activity intervention or as part of a multicomponent
package.

Introduction

It is recommended that adolescents obtain 60 min of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily.
This practice can promote overall health and help to
prevent problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity (Danaei et al., 2009). Interestingly,
many young children engage in adequate MVPA


(Nader et al., 2008). However, marked declines in
health promoting physical activity and increases in
sedentary time are observed around age 13 and
worsen through adulthood, at which point only 1 out
of 5 Americans meet the 2008 Physical Activity
Guidelines (DHHS, 2008; Nader et al., 2008). Given
the observed rapid decline it is essential to find

acceptable and efficacious intervention approaches
that can facilitate adolescents’ engagement in more
MVPA, which may translate into improved health
over the lifespan.
Adolescents are high adopters of smartphone technologies and are generally comfortable with communication via text message (Lenhart, 2015). In fact,
representative surveys suggest that the average adolescent sends �30 text messages per day and texting is
their dominant mode of communication (Anderson,
2015). A recent meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
efficacy of mobile health interventions for improving
health outcomes, in children and adolescents, and
found that the average overall effect size associated
with these interventions was small, yet statistically significant (Fedele et al., 2017). One conclusion from
this work was that very few mHealth studies use a
clear theoretical framework to guide the choice of the
behavior change techniques in the intervention.
Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that
consumer-facing mobile applications specifically for
physical activity do not widely employ efficacious
behavior-change techniques (Brannon & Cushing,
2015). Importantly, this runs counter to recent finding
that parents are open to a range of evidence-based behavior change techniques embedded in mHealth interventions, which indicates that the market is receptive
to features that should change behavior (Cushing
et al., 2018).
There is evidence that control theory might be a
powerful framework for designing interventions to
promote physical activity (Michie et al., 2009).
Indeed, control theory interventions (particularly
those that encourage self-monitoring) have support
for promoting adolescent physical activity (Brannon
& Cushing, 2015). Control theory posits that, individuals achieve goals by monitoring progress toward an
end state, incorporating feedback, and modifying
goals as needed (Carver & Scheier, 1981, 1982).
Michie et al. (2009) found interventions that leveraged
the control theory strategy of self-monitoring with at
least one other behavioral self-regulation component
were significantly more effective than interventions
that did not involve this combination. Broadly, interventions consistent with control theory use the techniques of goal-setting, self-monitoring of behavior,
receiving feedback, and goal review (Carver &
Scheier, 1981, 1982). Goal setting is typically defined
as a detailed plan of what a person will do that is
time-bound and measurable. Self-monitoring is simply
the act of keeping track of a behavior. Goal review
refers to actively reconsidering previously set goals to
determine if they are still framed in a way that is relevant and reasonable. Feedback can be either a depiction of data that indicates progress toward a goal or
more qualitative commentary on how well or poorly


the person has performed an action. Adolescents are
still developing the ability to self-regulate their own
behavior (Pokhrel et al., 2013). Therefore, tailored
interventions that provide developmentally appropriate external supports for self-regulatory skills consistent with control theory could support long-term
health habits in adolescents (Lansing & Berg, 2014).
Moreover, there is some evidence that interventions
that adapt to the user over time may be more effective
than static interventions (Smyth & Heron, 2016).
Digital interventions offer the potential to leverage
user data within the program to change or “adapt”
the intervention experience based on user inputs. Such
paradigms were originally framed as ecological momentary interventions, just-in-time interventions, and
in some cases where the rules of the interventions
change over time can be known as just-in-time adaptive interventions (Heron & Smyth, 2010; NahumShani et al., 2016; Smyth & Heron, 2016).
Importantly, such a digital intervention system that
adapts to user input can be easily conceptualized as a
form of feedback control (i.e., the controlled system
from control theory) because the system itself is continually optimizing its performance based on user
inputs (Rivera et al., 2007).
As one goes about building an adaptive intervention some consideration must be given to how the system will be designed. In contrast to large packages
with many active ingredients, the ORBIT (ObesityRelated Behavioral Intervention Trials) model encourages the smallest intervention possible with the intention of repurposing efficacious intervention concepts
in larger packages. The advantage of conducting small
scale interventions is that individual elements are
closely tied to theoretical models or empirical evidence. Then, when an intervention succeeds or fails a
clear picture of why it produces an observed effect
emerges from the study (Czajkowski et al., 2015).
Currently, it is unclear if simple prompts—designed in
a manner consistent with control theory—would be effective on their own in increasing adolescent physical
activity. In large part this is because most studies combine messaging with other intervention elements
(Ludwig et al., 2018).
This study aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and gather preliminary data on the effect of an
adaptive mHealth intervention in which adolescents
receive messages about physical activity that are tailored based on their recent exercise. Participants are
asked to self-report their physical activity, review
goals in the light of their past performance, set a goal
for the future, and receive feedback on their performance. Consistent with the ORBIT model of intervention development, this study was designed with as few
active ingredients as possible to ensure that the mechanisms of action would be unambiguous provided that

the intervention has an effect (Czajkowski et al.,
2015). It was hypothesized that adolescents who received a tailored text messaging intervention (intervention group) that involved goal-setting, selfmonitoring, feedback, and goal re-evaluation would
engage in more physical activity over a 20-day study
period than adolescents in the passive monitoring
group (attention control group). Although not a specific target of the intervention, an exploratory analysis
of the intervention effect on sedentary time was also
performed.

Materials and Methods


Participants
Because adolescence (13–18) is a time of declining
physical activity, forty adolescents, ages 13–18 years
old, participated in the study (see Table I). A total of
20 participants made up the intervention group
(Network Underwritten Dynamic Goals Engine;
NUDGE), whereas 20 were in the attention-control
group. The attention control group were drawn from
a larger sample that participated in an ecological momentary assessment study assessing the relationship
between state and trait psychological variables and
physical activity. Attention control participants were
matched to NUDGE participants on age, sex, and
race/ethnicity, with priority given in the order the variables are listed. Participants from each study were
recruited using the same procedures (i.e., through
flyers posted in a midwestern city) and the respective
protocols (i.e., study measures and duration), apart
from the NUDGE intervention, were equivalent. The
protocols were approved by the local institutional review board. Adolescents and/or their parents contacted the research lab to express interest in the study,
completed a brief screening process, and were scheduled for an initial lab visit. Inclusion criteria were: (a)
age range of 13–18 years old, (b) able to read at grade
level in English. Exclusion criteria included : (a) significant uncorrected visual impairments, (b) any physical
impairments that limited activity, and (c) independent
living without a caregiver (e.g., 18-year-old college
undergraduates living in a dormitory; Figure 1).

Procedures
Recruitment procedures as well as study procedures
for the intervention and attention control groups were
similar. Participants were recruited using flyers posted
in a midwestern community. Postings were made at
businesses, places of worship, and schools when
allowed. Flyers indicated that participants would be
asked to complete surveys, wear sensors, and would
be compensated financially for the time they devoted
to the project. Informed consent was obtained along
with assent if the child was a minor. The research


team recruited participants in the attention-control
group from 2015 to 2016 and participants in the
NUDGE group in 2017. Recruitment occurred across
all four seasons of the year.

Enrollment Visit
Parent-adolescent dyads attended a scheduled visit in
the lab and completed an informed consent and assent
process, respectively.[1] They completed a set of baseline questionnaires pertaining to physical activity, dietary behavior, and mood on a lab computer. These
measures included a demographics survey, the
Treatment Self-Regulation for Exercise and Diet
Questionnaire (Levesque et al., 2006), Perceived
Competence for Exercise Questionnaire (Williams
et al., 1998), Social Support for Exercise Scale (Sallis
et al., 1987), Physical Activity Self-Efficacy
Questionnaire (Motl et al., 2000), Physical Activity
Attitudes Questionnaire (Nelson et al., 2010),
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Varni et al.,
2001), Power of Food Scale (Lowe et al., 2009), and
the Children’s Report of Sleep Patterns (Meltzer et al.,
2013). Research staff provided the adolescent with a
smartphone for use in the study and explained instructions for usage.[2] Consistent with other studies in
youth (Heron et al., 2017) we limited the features of
the smartphones given to participants to only those
necessary to complete the study (i.e., SMS capability
and access to the survey app). Each participant chose
four times to complete a daily survey that would take
about 3–5 min. These daily surveys included the
Positive and Negative Affect Scale-Child Version
(Ebesutani et al., 2012), the three highest loading
items for five of the subscales from the Profile of
Mood States scale (depression, anxiety, anger, energy,
fatigue, McNair et al., 1971), questions about the participant’s environment, dietary intake, social support
for exercise (Sallis et al., 1987), and hedonic hunger
(Mitchell et al., 2016). Control participants received
the same contacts as the intervention condition (i.e.,
same surveys). In addition to the control procedures,
NUDGE participants provided convenient times to receive intervention text messages. NUDGE participants
were trained to report MVPA in minutes. In the training, we defined exercise as activities such as running,
swimming, or brisk walking that makes it hard to
carry on a conversation. Adolescents in both groups


1 On review, colleagues requested that all measures administered to
participants be listed. Because a larger number of measures were
given that are not analyzed in the current report, we list them in the
procedures section rather than the list of study measures which are
used to evaluate the study aims.
2 Participants were provided with a smartphone because our app used
for distributing surveys was unstable on phones it was not programmed for. For this reason, we gave participants phones so that
we could ensure the app would work properly.

were also provided an accelerometer for tracking
physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) to be worn
on their non-dominant wrist throughout the duration
of the study. The accelerometer did not provide feedback on activity to the participant.

Exit Visit
At the end of the 20-day[3] study period, all participants
returned to the lab for a scheduled visit to complete
postintervention measures and return the smartphone
and accelerometer. Participants were compensated
$15 for wearing the accelerometer for 24 h on 18 out
of 20 study days; and, an extra $25 if the participant
answered all four surveys on at least 17 days.


Attention Control Condition
The attention-control group did not receive the
NUDGE intervention text messages (described below).
Instead, participants completed identical study measures (enrollment, exit, and daily surveys) in the
NUDGE protocol and wore an accelerometer as well

as a blinded heart rate monitor for the 20-day study
duration. As mentioned previously, the recruitment,
consenting, assessment procedures, and the study period for the attention-control study were identical to
the NUDGE protocol. Research staff explained to participants that their physical activity would be monitored during the study. Participants in this condition
received no intervention content.

NUDGE Intervention
NUDGE is a chat bot developed for the purposes of
this study. The bot is a server-side computer program
that adapts text messages based on user input with the
goal to promote adolescent physical activity. The platform engages in a chat with users to help them set and
review goals, self-monitor progress, provide feedback
on goal attainment, and revise future goals. The adaptive nature of the intervention means that the program
changes the wording of messages, and the ranges of
goals based on user input and self-reported activity
levels. To begin, participants choose a time of day
when they would like to receive a text message to set a
physical activity goal. The goal is then stored overnight; at a predetermined time the next morning,
NUDGE sends a message reminding the user of their
stored goal (e.g., “Just a friendly reminder that your


-----

in goal attainment. For this reason, the self-report
(even if less accurate than an accelerometer) is desired
over a passive monitoring system (Michie et al.,
2009). The participant replies to the NUDGE bot with
a numerical value representing their accumulated exercise. The entry is compared against the previously
entered goal value. The NUDGE bot then provides
feedback to the user indicating whether or not their
predefined goal was met and subsequently requests a
new goal (e.g., “This is fantastic! You met your goal!”
or “It looks like you didn’t meet your goal.”). The
maximum allowable goal value was 120 min and the
minimum was 15. In addition, NUDGE only accepts
goal values that were between an investigator defined
range (i.e., 75–125%) of the last self-monitored physical activity value, so that future performance is tied to
past performance and goals cannot be set too high or
too low to be useful (Wrosch et al., 2003; e.g., “Let’s
set a new exercise goal. Based on what you did this
time [25 min], I think you should choose between 15
and 45 min”). If users exceeded 60 min of selfreported exercise, the feedback message was modified
to congratulate the user on their healthy level of exercise (e.g., “This is fantastic! You met your goal! You
exercised a healthy amount! Let’s set a new goal between [75–125% of current MVPA]”).

Measures
Demographics and Anthropometrics
Participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire and their height and weight were measured by
study staff. Body mass index percentile was calculated
based on age and sex, as indicated by the Centers for
Disease Control (Kuczmarski, 2002).

exercise goal today is 25 min. I will check in with you
later to see how you did”). Later the same day, the
user is prompted to self-monitor their physical activity
via self-report (e.g., “How much exercise did you get

[in minutes]?”). NUDGE used self-report in this instance because control theory posits that the active
comparison of one’s performance to a goal is essential


Objective Measure of Activity
Physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB)
were measured by an accelerometer (ActiGraph
wGT3X-BT; Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL).
Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer
for 24 h per day on their nondominant wrist during
the study. The accelerometer was used only for passively monitoring physical activity. The goal was to
use the device only to track outcomes and not as an element of the intervention. Accelerometers were set to
sample movement at a rate of 30 Hz. Data were processed using the Actilife software v.6.10.2, and summarized daily measurements of MVPA and the secondary
outcome of SB using the Chandler et al. (2016)
algorithm.

Feasibility and Acceptability
To determine the feasibility of the NUDGE protocol,
we computed the average number of participantprovided responses per day, messages sent by the
NUDGE bot per day, exchanged messages per day


-----

between participants and the NUDGE bot per day, as
well as the number of unexpected messages (i.e., the
participant texted without receiving a message from
NUDGE) received from participants, and compared
them with expected values based on the protocol. In
addition, we calculated instances of what we describe
as a goal-loop, or occurrences when participants were
unable to set goals within a personally useful range
(i.e., 75-125% of their previous attainment). This occurred when participants continually enter values that
are outside the acceptable range for the algorithm and
indicate lack of understanding of the NUDGE rules,
and may reflect frustration with the system.
Participants completed the Consumer Satisfaction
Questionnaire (CSQ) as a measure acceptability of the
intervention. This consisted of a list of questions administered in survey format at the end of the study to
assess participant satisfaction with NUDGE. The
CSQ-8 is comprised of eight items on a 4-point response scale (a ¼ .90) and measured general satisfaction with NUDGE as well as quality of program.
Some example items on the CSQ-8 are “how satisfied
are you with the amount of help you have received?”
and “how do you rate the quality of service you
received?” Total satisfaction scores were generated
(based on the sum of individual items) to investigate
acceptability of the program. Participants also completed two text responses regarding what participants
liked and did not like about the study: “please tell us
what you liked about the study”; and, “please tell us
what you did not like about the study” (Table II).

Data Analysis Plan
To evaluate feasibility and acceptability we evaluate
the mean number of text messages exchanged and the
average value in our acceptability measure. Our a priori criteria for feasibility and acceptability was that
both values would be above the midpoint of the scale.
To evaluate the efficacy hypotheses, we conducted
multilevel models using SAS PROC MIXED. We ran
two sets of identical models for MVPA and our exploratory analysis of sedentary time as assessed by objectively monitored accelerometry. First, the
dependent variable was entered into a model with no
predictors to allow for the computation of an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Next, we explicitly
modeled an effect of time by fitting dummy codes for
each observation centered at baseline. We fit models
for linear, random linear, quadratic, and random quadratic effects of time. The best fitting and most parsimonious model was selected using �2LL difference
tests (Snijders & Bosker, 2011). Group membership
was then entered into the model as a predictor with
the control group centered at zero this was done so
that the interpretation of the effect would be the number of minutes increase or decrease in the dependent


Feasibility
Based on the NUDGE protocol, there should be six
messages exchanged between the NUDGE bot and the
user (e.g., four from NUDGE bot and two from the
user). The average number of participant-provided
responses per day was 1.35, the average number of
sent messages from the NUDGE bot per day was 1.66,
and the average number of exchanged messages per
day was 3. There was a small, but significant decline
in participant engagement with the NUDGE bot
across time (b ¼ �0.02, p ¼ .004). In real terms this
means that by the end of the study participants were
responding to .4 fewer messages than on the first day,
which is a trivial difference. There were 16 occasions
of unexpected messages from participants and 2 occasions of goal-loop frustration (i.e., participants were
not able to set a goal within the acceptable range). We
anticipated 800 days of accelerometer data and
obtained 799.

Acceptability
The mean satisfaction score from the CSQ-8 was
26.65 (SD ¼ 4.03, range ¼ 16–32). This indicates that
the average participant was satisfied with the intervention. Scores from an individual item, “In an overall,
general sense, how satisfied are you with the services
you have received?,” on the CSQ-8 indicated that
60% of participants were very satisfied, 30% were
mostly satisfied, and 10% were indifferent or dissatisfied with the NUDGE program.
Free text responses regarding what participants
liked and disliked about the study were coded to create frequencies of common themes in responses. Five
participants commented how the NUDGE program increased their motivation for healthy behaviors, such as
physical activity. Four participants endorsed that
NUDGE facilitated self-reflection and self-monitoring
of physical activity. For example, participants commented how they liked “how it made me think about
exercising”, how “it forced me to look at how much
exercising I was getting” and how it “keeps tabs on
the physical activity I did.” Seventeen participants
commented on the ease of the intervention, the helpfulness of goal reminders, and the flexibility to


variable for the intervention group. Finally, a dummycoded variable representing weekend and weekdays
was entered into the model as a main effect and interaction with group membership. This variable was centered so that the zero point would represent weekdays.
Finally, we called up conditional effects of the interaction so that we could report on specific parameter estimates (e.g., MVPA levels in intervention participants
on weekdays).

participants indicated some dissatisfaction with the
equipment (e.g., accelerometer) with the majority of
complaints relating to discomfort wearing the device.

MVPA Efficacy
To evaluate the equivalence of the two groups we conducted an independent samples t-test across the two
groups on the first day of the study. There were no
group differences in MVPA at that timepoint. In an
empty multilevel model for MVPA the ICC was .57 indicating that �57% of the variance in MVPA is
between-person and 43% is within-person. In the


models for time, it was established that a random effect linear model of time fit best and was used for subsequent analyses; this suggests that MVPA increases or
decreases at different rates across study participants
during the study window. Participants in the control
condition averaged �28 min of MVPA. In the final
model, the main effect of group was b ¼ 20.84 (SE ¼
8.19; Table III) indicating that the intervention group
engaged in �21 more minutes of MVPA than the control group. Moreover, the magnitude of this difference
is more than three quarters of a SD (d ¼ .83). Finally,
day of the week did moderate the intervention effect
with NUDGE participants obtaining significantly

more MVPA on weekdays compared with weekends.
Moreover, controls obtained less activity than the intervention group on weekend days.

Sedentary Efficacy
There were no differences in sedentary time across the
two groups on the first day of the study. The empty
model revealed an ICC for sedentary activity of .63.
This indicates that 63% of the variability in SB is
between-person, whereas 37% is within-person.
Again, a random linear effect of time fit the longitudinal data best and was retained for analyses; this again
suggests that participants increased or decreased in
sedentary time at different rates. Participants in the

The current nonrandomized controlled trial demonstrated the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the NUDGE text messaging
intervention. With only three text messages per day
exchanged on average, the intervention group
obtained 21 more minutes of MVPA and 82 fewer
minutes of sedentary time. The satisfaction with the
program was high and participant confusion or frustration were low.
In the development of NUDGE, we have used a
minimalist approach to intervention design. Other
valuable physical activity promotion packages are
built on sound theory and contain many intervention
strategies that are hypothesized to produce the treatment effect (Gourlan et al., 2016; King et al., 2013).
Consistent with the ORBIT model of intervention development, our approach was to design the smallest
possible intervention that could reasonably produce
an effect (Czajkowski et al., 2015). By linking every
possible text message to an element of control theory,
we hoped to minimize wasted interactions with participants, and also reduce the risk of habituation. We attribute the high feasibility and acceptability to, at least
in part, the minimalist approach to design. Given that
participants are asked to use a familiar behavior (i.e.,
text messaging), it was relatively easy for them to
complete the protocol. Moreover, as a result of oversampling females, the generalizability of the intervention is enhanced as girls transition more rapidly from
obtaining adequate MVPA in youth to inactivity in adolescence and the effect is more pronounced than for
boys (Nader et al., 2008).
It is important to note that while the aggregate effect of NUDGE exceeds that found in comparable text
message interventions (Armanasco et al., 2017) and
face-to-face health promotion programs (Cushing
et al., 2014), the effects are not uniformly positive for
every participant. That is to say, we think it is important to note that not every person who receives the intervention will engage in a clinically meaningful
amount of more MVPA and less sedentary time. For
instance, the lower bound 95% CI for MVPA is 4.8.
Although even the participant who achieves this
muted intervention effect is increasing MVPA at a
level in keeping with prior physical activity interventions (Metcalf et al., 2012), additional studies that
seek to optimize the effect of NUDGE are needed. In
other words, there is value in raising the “floor” of the
intervention effect so that the person who benefits the
least still experiences a meaningful change. We expect
that the variables that influence MVPA and sedentary


-----

time are likely to fluctuate within-person and that
their effect will likely be different from person-toperson (Cushing et al., 2019). Importantly, the intervention period is quite brief (20 days) and additional
studies are needed to understand the durability of the
intervention effect over time.
We agree with the microtemporal framework put
forward by Dunton (2018) as a way of identifying variables that can be used to optimize NUDGE. For example, we imagine that environmental context may
moderate the effect of a NUDGE message. In our own
work, we have demonstrated that when participants
judge the weather to be poor they are less likely to engage in MVPA (Bejarano et al., 2019). Related, we
have observed that adolescents are highly individualized in the degree to which their mood or energy level
influences their MVPA or sedentary time (Cushing
et al., 2017). These findings suggest that environment
and mood states might be used to modify the delivery
of an activity prompt or other intervention content.
Another point of optimization is message timing. As a
day progresses for an individual participant there is an
asymptote in the probability that they are going to engage in meaningful exercise. Specifically, there appears
to be a window of opportunity for prompting activity
between 5 and 8 p.m. that deserves experimental investigation (Ortega & Cushing, 2020). Finally, some
evidence exists that suggests digital interventions may
not be the right solution for every participant who
wants to change their physical activity behavior, some
participants may benefit more from messages delivered by providers or practitioners than those delivered
by a piece of software (Brannon et al., 2018). With
these findings in mind, it will be important to demonstrate the effect of NUDGE in a larger clinical trial,
and to determine if it has utility in clinical populations
(e.g., pediatric overweight and obesity).

Limitations
This project is a nonrandomized trial. For this reason,
both generalizability and causality are unknown.
Second, the intervention period is short (�3 weeks),
and no maintenance phase was conducted. Therefore,
we are not able to assess the durability of the intervention effect nor can we predict the point at which participants would have habituated to the intervention.
Third, the sample is small which introduces three
problems: (a) The sample is not fully representative of
all those who might benefit from NUDGE, (b) the effect sizes are likely to change in a larger trial, and (c)
the p < .05 criterion may be too stringent for a significance test. This report is of a nonclinical sample that
is more likely to benefit from this type of intervention
compared with one with significant impairments.


Real World Application
A brief intervention like NUDGE does have realworld application beyond its function as a pilot trial.
It is meaningful to have an extremely brief intervention that improves MVPA in 20 days. Even if the intervention effect were to deteriorate after this window
(an open empirical question) it is easier to maintain a
behavior than to start it from nothing. Therefore, intervention content that follows after NUDGE has an
abundance of MVPA to attempt to reinforce. Because
the accelerometer was only used for outcome tracking,
teens do not need to wear a smartwatch or accelerometer to benefit from NUDGE, which further enhances
its real-world application. Finally, a real-world application would deliver texts directly to any phone.
Because a smartphone is not needed the cost of entry
for NUDGE is low.

Toward Recruitment of a Diverse Sample
The sample in this study was primarily white and upper income. This suggests to us that the community recruitment methods lack feasible for producing
diversity on income and race. Future studies may need
to employ clinic recruitment or more targeted recruitment from specific organizations where race and income diversity is present (e.g., Boys and Girls clubs,
faith groups, etc.).


Conclusion

NUDGE should be explored as both a standalone
physical activity intervention as well as part of a multicomponent package. This study serves as a useful
model for mapping intervention components onto specific elements of an established theory. By using as few
intervention components as possible the mechanism of
action is unambiguous.
