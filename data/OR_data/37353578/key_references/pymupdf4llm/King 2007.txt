**_Purpose: Given the prevalence of physical inactivity among American adults, convenient, low-cost_**
interventions are strongly indicated. This study determined the 6- and 12-month effectiveness of
telephone interventions delivered by health educators or by an automated computer system in promoting
physical activity. Design: Initially inactive men and women age 55 years and older (N � 218) in stable
health participated. Participants were randomly assigned to human advice, automated advice, or health
education control. Measures: The validated 7-day physical activity recall interview was used to estimate
minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical activity differences by experimental arm were
verified on a random subsample via accelerometry. Results: Using intention-to-treat analysis, at 6
months, participants in both interventions, although not differing from one another, showed significant
improvements in weekly physical activity compared with controls. These differences were generally
maintained at 12 months, with both intervention arms remaining above the target of 150 min per week
of moderate to vigorous physical activity on average. Conclusion: Automated telephone-linked delivery
systems represent an effective alternative for delivering physical activity advice to inactive older adults.


Regular physical activity plays an important role in the prevention and control of a range of chronic health conditions (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 1996), but 30% or less
of middle-aged and older adults engage regularly in healthenhancing physical activities (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services and National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2002), and 29% or more report no

leisure-time physical activity at all (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services and National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2002). Given this, promoting regular
physical activity in an efficient and cost-effective manner remains
a significant clinical and public health challenge (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2001; Wang et al., 2004).
The Task Force on Community Preventive Services reviewed
interventions to increase regular physical activity and rated individually adapted health behavior change interventions delivered
via telephone or other formats as effective and strongly recommended for broader dissemination (Kahn et al., 2002; Task Force
on Community Preventive Services, 2001). In addition to freeing
both participant and provider from the setting-based constraints
characteristic of face-to-face approaches, the telephone has been
identified, from a communication theory perspective, as the richest
medium next to face-to-face communication (Webster & Trevino,
1995). This is due to its ability to allow for preexisting, “natural”
elements of verbal communication as well as to allow the development of a personalized focus in a one-on-one discussion
(Webster & Trevino, 1995). Such telephone counseling, based on
well-established theories of behavior change, that is, social cognitive
theory (Bandura, 2001) and the transtheoretical model (Marcus &
Simkin, 1994), has been effective in promoting physical activity in
diverse populations of initially inactive middle-aged and older adults
(Castro & King, 2002; Hooker et al., 2005; King, Baumann,
O’Sullivan, Wilcox, & Castro, 2002).

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADVICE BY HUMANS VS. COMPUTERS 719


Emerging telecommunication technologies provide one potentially effective method for delivering ongoing, individually tailored physical activity telephone advice and support to large numbers of people at potentially lower cost per person (Marcus, Nigg,
Riebe, & Forsyth, 2000). Extending the reach of telecommunication technologies to promote physical activity has recently been
accomplished through the development and successful evaluation
of telephone-linked, interactive voice response systems for delivering physical activity advice (Jarvis, Friedman, Heeren, &
Cullinane, 1997; Pinto et al., 2002). However, few automated
delivery programs have been formally evaluated or compared with
programs delivered by trained health professionals (Jarvis et al.,
1997; Pinto et al., 2002).
The Community Health Advice by Telephone (CHAT) trial
evaluated the effectiveness of telephone-based physical activity
guidance and support delivered via a trained health educator or an
automated system across an extended (12-month) period. Both
programs were developed to optimize the natural elements of “real
time” personalized verbal communication (communication theory)
in combination with an emphasis on empirically supported cognitive and behavioral processes of change, for example, personal
commitment, enlisting support, self-efficacy enhancement, selfmonitoring (social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical model).
We sought to answer the following primary question in this trial:
Among underactive community-dwelling adults age 55 years and
older, how effective was the automated advice system in promoting regular, moderate-intensity or more vigorous (MOD�) physical activity in the short term (i.e., 6 months) and longer term (i.e.,
12 months) relative to a similar program delivered by a trained
health educator or to an attention-control arm? This study also
examined differences in selected perceived functioning and wellbeing outcomes across the three study arms, in light of the importance of such outcomes to the daily quality of life of older adults
and the growing literature linking such functioning and well-being
outcomes to regular physical activity (Rejeski & Mihalko, 2001).

###### Method


###### Participants and Experimental Design

The methods for the CHAT trial have been described in detail
elsewhere (King, Friedman, et al., 2002) and will be described
briefly here. Study eligibility criteria consisted of the following: 1)
ages 55 years and older; 2) not initially engaged in more than 60
minutes per week of moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical
activity over the previous 6 months; 3) free of any medical condition that would limit participation in moderate-intensity exercise;
4) body mass index (BMI) � 40; 5) average alcohol intake � 3
drinks per day; 6) able to speak and understand English sufficiently to provide informed consent and participate in study intervention and assessment procedures; 7) regular access to a touchtone phone; 8) not planning to move from the area over the study
period; and 9) willing to be randomized to any of the three study
arms. Major recruitment strategies consisted of promotion in local
media outlets, along with distribution of flyers and brochures to
local health clinics, pharmacies, senior centers, and other community settings. Individuals who met initial eligibility requirements
during a telephone screen underwent baseline medical and psychosocial assessment. Following stratification by gender, subjects


were randomly assigned, using a computerized version of the
Efron procedure (Efron, 1971), to one of three 12-month experimental arms: 1) a home-based moderate-intensity physical activity
program delivered primarily via a trained telephone counselor (i.e.,
Human Advice arm); 2) a home-based moderate-intensity physical
activity program delivered primarily via an automated, computercontrolled interactive telephone system (i.e., Automated Advice
arm); or 3) a health education attention-control arm. Blinded
evaluation of individuals enrolled in the three arms occurred at
baseline, 6, and 12 months (i.e., all study assessment staff were
blinded to participant study arm assignment). The appropriate
university institutional review boards approved the study protocol.
_Human advice arm._ This arm consisted primarily of
telephone-assisted physical activity counseling by a trained health
educator (King, Haskell, Taylor, Kraemer, & DeBusk, 1991).
Individuals received an initial in-person 30-40 minute health
educator-led instructional session, including development of an
individualized plan emphasizing a gradual progression of activity
frequency, duration, and intensity towards a goal of 30 minutes or
more of moderate-intensity endurance exercise (primarily brisk
walking) on most days of the week (Pate et al., 1995). The
remaining intervention contacts occurred via brief (i.e., 10 to 15
minutes) structured counselor-initiated telephone calls that occurred on a bi-weekly, then monthly basis. Each participant was
scheduled to receive approximately 15 contacts during the study
year during which they received individualized information, support, and problem-solving around physical activity barriers. Discussion of cognitive and behavioral strategies, derived from Social
Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 2001) and the Transtheoretical
Model, (Marcus & Simkin, 1994) occurred as appropriate to each
person’s stage of motivational readiness for change (Marcus &
Simkin, 1994). Telephone contacts were supplemented with informational mailings and use of a Yamax Digi-walker pedometer to
provide individualized activity feedback to the participant
(AccuSplit, San Jose, CA) (Bassett et al., 1996). All participants in
this arm recorded information about their physical activity levels
(e.g., type, frequency, duration, steps accumulated on the pedometer) on a daily basis, and then reported this information to their
telephone counselor during their regular telephone contacts.
_Automated advice arm._ This arm consisted primarily of
telephone-assisted physical activity counseling by an automated
telephone-linked computer (TLC) system (Pinto et al., 2002). The
counseling content delivered in the TLC-based physical activity
program was modeled after the counseling protocol utilized in the
Human Advice arm and was similarly based on Social Cognitive
Theory and the Transtheoretical Model (King, Friedman, et al.,
2002). Individuals randomized to this arm received an initial
in-person health educator-led instructional session that was identical to that in the Human Advice arm, with the exception of
additional instructions in the use of the TLC system. The content
of the counseling delivered by TLC was consistent with that
delivered by the health educators, including physical activity assessment, progress evaluation, individualized problem-solving,
goal-setting, feedback, and delivery of positive support and tailored advice. The total number and schedule of ‘counselor’initiated contacts by the TLC system, using a programmed outdialer, was the same as that scheduled in the Human Advice arm.
TLC ‘spoke’ to participants over the telephone using computercontrolled speech generation. The users communicated using the

touch-tone keypad of their telephones (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto et
al., 2002). At the beginning of each call, participants in each
intervention were asked whether they had experienced any physical symptoms or complaints that could interfere with their physical activity program. Participants in both interventions responding
‘yes’ to this question were told to stop exercising and contact their
personal physician to discuss the health issues further. This issue
was assessed on the next call in both intervention arms.
Intervention quality assurance procedures for the two intervention arms included weekly evaluation of telephone counseling
session number, content, and length. For the Human Advice arm,
this was accomplished through review of counselor summary
forms completed at the time of each contact and independent
review of audio-taped telephone contacts for appropriate content
(approximately one-third of telephone contacts—which were routinely audio-taped by counseling personnel after securing participant permission–were randomly selected for independent review
by study investigators and non-study doctoral level clinical psychologists) (King, Friedman, et al., 2002). For the Automated
Advice arm, quality control was accomplished through semiweekly evaluation of the technical performance of the automated
system via TLC’s automatic contact summarization database, as
well as daily monitoring of the automated system’s telephone
‘help’ line, which was used by participants to report any problems
related to interacting with the TLC system (King, Friedman, et al.,
2002).
_Attention-control arm._ Individuals randomized to this arm
were offered weekly health education classes that focused on a
variety of non-physical activity topics of interest to middle- and
older aged adults such as nutrition and home safety, and were
asked not to change their usual physical activity patterns during the
12-month study period. At the end of 12 months, persons in this
arm were offered a six-month health educator-delivered telephonebased exercise program.

###### Measurement of Physical Activity


_Stanford 7-day physical activity recall (PAR)._ The 7-Day PAR
(Blair et al., 1985) served as the primary measure of physical
activity. The PAR provides an estimate of energy expenditure and
minutes per week engaged in MOD� activity, as defined by the
most recent Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al.,
2000). The PAR is a validated and extensively used structured
interview in which the participant estimates the amount of time
spent each day during the past seven days in four intensity categories of activity: sleep, and moderate, hard, and very hard physical activity (Sallis et al., 1985). Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities have been reported in the .69–.86 range (Gross, Sallis, Buono,
Roby, & Nelson, 1990; Rauh, Hovell, Hofstetter, Sallis, &
Gleghorn, 1992), and concurrent validity in the .75-.84 range
(Dubbert, Weg, Kirchner, & Shaw, 2004). Time in light activity is
derived by adding minutes spent in sleep to the total number of
minutes spent in the assessed physical activity categories, then
subtracting this sum from 24 hours. The PAR-based mean daily
energy expenditure estimates (kcal/kg[-1]/day[-1]) from MOD� activity was considered to be the primary study outcome measure (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 1996).
The PAR was supplemented with the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire for older adults (Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001). This


instrument has been found to provide a valid and reliable estimate
of energy expenditure in middle- and older-aged adults (King,
Baumann, et al., 2002; King, Pruitt, et al., 2000; Stewart, Mills, et
al., 2001; Stewart, Verboncoeur, et al., 2001). Three-month stability coefficients have been reported to be in the .70–.84 range for
the caloric expenditure measure in community samples of older
adults (Harada, Chiu, King, & Stewart, 2001; Stewart, Mills, et al.,
2001). The instrument has also been shown to have concurrent
validity when compared with interviewer-collected physical activity data (King, Pruitt, et al., 2000; Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001), as
well as sensitivity to change with a moderate-intensity physical
activity program in at least six different community samples of
middle-age and older women and men (Hooker et al., 2005; King,
Baumann, et al., 2002; King, Pruitt, et al., 2000b; Stewart, Verboncoeur, et al., 2001). In addition to energy expenditure estimates, estimates of mean times per week engaged in 30 minutes or
more of moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD�) physical
activity and mean minutes per week in MOD� activity can also be
derived from the CHAMPS (Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001). We also
evaluated the sensitivity of the Yale Physical Activity Survey in
the current study (DiPietro, Casperson. Ostfeld, & Nadel, 1993),
but given that this instrument, in contrast to the other two instruments described above, was not found to be sensitive to change in
this study, it will not be discussed further.
_Objective physical activity measurement._ Approximately 26%
(25.7%) of study participants (n � 56) were randomly selected
from across the three study arms to wear an accelerometer (CSA
Actigraph, model #7164; Computer Science and Applications,
Shalimar, FL; currently manufactured by Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., http://www.mtiactigraph.com) that recorded body
movement continuously for up to 7 days during approximately the
mid-point of the intervention (i.e., 6 months). Accelerometry provides a valid and reliable indicator of amount of physical activity,
and is considered to be the most efficient and effective means of
validating physical activity behavior in epidemiological and RCT
research (King, Baumann, et al., 2002; King et al., 1991; Pruitt,
Haskell, Bolen, Ahn, & King, 2003, Pruitt, Varady, Haskell,
Bolen, & King, 2002). In order to more accurately identify
moderate-intensity activity, individualized accelerometer count
‘thresholds’ were determined by having participants wear the
accelerometer at 6 months while walking on a level treadmill at a
pace required to elicit a heart rate of 65–75% of maximal predicted
heart rate (Pruitt et al., 2002, 2003). These individualized activity
count thresholds were subsequently applied to the accelerometry
data collected in the field to determine amount of time spent in
MOD� activity.

###### Measurement of Perceived Functioning and Well-Being


Two perceived functioning and well-being questionnaires of
particular relevance for older adults were collected at baseline, 6,
and 12 months. The Vitality Plus Scale (VPS) is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses, on a 5-point scale, current well-being
constructs that have been associated with regular physical activity
and are relevant for older adults, including sleep quality, energy
level, mood, constipation, morning stiffness, and general pain
(Myers et al., 1999). Participants also completed a validated 9-item
questionnaire evaluating satisfaction with body function (e.g., fitness, stamina) and appearance (Reboussin et al., 2000).

###### Sample Size and Statistical Analyses

Based on previous literature investigating telephone-based
physical activity interventions in similarly-aged samples (Jarvis et
al., 1997; King, Baumann, et al., 2002; King et al.,1991; Pinto et
al., 2002), a sample size of approximately 61 participants completing the study per cell was judged to be adequate for detecting
a 30 minute per week difference across 7 days as measured by the
PAR in moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity at
90% power with 2-sided alpha set at .05 (Kraemer & Thiemann,
1987). Analysis of variance (general linear models procedure)
(Spector, Goodnight, Sall, & Sarle, 1985) was used to evaluate
between-arm differences at baseline. Analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) (Spector et al., 1985) was used to assess change
across the initial 6-month adoption phase as well as across the
entire 12-month intervention period (Marcus, Dubbert, et al.,
2000). In analyzing change, main effects for arm assignment and
gender along with their interactions were evaluated, with baseline
levels of the dependent variables serving as covariates. Because
the gender x arm interaction was non-significant in all analyses,
the results from the more straightforward analyses without the
interaction term are presented. Chi-square analyses were conducted at 6 and 12 months comparing the percentages of the three
arms reaching the Surgeon General’s recommendation of at least
150 minutes per week in MOD� activity (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 1996). Alpha was set at .05 using a
2-tailed test of significance.
We incorporated intent-to-treat principles for the primary outcome of interest, i.e., physical activity measured using the PAR,
whereby, for participants with missing or incomplete PAR data at
both 6 and 12 months (n � 19), their baseline values were used and
for participants missing 6-month data only (n � 13), the calculated
mid-point between their baseline and 12-month values was used.
For participants missing 12-month data only (n � 10), an inspec

tion of secondary physical activity data sources occurred (i.e.,
12-month CHAMPS questionnaires, logged reports of physical
activity occurring during the 7-12 month intervention period that
were collected as part of all exercise advisor [automated or human]
interactions). If the data from these secondary sources indicated
that participants were at least as active as their 6-month PAR data
indicated, then the 6-month values were used (Simkin-Silverman,
Wing, Boraz, & Kuller, 2003). If no secondary data were available
for the participant or indicated less physical activity was occurring
relative to the 6-month PAR, then baseline values were used. Eight
of the 10 participants missing only 12-month data had corroborating data from secondary sources indicating physical activity levels
that were similar to or greater than those reported on their 6-month
PAR. For these participants, 6-month PAR values were used at 12
months. For the 2 participants without corroborating data, baseline
values were used. The intent-to-treat analyses led to results that
were comparable to those conducted using the available data only.
The intent-to-treat analyses are reported for the PAR outcomes.
For those ANCOVAs and chi-square analyses that reached statistical significance, pre-planned comparisons between arms were conducted using the least squares means procedure in SAS (Spector et al.,
1985). Because this was the first study to evaluate the impact of
automated telephone advice for physical activity on the secondary
outcomes concerning rated function and well-being, we conducted
these exploratory analyses using the available data.

66/73, or 90.4%; Automated Advice � 61/75, or 81.3%; Control � 62/70, or 88.6%; p � .10). Those with 12-month 7-Day
PAR data were comparable to those without 12-month PAR data
(n � 29) on the major baseline variables of interest, with the
following exceptions: Those without 12-month 7-Day PAR data
reported fewer baseline days per week in which they engaged in
moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity lasting at
least 30 minutes (M � 0.59, SD � 1.28 days/wk) relative to
participants with 12-month data (M � 1.23, SD � 1.65 days/wk;
_t(52) �_ 3.11, p � .003); and participants without 12-month PAR
data had higher rated stress scores at baseline, as measured via the
Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarch, & Mermelstein, 1983),
(M � 23.2 � 7.7) relative to subjects with 12-month data (M �
20.4, SD � 6.6; t(215) � 2.06, p � .04). Descriptive baseline data
by arm are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for selected variables. (Raw
data are shown to allow for comparisons with other studies and to
provide clinically meaningful information.) Participants were similar across the three study arms on the major baseline variables of
interest (all p values � .20). Similar to many individuals in this age
group, a large proportion of participants (Human Advice arm �
47.3%; Automated Advice arm � 59.5%; Control arm � 51.4%)
were on medications for a range of chronic conditions, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and asthma.
Table 3 shows the number and total duration of telephone
contacts over 12 months by intervention arm. (This table includes
all participants who were randomized to the two intervention arms,
with the exception of those participants who dropped out of the
intervention early because of initial dissatisfaction with their arm
assignment [n � 1 in the Human Advice arm] or initial technical
difficulties with the TLC system [n � 5 in the Automated Advice
arm].) Although the automated system made a significantly larger
mean number of total call attempts to establish contact over the
12-month period, t(139) � 13.3, p � .0001, a somewhat (though
not significantly) greater number of total calls were actually completed in the Human Advice relative to the Automated Arm (see
Table 3). The average call length was also greater in the Human
Advice Arm relative to the Automated Arm, t(139) � 6.3, p �
.0001. At the end of the 12-month intervention period, mean
participant satisfaction ratings from both intervention arms were
generally positive with respect to their CHAT exercise advisor
(ratings of � 4 on a 6-point scale), although the overall satisfaction

Table 1
_Descriptive Statistics [Mean (Standard Deviation), Frequency]_
_for Selected Variables at Baseline (Raw Data)_


ratings were higher for the Human Advice arm than for the
Automated Advice arm. (Human Advice mean satisfaction rating � 5.5, SD � 0.4 and Automated Advice mean satisfaction
rating � 4.3, SD � 1.0; t(43.5) � 7.1, p � .0001.)
Five participants randomized to the Automated Arm reported
initial technical problems with the TLC system early in the project
and soon afterwards dropped out of the study. All reported problems were fixed. Forty-one Automated Arm participants (55%)
utilized the TLC telephone help line at least once during the
intervention to obtain assistance with the TLC system. The questions directed to the independent staff manning the TLC help line
were typically simple in content (e.g., forgotten password; system
called at wrong time) and were able to be resolved by the TLC
programming staff with minimal difficulty, typically within 24
hours of notification.
For the Control arm, average attendance to the weekly health
education workshops equaled 5.7 sessions across the 12-month
period. For the 26 subjects who attended at least one workshop,
mean attendance rates across the year equaled 14.8 sessions
(range � 1-50 out of 50). Participants who missed any workshop
received the relevant informational materials through the mail.

At 6 months, both the Human Advice and Automated Advice
arms, while not significantly different from one another ( _p �_ .73),
had significantly greater mean energy expenditure in MOD�
activity than the Control arm (F(4, 217) � 4.73, p � .01 (see
Figure 2). Similarly, both the Human Advice and Automated
Advice arms, while not significantly different from one another
( _p �_ .65), had significantly greater mean minutes/week spent in
MOD� activity than the Control arm, F(4, 217) � 4.73, p � .01.
Comparable arm differences were found for the number of days
per week engaged in 30 minutes or more of MOD� activity ( _p_
values for Human Advice vs. Control � .0001; for Automated
Advice vs. Control � .003) (see Table 2 for means).
The ANCOVAs using the CHAMPS data mirrored the PAR
results in showing significant differences between the two
physical activity arms and Controls for mean energy expenditure (kcal/kg[-1]/day[-1]) in MOD� activities (F(4, 217) � 7.73,
_p �_ .0006); mean minutes per week in MOD� activity, F(4,
217) � 8.93, p � .0002; and number of times per week engaged
in 30 minutes or more of MOD� activity, F(4, 217) � 4.57,
_p �_ .01 (see Table 2 for means).
As expected, the CHAMPS-based means were generally higher
than those found with the PAR. This is because the CHAMPS
questionnaire involves self-reporting of ‘usual activity levels’ over the
previous 4-week period and has participants choose categories reflecting varying ranges of minutes/week engaged in each activity. In
contrast, the PAR asks them to report actual minutes engaged in each
activity for each day of a specified period, with the interview format
providing a level of probing and clarification absent from the paperand-pencil CHAMPS (King, Pruitt, et al., 2000). Because of these
constraints, the CHAMPS and similar questionnaires are best utilized
to understand relative differences in physical activity across individuals and/or across time as opposed to absolute physical activity levels
for each individual as targeted in the PAR.
At six months, a significantly greater percentage of subjects in
the Human Advice (52.7%) and Automated Advice (44.6%) arms

Advice arms did not differ in any of the Actigraph-derived
measures ( p values .28), the two arms were combined and
compared to the Control arm. Intervention participants showed


more physical activity relative to Controls based on the mean
number of accelerometer counts accumulated per hour averaged
across days worn (i.e., mean number of counts was 31.3%
greater for intervention [M � 20,606, SD � 8,641 counts]
versus controls [M � 15,690, SD � 6,058 counts]) ( p � .045).
In addition, the mean number of minutes spent in the individual’s MOD� activity range accumulated over 5 to 7 days was
significantly greater in the two intervention arms (M � 112.5,
_SD �_ 118.3) relative to the Control arm (mean minutes � 36.8,
_SD �_ 35.2), t(35.1) � 3.1, p � .004. These data provide an
objective indicator that, on the days in which the accelerometer
was worn, Intervention participants engaged in greater amounts
of physical activity both in general and in their targeted intensity range relative to Controls.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADVICE BY HUMANS VS. COMPUTERS 725


###### Changes in Physical Functioning and Well-Being at 6 and 12 Months

At 6 months, the three arms were not significantly different in
Vitality Plus or Satisfaction with Fitness scores ( _p values �_ .10).
At 12 months, the Human Advice arm had significantly greater
improvements on both of these measures (adjusted Ms � 37.5,
_SD �_ 6.1 for Vitality Plus and 36.0, SD � 12.3 for Satisfaction
with Fitness) relative to the Control arm (adjusted Ms � 34.8,
_SD �_ 5.8 and 30.0, SD � 11.9, respectively, p values � .04).
Neither of these arms significantly differed from the Automated
Advice arm at 12 months on these scales (adjusted Ms � 35.9,
_SD �_ 6.3 for Vitality Plus and 32.8, SD � 12.1 for Satisfaction
with Fitness; p � .19).


###### Discussion

The results of this study provide the first systematic evidence
that automated, telephone-based computer systems can lead to
improvements in physical activity levels over an extended time
period. The automated system, which was developed using established behavioral principles and strategies (Bandura, 2001;
Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984), achieved significant physical
activity increases in a community-based sample of middle- and
older-aged adults that were comparable to those achieved by
trained health educators at 6 months. By 12 months the effectiveness of the automated system appeared to diminish relative to
Human Advice (i.e., mean number of minutes per week in MOD�
physical activity relative to Control was no longer significant at the
.05 level with the current sample size). The mean minutes per
week of MOD� activity in the Automated Advice arm did remain,
however, above the 150 minutes per week of MOD� activity
recommended by the Surgeon General and other national bodies
(Pate et al., 1995; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
1996). The proportions of Automated Advice participants meeting
or exceeding the national recommendations at 6 and 12 months
compares favorably to those seen in recent physical activity trials
evaluating mediated and face-to-face interventions (Marcus et al.,
1998; The Writing Group for Activity Counseling Trial Research
Group, 2001). However, improvements in the two rated functioning and well-being variables at 12 months were not as great in the
Automated Advice as in the Human Advice Arm, suggesting that
such automated systems may be less potent in influencing physical
activity-related aspects of well-being that may be important to
quality of life as well as continued physical activity participation
(Rejeski & Mihalko, 2001).
The results expand the potential physical activity program
choices available to health care providers and other community
organizations. Such choices are important, given the substantial
percentage of inactive individuals in this age group and the differing needs and preferences of subgroups of middle- and olderaged adults in this health area (King et al., 1997). While randomized clinical trial (RCT) research is based on evaluation of mean
differences between study arms, means may conceal subgroup
differences (reflected in the reasonably large standard deviations
observed across the three arms at 6 and 12 months) in program
response that are important to consider when making clinical or
public health-based intervention decisions (King et al., 1997; U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Systematically


exploring subgroup differences in response to automated versus
human-delivered programs is strongly recommended in future
research, as is systematic evaluation of the relative costeffectiveness of the two interventions when delivered in more
‘real-world’ settings.
Although the current study sample was largely white, welleducated, and reasonably healthy, the original automated,
telephone-based system was developed and successfully tested in
less-educated, lower income samples of primary care patients,
30-50% of whom were ethnic minorities (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto
et al., 2002). The acceptability of the system among such groups in
the earlier studies is encouraging, although continued exploration
of its utility with a broader range of population segments is
indicated. It appears, based on our results, that the use of an
out-dialer that is programmed to make scheduled telephone contacts is an effective alternative to relying on participants to initiate
a call into the system on a regular basis (Pinto et al., 2002).
While the one-year intervention period for this study is longer
than that used in prior investigations of automated counseling
systems for physical activity (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto et al., 2002),
the question remains concerning whether the declines generally
observed in the Automated Advice arm between 6 and 12 months
might continue, rendering the Automated Advice program ineffective eventually in maintaining adequate physical activity levels
over the long-run. This question deserves further exploration, as do
methods of combining the two methods (Human and Automated
advice) to yield potentially less costly yet effective long-term
intervention effects.
We conclude that delivery of individualized advice and support
via telephone-based automated systems is an effective and attractive option for middle- and older-aged adults that should be considered for improving regular physical activity participation. In the
current study, both automated and health educator-based programs
resulted in improvements in physical activity levels that have been
linked to important health outcomes in aging adults (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). Such telephone-based
programs can provide a more convenient and flexible channel for
delivering ongoing advice and support for the relatively large
proportion of the American public who find it difficult to attend
structured, setting-based classes or programs on a regular basis
(King, Castro, et al., 2000; Wilcox, King, Brassington, & Ahn,
1999). Future research should focus on systematic evaluation of
which subgroups of individuals should be matched to which program (human vs. automated advice vs. a combination of the two
program types) to optimize sustained behavior change in a
resource-efficient manner, as well expanding the exploration of
automated counseling delivery systems to more diverse, underserved populations.
