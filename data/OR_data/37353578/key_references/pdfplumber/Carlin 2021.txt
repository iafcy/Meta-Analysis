Abstract
Background: Intelligent personal assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become increasingly integrated into
the home setting and, therefore, may facilitate behavior change via novel interactions or as an adjunct to conventional interventions.
However, little is currently known about their potential role in this context.
Objective: This feasibility study aims to develop the Intelligent Personal Assistant Project (IPAP) and assess the acceptability
and feasibility of this technology for promoting and maintaining physical activity and other health-related behaviors in both
parents and children.
Methods: This pilot feasibility study was conducted in 2 phases. For phase 1, families who were attending a community-based
weight management project were invited to participate, whereas phase 2 recruited families not currently receiving any additional
intervention. Families were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (received a smart speaker for use in the family
home) or the control group. The IPAP intervention aimed to promote positive health behaviors in the family setting through
utilization of the functions of a smart speaker and its linked intelligent personal assistant. Data were collected on recruitment,
retention, outcome measures, intervention acceptability, device interactions, and usage.
Results: In total, 26 families with at least one child aged 5 to 12 years were recruited, with 23 families retained at follow-up.
Across phase 1 of the intervention, families interacted with the intelligent personal assistant a total of 65 times. Although device
interactions across phase 2 of the intervention were much higher (312 times), only 10.9% (34/312) of interactions were coded as
relevant (related to diet, physical activity or well-being). Focus groups highlighted that the families found the devices acceptable
and easy to use and felt that the prompts or reminders were useful in prompting healthier behaviors. Some further intervention
refinements in relation to the timing of prompts and integrating feedback alongside the devices were suggested by families.
Conclusions: Using intelligent personal assistants to deliver health-related messages and information within the home is feasible,
with high levels of engagement reported by participating families. This novel feasibility study highlights important methodological
considerations that should inform future trials testing the effectiveness of intelligent personal assistants in promoting positive
health-related behaviors.

Subheading Supporting quotes
Findings related to intervention delivery
Device setup “It was easy to set up and easy to use. Quite interesting but, and the prompts were very good.” [Family 1,
female]
Prompts or reminders from the re- • “We got a prompt, quick do 10 sit ups, and I’m like come on children, everyone on the floor, let’s do
search team it! It was some craic [fun] like, and everybody just downed the phones and going to do that challenge.
They loved it.” [Family 3, female]
• “The whole jist of it was brilliant, like the wee prompts it tells you...try this or try that, you know it’s
just planting that wee seed in your head and when that wee seed’s planted, obviously you are gonna
try aren’t you, so I think it is a great thing.” [Family 2, female]
Using other device features • “...the easy access to the workouts so that you could just do it at a time whenever it suited you.”
[Family 6, female]
• “There were a couple of occasions where we asked Alexa for a healthy recipe to make something so
we made a chilli one day and we asked Alexa for a recipe ‘cos we were prompted by the device about,
you know, healthy, eating healthily and stuff...” [Family 5, male]
• “[Child name] was new-fangled with it, she was more into the music in it, bopping about but it got
her active too, she was asking me how to do this, and will you do this ‘Flossing’...it was good from
that point of view you know.” [Family 2, female]
• “Even her homeworks, she was going out and asking, she was asking me how to spell this, I said ask
Alexa, just to get her doing things for herself.” [Family 3, male]
Overall device usage • “We probably could have utilised it much more but it’s just the pure fact if we had more time. Erm,
and the fact that we were away from it all day long and then we came in, in the evening, it’s usually
kind of a race, get the dinner made and...” [Family 6, female]
• “...but after, like, a week or so they kind of almost forgot it was there and maybe that was our fault,
we didn’t encourage them to use it as much, erm, but the prompts I think were a good idea.” [Family
5, male]
Findings related to intervention optimization
Timing of prompts or reminders • “I think there was a couple of technical glitches where the timing wasn’t right because we didn’t seem
to get the prompts and we used Alexa a lot like, we do ask a lot of questions and stuff but, erm, it
didn’t seem to prompt us; maybe we were out at the time.” [Family 4, male]
• “You know, if we weren’t at home..., I don’t know how many prompts there were.” [Family 7, female]
Lack of feedback provided • “...but what it would say to me, ‘Have you had your five a day?’Do I shout back, ‘Yes,’or, ‘Alexa,
yeah,’I don’t know what way to answer...” [Family 7, female]
• “If you had to log what you did, you know, because it’s fair enough, erm, you could say, ‘Right, go
for a family walk,’but you know, then they come back and say, ‘Well how many kilometres did you
do?’or whatever...to close the loop.”[Family 6, female]
Concerns • “I just worry about that whole side of technology, erm, never mind Alexa but all social media, erm,
in terms of how, how that can be utilised against them and I suppose that’s a worrying thing for me
as a parent...” [Family 6, female]
• “I think if you find the right balance where, you know, I don’t like the idea of my kids being constantly
engaged to technology but I can see the benefit of, of that via a prompt or something like that but, you
know, I wouldn’t want them to be constantly going to Alexa...” [Family 3, male]
Increasing device usage • “You know, I think they would maybe be set challenges to do because I think if they’ve, just can get
an app and do so much, I’m not sure that they’ll benefit from it.” [Family 6, female]
• “I think if it was maybe a wee bit more personalised...I don’t actually know what I was supposed to
be doing with Alexa, you know...and maybe it was in the documentation somewhere, maybe there was
a letter written somewhere that I didn’t see, that I didn’t read.” [Family 7, female]
