Abstract
Objective The present nonrandomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptabil-
ity,andpreliminaryefficacyofatailoredtextmessageinterventionforincreasingadolescentphysi-
calactivity,ascomparedwithpassivemonitoring.Methods Fortyadolescents(13–18yearsold)
received either a tailored text messaging intervention (Network Underwritten Dynamic Goals
Engine [NUDGE]; N¼20), or participated in an attention-control condition (N¼20), for 20days.
Physicalactivitywasmeasuredforallparticipantsviacontinuousaccelerometry.Frequencyanaly-
seswere conducted on program usageand satisfactionratings to evaluate feasibility and accept-
ability, and multilevel models were used to evaluate the efficacy hypotheses. Results The vast
majority of participants (90%) reported being very or mostly satisfied with the NUDGE program
andratedtheirenjoymentasaboveaverage.Theinterventiongroupwasestimatedtospendanav-
erage of 20.84 more minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity relative to the
attention-controlgroup(b¼20.84,SE¼8.19).Exploratoryanalysesrevealedthattheintervention

was not significant due to the large variability in sedentary time (b ¼ (cid:2)81.98, SE ¼ 46.86).
Conclusions TheNUDGEtailoredtextmessaginginterventionwasfeasible,acceptable,andef-
ficacious in increasing physical activity in this sample. Findings warrant additional evaluation of
NUDGE as both a standalone physical activity intervention or as part of a multicomponent
package.

and 45min”). If users exceeded 60min of self-
reported exercise, the feedback message was modified
tocongratulate the user on their healthy level of exer-
cise (e.g., “This is fantastic! You met your goal! You
exercised a healthy amount! Let’s set a new goal be-
