Abstract
Background: The rising incidence of chronic diseases is a growing concern, especially in Singapore, which is one of the
high-income countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes. Interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes have
been proven to be effective in reducing the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, but their in-person delivery may not be feasible
on a large scale. Novel technologies such as conversational agents are a potential alternative for delivering behavioral interventions
that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes to the public.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using a conversational agent promoting healthy
lifestyle behavior changes in the general population in Singapore.
Methods: We performed a web-based, single-arm feasibility study. The participants were recruited through Facebook over 4
weeks. The Facebook Messenger conversational agent was used to deliver the intervention. The conversations focused on diet,
exercise, sleep, and stress and aimed to promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes and improve the participants’knowledge of
diabetes. Messages were sent to the participants four times a week (once for each of the 4 topics of focus) for 4 weeks. We assessed
the feasibility of recruitment, defined as at least 75% (150/200) of our target sample of 200 participants in 4 weeks, as well as
retention, defined as 33% (66/200) of the recruited sample completing the study. We also assessed the participants’satisfaction
with, and usability of, the conversational agent. In addition, we performed baseline and follow-up assessments of quality of life,
diabetes knowledge and risk perception, diet, exercise, sleep, and stress.
Results: We recruited 37.5% (75/200) of the target sample size in 1 month. Of the 75 eligible participants, 60 (80%) provided
digital informed consent and completed baseline assessments. Of these 60 participants, 56 (93%) followed the study through till
completion. Retention was high at 93% (56/60), along with engagement, denoted by 50% (30/60) of the participants communicating
with the conversational agent at each interaction. Acceptability, usability, and satisfaction were generally high. Preliminary
efficacy of the intervention showed no definitive improvements in health-related behavior.
Conclusions: The delivery of a conversational agent for healthy lifestyle behavior change through Facebook Messenger was
feasible and acceptable. We were unable to recruit our planned sample solely using the free options in Facebook. However,
participant retention and conversational agent engagement rates were high. Our findings provide important insights to inform the
design of a future randomized controlled trial.
