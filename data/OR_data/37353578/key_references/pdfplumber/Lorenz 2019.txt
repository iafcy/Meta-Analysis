Introduction
Insomnia has become a major public health concern, with far-reaching consequences for
the health and well-being of affected people. In Western countries, sleep complaints are
reported by one-third of the adult population, and 6–10% meet the diagnostic criteria for
insomniadisorder(Ohayon,2011).Negativeconsequencesofinsomniaarediverseandinclude
daytimefatigue,reduceddaytimeperformance,moodimpairments,physicalcomplaints,and
neuropsychological consequences such as difficulties with concentration and memory (Katz
and McHorney, 2002; Léger et al., 2002). Moreover, evidence shows that insomnia often
precipitates, exacerbates or prolongs a broad range of medical complaints such as mental
or physical illnesses (Baglioni et al., 2010, 2011; Fernandez-Mendoza and Vgontzas, 2013;
Pigeonetal.,2012;RothandRoehrs,2003;Spiegelhalderetal.,2012).
Cognitivebehaviouraltherapyforinsomnia(CBT-I)isaneffectivetreatmentwithmoderate
tolargeeffectsonmeasuresofsleepcontinuityandonsubjectiveinsomniaseverityingeneral
(Irwinetal.,2006;Morinetal.,2009;Traueretal.,2015;VanStratenetal.,2017).Despitethe
factthatevidence-basedtreatmentsexistanddespitethenegativeimpactsofsleepdisturbances,
insomnia often remains unrecognized and untreated (Morin et al., 2006b). When insomnia
symptoms are reported to professionals (usually to a primary care physician), treatment is
normallylimitedtopharmacotherapyeventhoughhypnoticmedicationscanhavesevereside
effects(Kripkeetal.,2002).
In recent years, scalable and low-threshold internet-based self-help treatments have been
developedforaddressingabroadrangeofmentaldisordersandbehaviouralproblems.Most
internet-based treatmentstargetdisorder-specificperpetuating factors,suchasdysfunctional

High effect sizes on the primary outcome (sleep efficiency) were found when the treatment
groupwascomparedwithbothcontrolgroups.
Nevertheless,noneofthe11RCTsincludedinthemeta-analysisreportedlong-termfollow-
updata.Onlyonerecentlypublishedtrialreported12-monthfollow-updataofanonlineCBT-I
intervention(indicatingenduringeffects;Ritterbandetal.,2017).Theinterventionwasafully
automated, interactive and tailored web-based treatment called SHUTi that included sleep
restriction,stimuluscontrol,cognitiverestructuring,sleephygieneandrelapseprevention.
Although treatment effects seem substantial in online CBT-I, it has remained unclear if
theyareequivalenttotraditionalface-to-faceapproaches.Tworecentstudiescomparedonline
CBT-IagainstaCBT-Iprogrammedeliveredface-to-face,andfoundconflictingresults:Lancee
et al. (2016) found that a face-to-face CBT-I treatment was superior to an online CBT-I
intervention,whereasBlometal.(2015)foundthattheironlineCBT-Iinterventionwasnon-
inferior,comparedwithaface-to-facetreatmentgroup.
Furthermore, it remains unclear which perpetuating factors that are hypothesized in
theoreticalmodelsofinsomniaaresuccessfullytargetedinonlineinterventions.Conventional
CBT-I, delivered face-to-face, mainly includes psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, stimulus
control, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques and cognitive restructuring of unhelpful
thoughtsandbeliefsaboutsleep(Morin,2006).Theeffectsofthebehaviouralcomponentsof
CBT-I(i.e.stimuluscontrolandsleeprestriction)arewellestablished(Morinetal.,2006a).
Moreover,evidenceshowsthatcognitionsarealsoanimportanttargetforinterventions(Harvey
et al., 2007). Compared with healthy subjects, insomnia patients report more dysfunctional
thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep (Morin et al., 1993), and such dysfunctional
cognitionsplayanimportantroleintheoreticalmodelsofinsomnia(Espie,2002;Harvey,2002;
LundhandBroman,2000).Harvey(2002)suggeststhatattentionalandperceptualprocesses,
togetherwithmaladaptivebeliefsandbehaviour,contributetotheperpetuationofinsomnia.
Accordingtothismodel,attentionalprocessesincludethemonitoringofinternalandexternal
sleep-related threats, such as indicators of not getting enough sleep and of not functioning
well during the day. Harvey (2002) postulates that these sleep-related threats lead to safety
behaviours. Safety behaviours are maladaptive coping strategies (e.g. staying in bed longer
thanusual)thatareexecutedtoavoidthenegativeconsequencesofpoorsleep.Harveyetal.
(2007) suggest that such safety behaviours can be problematic for two reasons: first, safety
behavioursmaypreventpatientsfromexperiencinganon-confirmationofthefearednegative
consequence, and second, such behaviours may increase the probability that the anticipated
negativeconsequencesoccur.
Cognitive and attentional biases as well as safety behaviours can be addressed and
successfullyalteredinconventional,face-to-faceCBT-I(e.g.Harveyetal.,2007).However,
only a few studies have investigated whether cognitions and safety behaviours can be
successfully altered in online interventions as well. Lancee et al. (2015) found that
dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and safety behaviours were reduced after a guided online
intervention for the treatment of insomnia. However, evidence on the successful delivery of
cognitivetechniquesisscarce,particularlywithrespecttounguidedinternet-basedtreatments.

electronically via a link to the online questionnaires sent to participants’ e-mail addresses.

wasregisteredatClinicaltrials.govNCT02629913andSwissNationalClinicalTrialsPortal.
Measures
The ISI (Bastien et al., 2001) was used as the primary outcome measure. This self-report
questionnaire consists of seven items scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores
indicatingahigherdegreeofsymptomsandperceivedimpactofsleepdifficulties.Itemsare
summedtoatotalscorerangingfrom0to28.Atotalscoreof0to7isdefinedasnormal,8to

insomnia(Bastienetal.,2001).
In the treatment group a sleep diary was used to measure process parameters. The sleep
diaryconsistedofamorningandeveningreport.Themorningreportfollowedtheguidelines
of asleep expert consensus on sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012). The evening reportwas a
slightlyadaptedversionoftheshorteveningreportoftheGermanSocietyofSleepMedicine
(Liendl and Hoffmann, 1999). Participants received e-mail reminders if they did not fill in
the sleep diary. Moreover, sleep diary completion was automatically checked whenever the
participantloggedintotheprogram,andparticipantscouldonlycontinuetheonlinetreatment
after adding missing reports for the prior three days. The following main parameters were
calculatedfromthemorningreportofthesleepdiary:sleeponsetlatency(SOL),wakeafter
sleeponset(WASO),sleepefficiency(SE)andtotalsleeptime(TST).Intheeveningreport,
participants rated ‘overall sleep restfulness’ (restfulness) and ‘overall daytime performance’
(daytimeperformance)onascalefrom0to100.
TheAnxietyandPreoccupationaboutSleepQuestionnaire(APSQ;TangandHarvey,2004)
was used to measure sleep-related cognitions. This instrument consists of 10 statements,
and participants rate their agreement with each statement on a 10-point scale. The Sleep-
related Behaviours Questionnaire (SRBQ; Ree and Harvey, 2004) was used to measure
safety behaviour. The questionnaire consists of 32 items that assess insomnia-related safety
behaviours. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, adding to a sum score from 0 to 128.
Finally,toassesssecondarysymptoms,twowell-establishedquestionnaireswereadministered:
the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) for depression, and the Brief
SymptomInventory18(BSI-18;Derogatis,2001),usingonlythesubscalessomatization(BSI-

Discussion
In this study, an unguided internet-based self-help intervention for insomnia (CBT-I) was
compared with a waitlist control group. On the primary endpoint of self-reported insomnia
severity,largebetween-andwithin-treatmentgroupeffectsizesandasignificantinteraction
between the treatment and control group were observed, indicating a marked improvement
oninsomniaseverityforthetreatmentgroupcomparedwiththecontrolgroup.Thetreatment
effectwasstableoveralongfollow-upperiod(12months).Thisoutcomeappearscomparable
to therapist-delivered CBT-I (Riemann and Perlis, 2009) and to similar unguided CBT-I
interventions (Espie et al., 2012; Ritterband et al., 2009). This study adds evidence to the
literatureonunguidedinternetinterventionsforinsomniaanddemonstratesthatinternet-based
CBT-Icanhavesubstantiallong-termeffectsoninsomniaseverity.
Interestingly,attritionrateswereextremelylowinthisstudy(6–7%)comparedwithother
studies,inwhichrateswere14–48%(Lanceeetal.,2012,2015).Thus,deliveringCBT-Iwitha

Takingacloserlookonsecondaryoutcomeparameters,itwasremarkablethattheanxiety
score of the BSI-18 did not change significantly from pre- to post-assessment, even though
insomnia symptoms were already drastically reduced at post-assessment. There was a trend
towardsasignificanteffectatfollow-upassessment,buttheconfidenceintervalstillincluded0
at the lower end (–0.18 to 0.94). Other studies had already revealed a close link between
insomnia and anxiety disorder and highlighted a bidirectional association between these
conditions (Jansson-Fröjmark and Lindblom, 2008). Therefore, it can be assumed that the
non-significanteffectcouldbeduetothesmallsamplesize,reflectingapowerproblem.

Furthermore, in line with previous studies, we found a substantial effect on depression
symptoms.ThesymptomimprovementmeasuredwiththeBDI-IIwassignificantlystronger
in the intervention group compared with the control group. The same pattern occurred for
the somatization score of the BSI. Remarkably, the treatment effect size on depression was
still large at the 12-month follow-up assessment, indicating long-lasting transfer effects of
internet-basedCBT-Iondepression.
Apart from testing the effectiveness of the internet-based self-help program, this study
examined to what extent cognitions can be successfully altered with an unguided self-help
intervention.Theanalysesshowedasignificantdecreaseofsleep-relatedworriesandfearsin

Limitations
Severallimitationsofthestudymustbementioned.First,thesmallsamplesizedidnotallow
formoresophisticatedanalysisforpowerreasons.Withabiggersample,itwouldhavebeen
possibletodivideusersintosub-samplesanddetectpossibleoutcomemediatorsforthem(e.g.
improvementsinsafetybehavioursorsleep-relatedcognitions).Second,thewaitlistcontrol-
group did not have access to the sleep diary; this made it impossible to test for interaction
effects on sleep diary parameters. Third, we did not include objective measurements (e.g.
polysomnography) as outcome parameters due to the cost of such procedures. However, it
should be noted that subjective measurements are standard in most RCTs for insomnia, and
especiallyfromthepatient’spointofviewitisuncertainwhetherobjectivesleepparameters
