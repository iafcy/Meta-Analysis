Abstract
Background: Poor diet and physical inactivity are leading modifiable causes of death and disease. Advances in artificial
intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized
support at scale.
Objective: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of
physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach.
Methods: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide, Australia, from March to August 2019. Participants
were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years, recruited through news stories, social media posts, and flyers. The
program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot, Paola, who guided participants through a computer-based individualized
introductory session, weekly check-ins, and goal setting, and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin
Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps, a website with educational materials and recipes, and a printed diet and activity log sheet.
Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity
and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure.
Results: Over 4 weeks, 99 potential participants registered expressions of interest, with 81 of those screened meeting eligibility
criteria. Participants completed a mean of 109.8 (95% CI 1.9-217.7) more minutes of physical activity at week 12 compared with
baseline. Mediterranean diet scores increased from a mean of 3.8 out of 14 at baseline, to 9.6 at 12 weeks (mean improvement
5.7 points, 95% CI 4.2-7.3). After 12 weeks, participants lost an average 1.3 kg (95% CI –0.1 to –2.5 kg) and 2.1 cm from their
waist circumference (95% CI –3.5 to –0.7 cm). There were no significant changes in blood pressure. Feasibility was excellent in
terms of recruitment, retention (90% at 12 weeks), and safety (no adverse events).
Conclusions: An artificially intelligent virtual assistant-led lifestyle-modification intervention was feasible and achieved
measurable improvements in physical activity, diet, and body composition at 12 weeks. Future research examining artificially
intelligent interventions at scale, and for other health purposes, is warranted.
