Abstract
Objective—An automated health counselor agent was designed to promote both physical activity
and fruit and vegetable consumption through a series of simulated conversations with users on
their home computers.
Methods—The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact
intervention comparing: a) physical activity; b) fruit and vegetable consumption; c) both
interventions; and d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily
pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables was assessed using the NIH/NCI self-
report Fruit and Vegetable Scan.
Results—Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average
compared to the control group, while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined
intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group
consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group, and those in
the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group.
Conclusion—Automated health intervention software designed for efficient re-use is effective at
changing health behavior.
Practice Implications—Automated health behavior change interventions can be designed to
facilitate translation and adaptation across multiple behaviors.

1 Introduction
Behavioral health problems rarely occur in isolation. Managing chronic conditions such as
diabetes, prevention of conditions such as cancers, and addressing overweight and obesity,
all require constellations of behaviors to be modified in parallel. To date, most automated
health behavior change interventions are designed to only address a single behavior. One
barrier to implementation of multi-behavior change interventions is simply the increased
scope and complexity of building the individual interventions at the same time. The
complexity of design and test of such automated systems increases exponentially with the
number of behaviors targeted, since users may have any combination of the conditions
addressed.
We have undertaken the development of a health behavior change counseling dialogue
system that models the theory-driven therapeutic planning processes of a human health
advisor during a counseling session. Importantly, the software is designed to be re-usable, so
that new or derivative interventions can be implemented with minimal effort, thus
facilitating the design of multi-behavior change interventions [1]. Re-use is facilitated by
representing knowledge about health behavior change theory, constructs, and atomic
intervention actions in a computational ontology. An ontology is a taxonomic description of
the concepts in an application domain and the relationships among them. In addition to
facilitating re-use, computational ontologies also provide a formalism that can facilitate
clarification and description of the fundamental concepts in a domain through consensus of
experts and can facilitate interchange of information among diverse systems by describing,
at various levels of detail, the kinds of data entities that can be exchanged, independent of
the particular names the entities are given in each system.
We have tested this approach by implementing automated interventions for physical activity
and fruit and vegetable consumption. Participation in moderate amounts of physical activity
has important health benefits, including beneficial effects on risk factors for disease,
disability, and mortality [2–6], yet a substantial proportion of the U.S. adult population
remain underactive or sedentary [2]. Fruit and vegetable consumption plays a protective role
in a large number of epithelial cancers [7,8], and is associated with reduced risk for heart
disease, stroke, and hypertension [9–15], yet only 23% of American adults meet the (year
2000) recommendation to consume five or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day
[16,17].
The interventions we implemented are eclectic, based on elements from the transtheoretical
model, motivational interviewing, and social cognitive theory [1,18–21]. There are several
approaches to targeting multiple behaviors in one intervention. The behaviors can be
targeted in sequence, moving from one to the next once a completion criterion is reached
(e.g., this could be a target stage of change, a specified time duration, or a specified number
of user-system interactions, after which the system’s educational content is exhausted). The
behaviors can also be targeted in parallel, with all or some behaviors addressed in every
interaction, or addressed in alternating interactions over time. Our approach roughly follows
the latter one: following a few introductory conversations, the agent alternates topics so that
it focuses a conversation on physical activity counseling on one day, then focuses on diet

counseling the next, then repeats the sequence through the end of the intervention. However,
even when one behavior is focused on for counseling (e.g., involving problem solving,
homework assignment or education), a brief discussion of the other behavior was provided,
involving review of progress and re-negotiation of short-term behavioral goals. Further,
when users were in the contemplation stage of change the system spent additional sessions
focusing on the target behavior, under the assumption that this was needed to help them get
started on goal-setting program.
1.1 Intervention Design
The knowledge (“Artificial Intelligence”) in the system is encoded using two fundamentally
different representations: declarative facts about the world and procedures the agent can
follow during its dialog with users.
Declarative facts are themselves represented in two fundamentally different ways:
epistemological knowledge about the kinds of things in the world that the agent can reason
about—represented in the ontology (using OWL [22])—and specific facts about the specific
behavior change theories and techniques the agent can use, and about a particular user the
agent is talking to (using RDF [23]). The ontology encodes dictionary-like knowledge, such
as the fact that the “Actions” the agent can take can be either “Therapeutic Actions” or
“Non-therapeutic Actions” (such as saying “Hello!” to the user), and that the Therapeutic
Actions available to the agent include “Therapeutic Dialog Actions” (talk therapy) and
“Homework Actions” (homework assignments the user is asked to do outside of the agent
counseling sessions). Examples of specific facts would be that asking the user to “Try
looking for information about exercise in newspapers and magazines.” is an example of a
Homework Action for physical activity promotion, that this action is appropriate for users in
the Contemplation stage of change, and that the specific user the agent is talking to right
now is in Contemplation.
Procedural knowledge is encoded in a hierarchical task decomposition language (CEA-2018
[24]), that is based on a theory of the structure of dialog [25]. CEA2018 represents agent
goals, and actions that the agent and the user can take during a given dialog, and various
relationships that hold among these entities. For example, initial goals of the agent may be to
hold a counseling dialog with a user with the intention of increasing a health behavior. This
goal can be matched to a “recipe” that describes one way the agent can satisfy the goal, for
example by initiating a dialog, greeting the user, conducting some “small talk”, conducting
the core part of the behavior change counseling, saying farewell to the user, and terminating
the conversation, in that order. Each of these steps can give rise to more refined goals that
are matched to other recipes. For example, the core counseling dialog for a user in the
Action stage of change may consist of reviewing their progress since the last conversation,
conducting a problem solving dialog about specific barriers to change, and setting goals as a
new homework assignment. Ultimately, the actions in the most refined recipes will consist
of specific things the agent and user can say in the conversation.
Note that much of the structure of a counseling conversation, and much of the declarative
knowledge, required by a counseling agent can be described independent of a specific
behavior. The above examples work for either physical activity or fruit and vegetable
promotion.
The declarative and procedural knowledge is interpreted and turned into an interactive
conversation for a particular user by a dialog interpreter (DTask [26]). Together, the
ontology and the procedural knowledge are a unique new set of AI methods for organizing
how an agent can counsel a user for a series of health behavior change conversations. Figure
1 shows an excerpt of a conversation generated using this approach.

During the development of our intervention we first designed and implemented the physical
activity promotion part of the system, then extended it to also promote fruit and vegetable
consumption. Through the use of the knowledge representations described above we were
able to build the second system re-using 98% of the actions, 98% of the recipes, and 14% of
the agent utterances, representing 22% re-use by source lines of code. The second system
was built in 9% of the calendar time and 4% of the person hours required to develop the
initial exercise promotion system [1].
1.2 Evaluation Study
In the rest of this paper, we describe the results of a randomized pilot study designed to
provide preliminary evaluation of three behavioral interventions developed using the
approach described above. We have used the ontology-based design approach to develop an
animated conversational agent that plays the role of a health counselor that can promote both
physical activity (ACT) and fruit and vegetable consumption (DIET) through a series of
simulated conversations with users on their home computers (Figure 2). This approach and
agent were evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention
comparing: a) ACT; b) DIET; c) ACT+DIET (both interventions); and d) CONTROL (a
control group provided only with pedometers for tracking physical activity). The behavioral
goal of the ACT system is to motivate sedentary subjects to perform the minimum
recommended amount of physical activity: 30 minutes per day of moderate or greater
activity [27,28]. The behavioral goal of the DIET system is to motivate subjects who are not
regularly eating at least 4-1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables a day to reach this level [28]. The
goal of the ACT+DIET system is to achieve both behavioral goals.
The pilot study has the following hypotheses.
• H1. Subjects receiving ACT will significantly increase their physical activity (PA)
behavior, compared to non-intervention CONTROL subjects.
• H2. Subjects receiving DIET will significantly increase their intake of fruits and
vegetables compared to non-intervention CONTROL subjects.
• H3. Subjects receiving ACT+DIET will significantly increase their PA behavior
compared to non-intervention CONTROL subjects.
• H4. Subjects receiving ACT+DIET will significantly increase their intake of fruits
and vegetables compared to non-intervention CONTROL subjects.
2 Methods
Subjects in the intervention groups accessed the system remotely over the Internet from their
home computers on a daily basis during the two-month intervention period. Demographics
and baseline values for outcome measures were collected at the start of the intervention
period (T ); outcome measures were assessed a second time, along with usability
0
assessments and semi-structured interviews, at the end of the intervention period (T ). All
1
participants were provided with pedometers and instructed to wear them daily and upload
their steps to a server on a weekly basis.
The study was approved by the Northeastern University IRB, and study participants were
compensated a fixed amount.
2.1 Measures
Physical activity was assessed at T and T using the International Physical Activity
0 1
Questionnaire (IPAQ), which has been validated in several prior studies[29,30]. Steps

walked was objectively assessed using Omron HJ-720ITC pedometers given to all study
participants. While the pedometer assess walking specifically, the IPAQ assesses overall
physical activity. Servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed at T and T using the NIH/
0 1
NCI Fruit and Vegetable Scan (FVS) [31]. The FVS is a ten-item instrument that includes
assessment of portion size.
Participants were weighed at T and T using a calibrated scale.
0 1
Satisfaction was assessed via three single scale measure items (Table 4).
2.2 Recruitment & Eligibility
Subjects were recruited from an online job posting site. Eligibility criteria for this study
included: 1) age 18 or older; 2) have a home computer with Internet connection; 3) are able
to walk unaided; 4) understand spoken and written English; and 5) are in Precontemplation
or Contemplation Stages of Change with respect to both (a) the current DHHS/ACSM
guidelines for PA (30 minutes a day of moderate-or-greater intensity PA on five or more
days per week) [27,32]; and (b) current DHHS guidelines for daily consumption of fruits
and vegetables (4-1/2 cups a day)[28]. Exclusionary criteria include: 1) have a medical
condition that would make increasing PA level a health risk, assessed using the PA
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)[33]; 2) are on a prescribed diet; and 3) have any other
member of the household enrolled in the study.
2.3 Procedure
Following screening, consent, and baseline measurements in our laboratory, participants
were provided with software to install on their home computer and given a brief tutorial on
its use. Participants in the CONTROL group used their software only to upload their
pedometer steps; participants in all other groups were also instructed how to interact with
the conversational agent, and asked to conduct one conversation per day with the agent at
home. All participants were provided with pedometers and instructed in their use. Following
this, individuals participated in the study from home for the next two months. At the end of
this time, participants returned to our laboratory to collect final outcome measures and
engage in a semi-structured interview about their experience.
3 Results
One hundred and twenty-two (122) participants were enrolled into the study and randomized
among the four study arms, of which 113 (93%) completed the final two-month T1
assessment. Figure 3 shows the flow of participants in the study.
Table 1 shows baseline demographics of study participants, contrasting those in each arm of
the study. Overall, participants ranged in age from 21 to 69 years old (mean 33.0 +/− 12.6)
were 61% female, predominately white (52%) and Asian (33%), single and had some
college education. Body mass index (BMI) ranged from 18.8 to 46.4 (mean 27.8).
3.1 Longitudinal Analysis of Daily Pedometer Steps
Figure 4 shows pedometer steps by study participants, averaged per 15 day interval, by
study group. We assume that any day in which less than 100 steps are recorded means that
the participant did not wear the pedometer. We treat the step counts for this day as missing
data. We fit a mixed-effect model including effect of study day (time), study condition, and
an interaction. This model assumes a simple linear trend: the main effect of condition is the
difference in intercepts between conditions, while the interaction is the difference in slopes.
We assume here that the differences between groups in the first time period is a result of

differences in baseline walking behavior between the groups prior to the start of the study
(e.g., the effects of poor randomization), and thus we focus our analysis on significant
changes in step counts over the duration of the study. A series of likelihood-ratio tests
against reduced models indicates that the interaction effect is significant, but neither main
effect is significant. The full model is shown in Table 2. Results indicate that the ACT group
increases their daily walking faster than CONTROL, but the DIET group is slower, and the
ACT+DIET group is somewhere in the middle. Thus, there is some evidence that multiple
interventions might interfere with each other.
3.2 International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)
The IPAQ data is highly skewed, and is transformed (Yeo-Johnson transformation) prior to
analysis. A one-way ANOVA was used with the transformed IPAQ scores as the dependent
variable, and study condition as the independent variable. There are no significant
differences among conditions, F(3,107)=1.07, p=0.367.
3.3 Fruit & Vegetable Consumption (FVS)
Figure 5 shows mean change in FVS scores (T1 – T0) by study condition.
Model selection indicated that the simplest model is best, in which baseline FVS alone is
used as a covariate in an ANCOVA, with final FVS as the dependent measure and study
condition as the independent variable (Table 3). Results show a significant difference by
condition, F(3,103)=4.52, p=0.005, with the DIET intervention doing the best. A Tukey
post-hoc analysis indicates that the only significant pairwise difference, adjusting for
multiple comparisons, is DIET vs. CONTROL, with ACT+DIET vs. CONTROL near
significant.
3.4 Weight
Weight changed little for participants over the two months of the study, with no significant
differences among groups, F(3,105)=1.09, p=0.374.
3.5 Satisfaction
Self-report satisfaction scores are shown in Table 4. There were no significant differences
among the three intervention groups on these measures.
3.6 Qualitative Results
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from the ACT, DIET, and
ACT+DIET groups. Participant responses to semi-structured interview questions were
transcribed from the videotape and common themes were identified [34].
When asked what they like best about the agent Karen (the conversational agent in Figure
2), 7 people (35%) said that they like Karen because she was nice, personal, and was
someone they could relate to, and four people (20%) said that they liked how Karen would
show them their progress with the steps chart every time they had a conversation with her.
Four people (20%) said that they like Karen because she would not discipline them if they
did not meet a goal or log onto the system, while three people said that they liked being held
accountable by Karen.
When asked if the agent helped them to achieve their goals, 10 people (50%) agreed that the
agent did help (e.g., “I think it moved me closer to eating better. I am more motivated and I
am thinking more about trying to get 5 servings of fruits and veggies every day.”). Four
people (20%) said they believed it was a combination of using the pedometer and talking to

Karen that helped them reach their goals. When asked what about the agent helped them the
most, 3 people said that the constant reminder by Karen was what helped them the most.
4 Discussion and Conclusion
Overall, the four study hypotheses received mixed support. The first hypothesis (H1), that
subjects receiving ACT will significantly increase their PA, compared to non-intervention
CONTROL subjects, received partial support. Based on analysis of pedometer steps,
participants in the ACT group tended to increase their daily walking faster than CONTROL.
However, there were no significant differences in physical activity based on self-report
IPAQ scores.
The second hypothesis (H2), that subjects receiving DIET will significantly increase their
intake of fruits and vegetables compared to non-intervention CONTROL subjects, received
strong support through significant increase in fruit and vegetable consumption (as measured
by the FVS) for the DIET group compared to CONTROL. The hypothesis that subjects
receiving ACT+DIET will significantly increase their PA behavior compared to non-
intervention CONTROL subjects (H3), received no support, based on either analysis of
pedometer steps or IPAQ scores. The final hypothesis (H4), that subjects receiving ACT
+DIET will significantly increase their intake of fruits and vegetables compared to non-
intervention CONTROL subjects, received marginal support: differences between ACT
+DIET and CONTROL participants on FVS scores were in the hypothesized direction and
trending towards significance.
4.1 Discussion
The evaluation study demonstrated that, while the individual health behavior change
interventions performed as expected—with ACT resulting in superior walking behavior and
DIET resulting in improved fruit and vegetable consumption, both relative to a non-
intervention control group—the combined, multi-behavior change intervention did not result
in significant improvements relative to controls. There are several possible reasons for this.
One possible explanation is that our approach to intervening on multiple behaviors is to
alternate which behavior was discussed on sequential logins, thus participants in the ACT
+DIET group received half the number of physical activity counseling sessions as those in
ACT and half the number of diet counseling sessions as those in DIET. Another possibility
is that the two interventions actually interfered with each other, either on a psychological
level (e.g., through distraction) or an instrumental level (e.g., taking more time to shop for
and prepare fruit and vegetable dishes may have decreased time available for physical
activity). Another explanation is that the combined intervention simply had smaller effect
sizes compared to the individual behavior interventions, requiring more participants to reach
significance. The trends in Figure 4 may also imply that the PA intervention was simply
most effective for sedentary individuals (those with the lowest baseline step counts).
We have begun exploring solutions to address the problem of perceived repetitiveness
mentioned by several participants [35]. In one study, we confirmed that simply increasing
superficial linguistic and graphical variability during daily health behavior change
counseling sessions with an automated coach agent leads to greater self-reported desire to
continue using the system, as well as a significant increase in actual system usage. In a
second study we demonstrated that having the coach agent tell personal “backstories” about
its personal history (as if it were a person) led to significant increases in system usage
compared to an identical agent that told the same stories as if they were about another user,
demonstrating that users were more engaged by a more anthropomorphic agent.

Limitations of our study include the generalizability of our findings, especially given the
very small convenience sample used and the relatively short duration of the intervention. We
also acknowledge that our CONTROL group does not represent a true non-intervention
control, since providing individuals with pedometers alone has been shown to result in
increased physical activity. However, this should make any significant physical activity
results stronger. Finally, we cannot determine whether the differences between groups
during the first 15 days of the study were due to baseline differences or initial reactions to
the study conditions, since we did not measure true pre-intervention baseline behavior.
4.2 Conclusion
Together with our earlier pilot study [1], we have demonstrated that automated health
interventions can be developed using software representations that promote reuse, that the
representations do indeed lend themselves to reuse, and that this approach results in
interventions that are effective at changing health behavior.
4.3 Practice Implications
Adapting a computerized behavioral intervention developed for a research study (or for a
different application) for large-scale deployment by an institution or public health
department typically requires significant modifications to the original system, and these
modifications often represent an insurmountable barrier to dissemination [36]. The use of
open source software, designed using public standards and computational ontologies, with
re-use in mind, significantly lowers the cost and complexity of adapting these systems for
practice.
