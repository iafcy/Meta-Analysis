Abstract
Background: Despite the growing number of mobile health (mHealth) interventions targeting childhood obesity, few studies
have characterized user typologies derived from individuals’patterns of interactions with specific app features (digital phenotypes).
Objective: This study aims to identify digital phenotypes among 214 parent-child dyads who used the Aim2Be mHealth app
as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2019 and 2020, and explores whether participants’characteristics and
health outcomes differed across phenotypes.
Methods: Latent class analysis was used to identify distinct parent and child phenotypes based on their use of the app’s behavioral,
gamified, and social features over 3 months. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes
differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI z scores (zBMI),
diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes.
Results: Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified: socially engaged(35/214, 16.3%), independently engaged(18/214,
8.4%) (sociallyand independently engagedparents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app,
respectively), fully engaged(26/214, 12.1%), partially engaged(32/214, 15%), and unengaged(103/214, 48.1%) users. Married
parents were more likely to be fully engagedthan independently engaged(P=.02) or unengaged(P=.01) users. Socially engaged
parents were older than fully engaged(P=.02) and unengaged(P=.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes
among children: fully engaged (32/214, 15%), partially engaged (61/214, 28.5%), dabblers (42/214, 19.6%), and unengaged
(79/214, 36.9%) users. Fully engagedchildren were younger than dabblers(P=.04) and unengaged(P=.003) children. Dabblers
lived in higher-income households than fully and partially engaged children (P=.03 and P=.047, respectively). Fully engaged
children were more likely to have fully engaged (P<.001) and partially engaged (P<.001) parents than unengaged children.
Compared with unengagedchildren, fullyand partially engagedchildren had decreased total sugar (P=.006 and P=.004, respectively)
and energy intake (P=.03 and P=.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use. Partially engaged children also had decreased
sugary beverage intake compared with unengagedchildren (P=.03). Similarly, children with fully engagedparents had decreased

zBMI, whereas children with unengagedparents had increased zBMI over time (P=.005). Finally, children with independently

(P=.02).
Conclusions: Full parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions. Further research is needed to
understand program design elements that can affect participants’engagement in supporting behavior change.
