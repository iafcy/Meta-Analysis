We estimated all effects in a complete case analysis
using available data only. We conducted sensitivity ana-
lyses for missing data (intention-to-treat analysis) and
for adjustment of covariates of physical activity (ad-
justed intention-to-treat analysis). Covariates included
in all adjusted models were age, gender, baseline step
count, smartphone operating system, and employment.
In addition, we adjusted longitudinal models for linear
time trends and a binary indicator for weekend days. We
investigated time-varying effects of microrandomized
intervention components by adding the interaction be-
tween interventions and day in study (for self-monitoring
prompts) and week in study (for planning exercises) to
the model. To account for missing data, we assumed
missing data to be “missing at random” (MAR) and used
multiple imputation to create 10 complete data sets. We
then fitted models to each complete data set separately
