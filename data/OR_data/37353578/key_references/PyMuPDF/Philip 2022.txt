Abstract: (1) Background: Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide and cognitive
behavioral therapy is the front-line treatment. Digital health technologies have a role to play in
screening and delivering interventions remotely and without the need for human intervention. The
KANOPEE app, which provides a screening and behavioral intervention for insomnia symptoms
through an interaction with a virtual agent, showed encouraging results in previous studies during
and after the COVID-19 lockdown, but has not yet been evaluated in a controlled study. This study
aims at comparing the beneﬁts of KANOPEE, a smartphone application dealing with insomnia
complaints, with another application proposing an electronic sleep diary named “My Sleep Diary”.
The acceptance and potential beneﬁts of these digital solutions are tested in real-life settings (i.e.,
without soliciting human medical resources) and in the general population. (2) Methods: Subjects
were included if they downloaded one of the apps between December 2020 and October 2021,
and were of legal age. Both apps were available on downloading platforms in France. Primary
outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and secondary outcomes were total sleep time (TST),
sleep efﬁciency (SE) and wake time after sleep onset (WASO). (3) Results: A total of 535 users
completed the intervention with KANOPEE and 489 users completed My Sleep Diary, both for 17 days.
KANOPEE users improved their ISI score signiﬁcantly more than sleep diary users (interaction
Time*Group: F(2,2002) = 17.3, p < 0.001). Similar results were found for nocturnal sleep parameters
(TST) (KANOPEE users gained 48 min of sleep after intervention, while My Sleep Diary users
gained only 16 min of sleep), and particularly in the population with moderate to severe initial
sleep complaints (F(4,1980) = 8.9, p < 0.001). Other sleep markers (SE and WASO) were signiﬁcantly
improved in the KANOPEE users compared to the sleep diary ones (p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions:
KANOPEE provides signiﬁcantly greater beneﬁts than an electronic sleep diary regarding reduction
of insomnia complaints and estimated nocturnal sleep characteristics in a self-selected sample of the
general population. Population with the most severe initial ISI score (≥15) beneﬁted the most from
the KANOPEE App compared to ﬁlling up a simple sleep diary.

1. Introduction
Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder. It is present in about 10 to 20% of the
general population [1,2], and is frequently associated with mental conditions such as mood
or anxiety disorders [3]. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has increased the prevalence of
mental disorders [4,5] and insomnia [6,7], conﬁrming how sleep and mental disorders are
closely related.
Most patients suffering from insomniac complaints receive hypnotic drugs, but medi-
cations are not recommended on a long-term basis because of their lack of long-term efﬁcacy
and potentially severe side-effects. The recommended ﬁrst-line treatment for insomnia
disorder in adults is cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT-I) [1]. These usually rely on
multicomponent interventions including sleep hygiene education (e.g., avoiding caffeine
and alcohol before bedtime), stimulus control and time in bed reduction (i.e., instructions
aiming at strengthening the association between bed and sleep). In addition, cognitive inter-
ventions aimed at correcting negative thoughts and beliefs about sleep reinforce adherence
to behavioral recommendations [1,8].
Unfortunately, due to the discrepancy between the huge number of patients needing
treatment and the lack of trained healthcare practitioners, many patients do not have
access to CBT-I. To combat this shortage, which has been accentuated by the COVID-19
crisis, autonomous digital solutions need to be promoted. These solutions, called digital
CBT-I (d-CBT-I), have shown their efﬁcacy in delivering CBT-I [9,10], reducing insomnia
complaints and improving sleep efﬁciency [11–15]. More recently, d-CBT-I have also shown
their beneﬁt in reducing anxiety symptoms and improving psychological well-being [9,12].
Acceptance of d-CBT by users is also a key issue for promoting digital health solutions
in the general population. Interaction with digital solutions can be improved by using
embodied conversational agents, which have demonstrated a high level of acceptance in
patients reporting mental disorders [16]. In 2020, our team launched a free app (KANOPEE)
that is available on Google Play Store and Apple Store. Thanks to repeated interaction
with a virtual companion, the app helps screen insomnia complaints, provides a follow-up
tool (sleep diary) and gives users personalized recommendations regarding sleep hygiene,
stimulus control, the optimization of sleep schedules and physical activity [17].
To date, KANOPEE has been downloaded more than 23,000 times, thus creating a large
cohort followed by our research team. KANOPEE has shown a very good level of acceptance by
users in the general population in a real-life setting [18]. A recently published open single-arm
study of 108 KANOPEE users showed a decrease in insomnia complaints and an improvement
in sleep duration and sleep efficiency [19]. However, the main limitation of that study was
the lack of a controlled condition, precluding any definitive conclusions about whether sleep
improvement is directly attributable to using KANOPEE.
To overcome this limitation, we designed a self-selected (non-randomized) controlled
study comparing KANOPEE users to users of a non-interventional app, My Sleep Diary,
an electronic sleep diary developed by our team and freely available on downloading
platforms in France.
The objective of this study, conducted in a real-life naturalistic setting and offered to the
general population, was to measure the efﬁcacy of KANOPEE, a smartphone application
proposing repeated interactions with a virtual agent to reduce sleep complaints over
17 days compared to another application giving access to an electronic sleep diary only.
Based on the literature and previous studies, we hypothesized that both apps could reduce
insomnia complaints and improve sleep, but that KANOPEE would have a greater impact
on insomnia and sleep quality measures.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design
The study design was a two-group non-randomized controlled trial with self-selection
sampling. The ﬁrst group of subjects downloaded and used KANOPEE, which provided
interactions with a virtual companion to obtain personalized recommendations for improv-

ing sleep over 17 days. A second group of subjects downloaded My Sleep Diary to obtain
access to an electronic sleep diary and a repeated follow-up on insomnia complaints, which
was considered as the control condition (no intervention).
Both apps were developed by our research lab, are downloadable for free on Google
Play Store and Apple Store and are available only in France. A speciﬁc authorization from
Google and Apple was obtained to put our non-proﬁt apps online during the COVID-19
crisis. The study was approved by the ethical committee of University of Bordeaux and
was registered at the US National Institute of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT05074901.
Methods,
results and discussion are described using the CONSORT 2010
reporting guidelines.
2.2. Participants
Targeted communication promoting the usage of both apps to help with monitoring
and regulating sleep was made on social media (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter),
national and regional newspapers and TV, and university and hospital mailing lists, in
order to increase the download rate and reach the most diverse populations. The release of
both apps was in line with government communication about the prevalence of sleep and
mental complaints and as support to increase awareness of the importance of sleep during
the COVID-19 crisis.
From December 2020 to October 2021, subjects were included based on the following
criteria: (1) having downloaded KANOPEE or My Sleep Diary; (2) having completed the
ﬁrst insomnia questionnaire between December 2020 and October 2021; and (3) being of
legal age (aged 18 or older).
Criteria for not participating were: (1) not owning a smartphone; (2) not being located
in France; (3) having completed the ﬁrst insomnia questionnaire outside the inclusion
period; or (4) being younger than age 18.
Recruitment was performed on Google Play Store and Apple Store by downloading
one of the two apps.
Baseline characteristics of users were collected at the registration step after acceptance
of informed consent obtained directly on the apps, in accordance with General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des
libertés (CNIL) requirements.
Both apps collected the users’ information about age (in years), gender (male/female),
educational level (middle school/high school/less than 5 years of university/more than
5 years of university), initial insomnia complaints (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), see later
outcome measure) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4
(PHQ-4)) [20].
All data were collected anonymously and stored on secure servers at University
of Bordeaux.
2.3. Interventions
Users in the intervention condition (KANOPEE) were invited to interact with Louise,
a virtual companion providing screening, follow-up and personalized recommendations to
decrease insomnia complaints.
2.3.1. Screening Interview
Screening consisted of administration of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [21,22]
(Figure 1A), then visual feedback (green/orange/red visual scale) (Figure 1B), and the offer
of completing a sleep diary for one week and then having another interview at that time.
After this screening interview, the sleep diary tab appeared on the bottom of the screen and
users could ﬁll it every day and obtain visual feedback on their sleep (Figure 1C).

2.3.2. Follow-Up Interview
One week later, KANOPEE users were offered another interview with the virtual com-
panion, who provided a summary of sleep diary data, administered the ISI for the second
time, and then gave personalized recommendations based on ISI answers and on sleep
diary data. The recommendations were simple sentences (e.g., “In the morning, expose
yourself to sunlight or to another source of bright light (luminotherapy, screen) to improve
the functioning of your biological clock”), associated with a picture (Figure 1D). Users were
encouraged to follow these recommendations on sleep hygiene recommendation, stimulus
control, time in bed restriction, relaxation and physical activity for 10 days and continue to
use the sleep diary, and they were informed that they would have a third interview 10 days
later. After this follow-up interview, a new tab “personalized recommendations” appeared
at the bottom of the screen so that users could refer to them at any time.
2.3.3. Final Interview
Ten days later, KANOPEE users had a last interview with Louise, who asked which
recommendations users were able to follow, administered the ISI, and then, depending on
the ISI score, gave the user the opportunity to continue using KANOPEE autonomously (if
ISI ≤21) or be referred to a sleep specialist (if ISI > 21).

2.4. Control Condition
Users of My Sleep Diary had access to the exact same sleep diary proposed in
KANOPEE (Figure 1F). Additionally, once a week, users could complete the ISI in a textual
interface (Figure 1E). The differences compared to KANOPEE were the absence of a virtual
companion administering the questionnaire, the absence of personalized recommendations,
and no referral to a specialist if complaints persisted after two weeks of use.
The potential bias induced by non-randomization was minimized as follows:
Both applications had the same “tags” on the download platforms (i.e., Apple Store
and Google Play Store), so when a user searched for an app with the words “sleep” or
“diary” or “insomnia”, they found both apps to download;
The inclusion period was the same for both apps in order to reduce any seasonal
effects or those attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic;
If user characteristics at baseline differed from one group to another, further analyses
were used to control the effect of those characteristics (age, gender, symptom severity, etc.)
in the outcomes of interest.
To increase compliance, a reminder was sent every day from both apps to remind
users to ﬁll in their sleep diary, and every week to complete the ISI. Users did not receive
any ﬁnancial incentive for participation.
2.5. Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index, a seven-item self-
report questionnaire that provides a global measure of perceived insomnia severity (range
from 0 to 28: 0–7 (no clinical insomnia), 8–14 (sub-threshold insomnia), 15–21 (insomnia
of moderate severity), and 22–28 (severe insomnia)). The ISI has been validated and has
proven sensitive to changes in insomnia severity with treatment [22]. In the intervention
group (KANOPEE users), the ISI was administered by the virtual companion. In the control
group (My Sleep Diary users), it was in a textual format. The secondary outcome measures
included changes in nocturnal sleep indicators derived from the sleep diaries completed
by the subjects: sleep onset latency (SOL), number of awakenings (NWAK), wake after
initial sleep onset (WASO), terminal wakefulness (TWAK), total time spent in bed (TIB),
total sleep time (TST), and sleep efﬁciency (SE). These sleep indicators have proven their
validity [23,24]. The sleep diary was the same in both apps. Reminders sent every day in
the event of non-completion reduced the amount of missing data.
2.6. Statistical Analyses
2.6.1. Sample Size
Sample size and power analysis were calculated based on our preliminary results [19]
in which ISI scores differed between the ﬁrst measure and the measure after one week of
sleep diary intervention (15.60 ± 5.01 vs. 13.58 ± 5.21), representing an estimated Effect
Size = 0.4.
For an ANOVA with independent groups (sleep diary versus KANOPEE), a total
sample size of 684 participants after the three-week follow-up is needed to obtain a sufﬁcient
statistical power (1-β err prob) = 0.80, an effect size = 0.10 (conservative hypothesis) and an
α err prob = 0.05 (GPower). Considering the same rate of completion (10%) and frequency
of downloads (700 downloads per month) as in our previous study, the inclusion period
had to last at least 10 months to obtain the minimum total sample size of 684 users.
2.6.2. Descriptive
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and qualita-
tive variables were expressed as percentage.
2.6.3. Comparative Analyses
Univariate analyses with t-test comparisons for independent groups for continuous
variables or Chi2 test for categorical variables were used to compare socio-demographic

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 4387
6 of 11
and clinical characteristics of participants between My Sleep Diary and KANOPEE groups.
Four-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with repeated factor “Time” (“screening”: corre-
sponding to scores at baseline, “after Step 1”: corresponding to scores after one week of
app use; and “after Step 2”: corresponding to scores after 17 days of app use), and between
subject-factors “Group” (sleep diary versus KANOPEE), “Severity of baseline insomnia
complaints” (0–7, 8–14 and 15–28) and “Age” (Less than 50 years old, More than 50 years
old) were used to analyze ISI and nocturnal sleep characteristics. Age categories were
based on the median age of the study population.
Chi2 tests were performed to compare the proportion of users in each severity category
of insomnia complaints (none, mild, moderate to severe) by condition (sleep diary and
KANOPEE) between ﬁrst and last timepoint (screening versus after Step 2), and to compare
the distribution of users’ severity of insomnia complaints between sleep diary versus
KANOPEE at each timepoint (screening, after Step 1 and after Step 2).
The alpha risk threshold was set at p = 0.05. Statistica® (StatSoft Inc. 2010, Statistica
for Windows, Maisons-Alfort, France, Version 9.1) was used.
3. Results
3.1. Participant Flow
The ﬂowchart of participants can be found in Figure 2. During the inclusion period
(i.e., December 2020 to October 2021), 8714 users downloaded the two apps (i.e., KANOPEE
and My Sleep Diary), but 242 users were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria
(age < 18 years old). Among the remaining 8470, 5614 KANOPEE users and 1834 My Sleep
Diary users discontinued the intervention before the end (either forgot to answer or deleted
the app) and were therefore excluded. Eventually, 535 KANOPEE users and 489 My Sleep
Diary users were included in this study.

3.2. Characteristics of Participants
Table 1 shows baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in the
KANOPEE and sleep diary groups. They were predominantly female (two-thirds of the
sample) with moderate to high educational level in both groups. KANOPEE users were
signiﬁcantly older (p < 0.001), scored slightly higher on insomnia complaints (ISI score,
KANOPEE: 15.2 ± 4.5 vs. My Sleep Diary: 14.2 ± 5.2, p < 0.01) and expressed similar levels
of depression and anxiety on the PHQ-4 questionnaire. There were more people without
professional activity in the KANOPEE group than in the sleep diary group.

3.3. Insomnia Complaints
The evolution of subjective insomnia complaints between the two groups at baseline,
after Step 1 and Step 2 is presented in Figure 3.

The main effect “Group” yielded significance for ISI score (F(1,1001) = 10.5, p < 0.001)
with significantly lower ISI scores in the KANOPEE group than in the sleep diary group. A
significant interaction between the “Group” factor and the “Time” factor (F(2,2002) = 17.3,
p < 0.001) created a more marked reduction in ISI score over time in the KANOPEE group
than in the sleep diary group (Figure 3).
Regarding the severity of baseline insomnia complaints, we obtained a signiﬁcant
interaction with the factor “Time” (F(4,2002) = 24.6, p < 0.001), indicating a greater decrease
in ISI score over time for the most severe users, whatever the group. The distribution of
KANOPEE and sleep diary users depending on the severity of their insomnia complaints
over time is shown in Figure 4. The proportion of users with severe insomnia complaints
decreased in both groups between the ﬁrst and last timepoint (sleep diary: Chi2 = 179.2,
ddl = 4, p < 0.001 and KANOPEE: Chi2 = 130.8, ddl = 4, p < 0.001). At screening, a higher
proportion of users with severe insomnia complaints was observed in the KANOPEE group
than in the sleep diary group (Chi2 = 13.3, ddl = 2, p < 0.01). There was no difference in
distribution at the intermediate timepoint between the groups (Chi2 = 0.1, ddl = 2, NS). On
the other hand, the trend was reversed after Step 2 with a greater proportion of less severe
patients in the KANOPEE group than in the sleep diary group (Chi2 = 8.7, ddl = 2, p < 0.05).
Consequently, a shift towards the lower classes in terms of severity of insomnia complaints
seemed to occur over time in the KANOPEE group.
Figure 4. Distribution of sleep diary versus KANOPEE users depending on severity of their insomnia
complaints over time.
3.4. Nocturnal Sleep Indicators
Table 2 presents nocturnal sleep indicators of sleep diary and KANOPEE users
over time.
Regarding sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO), a de-
crease was observed from screening to the last timepoint in both groups (respectively,
F(2,1980) = 3.5, p < 0.05 and F(2,1980) = 6.6, p < 0.001). The interaction “Group”, “Time”,
“Severity of baseline insomnia complaints” yielded signiﬁcance (respectively, F(4,1980) = 5.9,
p < 0.001 and F(4,1980) = 8.4, p < 0.001) showing that reduced SOL and WASO over time
were observed mostly in KANOPEE users with severe initial insomnia complaints.
Time in bed (TIB) and terminal wakefulness (TWAK) were decreased from screening
to the next two timepoints in both groups (respectively, F(2,1980) = 88.6, p < 0.001 and
F(2,1980) = 6.5, p < 0.001). No difference was observed in TIB or TWAK reduction between
the two groups. The severity of insomnia complaints did not inﬂuence the reduction in TIB
or TWAK.

users with severe initial insomnia complaints.
4. Discussion
The digital self-guided sleep health intervention provided by KANOPEE produced
a signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful reduction in insomnia symptom severity. This
demonstrates that, in line with public health campaigns, the regular use of smartphone
apps downloaded without a previous medical consultation can improve sleep complaints.
This ﬁnding pleads for the idea of promoting autonomous digital interventions prior to
members of the general public with sleep complaints consulting their general practitioner or
specialized medical centers, especially during a period of tension marked by the COVID-19
crisis and the increasing emergence of sleep complaints in modern societies.
Furthermore, the KANOPEE intervention had a greater effect on sleep complaints
than simply recommending subjects to monitor their sleep schedules by using a sleep diary.
Both applications globally improved ISI scores and reduced TIB, but KANOPEE had a
more signiﬁcant beneﬁt on sleep efﬁciency and increased TST. This effect can probably
be explained by the personalized recommendations proposed in KANOPEE, targeting
stimulus control and time in bed restriction, and consequently, reducing SOL and WASO
over time. Interestingly, patients with severe insomnia at baseline (≥15 on ISI) improved
signiﬁcantly over time in the KANOPEE group, whereas severe patients in the sleep diary
group did not change over time. The ﬁnding that an autonomous digital intervention can
improve insomnia in severely affected patients, if they follow the recommendations for two
weeks, is very encouraging for implementation in a large population of patients.
Several studies have already demonstrated the efﬁcacy of digital CBT-I [9,11–15],
but they were conducted as formal clinical trials with the rationale of participating in a
research study. On the other hand, the KANOPEE project adopts an ecological public health
perspective by providing help to the general population in a period when consultations
with physicians are difﬁcult to obtain. Its ecological design and its ﬁndings constitute
a sound basis for using validated applications like KANOPEE and My Sleep Diary in
members of the general population exposed to psychosocial stress.

By comparing the effects of using KANOPEE or a sleep diary, we obtained comparable
self-monitoring of sleep quality and regular feedback, thus controlling for a placebo effect
and reinforcing the validity of our results. A future development would be to conduct
a controlled study with text-based interaction to highlight the advantages of interacting
with virtual agents. While a randomized controlled study with two arms could have also
provided interesting insights into the efﬁcacy of both applications, it would suppose a
selection process requiring human interactions, which is exactly what we want to avoid in
this speciﬁc study. Our aim was to investigate the real-world perception of both apps (with
no physician intervention) to understand how future campaigns could be undertaken to
increase the download rate. The added value of using KANOPEE compared to a simple
sleep diary would prove useful in public health campaigns.
An important limitation is that we did not conduct speciﬁc interviews to question
KANOPEE users about which recommendations best improved their sleep because we
wanted to leave the participants free to focus on their acceptance of the application during
the 17 days of the program. Future research should investigate how interventions could be
tailored to patients’ phenotypes and level of acceptance. Research in dedicated sleep centers
would be more appropriate to explore this issue. Our results demonstrate a good efﬁcacy
on a 17-day period. It is worth considering further studies to demonstrate the efﬁcacy
of our apps on longer periods. It also could be interesting to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of
KANOPEE app on objective measures collected by actimetry or polysomnography.
The validity of interventions based on autonomous virtual agents at the population
level is still a burning issue. However, our results in a sample of over 1000 subjects
underline the potential for using these new autonomous digital solutions in medicine and
the beneﬁts that they represent for healthcare systems.
