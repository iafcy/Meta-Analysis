OBJECTIVES: To compare the efﬁcacy of a computer-
based physical activity program (Embodied Conversational
Agent—ECA) with that of a pedometer control condition
in sedentary older adults.
DESIGN: Single-blind block-randomized controlled trial
stratiﬁed according to clinic site and health literacy status.
SETTING: Three
urban
ambulatory
care
practices
at
Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September
2011.
PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N = 263; mean age 71.3;
61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school
diploma or less).
INTERVENTION: ECA participants were provided with
portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for
2 months and were directed to connect their pedometers
to the computer using a data cable and interact with a
computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss
walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants
were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA
in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following
10 months. Control participants were given a control
pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for
an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants
were also provided with pedometers.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was average
daily step count for the 30 days before the 12-month inter-
view. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count
for the 30 days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes
were also stratiﬁed according to health literacy level.
RESULTS: ECA participants walked signiﬁcantly more
steps than control participants at 2 months (adjusted mean
4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P = .01), but this effect waned
by 12 months (3,861 vs 3,383, P = .09). For participants
with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group
walked signiﬁcantly more than controls at both 2 months
(P = .03) and 12 months (P = .02), while those with inad-
equate health literacy failed to show signiﬁcant differences
between treatment groups at either time point. Interven-
tion participants were highly satisﬁed with the program.
CONCLUSION: An automated exercise promotion system
deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among
older adults over the short-term. Effective methods for
long-term maintenance of behavior change are needed.

greater ankle plantar ﬂexor and knee extensor strength,
and signiﬁcantly fewer falls in older adults than in those

Older adults who are sedentary can begin an exercise
program and still reap the beneﬁts in later life. Healthy
older adults adapt to moderate- to high-intensity cardio-
vascular training similarly to younger adults, and most
health outcomes appear to be achievable with moderate
levels of exercise.9 Low- to moderate-intensity aerobic

maximal predicted heart rate have been associated with
modest improvements in cardiovascular efﬁciency and
mobility tasks.10 Moreover, a change from a sedentary to
a more-active lifestyle in midlife or beyond is associated
with lower mortality.11,12
Despite these beneﬁts, only approximately 25% of
men and 20% of women aged 65 and older meet the
national guidelines for regular physical activity.13 The
demographic groups at highest risk of inactivity are minor-
ities and those with low income or educational back-
grounds,14 and it is clear that this is a driver of health
disparities.15,16 Although there have been many physical
intervention studies conducted in older adults,17,18 these
interventions are not typically designed to meet the needs
of individuals with limited educational attainment and low
health literacy, so interventions designed for populations
with low educational backgrounds and health literacy are
needed.
This study investigated the use of a new technology
for health behavior change speciﬁcally targeting older
adults with low levels of health literacy. The primary aim
was to test the efﬁcacy of an embodied conversational
agent (ECA)-based physical activity intervention designed
speciﬁcally for older adults that could be deployed from
outpatient clinics, targeting individuals who are in need
of greater mobility. The intervention had two phases: a
2-month intensive intervention phase delivered on take-
home tablet computers, followed by a 12-month mainte-
nance phase delivered on outpatient waiting room kiosk
computers. The intervention was compared with a control
pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for
an equivalent period of time. It was hypothesized that
intervention participants would have signiﬁcantly greater
physical activity levels (measured according to pedometer
steps) than controls at the end of the 2 and 12 months.
METHODS
A two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was
conducted to compare the ECA intervention with a control
pedometer intervention. All participants were assessed in
person at baseline, at the end of the active phase of
the intervention (2 months), and at the conclusion of the
intervention (12 months).
Participants
Participants were 263 older adults recruited from three
outpatient clinics at Boston Medical Center between April
2009 and September 2011. The institutional review board
at Boston University Medical Campus approved the study.
Community-dwelling adults who attended the geriatrics
or internal medicine ambulatory care clinics at Boston
Medical Center and were aged 65 and older, English
speaking, inactive (not engaged in regular moderate-inten-
sity or greater physical activity ≥3 d/wk for at least
20 min/d over the previous 6 months),13 free of any medi-
cal condition that would limit participation in a walking
program, and
stable
on
all
medications for
at
least
3 months were eligible. Individuals were excluded if they
had cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog score <2),19 signiﬁ-
cant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9) score ≥16),20 were at high risk of falls, or had a
timed maximal walking velocity of less than 0.5 m/s
(0.2 m/s is considered frail).21
Data Collection
Trained research assistants who administered structured
research protocols collected data in face-to-face sessions in
a private room. Potential participants who agreed to be in
the study and passed ﬁnal screening procedures completed
the baseline assessment, which included sociodemographic
information, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9),20 cognitive
status (Mini-Cog),19 ﬁtness and mobility (timed maximal
walking velocity),22 and health literacy. Health literacy
was assessed using the Test of Functional Health Literacy
in Adults (TOFHLA),23 and participants were split into
adequate and inadequate health literacy groups, using a
TOFHLA cutoff of 23.24 All participants returned for
assessments at 2 and 12 months, at which a different
research assistant blinded to group assignment and ﬁndings
from earlier data collection points collected data.
Steps
were
measured
using
a
digital
pedometer
(HJ-720ITC, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) to
track daily steps throughout the walking program. This
device provides valid and reliable step counts under a
range of walking conditions in normal-weight and over-
weight adults.25 All participants were instructed to wear
the pedometer at the waist or in a pants pocket daily, to
record their steps daily on paper log sheets, and to return
the log sheets to the researchers monthly (by mail or in
person). Research staff also electronically downloaded
pedometer
steps
from
the
pedometer
at
the
2-
and
12-month in-person interviews. Intervention participants
also downloaded pedometer steps on the ECA computer
(at home or in a waiting room kiosk) through a data cable
each time they interacted with the ECA.
Step
count
analyses
were
based
on
electronically
recorded pedometer readings, excluding daily step values
below the 5th percentile (233 steps) and above 20,000
steps. A low-value cutoff of this kind is typically assigned
in pedometer research because days with extremely low
step
counts
probably
represent
minimal
use
of
the
device.26,27 A high-value cutoff is typically assigned in
pedometer research because of the rare occurrence of high-
value pedometer errors.28 Participants must have had at
least 7 days of valid data to be included in analyses.29
Pedometer steps per day were averaged for the ﬁrst
2 weeks of the intervention as a baseline and 30 days
before the 2-month interview and 30 days before the
12-month interview as outcomes.
Adherence to Intervention
Intervention participant use of the system was determined
according to analysis of log ﬁles on the tablet and kiosk
computers.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome measure was average daily step
count for the 30 days before the end of the intervention at
12 months.

Secondary Outcomes
Average daily step count for the 30 days before the end of
the
active
intervention
phase
at
2 months
was
also
assessed, as were 2-month and 12-month step counts
stratiﬁed according to health literacy level.
Supplementary Intervention Group Findings
Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed through a
single question and semistructured interviews with partici-
pants.
Adverse Events
An independent data safety monitoring board monitored
the study for safety (but not efﬁcacy), reviewing all adverse
event reports for determination of whether they were
attributable to study participation.
Randomization
At study entry and at the end of baseline data collection,
participants were randomized in blocks of six or eight,
selected randomly, and stratiﬁed according to clinic site
and health literacy status (inadequate vs adequate).
ECA Intervention
The intervention used an ECA (Figure 1) on a take-home
touch-screen tablet computer as the primary communica-
tion medium to motivate participants to do more walking
during the ﬁrst 2 months of the intervention. ECAs are
animated computer characters that simulate face-to-face
conversation using voice, hand gesture, gaze cues, and
other nonverbal behavior to make the computer interface
as acceptable and intuitive as possible for individuals who
may have no prior experience with computers. Simulating
face-to-face
conversation
is
particularly
important
for
individuals with low health literacy, because a face-to-face
encounter with a health provider remains one of the best
methods for communicating health information to individ-
uals with low health literacy levels,30–32 and prior studies
have indicated that this medium works well for individuals
of all levels of health and computer literacy.33 ECAs have
also been successfully used in several prior interventions
promoting lifestyle health behavior change with younger
adults, including physical activity promotion, in which sev-
eral mechanisms were used to maintain long-term engage-
ment in addition to behavior change counseling.34–38 In
the simulated conversations, the ECA talks using synthetic
speech and animated nonverbal behavior, and participants
“talk” by selecting what they want to say from a multiple-
choice list of options on the touch screen.
At their baseline visit, participants in the ECA group
were instructed on how to use the ECA system, were sent
home
with
touch-screen
tablet
computers,
and
were
instructed to conduct daily conversations with the ECA for
2 months. At the 2-month interview, ECA participants
returned their tablet computers (100% returned) and were
provided instruction on how to use a kiosk computer in
the clinic waiting room whenever they were at the clinic
for regularly scheduled appointments.
Daily conversations with the ECA consisted of dialogue
and other media designed to promote health behavior
change.38 A daily 5-minute conversation typically consisted
of a greeting, social chat, and well-being check-in to deter-
mine whether the participant needed to stop his or her walk-
ing program and to provide empathic opportunities. The
participant was instructed to connect his or her pedometer
into the system to upload steps. Next, the virtual coach
reviewed the participant’s progress relative to her or his
short- and long-term goals, provided positive reinforcement
if warranted, identiﬁed barriers to walking and engaged the
participant in a problem-solving discussion for any barriers
identiﬁed, and then negotiated a new short-term goal, if
needed.39 The session ended with an exercise tip of the day.
Each day’s dialogue was varied in content and structure and
augmented
with
additional
media
to
help
maintain
participant engagement and retention.33 The dialogue and
animated character display were augmented with media
consisting of various images, such as characters demonstrat-

ing stretching exercises and the proper use of the pedometer
and dynamically generated self-monitoring charts showing
the participant’s step counts relative to goals over time.
ECA conversations on the in-home tablet computer and in-
clinic kiosks were identical.
Control Group Intervention
The control participants received pedometers, which they
were encouraged to wear every day, and monthly logs to
track their step counts.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to have 80% power (two-sided
alpha = .05) to detect effect sizes of 0.4 at 2 months and
0.5 at 12 months between the treatment and control
groups based on pilot data40 and the literature.41 The
necessary baseline sample size was 66 per study group.
Because the study was stratiﬁed and randomized according
to health literacy level, the total sample size required was
264, with outcomes according to literacy level performed
as a secondary analysis.
Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-
treat basis, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines.42
Separate linear regression analyses were performed for
physical activity outcomes at 2 and 12 months using the
log of average steps per day in the 30 days before the 2-
month interview and the 30 days before the 12-month
interview. Models were controlled for age, factors used in
the stratiﬁed randomization (health literacy and clinic site),
and sex, the one characteristic that appeared to differ
according to randomization group. Baseline steps, which
was deﬁned as the average steps per day in the ﬁrst
2 weeks of the study from paper logs, were controlled for.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted replacing missing
or invalid electronic values with paper log values when
available and then replacing excluded values as described
above to test the effect of missing data on results.
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
There were no signiﬁcant differences before the treatment
between groups in participant demographic characteristics
other than sex (Table 1). Of the 263 participants who
completed the study, 63% self-identiﬁed as African Ameri-
can, 61% were female, and 51% had an educational
attainment of a high school diploma or less. Participants
had a mean age  SD at enrollment of 71.3  5.4, and
39.9% had low health literacy.
Participant Study Adherence
Of the 263 participants who enrolled in the study, 250
(95%) completed the 2-month assessment, and 226 (86%)
completed the 12-month assessment (Figure 2). There were
no signiﬁcant differences in rates of attrition between the
groups, but there was a higher rate of pedometer data
capture in the control group at 12 months (52.5% vs
39.6%).
Participants in the ECA intervention group interacted
with
the
take-home
virtual
coach
an
average
of
35.8  19.7 times during the 60-day in-home intervention
phase, with usage decreasing markedly after the ﬁrst
week (from an average of 4.7 to 4.0 sessions/wk) and then
gradually declining (to 3.3 sessions/wk). Participants accessed
the ECA on the waiting room kiosks an average of
1.0  2.9 times during the 10-month period between
returning the tablet computer at the 2-month interview
and the end of the intervention at 12 months.
Outcomes
For the 200 participants with adequate pedometer data for
analysis, the adjusted average number of daily steps for
the 30 days before the 2-month interview was 3,499 for
the control group and 4,041 for the intervention group
(Figure 3, Table 2). For the 30 days before the 12-month
interview, the adjusted average number of daily steps for

the 128 participants available was 3,383 for the control
group and 3,861 for the intervention group. At 2 months,
this represents a statistically signiﬁcant intervention effect
(P = .01), but this effect waned and was no longer signiﬁ-
cant by 12 months (P = .09).
For participants with inadequate health literacy, the
adjusted average number of daily steps from the linear
regression models for the 30 days before the 2-month inter-
view was 3,116 in the control group and 3,604 in the inter-
vention group (N = 69, P = .24), and for the 30 days
before the 12-month interview, the adjusted average num-
ber of daily steps was 2,852 in the control group and 3,064

intervention group (N = 131, P = .03), and for the 30 days
before the 12-month interview, the adjusted average num-
ber of daily steps was 3,822 in the control group, and 4,681
in the intervention group (N = 87, P = .02).
The sensitivity analysis to test the effect of missing
data on results conﬁrmed the general trends above but did
not yield signiﬁcant differences between groups at either
time point (P = .08 at 2-month interview, P = .11 at
12-month interview).
Supplementary Intervention Group Findings
Intervention participants expressed a high level of satisfac-
tion with the virtual coach, rating satisfaction an average
6.0 on a scale from 1 (not at all satisﬁed) to 7 (very satis-
ﬁed). Data from semistructured interviews also indicated
high levels of satisfaction. When asked for their overall
impressions of the intervention, 90% of the 125 responses
were positive (e.g., “Gives me an incentive to get out there
and walk.”). When asked whether the virtual coach helped
them to walk more, 80% of the 112 responses were
afﬁrmative.

adverse events was determined to be unrelated to the
study.
DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the efﬁcacy of an exercise-promotion
intervention to improve physical activity in sedentary older
adults. The intervention featured a novel conversational
agent technology designed to increase its reach to persons
with low health and computer literacy that could be
deployed from primary care clinics. Study results demon-
strate that participants were adherent to the initial 2-month
intensive phase of the intervention and that it was more
effective at increasing physical activity levels than a control
group that was only given pedometers, but the subsequent
10-month maintenance phase of the intervention was less
successful; intervention participants used the waiting room
kiosks once on average over the course of 10 months, and
by the end of 12 months of follow-up, there were no signiﬁ-
cant differences between the groups in number of daily
steps. For participants with adequate health literacy, those
in the intervention group did signiﬁcantly better at 2 and
12 months than controls. For patients with inadequate
health literacy, there were no signiﬁcant differences at
either time point, although the trends were promising.
As shown in Figure 3, the differences in group means
—especially at 12 months—appear to be mostly due to
walking declines in the control groups. This could be due
to an initial novelty or the Hawthorne effect, causing an
initial increase in walking behavior immediately after
participants received their pedometers. It could be due to
natural declines in mobility over the year in study partici-
pants. It could also be due to differential dropout, with
control group participants who were doing well with
self-monitoring more likely to discontinue use over time.
There are several possible reasons why the second
phase of the study was not effective at maintaining behav-
ior change. If the behavior change exhibited in the ﬁrst
2 months was a simple dose-response function, then it is
possible that the frequency of use of the ECA may have
been insufﬁcient to maintain physical activity in the latter
10 months. The waiting room kiosks may have been
avoided because of concerns about privacy or may have
been ignored or simply overlooked because of the time
elapsed since last use, competing agendas that commonly
arise during clinic visits, or uncertainty about how long
the ECA interaction might take (wanting to be ready for
the clinician when called from the waiting room). Future
interventions should focus on ECA deployments using
media that are more accessible than waiting room kiosks,
such as web-based or smart phone–based applications that
can be accessed daily and indeﬁnitely.
Despite overall low levels of health and computer
literacy, most intervention participants had no difﬁculty
using the take-home tablet computer system, satisfaction
was generally very high, and all computers were returned
at the end of 2 months. The study demonstrated very high
retention and a low rate of adverse events, given the age
of
the
participants.

increases in walking, even though it used pedometers and
log sheets as a control condition. Interventions that use
only pedometers and step diaries have been found to be
effective for increasing walking in younger adults,18 so the
intervention had a signiﬁcantly higher bar to overcome
than a nonintervention control.
Despite the widespread use of pedometers in society,
there is still a great deal of methodology that needs to
be developed regarding their use in walking-promotion
interventions. Although baseline measures in health behav-
ior–change interventions are typically obtained before the
start of the intervention, it was felt that a true preinterven-
tion baseline measure of steps per day was not possible,

given the effect that pedometers alone can have on walking.
In addition, the clinical signiﬁcance of daily step counts (or
changes in daily step counts) is still lacking evidence and
needs to be established, although physical activity in general
has been shown to have many physical and mental health
beneﬁts. The difference of 542 steps per day observed at
2 months may have limited clinical signiﬁcance. A recent
review of walking studies of older adults identiﬁed an asso-
ciation between increases of 2,000 to 3,000 steps per day
and increases in immune functioning, decreases in body
mass index, and achievement of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention–recommended 30 minutes per day
of moderate or greater physical activity through walking
alone,13 although the dose-response relationships between
steps per day and bone density of the hip and spine,43 mark-
ers of inﬂammation,44 and health-related quality of life45
appear to be linear and without threshold.
Although there have been many physical intervention
studies conducted with older adults,21,22 and there have
been many health behavior interventions targeted at disad-
vantaged populations,46 there are few studies of walking
in urban, minority, low-income older adults. This is the
ﬁrst study the authors are aware of that has attempted to
reach this population with a walking intervention deployed
from outpatient clinics afﬁliated with a safety net hospital.
The results indicated that the study had partial success in
reaching this population, although more work is needed to
develop effective interventions for those with low health
literacy.
There are several limitations to this study. Older
adults with signiﬁcant cognitive impairments and mobility
limitations were excluded, 667 of 990 eligible patients
declined participation, and the study was conducted in a
single metropolitan area (Boston), which may not be repre-
sentative of all locales in the United States. The effect of
seasonality on walking is especially relevant given New
England winters, although the permuted block randomiza-
tion scheme with small block sizes controlled for seasonal
effects by enrolling equal numbers of participants in each
arm of the study at each time of year.
The lack of signiﬁcance at 12 months is possibly due
in part to low power, because the sample size for the anal-
ysis was smaller (128 at 12 months vs 200 at 2 months).
Low power was particularly relevant for the subanalyses
in participants with low literacy. Overall, the lack of
pedometer data (76% of participants available for analysis
at 2 months, 49% at 12 months) is somewhat surprising
given the high retention rate in the study (95% at
2 months, 86% at 12 months), and the increase in missing
pedometer data was especially large in the intervention
group. One explanation for this may be that the interven-
tion participants thought the intervention was over once
they returned their tablet computers, causing them to stop
using their pedometers and resulting in a signiﬁcant drop
in pedometer use in Months 3 to 12. Improving pedometer
use adherence is a prerequisite for improving outcomes in
pedometer-based walking interventions and should thus be
the target of future research efforts.
In spite of these limitations, the study demonstrated
that an ECA-based intervention can be successfully deployed
from outpatient clinics to the homes of older adults, that the
individuals adhered to the intervention and were satisﬁed
with it, and that it can be effective in increasing short-term
physical activity. This study is one of the few physical
activity interventions involving an urban, largely minority
population with a high rate of inadequate health literacy.
