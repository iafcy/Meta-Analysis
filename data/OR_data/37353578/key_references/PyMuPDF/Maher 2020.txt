Abstract
Background: 
Poor diet and physical inactivity are leading modifiable causes of death and disease. Advances in artificial
intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized
support at scale.
Objective: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of
physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach.
Methods: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide, Australia, from March to August 2019. Participants
were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years, recruited through news stories, social media posts, and flyers. The
program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot, Paola, who guided participants through a computer-based individualized
introductory session, weekly check-ins, and goal setting, and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin
Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps, a website with educational materials and recipes, and a printed diet and activity log sheet.
Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity
and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure.
Results: Over 4 weeks, 99 potential participants registered expressions of interest, with 81 of those screened meeting eligibility
criteria. Participants completed a mean of 109.8 (95% CI 1.9-217.7) more minutes of physical activity at week 12 compared with
baseline. Mediterranean diet scores increased from a mean of 3.8 out of 14 at baseline, to 9.6 at 12 weeks (mean improvement
5.7 points, 95% CI 4.2-7.3). After 12 weeks, participants lost an average 1.3 kg (95% CI –0.1 to –2.5 kg) and 2.1 cm from their
waist circumference (95% CI –3.5 to –0.7 cm). There were no significant changes in blood pressure. Feasibility was excellent in
terms of recruitment, retention (90% at 12 weeks), and safety (no adverse events).
Conclusions: 
An artificially intelligent virtual assistant-led lifestyle-modification intervention was feasible and achieved
measurable improvements in physical activity, diet, and body composition at 12 weeks. Future research examining artificially
intelligent interventions at scale, and for other health purposes, is warranted.

Introduction
Poor diet and physical inactivity are amongst the leading
modifiable causes of death and disease and increase the risk of
developing chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancers, depression, and anxiety
[1]. In highly developed countries, these unfavorable health
behaviors are pervasive; for example, over ninety percent of
Australian adults fail the recommended daily intake of
vegetables and fruit, and approximately two-thirds do not meet
guidelines of 30 min of physical activity most days [2,3].
Despite the overwhelming benefits of healthy eating and
physical activity, making and sustaining lifestyle modification
is tremendously challenging [4]. Specialized support from health
professionals, such as dietitians and exercise physiologists or
physiotherapists, can help people achieve lifestyle change.
However, health systems’ finite budgets typically limit access
to such services to specific patient populations, such as those
with established chronic disease [5]. Consequently, many people
with unfavorable lifestyle patterns, who in time will go on to
develop chronic disease, do not have access to health
professional support to help them modify their lifestyle and
prevent disease.
Technology advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and
wearables offer new opportunities to deliver accessible,
personalized, and cost-efficient behavior modification programs.
In particular, virtual assistants use artificial intelligence to mimic
human conversation and can be programmed with scripted
conversations, questions and answers, and the ability to provide
personalized responses based on input from the user. Basic
virtual assistants have limited functionality and restrict users’
inputs (eg, by offering questions with multiple-choice response
options). For example, weight-loss virtual assistant “Lark” led
to significant weight loss, comparable in magnitude to that
achieved in in-person lifestyle interventions.[6] However, Lark
only allowed users to respond to program-directed questions
and did not allow users to ask questions. In contrast,
sophisticated virtual assistant technology is capable of
recognizing free-written or spoken language (natural language
processing), enabling more natural and user-directed
communication. Compared to more traditional knowledge
transfer methods in digital health (eg, tailored modules), the
conversational methods in virtual assistance may be perceived
as more personally relevant and humanistic, which is critical
given that perceived relevance and the inclusion of social
support are associated with increased effect sizes in digital
behavior change interventions [7,8].
Preliminary research supports the acceptability and efficacy of
natural language virtual assistants in health; however, few
studies have been conducted to date. Laranjo and colleagues’
2018 systematic review of studies evaluating natural language
processing virtual assistants in healthcare identified just 14
studies, most of which focused on mental health (n=6) or
clinician decision making (n=4) [9]. Single studies (n=3) used
virtual assistants to provide patients with education and support
for asthma, sexual health, and language impairment [9].
Using an identical search strategy, we updated this review in
January 2020 and identified a further 11 studies. Similar to the
previous review, most recent studies were aimed at mental health
self-management (n=5) [10-12]. Single studies (n=3) used virtual
assistants to provide patients with education and support for
breast cancer [13], genetic counseling [14], and clinician training
[15]. Despite the potential for natural language virtual assistants
to provide personalized information and support users to engage
in positive health behaviors, only three natural language
processing virtual assistants focus on lifestyle modification.
“J’arrête de fumer” assisted users in quitting smoking by
profiling smoking behavior and providing advice and support
at times when cravings were likely to occur [16]. A feasibility
study published in 2019 employed a virtual assistant “Tess” to
support obese adolescents in health-promoting behavior change
with success [17]; however, Tess played a support role only
and was designed to supplement ongoing in-person
hospital-based services. Additionally, “Reflection Companion”
prompted participants to reflect on their physical activity
patterns, goals, barriers, and enablers of activity but was unable
to provide positive affirmation or encouragement, answer
participants’ questions, or provide tailored advice [18].
In sum, although the use of virtual assistants in healthcare is a
rapidly developing field, few virtual assistants use natural
language processing to promote lifestyle change and those that
do remain basic, performing limited, highly specific processes.
To our knowledge, there are currently no published studies
examining fully automated, natural language processing artificial
intelligence health coaches for lifestyle modification.
This proof-of-concept study aimed to assess the feasibility of
an artificial intelligence virtual health coach-led physical activity
and diet intervention for community-dwelling middle-aged and
older adults (recruitment and retention) and to evaluate the
preliminary efficacy of the virtual health coach intervention for
improving physical activity, Mediterranean-style diet adherence,
and health risk factors.
Methods
The case-controlled study was approved by the University of
South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (ref
201724). All participants provided informed consent before
commencing the study.
Intervention
The 12-week MedLiPal program assists users in increasing their
lifestyle physical activity and adopt a Mediterranean-style diet.
It incorporates numerous behavior change techniques to target
determinants of lifestyle behaviors, including goal-setting,
problem-solving, goal review, self-monitoring with feedback,
social support, reattribution, and use of credible sources [19].
The components include Paola, a wearable activity monitor, the
MedLiPal website, and a diet and activity log.
‘Paola’ is a natural language processing virtual health coach
(Figure 1), created using IBM Watson Virtual Assistant artificial
intelligence software (IBM Corp.). Paola performs three key
roles: (1) guides participants through an introductory session
during which she teaches them about the principles of physical

activity, goal-setting and self-monitoring, and the Mediterranean
diet, including recommended daily and weekly servings (based
on Davis protocol) [20]; (2) guides users through 11 weekly
check-ins regarding their daily steps and dietary pattern for the
past week, and assists users to set personalized step and diet
goals for the coming week; and (3) is available 24/7 to answer
users’questions. Paola was deployed on the cloud-based instant
messaging platform Slack (Slack Technologies). Participants
were required to download the Slack application on their device
and create a user account to access Paola.
Figure 1. Overview of the technology underpinning Paola, the virtual health coach.
Paola referred to users by their first name and could respond to
questions at any time. Frequently asked questions (eg, “How
much bread can I eat?”) were categorized by the intent (eg,
“how much” type questions) and by the entity (eg, breads and
cereals). The natural language processing artificial intelligence
software underpinning Paola identified intents and entities and
selected an appropriate response from stored dialogue options
(eg, “You can have up to 5 servings of breads and cereals per
day”). Intents, entities, and dialogue selections were developed
through collaboration between the health scientists on the study
team and the software developers.
We provided participants with a Garmin Vívofit4 wearable
activity monitor, which allows users to monitor their daily
physical activity levels (Garmin). During the introductory
session, Paola assisted participants to set a personal daily step
count goal based on age-based normative values +2000 steps,

considering their current activity levels. This daily step goal
was revisited and edited at each weekly check-in.
The MedLiPal website housed educational videos, study
information, and useful links. During the baseline session, Paola
linked participants to the website from Slack, requiring them
to log in and view the educational videos. Participants could
then visit the website for information and recipes at any time.
The diet and activity log was used to record daily steps and
dietary servings (Multimedia Appendix 1) [20,21]. Details of
the Mediterranean diet recommendations are included as
Multimedia Appendix 2.
Participants
Volunteers were recruited during February and March 2019
through mainstream news items, flyers, and social media.
Participants were eligible if they were aged 45-75 years, owned
an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet with internet access,
were not currently meeting the Australian physical activity
guidelines, and were not following a Mediterranean dietary
pattern. Participants completed an online screening survey,
followed by a brief phone interview to confirm eligibility,
answer any potential questions participants may have had, and
arrange their baseline appointment. Participants’ physical
activity level was determined based on a single question
enquiring whether they did more than 30 minutes of activity on
five or more days per week, while Mediterranean diet pattern
was determined using the 14-item Mediterranean diet
questionnaire, with a score of 7 or less indicating they were not
following the Mediterranean diet [22]. Participants were
excluded if they were unable to consume a Mediterranean diet
due to allergy or other food aversions, had a medical condition
precluding them from increasing their physical activity or were
pregnant or lactating. All participants read the information sheet
and were provided an opportunity to ask questions before
providing informed consent and commencing the study.
Procedure
The primary outcomes were total minutes of weekly
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and Mediterranean diet
adherence, measured via an online survey at baseline, week 6,
and week 12. Total minutes of weekly moderate to vigorous
physical activity was assessed using the Active Australia Survey
(AAS) [23,24]. Mediterranean diet adherence was measured
using a 14-item Australian Mediterranean diet adherence tool,
adapted from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea
(PREDIMED) study [25] to align with the Australian food
supply [26]. The Australian Mediterranean diet adherence tool
has been validated relative to the Mediterranean diet score
calculated from a 3-day weighed food record r=0.44 [26].
Participants attended in-person assessments at baseline, 6 weeks,
and 12 weeks for secondary outcome measures. Secondary
outcomes included: body weight (Seca 703), measured while
clothed and with shoes removed; height measured without shoes
(Seca 206); waist circumference, measured at the midpoint
between the pelvic crest and bottom rib, unless a visual narrow
was present elsewhere (Lufkin Thinline 2 mm, Apex Tool
Group) [27]; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Omron
Healthcare) [26].
Sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age) and medication use
were captured in the online survey. Socioeconomic status was
measured according to the Socio-Economic Index for Areas
disadvantage index, based on postcode [28].
Following the completion of the baseline assessments,
participants were provided with a Garmin Vívofit4 activity
tracker and access to the virtual health coach and the MedLiPal
website. Initial login prompted Paola to begin the introductory
session, in which the health coach introduced herself and taught
users about the Mediterranean lifestyle and its benefits, the
principles of increasing physical activity, goal-setting, and how
to use the Garmin Vívofit4 activity tracker, the Mediterranean
dietary pattern, and how to self-monitor daily and weekly
servings using the MedLiPal weekly log sheet. Paola then
invited the participant to converse with her regarding any
questions they had about the program. Paola also explained to
participants that she was available 24/7 to answer their
questions.
Each week, users received an email notification inviting them
to complete a weekly check-in with Paola to check their
progress, assisting them with setting new weekly goals and
answering their questions.
Participants did not receive an honorarium but could keep their
Garmin Vívofit4 activity tracker after the study.
Feasibility
Feasibility was judged based on recruitment, retention, and
engagement. We sought to recruit 30 participants to the study
within 6 weeks, on the rationale that if this could be achieved
with no advertising budget, a future definitive trial with a
dedicated recruitment budget should be able to recruit
approximately 400 participants over a year. We set a retention
threshold of 75% at 12 weeks. Behavioral engagement with the
MedLiPal program was assessed via virtual health coach usage
data (number of weekly check-ins completed). The a priori
engagement target was set at 70% (ie, that participants would
complete at least 8 of 11 weekly sessions with Paola).
Power and Statistical Analyses
The target sample size was set at n=30, which was considered
adequate to answer feasibility research questions. For efficacy
outcomes, this sample size, assuming 80% power, an alpha of
0·05, and a single group design with three repeated measures,
was able to detect an effect size of d=0.48.
Feasibility 
data 
and 
participants’
sociodemographic
characteristics were analyzed descriptively, using means and
standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages. Efficacy was
assessed using an unadjusted repeated measures ANOVA,
conducted on an intention-to-treat principle. Given that a small
amount of data was missing (16% missing data at week 6, 10%
at week 12 for primary outcomes), imputation was achieved
using the last observation carried forward. Sensitivity analyses
using complete cases were also conducted. All analyses were
performed using SPSS (version 26, IBM) with a P value of .05.
Pairwise comparisons included Bonferroni adjustment, and
exact P values are reported.

Results
Recruitment and Retention
A total of 99 potential participants formally expressed their
interest in the study within four weeks of recruitment opening,
at which point expressions of interest were closed. The first 38
potential participants completed the eligibility screening
interview, of which 31 (82%) were eligible. Participants were
sequentially booked for baseline assessments until the study
quota of 30 participants was filled, with n=31 ultimately
enrolled. Attendance for the 6- and 12-week assessments was
29 and 28, respectively (Figure 2).

Behavioral and Health Outcomes
The efficacy results are shown in Table 2. From baseline to
week 6, weekly physical activity increased by approximately
one hour, and then by a further 50 minutes at 12 weeks. Thus
overall, from baseline to 12 weeks, physical activity increased
by 109.8 minutes (95% CI 1.9 to 217.7, P=.005). Mediterranean
diet adherence increased markedly from baseline to week 6 and
then was approximately maintained at this level from week 6
to week 12 (mean change baseline to 12 weeks 5.7, 95% CI 4.2
to 7.3, P<.001).
On average, participants lost 1.1 kg from baseline to week 6,
and then lost a further 0.2 kg to week 12, resulting in an overall
average loss of 1.3 kg (95% CI –2·5 to –0·7, P=.01). Similarly,
waist circumference decreased by 1 cm from baseline to week
6, and then another 1 cm to week 12, leading to an overall loss
of –2.1cm (95% CI –3.5 to –0.7, P=.003). There was no change
in blood pressure (diastolic or systolic) at either time point.
Sensitivity analyses (Multimedia Appendix 3) were conducted
using complete case data (n=28). Results were consistent with
the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, though effect sizes tended
to be slightly larger; for example, physical activity increased
by 145 minutes (vs 110 minutes in the ITT analyses) and that
Mediterranean diet adherence score increased by 6.5 points (vs
5.7 points in the ITT analysis).

Engagement With the Virtual Health Coach
From Weeks 2-12 of the program, participants were encouraged
to complete weekly check-ins with Paola, the virtual health
coach. Out of a maximum of 11 possible check-ins, participants
completed an average of 6.9 (64%, range 1-11). Engagement
with the check-ins across the intervention period is shown in
Figure 3. Around 70% of participants completed the check-ins
in weeks two, three, four and 12, with engagement gradually
sliding to around 50% through weeks eight and nine, before
rising again in the final weeks of the program. Participants who
completed the first weekly check-in had significantly higher
engagement across the intervention period than those who did
not complete the first weekly check-in (mean 7.4, SD 3.4 vs
mean 4.6, SD 2.6; P=.03).

Other Feasibility Issues
Of the 31 participants meeting all eligibility criteria and enrolled
in the study, it became clear during baseline appointments that
3 participants had minimal smartphone skills (eg, did not know
how to send a text message or download an app). These
participants were reliant on their partners or children to use their
phones as part of the study. At the 6-week assessment, several
participants reported difficultly consuming the recommended
number of food group servings (due to feeling satiated). They
were encouraged to ask Paola for advice. Paola’s advice to users
reporting satiation was to reduce portion sizes across all food
groups and to maintain a variety of healthy foods
Adverse Events
No adverse events related to study participation were
experienced.
Discussion
Principal Results
This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a highly innovative
virtual health coach physical activity and diet intervention for
middle-aged and older adults. The study found a high level of
interest in the technology-based intervention approach amongst
the target demographic and high retention across the 12-week
study period. Preliminary evidence suggests that the intervention
led to sizable improvements in physical activity, diet, and body
composition across 12 weeks.
The intervention approach was well-received by participants,
exceeding our a priori expectations for recruitment and retention.
Engagement with the virtual health coach (based on completed
weekly check-ins) was slightly lower than our a priori threshold
of ≥70% (actual completion rate 64%). Interestingly, the most
significant drop off with the virtual health coach occurred
between the baseline appointment and week two of the program
(ie, the first check-in participants were supposed to complete
on their own), with around a quarter of participants failing to
complete the first weekly check-in. Three participants who
enrolled in the study were found to have very low smartphone
literacy at the baseline session, which impacted their ability to
use the program as intended. In some cases, technical problems
with Slack or the software interrupted attempts to check in,
which generally were rectified after week 1. It appears that
getting participants to complete their first independent check-in
successfully may be a strong predictor of ongoing engagement,
and a specific target in future program iterations. It may be
useful to provide participants with a courtesy follow-up phone
call after the first week to ensure they were able to complete
the first check-in and proactively troubleshoot issues.
Allowances for low smartphone literacy could be addressed in
the study protocol, for example, by offering in-person assistance
and written step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting
information.
Our study attracted mostly women, who were similar to national
averages for socioeconomic advantage (national average 1000)
[28]. Our sample had poor adherence to Australian healthy
eating guidelines (baseline average self-reported vegetable
servings was 2.2/day and fruit 1.3/day compared to the
recommended 5 and 2 servings per day, respectively) [29]. They
also exhibited above-average rates of obesity and overweight
compared with population norms [30] and physical activity rates
comparable to other Australian studies of older adults measured
using the AAS [31-33]. This population appears to be ideally
suited to this type of new offering, given that they are not unwell
enough to qualify for face-to-face services through the health
system, yet have modifiable risk factors for the future
development of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.
Feasibility data collected in the study are invaluable to inform
future trials, which could take the form of a traditional
randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the
current intervention package or utilize a modern research design,
such as the micro-randomization trial design, which allows
multiple intervention elements to be experimentally evaluated
[34]. The latter is useful for optimizing intervention packages
for future use. Results suggest there is considerable enthusiasm
amongst older adults for this style of intervention and confirm
that most older adults have sufficient skills to access a virtual
health coach program and use it effectively to achieve sizeable
behavior and health change. Future research may also focus on
thoroughly understanding the user experience of virtual health
coach programs, which would be useful to inform
improvements, for example, in terms of the virtual health
coach’s language style, variety of language, and possibly, sense
of humor (which improves the humanity and emotional
connection of artificial-intelligence virtual assistants [35]).
Given the rapid technological advancements occurring in this
field, there are many other opportunities for enhancing this
intervention to address poor health behaviors, which may allow
targeting of specific health issues, such as weight loss or diabetes
self-management.
Comparison With Prior Work
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the capacity
of an advanced virtual assistant technology to deliver a
personalized lifestyle intervention amongst older adults. The
magnitude of change in physical activity was similar to [36,37]
or 
larger 
than 
[38,39] 
that 
achieved 
in 
previous
computer-tailoring interventions. Improvement in Mediterranean
diet adherence was much more significant than those achieved
by previous technology-based Mediterranean diet interventions
[40,41]. The degree of behavior change achieved was
approximately in line with that reported in previous studies
using intensive one-on-one dietary counseling [26,42]. These
exciting findings suggest that artificial intelligence technology
may be able to provide practical, supportive dietary counseling
at a low cost.
Limitations
This study’s primary strength is its ground-breaking intervention
approach of using an artificially intelligent virtual health coach
to deliver a personalized physical activity and dietary
intervention program. Our virtual health coach used natural
language processing, which allows users to converse using
freely written language, representing a significant advancement
over previous computer-tailoring approaches, which typically
rely on multiple choice. Other study strengths include its mostly

hands-off approach (thus improving the ecological validity of
the study compared with a study with a high level of human
contact), the use of objective health measures, and the use of
intention-to-treat analysis, which ensures that the intervention
effects are not over-estimated. Limitations include the pre-post
design, which meant the study lacked a randomized control
comparator, and follow-up is limited to three months.
Conclusions
Virtual assistant technology offers exciting potential for the
delivery of highly personalized, scalable health interventions.
They can make evidence-based advice and support available to
patients who are not unwell enough to quality for in-person (ie,
expensive) services. They also have the potential to be used as
adjunct support for those patients with complex and chronic
health conditions such as type 2 diabetes or celiac disease, who
see a health practitioner, but would benefit from additional
support. Furthermore, they present a way of providing a
scientifically substantiated dietary pattern and lifestyle programs
to rural or remote areas or isolated individuals.
This ground-breaking study confirmed that a virtual health coach
diet and physical activity intervention is feasible for older adults
and leads to sizable health behavior change and improvements
in body composition. Future research examining artificially
intelligent interventions at scale, and for other health purposes,
is warranted.
