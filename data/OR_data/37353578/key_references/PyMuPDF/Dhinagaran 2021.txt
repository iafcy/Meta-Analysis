Abstract
Background: The rising incidence of chronic diseases is a growing concern, especially in Singapore, which is one of the
high-income countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes. Interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes have
been proven to be effective in reducing the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, but their in-person delivery may not be feasible
on a large scale. Novel technologies such as conversational agents are a potential alternative for delivering behavioral interventions
that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes to the public.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using a conversational agent promoting healthy
lifestyle behavior changes in the general population in Singapore.
Methods: We performed a web-based, single-arm feasibility study. The participants were recruited through Facebook over 4
weeks. The Facebook Messenger conversational agent was used to deliver the intervention. The conversations focused on diet,
exercise, sleep, and stress and aimed to promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes and improve the participants’ knowledge of
diabetes. Messages were sent to the participants four times a week (once for each of the 4 topics of focus) for 4 weeks. We assessed
the feasibility of recruitment, defined as at least 75% (150/200) of our target sample of 200 participants in 4 weeks, as well as
retention, defined as 33% (66/200) of the recruited sample completing the study. We also assessed the participants’ satisfaction
with, and usability of, the conversational agent. In addition, we performed baseline and follow-up assessments of quality of life,
diabetes knowledge and risk perception, diet, exercise, sleep, and stress.
Results: We recruited 37.5% (75/200) of the target sample size in 1 month. Of the 75 eligible participants, 60 (80%) provided
digital informed consent and completed baseline assessments. Of these 60 participants, 56 (93%) followed the study through till
completion. Retention was high at 93% (56/60), along with engagement, denoted by 50% (30/60) of the participants communicating
with the conversational agent at each interaction. Acceptability, usability, and satisfaction were generally high. Preliminary
efficacy of the intervention showed no definitive improvements in health-related behavior.
Conclusions: The delivery of a conversational agent for healthy lifestyle behavior change through Facebook Messenger was
feasible and acceptable. We were unable to recruit our planned sample solely using the free options in Facebook. However,
participant retention and conversational agent engagement rates were high. Our findings provide important insights to inform the
design of a future randomized controlled trial.

Introduction
Background
In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the incidence
of chronic disease, especially among the younger population
[1]. These chronic diseases include obesity and type 2 diabetes
[1]. In terms of diabetes prevalence, Singapore, with 600,000
adults living with diabetes, ranks second among high-income
countries, and obesity levels are also on the rise [2]. In addition,
34% of the men and 39% of the women in Singapore do not
reach the weekly target of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
activity per week, leaving people at higher risk of developing
diseases such as diabetes [3]. People with diabetes live shorter
lives—by at least 10 years—and have a lower quality of life
(QoL) than those without diabetes [4,5]. Prediabetes, a precursor
to diabetes, affected 15.5% of the Singaporean adults in 2010
(ie, 1 in 7), and this figure is estimated to increase to 24.9% by
2035 [6]. Prediabetes increases the risk of heart disease, and if
untreated, over time, most people with prediabetes transition to
diabetes [7]. Research has shown that lifestyle interventions
(such as increasing physical activity and eating a healthy diet)
delivered by trained health care professionals can help to
promote healthy weight loss [8-10]. In addition, lifestyle change
through high-risk and population-based approaches were also
directly associated with a reduction in the incidence of type 2
diabetes, accentuating the efficacy of healthy lifestyle behavior
change for diabetes prevention [8].
Achieving healthy lifestyle behavior changes independently
can be challenging, and support from experts such as dietitians
or exercise physiologists has been shown to be more effective
[8]. However, access to experts at a population level may not
be feasible or affordable. A potentially more accessible
alternative to in-person support and supervision could be novel
digital health interventions such as conversational agents.
Conversational agents, or chatbots, are computer programs
designed to mimic human-to-human conversations in the form
of either text messaging or verbal discourse [11]. The heightened
accessibility, personalization, and efficiency that conversational
agents offer highlight the potential for conversational agents to
improve patient care [11-13]. Conversational agents enable
2-way communication, and their text- or speech-based method
of communication makes them suitable for a variety of target
populations, ranging from young children to older people. The
application of conversational agents in health care is gaining
traction in a number of medical fields, including health care
service provision, chronic disease management, and patient
education [14]. They can be delivered through a variety of
means: messaging apps, individual apps, or even standalone
devices [14].
Singapore is a technologically savvy country, and citizens avidly
use messaging apps. In addition, Singapore’s ministry of health
has proposed the increasing use of conversational agents in
health care in tackling issues such as the rising chronic disease
burden and the aging population [15] that can lead to more
primary care appointments. The ministry envisions a near future
where a conversational agent can collect a patient’s history from
them before their consultation, streamlining the primary care
visit and thus cutting down waiting times. This makes Singapore
an ideal place for the evaluation of novel mobile health
interventions such as conversational agents. Moreover, health
programs delivered over the internet have shown success, as
exemplified by web-based interventions for smoking [16],
alcohol intake [17], sexual health [18], cancer screening [19],
physical activity [20], and diet modifications [21]. The ubiquity
of the internet makes these programs easily accessible to a
diverse group.
Objective
The evidence for the use of conversational agents for healthy
lifestyle behavior change from trials is limited. The feasibility
and acceptability of implementing and evaluating the use of
novel interventions are essential for informing potential future
trials. Correspondingly, we aim to assess the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the use of
conversational agents for healthy lifestyle behavior changes in
the general population in Singapore.
Methods
Approval and Consent
This web-based single-arm feasibility study was approved by
the Nanyang Technological University Ethics Committee
(IRB-2018-11-032). All participants signed their digital
informed consent before embarking on the study.
Participants
Participants were eligible if they were aged above 21 years,
were Singapore citizens or permanent residents, owned a
smartphone, and had a Facebook Messenger (Facebook, Inc)
account. Prospective participants were excluded if they were
pregnant or had any of the following conditions: cancer, chronic
liver disease, chronic kidney disease, a neurodegenerative
condition, heart disease, stroke, a physical disability,
hypertension, or a condition that does not allow for regular
physical activity. Eligibility was confirmed by having
participants complete an eligibility questionnaire, after which
they were asked to provide informed consent on a digital form
sent to them through email.
Recruitment
The participants were recruited on the web through Facebook
in August-September 2019. A digital poster listing the study
aims and eligibility criteria was uploaded on relevant Facebook
pages focused on healthy living, such as Singapore fitness and
health community and Singapore healthy cooking. In addition,
we used snowballing in our recruitment; therefore, participants
were also procured through redistribution of our study poster
through messaging apps or through word of mouth.

Intervention
The conversational agent was designed to be used on Facebook
Messenger using a free web-based tool, Chatfuel [22]. A
research associate (AS) and a PhD student (DAD) developed
the script for the program and performed the input. The
intervention focused on diabetes and prediabetes knowledge,
diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress management. These
were the topics of focus identified in other diabetes prevention
programs targeting lifestyle change [23-25].
The content was informed by existing evidence-based sources
of information, including clinical guidelines and systematic
reviews. Advice on improving sleep quality was generated from
published evidence reporting on techniques and successful
interventions for sleep disorders [26]. The domain on stress was
informed by distance learning–based stress management
techniques identified from a review of existing studies that
described methods to reduce stress and improve health [27].
Pertinent nutritional advice for individuals with prediabetes was
obtained from authenticated government health portals and other
validated health and nutrition webpages [28]. The collated
advice was then compartmentalized into themes, which
translated into the topic of focus for each interaction between
conversational agent and user (Multimedia Appendix 1
[8,26,27,29-53]). The content for the section on physical activity
was informed by advice on the recommended duration and
intensity of exercise from Singapore’s Health Promotion Board
[28]. Validated fitness routines were then presented as part of
the conversation as methods to achieve the necessary level of
fitness [29]. Examples of conversational exchanges between
the conversational agent and users are presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1. A representation of what the interactions between Precilla and users entailed.
We also followed the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation,
Behavior model of behavior to guide the development of the
intervention [54]. This model posits that to exhibit a particular
behavior (B), the participant must be physically and
psychologically capable (C), have sufficient social and physical
opportunities (O) to perform the behavior, and must have the
desire or need to do so—motivation (M). This was important
in determining the inclusion criteria for the intervention (eg,
physically fit with no comorbidities) and in conversation
designing.
The content was mostly presented in the form of text,
supplemented with some images to make the conversational
agent more engaging and to enhance the user experience. These
images were obtained from free-to-use sources or photographs
taken by our study team members. To further contribute to a
positive user experience that mimicked human interaction, the

conversational agent was given a name, Precilla, and it
displayed human-like characteristics such as in the tone of
speech, profile picture, and through using the typing function
for messages. From here onward, we use Precilla to refer to the
conversational agent used in our pilot study.
The intervention was scheduled to last for 4 weeks, whereby
participants would receive 4 messages per week, (every other
day), 1 for each topic (diet, exercise, sleep, and stress). A sample
of the dialog tree is presented in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Procedure
An overview of the study workflow is demonstrated in Figure
2. Interested individuals were first required to complete an
eligibility questionnaire. The eligible participants then provided
informed consent, after which they were requested to complete
a baseline questionnaire on a web-based tool, REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) [55].
The questionnaire obtained general information regarding
demographics as well as data on diet, physical activity, sleep,
and stress.
Figure 2. Study workflow.
The actual pilot study lasted for 4 weeks. Upon completion of
the piloting period, the participants were required to complete
a follow-up questionnaire that contained all the details outlined
in the baseline questionnaire, with some additional questions
on conversational agent usability and their overall satisfaction
with the study. Interested participants also had an opportunity
to take part in a follow-up interview to share their views on the
conversational agent, their experience while taking part in this
web-based study, as well as their thoughts on points of
improvement.
Outcomes
Primary Outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest for this study were the
feasibility of recruitment and retention of participants,
acceptability of the intervention, and participant engagement
with the intervention.
Feasibility of Recruitment and Retention
Feasibility in this study was determined by recruitment and
retention. Feasibility of recruitment was defined as the ability
of the researchers to recruit at least 75% (150/200) of the target
sample on the web using Facebook within a 1-month period.
Feasibility of retaining participants was defined as at least 32.7%
(49/150) of the recruited participants completing the study.
Acceptability of the Intervention
The acceptability of Precilla was measured through questions
on usability and satisfaction in the follow-up questionnaire.
Questions were asked on the participants’ overall satisfaction
with Precilla, their likelihood of using Precilla again and
recommending it to others, as well as the impact of the
interactions on their health.
The usability questionnaire was split into 2 sections; the
questions in section 1 related to how participants perceived the
content of Precilla’s input. They were required to provide a
rating for each statement from the following options: strongly
agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Questions
were asked on ease of use, enjoyment, long-term use of Precilla,
and language, as well as motivation to make healthier food
choices, exercise, change sleeping habits, and better manage
stress.
The questions in section 2 were concerned with the usability of
Precilla and its associated delivery methods. The participants
were provided with the same options to choose from as in
section 1, and they were asked to share their opinions on the
mode of communication (buttons, text, images, etc), the
suitability of Facebook Messenger as a channel of
communication, the number of messages sent, the timing of
messages, and Precilla’s personality.
Participants’ Engagement
A further measure of acceptability of the intervention was the
participants’engagement with Precilla. Data on this aspect was
collected manually by analyzing individual conversations
between Precilla and the participants on Facebook Messenger.
This involved noting down the duration of interactions and
counting the number of complete, incomplete, and nil
interactions. Immediate responses were defined as interactions
made by the user within an hour of message receipt. We also
collected data directly from Chatfuel analytics, such as user
retention, free text typed by users (such as questions or random
utterances), and the total number of attempted interactions with
Precilla. In addition, the technological savviness of the study
population was gauged by asking the participants to rate their
own technological competency on a scale from 1 to 10.
Secondary Outcomes
Our secondary outcomes were related to the efficacy of the
intervention with regard to the participants’ QoL, diabetes
knowledge, diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress over 4
weeks.
QoL was measured using the short form version of the QoL
Enjoyment 
and 
Satisfaction 
Questionnaire 
[56]. 
The
questionnaire comprises 14 items that are rated on a 5-point
scale that indicates the degree of enjoyment or satisfaction
experienced during the past week. The total score for the 14
items, which cover the topics of work, social life, health, and
overall well-being, ranges from 14 to 70. A percentage of the
maximum score is also reported; for example, if a participant

scores 20, the percentage—29% (20/70)—is also reported. The
last 2 questions on medication adherence and overall life
satisfaction were reported as percentages (Multimedia Appendix
3).
The knowledge questionnaire had 3 separate sections. Section
1 was concerned with participants’ knowledge about healthy
living, prediabetes, and diabetes; section 2 asked for their
perceptions on how healthy their lifestyle is and the likelihood
of their developing diabetes; section 3 tested their knowledge
of risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The questionnaire was derived
from an adaptation of questions presented by the Michigan
Diabetes Research Centre [57]. The questionnaire was adapted
such that, in section 1, questions regarding the definitions of
diabetes and prediabetes were added to test participants’
knowledge of these conditions. In section 2, the wording of
some questions about participants’ efforts to make healthy
lifestyle behavior changes in the past year was adapted to obtain
more detail in their responses from just yes or no to a scaled
format. In section 3, some risk factors that were not applicable
to the Singaporean context were removed (eg, being Asian
American, Hispanic, or African American).
The participants’diets were assessed based on an adaptation of
the Food Frequency Questionnaire where questions were asked
on the frequency of daily intake of vegetables, fruits, fried foods,
and sweetened drinks [58]. Physical activity was assessed using
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which
was adapted specifically for use in this study [59]. Questions
were asked on the intensity of exercise (vigorous, moderate, or
light), the frequency of physical activity (in days per week),
and the length of each session (in minutes). Only sessions lasting
at least 10 minutes qualified as physical activity. In line with
IPAQ scoring, a metabolic equivalent of task (MET) score was
calculated. The MET score represented the amount of energy
expended when carrying out physical activity. For consistency,
walking was given a score of 3.3 METs, moderate physical
activity 4 METs, and vigorous physical activity 8 METs. To
calculate MET minutes per week, the MET value was multiplied
by the minutes for which the activity was carried out and again
by the number of days in the week that the activity was
undertaken. As some participants provided a range for their
responses, for consistency, a mean value was used for the
calculation. For example, for number of days, that is, 1-3 days,
the mean was calculated as 2. For session length, that is, 10-20
minutes, the mean was calculated as 15.
A MET score of 600 METs per week indicated that an individual
was moderately physically active, whereas 1500 METs per week
indicated a high level of physical activity. Any score that did
not qualify as moderate or high was considered an indication
of a low level of physical activity.
Sleep scoring was done using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI) questionnaire [60]. A score of 0 indicated excellent sleep
quality, whereas 10 indicated severely poor sleep quality. Poor
sleep quality was defined as participants with a global PSQI
score higher than 5. The stress level of the participants was
gauged using the Perceived Stress Scale, where it was possible
to receive a score between 0 and 40 [61]. Scores ranging from
0 to 13 were considered low perceived stress, from 14 to 26
moderate perceived stress, and from 27 to 40 high perceived
stress.
Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted on the data collected at baseline
and follow-up (Table 1). The participant responses on
satisfaction and usability were presented as percentages of each
option on a Likert scale (eg, strongly agree, disagree, much
better than before, or neither better nor worse). The participant
outcomes for QoL, knowledge, physical activity, sleep, and
stress were all presented as pre- and postscores using the
individualized scoring system of each questionnaire.

baseline and follow-up were presented, accompanied by 95%
CIs [62].
Results
Recruitment and Retention
A total of 136 individuals expressed initial interest in
participating in the study; however, 9 (6.6%) were ineligible
because of comorbidities or because they had not installed
Facebook Messenger on their smartphone, and a further 52
(38.2%) completed the screening questionnaire but did not
proceed to provide informed consent, leaving 75 (55.1%)
participants eligible for participation. Of these 75 participants,
60 (80%) completed baseline assessments, and of these 60, 56
(93%) completed the follow-up questionnaires (Figure 3).

Satisfaction
Of the 56 participants who followed the study through till
completion, 52 (92%) were moderately or very satisfied with
Precilla, 30 (54%) thought that their likelihood of recommending
Precilla to others would be somewhat likely, 32 (57%) felt that
the likelihood of their opting to use Precilla again for personal
use would also be somewhat likely, and, finally, 29 (51%)
posited that their health was somewhat better or much better
than before.
Usability
The agree and strongly agree responses exceeded 50% (28/56)
for all the questions relating to Precilla’s acceptability, except
for question 5, “Chatting with Precilla motivated me to change
unhealthy sleeping habits,” where the collective response in
agreement (agree and strongly agree) was only 46% (26/56)
(Figure 4). The smallest percentage of disagreement was for
questions 1 and 8, indicating that most of the participants (55/56,
98%) found the chat easy to use and thought that Precilla used
simple language and was easy to talk to. The neutral response
was a common selection by participants for questions 2-7.
Figure 4. Participants’ opinions of Precilla’s usability and acceptability.
Of the 56 participants, 37 (67%) agreed that Facebook
Messenger was an appropriate medium to deliver the messages
sent by Precilla. The remaining participants were either neutral
or disagreed. Telegram and WhatsApp were proposed as
potential alternative delivery media. Of the 56 participants, 9
(15%) thought that the number of messages exchanged with
Precilla was too high, and they would have preferred the
intervention to deliver fewer messages; 12 (21%) disagreed that
12 PM was the most appropriate time to receive messages,
whereas the remaining 44 (79%) either agreed, strongly agreed,
or were neutral (Figure 4) and indicated a preference for
interacting with Precilla after work, in the evening or before
bedtime. Some indicated specific timings such as 5 PM, 8 PM,
or 10 PM, and 1 participant suggested 9 AM or during the
morning commute to work. There were no disagreements to
statement 13 (“I liked images and videos in Precilla’s
messages”) and minimal disagreement for statements 14 (5/56,
9%) and 15 (4/56, 7%) on the inclusion of more visual
components and Precilla’s personality, respectively. Most
participants did not find Precilla to be very human-like and
could clearly tell that they were communicating with a
conversational agent. Of the 56 participants, 3 (5%) suggested
some degree of personalization, whereby Precilla’s messages
should be initiated when the user prompted the conversational
agent and not the other way around.
Conversational Agent Engagement Data
The number of complete, incomplete, and absent interactions
were noted (Figure 5). In addition, the number of immediate
and delayed interactions were also counted (Figure 6). Some
interactions were started but not completed. The reasons for not
completing interactions are presented in Multimedia Appendix
4.

Figure 5. Percentage of total weekly interactions that were complete, incomplete, or absent (not attempted at all).
Figure 6. Number of immediate and delayed interactions between participants and Precilla for each category.
All the conversations were completed by at least 50% (>30/56)
of the participants consistently over the period of the study. The
number of participants who completed interactions from start
to finish exceeded 71% (40/56) for 56% (9/16) of the
interactions, denoting high engagement with the conversational
agent. Similarly, at least 40% (<22/56) of the participants
responded immediately to the conversational agent 75% (12/16
interactions) of the time, even in the last week of the study,
denoting consistently high conversational agent engagement.
The participants were restricted to a predetermined list of options
when providing responses to the questions asked or information
provided. A frequent cause of disruption to the conversation
flow was participants typing free text, which led them off track.
This resulted in their being redirected to the main menu, which
they potentially found confusing, or they were reluctant to go
through the whole conversation flow again and, hence, failed
to complete that interaction. The average duration of each
interaction was in the 2- to 5-minute range. More data on
conversational agent engagement are presented in Multimedia
Appendix 4.
QoL Score
The 14-item QoL score was 54 (SD 6.90) at baseline and 53
(SD 6.46) at follow-up (mean difference 0.95; 95% CI −1.51
to 3.41). Of the participants taking medication (10 at baseline,
17 at follow up), participants rated adherence as fair (baseline

5/10, 50%; follow-up 6/17, 35%), good (baseline 5/10, 50%;
follow-up 9/17, 53%), and very good (baseline 0/10, 0%;
follow-up 2/17, 12%). The participants rated overall life
satisfaction as fair (baseline 16/60, 27%; follow-up 12/56, 21%),
good (baseline 35/60, 58%; follow-up 33/56, 59%), or very
good (baseline 9/60, 15%; follow-up 10/56, 18%), and 2% (1/56)
of participants reported poor overall life satisfaction at
follow-up.
Knowledge
The scoring system for the questionnaires meant that lower
scores denoted better knowledge outcomes (sections 1 and 3)
and lower perceived risk of diabetes (section 2). In section 1,
the scores were 7 (SD 1.37) at baseline and 6 (SD 0.93) at
follow-up (mean difference 0.52, 95% CI 0.09-0.95); the
possible score range was 6-18. In section 2, the scores were 28
(SD 2.7) at baseline and 27 (SD 3.5) at follow-up (mean
difference 0.9, 95% CI −0.25 to 2.05); the possible score range
was 12-48. In section 3, the scores were 10 (SD 4.11) at baseline
and 9 (SD 2.2) at follow-up (mean difference 1.0, 95% CI −0.23
to 2.23); the possible score range was 8-32.
Diet
The number of individuals consuming vegetables at least once
a day was 27% (16/60) at baseline and 29% (16/56) at follow-up.
Similarly, the percentage of participants having three portions
of fruit per day was 3% (2/60) at baseline and 7% (4/56) at
follow-up. With regard to intake of unhealthy food comprising
sweetened beverages and fried food or snacks, the almost never
consumption category for sweetened beverages was 38% (23/60)
at baseline and 45% (25/56) at follow-up, whereas for fried food
and snacks, the almost never consumption category was 25%
(15/60) at baseline and 30% (17/56) at follow-up.
Physical Activity
The median METs-per-week score was 857 at baseline (IQR
902) and 765 (IQR 882) at follow-up. The average categorical
score remained constant from baseline to follow-up where the
average exercise intensity was moderate. The mean time spent
sitting was 439 minutes at baseline and 406 minutes at
follow-up. In addition, the median amount of moderate and
vigorous physical activity was the same, 30 min per week (IQR
90) at baseline and 50 min per week (IQR 90) at follow-up.
Sleep
According to the scoring method, a lower score indicated better
sleep. The mean PSQI score was 4.38 (SD 2.36) at baseline and
4.43 (SD 2.45) at follow-up (mean difference −0.05, 95% CI
−0.93 to 0.83). The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 28%
(16/60) at baseline and 30% (16/56) at follow-up. The
participants who reported sleeping for less than 7 hours were
classified as short sleepers; 82% (49/60) were short sleepers at
baseline, whereas 88% (49/56) were short sleepers at follow-up.
Stress
The scoring for stress meant that lower scores denoted lower
stress levels and higher scores denoted higher stress levels. The
mean score at baseline was 17 (SD 5.13), denoting a moderate
stress level, which was maintained even at follow-up, mean 16
(SD 5.1; mean difference 0.73; 95% CI −1.15 to 2.61).
Discussion
Principal Findings
To our knowledge, this is the first web-based pilot study to test
the feasibility and acceptability of a healthy lifestyle behavior
change conversational agent in the Singaporean population. In
this web-based study, which used Facebook Messenger as a
delivery medium for a conversational agent targeting healthy
lifestyle behavior change in the Singaporean population, we
managed to recruit 37.5% (75/200) of the target sample size in
1 month. Retention was high at 93% (56/60); conversational
agent engagement was also high, with all the conversations
being completed by at least 50% (28/56) of the participants
consistently. Furthermore, at least 40% (22/56) of the
participants responded almost immediately 75% (12/16) of the
time. Acceptability, usability, and satisfaction were also
generally high. In general, we were able to conduct the study
with high fidelity, and each phase ensued as planned. Any
definitive signs of improvement in QoL, knowledge, diet,
physical activity, sleep, and stress would have to be studied in
more detail in a future study of effectiveness.
The secondary outcomes in the study were measured using
validated scales, namely, the short form version of the QoL
Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, PSQI, Perceived
Stress Scale, Food Frequency Questionnaire, and IPAQ. We
took note that although these questionnaires have not necessarily
been optimized for the Singaporean population, these
well-established scales were chosen to ensure a certain level of
validity and reliability in our results.
Comparisons With Existing Literature
Conversational agents have been used for healthy behavior
change; however, they have been used mainly in niche areas
such as smoking cessation, alcohol misuse treatment, and the
promotion of physical activity in sedentary populations [63-65].
The application presented in this study is very comprehensive,
novel, and relevant to the general population in Singapore.
The outcome measures were similar to those in other studies
looking at the acceptability of conversational agents in health
care, and acceptability was high in other studies as well as in
this feasibility trial. Previous studies noted high response rates
(ie, conversational agent engagement) and strongly agree or
agree scores for user-friendliness, appropriateness, consistency,
and speed of response, as in our study [66]. The other measures
in prior studies that denoted acceptability were high perceived
ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use, similar to our
measures of ease and enjoyment of use, motivating change in
unhealthy habits, and intention to use Precilla again or
recommend it to others, respectively [67,68].
In another study using a health behavior change conversational
agent, high compliance was attributed to a rewarding game
system [68]. Considering the slight decrease in weekly
compliance in our feasibility study (43/56, 77% completed
interactions in week 1 vs 39/56, 69% in week 4), it may be
worth exploring the possibility of introducing a gaming or
reward component in future iterations. Personalization has
previously been met with positive user reception, for example,

by providing personalized advice to maintain target blood
glucose levels or personalized reminders for taking medication
[69]. Similarly, personalized content and message timing
delivery should be implemented in future versions of Precilla,
considering the preference indicated by users.
It has previously been indicated that users tend to prefer
interacting with female conversational agents, as evidenced by
Siri, Cortana, and Alexa, for example [70]. In addition, the study
by Brahnam et al [71] has explained that in the field of
human-computer interaction, “the standard of believability has
become inextricably linked to gender personification, especially
female personification.” As such, we chose to use Precilla and
reinforced her character with a profile picture.
Views on conversational agent personality have been mixed,
depending on the function of the agent. For example, participants
appreciated an empathetic demeanor from conversational agents
for e-therapy, in contrast to the participants’ indifference to
Precilla’s humanity in this pilot study, where she played more
of an impersonal, informative or educational role [72]. It may
be that the conversational agent’s purpose determines how
important the degree of humanity is.
Another aspect of this study was the effectiveness of participant
recruitment through social media. We chose a goal of 75%
(150/200) recruitment rate based on other studies involving
mobile health trials having achieved an application rate of 86%
(70/81) for enrollment through Facebook or an 85.1% (605/711)
response rate to Facebook advertisements in 45 days [73,74].
Although our study only yielded a recruitment rate of 37.5%
(75/200) in the given period, it aligns quite appropriately with
the recruitment rates of 33%, 30%, or 37.7% in other web-based
mobile apps or Facebook trials [75-77]. Hence, our 37.5%
(75/200) recruitment rate seems to indicate feasibility regarding
the recruitment of participants in the general population in
Singapore for a web-based conversational agent intervention
delivered through Facebook.
A systematic review accentuated the effectiveness of Facebook
as a recruitment tool [78]. It was suggested that on average,
studies allowed a 3-month recruitment period, and Facebook
was found to be more efficient than traditional methods (print,
radio, television, email, or word of mouth) because of the
reduced costs, shorter recruitment times, and ability to connect
with harder-to-reach populations. In future studies, we may
need to consider complementing our current no-fee Facebook
approach with advertisements or other recruitment methods, as
well as potentially a longer recruitment period.
Implications and Future Research
In terms of the recruitment, we noticed some attrition among
the eligible participants just before provision of informed
consent. As the only communication was through email from
an institutional email address, the uncertainty involved in remote
participation, such as never meeting the study team in person,
could have been a cause for the participants’apprehension. This
lack of direct engagement may have led to some participants
not feeling comfortable sharing their digital signature with us
because of data protection and privacy concerns. In future
research studies, a mix of a digital recruitment approach and
face-to-face exchange (possibly in the form of recruitment or
debriefing) could provide participants with an opportunity to
ask questions and validate the legitimacy of the study.
Regarding the preliminary efficacy, minimal improvements
were observed in the participants’ knowledge, stress, and diet,
whereas there was a lack of improvement in QoL and sleep and
no change in physical activity. The dearth of significant
improvement in these areas could be attributed to the content
and delivery not being adequately designed to target
effectiveness and, possibly, the short study length (4 weeks),
which may not have been sufficient for any noteworthy changes
to have been observed. Furthermore, this study was not designed
to test the effectiveness of the intervention, and this should be
explored in more detail in future iterations.
The participants indicated that they could clearly tell that Precilla
was indeed a conversational agent. This was beneficial in
confirming Precilla’s identity and in reducing expectations from
users that the conversational agent should think, function, and
react like a human being. It was interesting to note that although
the participants did not find Precilla to be very human-like, they
still rated the conversational agent highly in terms of content,
usability, general acceptability, ease of use, visual components,
and so on. This shows that, for this study population and for a
conversational agent with Precilla’s functions and capabilities,
acceptability was not dependent on the anthropomorphism of
the conversational agent.
The conversational agent engagement data revealed that there
was a slight decrease in the number of interactions that the
participants completed fully with each successive week. It is
possible that the content and delivery methods could have come
across as repetitive because we provided a review of take-home
points from the previous interaction from week 2 onwards.
Alternatively, perhaps the routine that Precilla followed made
the intervention very regimented, not leaving much room for
spontaneity in the form of varied message timings or even
variations in the ways that users could respond to Precilla, for
example, using free text. These factors may have contributed
to the decrease in interest over time. Future iterations of Precilla
could explore introducing more novelty and personalization, as
recommended by the participants in the telephone interviews.
The participants shared some points for improvement, including
alternative modes of delivery such as WhatsApp and Telegram,
a possibility of shortening the conversation lengths, and more
personalized timings for message delivery.
Strengths and Limitations
One of the main strengths of the study is the high fidelity in the
delivery of this low-cost, fully web-based feasibility study. We
did not experience any software malfunctions and were able to
implement the intervention as per protocol. The content of the
intervention was evidence based, and it was co-designed with
members of the target population to make the intervention as
relevant to them as possible. We managed to reach a diverse
range of age groups—from 23 to 60 years—using Facebook
without the need to pay for advertising. Although the recruited
sample—recruited 
over 
4 
weeks 
using 
solely
Facebook—consisted of fewer participants than our target size,
it is comparable with those reported in other studies that used

paid Facebook advertisements within the same time frame.
However, the participants were recruited through healthy
living–focused Facebook groups and pages; therefore, these
individuals were already very much invested in healthy lifestyle
behavior change and more likely to use apps and social media.
Furthermore, the participants were Facebook users, capable of
navigating Facebook Messenger, had high technological
competency, and a very high level of tertiary education. As
such, our findings may not be generalizable to other
demographic groups such as older people; individuals with
lower education levels; or those not active on, or familiar with,
social media. However, this study did largely cover the general
characteristics of the average Singaporean, making the findings
very much valuable and relevant. A further limitation is that
although we used validated outcome measurement tools, all
outcomes were self-reported by the participants. Furthermore,
although these measurement scales are well reputed and
established, they were not necessarily optimized for use in the
Singaporean population. Finally, we used a single-arm pre-post
study design, which is acceptable for a feasibility study but does
not allow for assessment of the effectiveness of the intervention.
Conclusions
This web-based feasibility study showed that the delivery of a
conversational agent for healthy lifestyle behavior change using
Facebook Messenger is, to a large extent, feasible in Singapore.
Precilla is a low-cost intervention that was popular among the
participants and was well received, with most participants being
satisfied with the intervention and prepared to recommend it to
friends and family. This study demonstrated the ability to
conduct a web-based trial to assess the impact of a novel
intervention. Our preliminary data on the acceptability of the
intervention showed the need for further enhancement of this
conversational 
agent 
intervention, 
potentially 
through
humanization of the agent and personalization of the messaging.
Such an intervention needs to be evaluated with a rigorous study
design and larger sample size.
