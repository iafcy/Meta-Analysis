Abstract
Objective
The present nonrandomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptabil-
ity, and preliminary efﬁcacy of a tailored text message intervention for increasing adolescent physi-
cal activity, as compared with passive monitoring. Methods
Forty adolescents (13–18 years old)
received either a tailored text messaging intervention (Network Underwritten Dynamic Goals
Engine [NUDGE]; N ¼ 20), or participated in an attention-control condition (N ¼ 20), for 20 days.
Physical activity was measured for all participants via continuous accelerometry. Frequency analy-
ses were conducted on program usage and satisfaction ratings to evaluate feasibility and accept-
ability, and multilevel models were used to evaluate the efﬁcacy hypotheses. Results
The vast
majority of participants (90%) reported being very or mostly satisﬁed with the NUDGE program
and rated their enjoyment as above average. The intervention group was estimated to spend an av-
erage of 20.84 more minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity relative to the
attention-control group (b ¼ 20.84, SE ¼ 8.19). Exploratory analyses revealed that the intervention
group also engaged in 82 fewer minutes of sedentary time per day on average, although this effect
was not signiﬁcant due to the large variability in sedentary time (b ¼ 81.98, SE ¼ 46.86).
Conclusions
The NUDGE tailored text messaging intervention was feasible, acceptable, and ef-
ﬁcacious in increasing physical activity in this sample. Findings warrant additional evaluation of
NUDGE as both a standalone physical activity intervention or as part of a multicomponent
package.

Introduction
It is recommended that adolescents obtain 60 min of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily.
This practice can promote overall health and help to
prevent problems such as cardiovascular disease, dia-
betes, and obesity (Danaei et al., 2009). Interestingly,
many young children engage in adequate MVPA
(Nader et al., 2008). However, marked declines in
health promoting physical activity and increases in
sedentary time are observed around age 13 and
worsen through adulthood, at which point only 1 out
of 5 Americans meet the 2008 Physical Activity
Guidelines (DHHS, 2008; Nader et al., 2008). Given
the observed rapid decline it is essential to find

acceptable and efficacious intervention approaches
that can facilitate adolescents’ engagement in more
MVPA, which may translate into improved health
over the lifespan.
Adolescents are high adopters of smartphone tech-
nologies and are generally comfortable with communi-
cation via text message (Lenhart, 2015). In fact,
representative surveys suggest that the average adoles-
cent sends 30 text messages per day and texting is
their dominant mode of communication (Anderson,
2015). A recent meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
efficacy of mobile health interventions for improving
health outcomes, in children and adolescents, and
found that the average overall effect size associated
with these interventions was small, yet statistically sig-
nificant (Fedele et al., 2017). One conclusion from
this work was that very few mHealth studies use a
clear theoretical framework to guide the choice of the
behavior
change
techniques
in
the
intervention.
Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that
consumer-facing mobile applications specifically for
physical activity do not widely employ efficacious
behavior-change techniques (Brannon & Cushing,
2015). Importantly, this runs counter to recent finding
that parents are open to a range of evidence-based be-
havior change techniques embedded in mHealth inter-
ventions, which indicates that the market is receptive
to features that should change behavior (Cushing
et al., 2018).
There is evidence that control theory might be a
powerful framework for designing interventions to
promote physical activity (Michie et al., 2009).
Indeed,
control
theory
interventions
(particularly
those that encourage self-monitoring) have support
for promoting adolescent physical activity (Brannon
& Cushing, 2015). Control theory posits that, individ-
uals achieve goals by monitoring progress toward an
end state, incorporating feedback, and modifying
goals as needed (Carver & Scheier, 1981, 1982).
Michie et al. (2009) found interventions that leveraged
the control theory strategy of self-monitoring with at
least one other behavioral self-regulation component
were significantly more effective than interventions
that did not involve this combination. Broadly, inter-
ventions consistent with control theory use the techni-
ques of goal-setting, self-monitoring of behavior,
receiving
feedback,
and
goal
review
(Carver
&
Scheier, 1981, 1982). Goal setting is typically defined
as a detailed plan of what a person will do that is
time-bound and measurable. Self-monitoring is simply
the act of keeping track of a behavior. Goal review
refers to actively reconsidering previously set goals to
determine if they are still framed in a way that is rele-
vant and reasonable. Feedback can be either a depic-
tion of data that indicates progress toward a goal or
more qualitative commentary on how well or poorly
the person has performed an action. Adolescents are
still developing the ability to self-regulate their own
behavior (Pokhrel et al., 2013). Therefore, tailored
interventions that provide developmentally appropri-
ate external supports for self-regulatory skills consis-
tent with control theory could support long-term
health habits in adolescents (Lansing & Berg, 2014).
Moreover, there is some evidence that interventions
that adapt to the user over time may be more effective
than static interventions (Smyth & Heron, 2016).
Digital interventions offer the potential to leverage
user data within the program to change or “adapt”
the intervention experience based on user inputs. Such
paradigms were originally framed as ecological mo-
mentary interventions, just-in-time interventions, and
in some cases where the rules of the interventions
change over time can be known as just-in-time adap-
tive interventions (Heron & Smyth, 2010; Nahum-
Shani
et
al.,
2016;
Smyth
&
Heron,
2016).
Importantly, such a digital intervention system that
adapts to user input can be easily conceptualized as a
form of feedback control (i.e., the controlled system
from control theory) because the system itself is con-
tinually optimizing its performance based on user
inputs (Rivera et al., 2007).
As one goes about building an adaptive interven-
tion some consideration must be given to how the sys-
tem will be designed. In contrast to large packages
with many active ingredients, the ORBIT (Obesity-
Related Behavioral Intervention Trials) model encour-
ages the smallest intervention possible with the inten-
tion of repurposing efficacious intervention concepts
in larger packages. The advantage of conducting small
scale interventions is that individual elements are
closely tied to theoretical models or empirical evi-
dence. Then, when an intervention succeeds or fails a
clear picture of why it produces an observed effect
emerges from the study (Czajkowski et al., 2015).
Currently, it is unclear if simple prompts—designed in
a manner consistent with control theory—would be ef-
fective on their own in increasing adolescent physical
activity. In large part this is because most studies com-
bine messaging
with
other intervention
elements
(Ludwig et al., 2018).
This study aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptabil-
ity and gather preliminary data on the effect of an
adaptive mHealth intervention in which adolescents
receive messages about physical activity that are tai-
lored based on their recent exercise. Participants are
asked to self-report their physical activity, review
goals in the light of their past performance, set a goal
for the future, and receive feedback on their perfor-
mance. Consistent with the ORBIT model of interven-
tion development, this study was designed with as few
active ingredients as possible to ensure that the mecha-
nisms of action would be unambiguous provided that

the intervention has an effect (Czajkowski et al.,
2015). It was hypothesized that adolescents who re-
ceived a tailored text messaging intervention (inter-
vention
group)
that
involved
goal-setting,
self-
monitoring, feedback, and goal re-evaluation would
engage in more physical activity over a 20-day study
period than adolescents in the passive monitoring
group (attention control group). Although not a spe-
cific target of the intervention, an exploratory analysis
of the intervention effect on sedentary time was also
performed.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Because adolescence (13–18) is a time of declining
physical activity, forty adolescents, ages 13–18 years
old, participated in the study (see Table I). A total of
20 participants made up the intervention group
(Network
Underwritten
Dynamic
Goals
Engine;
NUDGE), whereas 20 were in the attention-control
group. The attention control group were drawn from
a larger sample that participated in an ecological mo-
mentary assessment study assessing the relationship
between state and trait psychological variables and
physical activity. Attention control participants were
matched to NUDGE participants on age, sex, and
race/ethnicity, with priority given in the order the vari-
ables are listed. Participants from each study were
recruited using the same procedures (i.e., through
flyers posted in a midwestern city) and the respective
protocols (i.e., study measures and duration), apart
from the NUDGE intervention, were equivalent. The
protocols were approved by the local institutional re-
view board. Adolescents and/or their parents con-
tacted the research lab to express interest in the study,
completed a brief screening process, and were sched-
uled for an initial lab visit. Inclusion criteria were: (a)
age range of 13–18 years old, (b) able to read at grade
level in English. Exclusion criteria included : (a) signif-
icant uncorrected visual impairments, (b) any physical
impairments that limited activity, and (c) independent
living without a caregiver (e.g., 18-year-old college
undergraduates living in a dormitory; Figure 1).
Procedures
Recruitment procedures as well as study procedures
for the intervention and attention control groups were
similar. Participants were recruited using flyers posted
in a midwestern community. Postings were made at
businesses, places of worship, and schools when
allowed. Flyers indicated that participants would be
asked to complete surveys, wear sensors, and would
be compensated financially for the time they devoted
to the project. Informed consent was obtained along
with assent if the child was a minor. The research
team recruited participants in the attention-control
group from 2015 to 2016 and participants in the
NUDGE group in 2017. Recruitment occurred across
all four seasons of the year.
Enrollment Visit
Parent-adolescent dyads attended a scheduled visit in
the lab and completed an informed consent and assent
process, respectively.1 They completed a set of base-
line questionnaires pertaining to physical activity, die-
tary behavior, and mood on a lab computer. These
measures
included
a
demographics
survey,

Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Varni et al.,
2001), Power of Food Scale (Lowe et al., 2009), and
the Children’s Report of Sleep Patterns (Meltzer et al.,
2013). Research staff provided the adolescent with a
smartphone for use in the study and explained instruc-
tions for usage.2 Consistent with other studies in
youth (Heron et al., 2017) we limited the features of
the smartphones given to participants to only those
necessary to complete the study (i.e., SMS capability
and access to the survey app). Each participant chose
four times to complete a daily survey that would take
about 3–5 min. These daily surveys included the
Positive and Negative Affect Scale-Child Version
(Ebesutani et al., 2012), the three highest loading
items for five of the subscales from the Profile of
Mood States scale (depression, anxiety, anger, energy,
fatigue, McNair et al., 1971), questions about the par-
ticipant’s environment, dietary intake, social support
for exercise (Sallis et al., 1987), and hedonic hunger
(Mitchell et al., 2016). Control participants received
the same contacts as the intervention condition (i.e.,
same surveys). In addition to the control procedures,
NUDGE participants provided convenient times to re-
ceive intervention text messages. NUDGE participants
were trained to report MVPA in minutes. In the train-
ing, we defined exercise as activities such as running,
swimming, or brisk walking that makes it hard to
carry on a conversation. Adolescents in both groups

participants be listed. Because a larger number of measures were
given that are not analyzed in the current report, we list them in the

Participants were provided with a smartphone because our app used
for distributing surveys was unstable on phones it was not pro-
grammed for. For this reason, we gave participants phones so that
we could ensure the app would work properly.

were also provided an accelerometer for tracking
physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) to be worn
on their non-dominant wrist throughout the duration
of the study. The accelerometer did not provide feed-
back on activity to the participant.
Exit Visit
At the end of the 20-day3 study period, all participants
returned to the lab for a scheduled visit to complete
postintervention measures and return the smartphone
and accelerometer. Participants were compensated
$15 for wearing the accelerometer for 24 h on 18 out
of 20 study days; and, an extra $25 if the participant
answered all four surveys on at least 17 days.
Attention Control Condition
The attention-control group did not receive the
NUDGE intervention text messages (described below).
Instead, participants completed identical study meas-
ures (enrollment, exit, and daily surveys) in the
NUDGE protocol and wore an accelerometer as well
as a blinded heart rate monitor for the 20-day study
duration. As mentioned previously, the recruitment,
consenting, assessment procedures, and the study pe-
riod for the attention-control study were identical to
the NUDGE protocol. Research staff explained to par-
ticipants that their physical activity would be moni-
tored during the study. Participants in this condition
received no intervention content.
NUDGE Intervention
NUDGE is a chat bot developed for the purposes of
this study. The bot is a server-side computer program
that adapts text messages based on user input with the
goal to promote adolescent physical activity. The plat-
form engages in a chat with users to help them set and
review goals, self-monitor progress, provide feedback
on goal attainment, and revise future goals. The adap-
tive nature of the intervention means that the program
changes the wording of messages, and the ranges of
goals based on user input and self-reported activity
levels. To begin, participants choose a time of day
when they would like to receive a text message to set a
physical activity goal. The goal is then stored over-
night; at a predetermined time the next morning,
NUDGE sends a message reminding the user of their
stored goal (e.g., “Just a friendly reminder that your

exercise goal today is 25 min. I will check in with you
later to see how you did”). Later the same day, the
user is prompted to self-monitor their physical activity
via self-report (e.g., “How much exercise did you get
[in minutes]?”). NUDGE used self-report in this in-
stance because control theory posits that the active
comparison of one’s performance to a goal is essential
in goal attainment. For this reason, the self-report
(even if less accurate than an accelerometer) is desired
over a passive monitoring system (Michie et al.,
2009). The participant replies to the NUDGE bot with
a numerical value representing their accumulated ex-
ercise. The entry is compared against the previously
entered goal value. The NUDGE bot then provides
feedback to the user indicating whether or not their
predefined goal was met and subsequently requests a
new goal (e.g., “This is fantastic! You met your goal!”
or “It looks like you didn’t meet your goal.”). The
maximum allowable goal value was 120 min and the
minimum was 15. In addition, NUDGE only accepts
goal values that were between an investigator defined
range (i.e., 75–125%) of the last self-monitored physi-
cal activity value, so that future performance is tied to
past performance and goals cannot be set too high or
too low to be useful (Wrosch et al., 2003; e.g., “Let’s
set a new exercise goal. Based on what you did this
time [25 min], I think you should choose between 15
and 45 min”). If users exceeded 60 min of self-
reported exercise, the feedback message was modified
to congratulate the user on their healthy level of exer-
cise (e.g., “This is fantastic! You met your goal! You
exercised a healthy amount! Let’s set a new goal be-
tween [75–125% of current MVPA]”).
Measures
Demographics and Anthropometrics
Participants completed a brief demographic question-
naire and their height and weight were measured by
study staff. Body mass index percentile was calculated
based on age and sex, as indicated by the Centers for
Disease Control (Kuczmarski, 2002).
Objective Measure of Activity
Physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB)
were
measured
by
an
accelerometer
(ActiGraph
wGT3X-BT;
Actigraph
LLC,
Pensacola,
FL).
Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer
for 24 h per day on their nondominant wrist during
the study. The accelerometer was used only for pas-
sively monitoring physical activity. The goal was to
use the device only to track outcomes and not as an el-
ement of the intervention. Accelerometers were set to
sample movement at a rate of 30 Hz. Data were proc-
essed using the Actilife software v.6.10.2, and summa-
rized daily measurements of MVPA and the secondary
outcome of SB using the Chandler et al. (2016)
algorithm.
Feasibility and Acceptability
To determine the feasibility of the NUDGE protocol,
we computed the average number of participant-
provided responses per day, messages sent by the
NUDGE bot per day, exchanged messages per day
Figure 1. Flowchart of NUDGE processes.

between participants and the NUDGE bot per day, as
well as the number of unexpected messages (i.e., the
participant texted without receiving a message from
NUDGE) received from participants, and compared
them with expected values based on the protocol. In
addition, we calculated instances of what we describe
as a goal-loop, or occurrences when participants were
unable to set goals within a personally useful range
(i.e., 75-125% of their previous attainment). This oc-
curred when participants continually enter values that
are outside the acceptable range for the algorithm and
indicate lack of understanding of the NUDGE rules,
and
may
reflect
frustration
with
the
system.
Participants completed the Consumer Satisfaction
Questionnaire (CSQ) as a measure acceptability of the
intervention. This consisted of a list of questions ad-
ministered in survey format at the end of the study to
assess participant satisfaction with NUDGE. The
CSQ-8 is comprised of eight items on a 4-point re-
sponse scale (a ¼ .90) and measured general satisfac-
tion with NUDGE as well as quality of program.
Some example items on the CSQ-8 are “how satisfied
are you with the amount of help you have received?”
and “how do you rate the quality of service you
received?” Total satisfaction scores were generated
(based on the sum of individual items) to investigate
acceptability of the program. Participants also com-
pleted two text responses regarding what participants
liked and did not like about the study: “please tell us
what you liked about the study”; and, “please tell us
what you did not like about the study” (Table II).
Data Analysis Plan
To evaluate feasibility and acceptability we evaluate
the mean number of text messages exchanged and the
average value in our acceptability measure. Our a pri-
ori criteria for feasibility and acceptability was that
both values would be above the midpoint of the scale.
To evaluate the efficacy hypotheses, we conducted
multilevel models using SAS PROC MIXED. We ran
two sets of identical models for MVPA and our ex-
ploratory analysis of sedentary time as assessed by ob-
jectively
monitored
accelerometry.
First,
the
dependent variable was entered into a model with no
predictors to allow for the computation of an intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC). Next, we explicitly
modeled an effect of time by fitting dummy codes for
each observation centered at baseline. We fit models
for linear, random linear, quadratic, and random qua-
dratic effects of time. The best fitting and most parsi-
monious model was selected using 2LL difference
tests (Snijders & Bosker, 2011). Group membership
was then entered into the model as a predictor with
the control group centered at zero this was done so
that the interpretation of the effect would be the num-
ber of minutes increase or decrease in the dependent
variable for the intervention group. Finally, a dummy-
coded variable representing weekend and weekdays
was entered into the model as a main effect and inter-
action with group membership. This variable was cen-
tered so that the zero point would represent weekdays.
Finally, we called up conditional effects of the interac-
tion so that we could report on specific parameter esti-
mates (e.g., MVPA levels in intervention participants
on weekdays).
Results
Feasibility
Based on the NUDGE protocol, there should be six
messages exchanged between the NUDGE bot and the
user (e.g., four from NUDGE bot and two from the
user). The average number of participant-provided
responses per day was 1.35, the average number of
sent messages from the NUDGE bot per day was 1.66,
and the average number of exchanged messages per
day was 3. There was a small, but significant decline
in participant engagement with the NUDGE bot
across time (b ¼ 0.02, p ¼ .004). In real terms this
means that by the end of the study participants were
responding to .4 fewer messages than on the first day,
which is a trivial difference. There were 16 occasions
of unexpected messages from participants and 2 occa-
sions of goal-loop frustration (i.e., participants were
not able to set a goal within the acceptable range). We
anticipated
800 days
of
accelerometer
data
and
obtained 799.
Acceptability
The mean satisfaction score from the CSQ-8 was
26.65 (SD ¼ 4.03, range ¼ 16–32). This indicates that
the average participant was satisfied with the interven-
tion. Scores from an individual item, “In an overall,
general sense, how satisfied are you with the services
you have received?,” on the CSQ-8 indicated that
60% of participants were very satisfied, 30% were
mostly satisfied, and 10% were indifferent or dissatis-
fied with the NUDGE program.
Free text responses regarding what participants
liked and disliked about the study were coded to cre-
ate frequencies of common themes in responses. Five
participants commented how the NUDGE program in-
creased their motivation for healthy behaviors, such as
physical activity. Four participants endorsed that
NUDGE facilitated self-reflection and self-monitoring
of physical activity. For example, participants com-
mented how they liked “how it made me think about
exercising”, how “it forced me to look at how much
exercising I was getting” and how it “keeps tabs on
the physical activity I did.” Seventeen participants
commented on the ease of the intervention, the help-
fulness of goal reminders, and the flexibility to

incorporate NUDGE into their daily schedule. Ten
participants indicated some dissatisfaction with the
equipment (e.g., accelerometer) with the majority of
complaints relating to discomfort wearing the device.
MVPA Efficacy
To evaluate the equivalence of the two groups we con-
ducted an independent samples t-test across the two
groups on the first day of the study. There were no
group differences in MVPA at that timepoint. In an
empty multilevel model for MVPA the ICC was .57 in-
dicating that 57% of the variance in MVPA is
between-person and 43% is within-person. In the
models for time, it was established that a random ef-
fect linear model of time fit best and was used for sub-
sequent analyses; this suggests that MVPA increases or
decreases at different rates across study participants
during the study window. Participants in the control
condition averaged 28 min of MVPA. In the final
model, the main effect of group was b ¼ 20.84 (SE ¼
8.19; Table III) indicating that the intervention group
engaged in 21 more minutes of MVPA than the con-
trol group. Moreover, the magnitude of this difference
is more than three quarters of a SD (d ¼ .83). Finally,
day of the week did moderate the intervention effect

more MVPA on weekdays compared with weekends.
Moreover, controls obtained less activity than the in-
tervention group on weekend days.
Sedentary Efficacy
There were no differences in sedentary time across the
two groups on the first day of the study. The empty
model revealed an ICC for sedentary activity of .63.
This indicates that 63% of the variability in SB is
between-person,
whereas
37%
is
within-person.
Again, a random linear effect of time fit the longitudi-
nal data best and was retained for analyses; this again
suggests that participants increased or decreased in
sedentary time at different rates. Participants in the
control condition obtained 725 min of sedentary
time. In the final model, there was a nonsignificant ef-
fect of the intervention on SB (Table IV). The effect
size of the model implied means was d ¼ .40. Day of
the week did not have a significant main effect or in-
teraction for SB.
Discussion
The current nonrandomized controlled trial demon-
strated the initial feasibility, acceptability, and prelim-
inary
efficacy
of
the
NUDGE
text
messaging
intervention. With only three text messages per day
exchanged
on
average,
the
intervention
group
obtained 21 more minutes of MVPA and 82 fewer
minutes of sedentary time. The satisfaction with the
program was high and participant confusion or frus-
tration were low.
In the development of NUDGE, we have used a
minimalist approach to intervention design. Other
valuable physical activity promotion packages are
built on sound theory and contain many intervention
strategies that are hypothesized to produce the treat-
ment effect (Gourlan et al., 2016; King et al., 2013).
Consistent with the ORBIT model of intervention de-
velopment, our approach was to design the smallest
possible intervention that could reasonably produce
an effect (Czajkowski et al., 2015). By linking every
possible text message to an element of control theory,
we hoped to minimize wasted interactions with partic-
ipants, and also reduce the risk of habituation. We at-
tribute the high feasibility and acceptability to, at least
in part, the minimalist approach to design. Given that
participants are asked to use a familiar behavior (i.e.,
text messaging), it was relatively easy for them to
complete the protocol. Moreover, as a result of over-
sampling females, the generalizability of the interven-
tion is enhanced as girls transition more rapidly from
obtaining adequate MVPA in youth to inactivity in ad-
olescence and the effect is more pronounced than for
boys (Nader et al., 2008).
It is important to note that while the aggregate ef-
fect of NUDGE exceeds that found in comparable text
message interventions (Armanasco et al., 2017) and
face-to-face health promotion programs (Cushing
et al., 2014), the effects are not uniformly positive for
every participant. That is to say, we think it is impor-
tant to note that not every person who receives the in-
tervention will engage in a clinically meaningful
amount of more MVPA and less sedentary time. For
instance, the lower bound 95% CI for MVPA is 4.8.
Although even the participant who achieves this
muted intervention effect is increasing MVPA at a
level in keeping with prior physical activity interven-
tions (Metcalf et al., 2012), additional studies that
seek to optimize the effect of NUDGE are needed. In
other words, there is value in raising the “floor” of the
intervention effect so that the person who benefits the
least still experiences a meaningful change. We expect
that the variables that influence MVPA and sedentary

time are likely to fluctuate within-person and that
their effect will likely be different from person-to-
person (Cushing et al., 2019). Importantly, the inter-
vention period is quite brief (20 days) and additional
studies are needed to understand the durability of the
intervention effect over time.
We agree with the microtemporal framework put
forward by Dunton (2018) as a way of identifying var-
iables that can be used to optimize NUDGE. For ex-
ample, we imagine that environmental context may
moderate the effect of a NUDGE message. In our own
work, we have demonstrated that when participants
judge the weather to be poor they are less likely to en-
gage in MVPA (Bejarano et al., 2019). Related, we
have observed that adolescents are highly individual-
ized in the degree to which their mood or energy level
influences their MVPA or sedentary time (Cushing
et al., 2017). These findings suggest that environment
and mood states might be used to modify the delivery
of an activity prompt or other intervention content.
Another point of optimization is message timing. As a
day progresses for an individual participant there is an
asymptote in the probability that they are going to en-
gage in meaningful exercise. Specifically, there appears
to be a window of opportunity for prompting activity
between 5 and 8 p.m. that deserves experimental in-
vestigation (Ortega & Cushing, 2020). Finally, some
evidence exists that suggests digital interventions may
not be the right solution for every participant who
wants to change their physical activity behavior, some
participants may benefit more from messages deliv-
ered by providers or practitioners than those delivered
by a piece of software (Brannon et al., 2018). With
these findings in mind, it will be important to demon-
strate the effect of NUDGE in a larger clinical trial,
and to determine if it has utility in clinical populations
(e.g., pediatric overweight and obesity).
Limitations
This project is a nonrandomized trial. For this reason,
both generalizability and causality are unknown.
Second, the intervention period is short (3 weeks),
and no maintenance phase was conducted. Therefore,
we are not able to assess the durability of the interven-
tion effect nor can we predict the point at which par-
ticipants would have habituated to the intervention.
Third, the sample is small which introduces three
problems: (a) The sample is not fully representative of
all those who might benefit from NUDGE, (b) the ef-
fect sizes are likely to change in a larger trial, and (c)
the p < .05 criterion may be too stringent for a signifi-
cance test. This report is of a nonclinical sample that
is more likely to benefit from this type of intervention
compared with one with significant impairments.
Real World Application
A brief intervention like NUDGE does have real-
world application beyond its function as a pilot trial.
It is meaningful to have an extremely brief interven-
tion that improves MVPA in 20 days. Even if the inter-
vention effect were to deteriorate after this window
(an open empirical question) it is easier to maintain a
behavior than to start it from nothing. Therefore, in-
tervention content that follows after NUDGE has an
abundance of MVPA to attempt to reinforce. Because
the accelerometer was only used for outcome tracking,
teens do not need to wear a smartwatch or accelerom-
eter to benefit from NUDGE, which further enhances
its real-world application. Finally, a real-world appli-
cation would deliver texts directly to any phone.
Because a smartphone is not needed the cost of entry
for NUDGE is low.
Toward Recruitment of a Diverse Sample
The sample in this study was primarily white and up-
per income. This suggests to us that the community re-
cruitment
methods
lack
feasible
for
producing
diversity on income and race. Future studies may need
to employ clinic recruitment or more targeted recruit-
ment from specific organizations where race and in-
come diversity is present (e.g., Boys and Girls clubs,
faith groups, etc.).
Conclusion
NUDGE should be explored as both a standalone
physical activity intervention as well as part of a mul-
ticomponent package. This study serves as a useful
model for mapping intervention components onto spe-
cific elements of an established theory. By using as few
intervention components as possible the mechanism of
action is unambiguous.
