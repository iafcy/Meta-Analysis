Physical activity (PA) has numerous health beneﬁts. Personalized coaching may increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it
is challenging to deliver personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to determine whether novel
artiﬁcially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors
compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal
allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text
message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking
outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks.
Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m2.
The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an
average of 3618.2 steps/day; the net gain in this arm was signiﬁcantly greater [net difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI:
1483–5655), P value <0.001] compared to control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11–4310), P value 0.049]
compared to SmartText. In conclusion, AI-based voice-assisted coaching shows promise as a practical method of delivering scalable,
individualized coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer survivors. Additional research is needed to replicate these
ﬁndings in a broader population of cancer survivors and to investigate the effects of these interventions in the general population.

INTRODUCTION
Despite
obesity’s
well-documented
association
with
poor
health outcomes—including increased risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), diabetes, and cancer incidence and recurrence—
the prevalence of overweight and obesity has risen sharply over
the past several decades1. Nearly 42.4% (2017–2018 NHANES)
of US adults have obesity1, with an estimated annual economic
burden of US$190 billion in total costs, corresponding to 21%
per year of total direct healthcare spending in the US2. In recent
years, CVDs became one of the leading causes of death among
cancer survivors3. Obesity among cancer survivors signiﬁcantly
reduces survivorship4. Increasing physical activities among
cancer survivors signiﬁcantly reduced all-cause mortality5.
Behavioral approaches to reduce calorie intake and increase
physical activity are essential features of weight loss interven-
tions, which typically involve individualized, person-to-person
coaching6,7. However, such programs are time- and cost-
intensive8.
The introduction of intelligent voice assistance using smart
devices—phones, wearables, in-home speakers, the ability to
deploy learning models and other technologies comprising the
Internet of Things—is a potential way to deliver behavioral base
interventions closer to the classic model of person-to-person
coaching but at lower cost and in a scalable form. The potential
scalability of AI interventions is especially important given the
extremely high prevalence of physical inactivity and limited
reimbursement for lifestyle counseling. For these reasons, the
classical model of “person-to-person,” behavioral interventions
are insufﬁcient as a public health response given the scope of the
problem. The ability of artiﬁcially intelligent agent to generate
adaptive responses based on behavior, language process for
human-machine interaction, and on-demand data analytics in the
cloud present an opportunity to create an artiﬁcially intelligent
agent that can provide instant, individualized, on demand health
coaching adapted by user’s behavior. Such coaching has the
potential to calibrate guidance based on real-time data from a
user’s ﬁtness tracker and health records.
Our team designed and developed two artiﬁcial intelligent (AI)-
based, physical activity interventions and tested them in a three-
arm, randomized, controlled pilot study. The AI-based health
coaching agent (MyCoach) was delivered through an in-home
smart speaker—a relatively recent technology found in nearly half
of homes in the United States in 20189. A second AI intervention
was autonomous progressive smart coaching delivered through
text messaging (SmartText). The third arm received educational
materials on physical activity (control). The aim of our study was to
determine whether novel AI coaching interventions increase
physical activities among overweight or obese, physically inactive
cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health
information.

RESULTS
Participants
Fourteen participants enrolled in each arm; participant ﬂow from
screening to enrollment is summarized in the consort ﬁgure
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Table 1 provides participants’ character-
istics by study arm and overall. Mean (SD) age was 62.1 (9.8) years
and mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 32.9 kg/m2 (5.0). The
majority of participants (85.7%) had stage 1 or 2 breast cancer.
Baseline characteristics were similar in the study arms.
Physical activity
At baseline, the average number of steps was similar in the three
study arms (Table 2). Within each arm, the average number of
steps increased between baseline and follow-up by a mean of
886.1 steps/day (95% conﬁdence interval (CI): −895 to 2667) in the
control arm, 1619.0 steps/day (95% CI: −328 to 3566) in SmartText
arm, and 3618.2 steps/day (95% CI: 2490–4764) in the MyCoach
arm (Table 2, top panel). When the fourth week of intervention
was used alone as follow-up (Table 2, bottom panel), there were
similar patterns, e.g., mean (95% CI) change in the MyCoach arm
was 3585.0 steps/day (95% CI: 2304–4866). Figure 1 displays the
average number of steps per day, by study arm, for each day post-
randomization. In the MyCoach arm, there was an early and
sustained increase in the average number steps, while in the
SmartText arm, an early increase in steps per day was not
sustained. During the whole intervention period, the number (%)
of person/days achieved ≥10,000 steps per day was 28, 41, and
61% in the control, SmartText, and MyCoach arms, respectively.
During the fourth week of follow-up only, corresponding results
were 31, 34, and 58%.
The MyCoach arm achieved a greater increase in the average
number
of
steps/days
with
an
average
net
difference
of
3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483–5655, P value < 0.001) compared
to control arm. MyCoach arm also achieved an average net
difference of 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11–4310, P value 0.049)
compared to SmartText arm (Table 3, top panel). Results were
similar after limiting the follow-up period to the fourth week of
intervention (Table 3, bottom panel).
Intervention process data
The intervention was delivered as intended in all three study arms.
All participants in the control arm received printed and emailed
National Cancer Institute (NCI) educational materials about
physical activities for cancer survivors. All SmartText participants
received three text messages per day during the intervention
period, except one participant who did not get messages on
1 day. MyCoach participants had an average of two interactions
per day. Most of the voice interaction sessions concerned physical
activity reminders and progress (66%), asking for health tips (23%),
checking local resources (7%), and checking for sunscreen need
before going out for a walk (4.3%).
Safety
There were no adverse events during the intervention period.
DISCUSSION
In the Physical Activity by Technology Help (PATH) trial, we
tested two novel AI-based interventions to increase physical
activities among overweight or obese cancer survivors. Our
main
ﬁnding
was
that
AI-based,
voice-assisted
coaching
delivered through a smart speaker (MyCoach) signiﬁcantly
increased physical activity in comparison to the control arm
and the AI-based autonomous texting (SmartText). In addition,
while the SmartText intervention increased physical activity,
the change in physical activity did not differ from the change in
physical activity in the control arm.
While physical activity increased in each arm, the patterns over
time appeared to differ. During the initial 2 weeks of the
intervention period, participants in the control arm had a gradual
rise in steps, followed by a gradual reduction over the last
2 weeks. Participants in the MyCoach and SmartText arms both
experienced a spike in activity in the ﬁrst week. However, those
enrolled in the SmartText arm had a gradual reduction in activity
during the following 3 weeks. In contrast, the MyCoach arm
participants sustained a high level of physical activity throughout
the intervention period. Potential reasons for the apparent
differences in physical activity between SmartText and MyCoach
interventions are manifold. One reason is the approach to
communication between the AI agent and participant. The
intervention in MyCoach is dependent on the participant’s desire
to seek coaching that occurred in a bidirectional conversation,
while the intervention in the SmartText arm provided coaching via
text messages in a unidirectional fashion from the AI agent to the
participant. Similarly, a prior study that aimed to increase physical
activity among patients with diabetes showed sustained gain in
physical activities for an extended period, 12 weeks, and used
mobile app with bidirectional communication but powered by
human coaching10. A second reason is the ﬂexible vs ﬁxed contact
frequency in the MyCoach and SmartText arms, respectively.
Nevertheless, both interventions used had similar content and
goals. These results suggest that technology interventions that
allow users to decide when and how to use the technology may
have a better chance at achieving and sustaining increased
physical activity and perhaps other lifestyle changes.
Our target population in this study was cancer survivors who
were sedentary and overweight or obese. Increased physical
activity coupled with weight reduction might beneﬁt this group
by reducing the risk of cancer recurrence and reducing morbidity
and mortality from CVDs. In recent years, our research group has
focused on weight loss in overweight and cancer survivors and
has published the results of two trials11–13 and is conducting a
third (NCT04534309). Still, the physical inactivity component of

the interventions implements the classic “person-to-person”
model, which is problematic given the need for scalability and
concerns about effectiveness. Despite the high prevalence of
overweight, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle, our results may not
be generalizable to all sedentary people who are overweight or
obese, as well as normal weight cancer survivors. The study
interventions were speciﬁcally designed and tested for cancer
survivors. However, similar approach can be adapted for other
population in future studies. In addition, our study was a short-
term pilot trial. Also, the trial was not designed to assess the
impact of the interventions on weight change or general health.
Our team is planning to assess these outcomes in a long-
term study.
A systematic review of studies aimed to increase physical
activities among adults with cancer using technology support
concluded that most of the studies were of short duration without
sufﬁcient time to assess long-term outcomes14. Still, given
abundance evidence on the beneﬁt of increased physical activity
on general health, and the concurrent public health burden of
CVD,
sedentary
lifestyle,
and
overweight/obesity
in
cancer
survivors as well as the general public, the need for practical,
scalable interventions to increase physical activities is a public
health priority.
In this context, AI technology has the potential to deliver
effective interventions at scale to promote physical activity and
perhaps other lifestyle interventions. Importantly, as AI-based
interventions become widely available with large numbers of
users, the learning and training of AI agents will likely improve.
The use and effectiveness of AI agents (supervised or unsuper-
vised) can be further enhanced through publicly accessible, open-
access repositories with the learning algorithms. Some of the
challenges to scale unsupervised AI intervention is computational
resources. However, a recent study demonstrated an efﬁcient use
of computational resources to optimize model hyper-parameter
tuning for fast physical activity recommendation in mobile health.
Our study did not have to account for this challenge since the use
of a dedicated server for the model computation is separate from
the server that runs the voice interface15.
Our study has limitations. It was a pilot study with only 4 weeks
of follow-up. However, in an analysis that included only the last
week of follow-up, the MyCoach arm still showed a signiﬁcant
improvement in physical activity that highlights the potential for
sustainability. Second, the trial enrolled a small number of
participants. Replication of the trial with a large number of
participants followed for a longer period of time is warranted.
Third, the eligibility criteria of the trial included use of technology,
which is not universally available now. However, digital voice
assist technology is widely accepted and used by millions of users
in the US9. Fourth, there are complex issues related to data
security and privacy. At the time we developed these technolo-
gies, our institutional review board (IRB) required that we host and
operate the AI agents from a secure server at Johns Hopkins
University. However, technology companies now offer HIPAA
compliant voice technology for such use, which makes AI
technology interventions easily scalable.
Our study also has several strengths. Even though the trial was a
pilot study, it was adequately powered and designed to detect
changes in physical activity. Second, follow-up and data com-
pleteness were high; all participants had follow-up data, and the
vast majority had completed primary outcome data. Third, trial
conduct was extremely efﬁcient with automated interventions,
data collection, data transfer, and data storage. After the initial in-
person visit, there were no other required in-person visits to the
research clinic; all outcome data were collected remotely, mostly
by physical activity sensor. In addition, recruitment was also
efﬁcient, using the electronic health record to target invitations,
including mailings16.

In conclusion, AI voice-assisted coaching shows considerable
promise as a practical method of delivering scalable, individua-
lized coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer
survivors. Further research would be required to investigate
whether this intervention produces similar results in the general
population.
METHODS
Design
The PATH study was a three-arm, randomized parallel trial with an
allocation ratio of 1:1:1. A detailed description of the trial’s interventions
has been published16. An IRB at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine approved the trial protocol. All participants provided written
informed consent.
Eligibility
The principal eligibility criteria were: (1) Maryland adults with a history of
breast, prostate, colon, lung, cervical, oral, or melanoma cancer; (2)
overweight or obese as deﬁned by BMI of ≥25 kg/m2; (3) completion of
cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) at least 3 months
before enrollment, with the exception of anti-hormonal therapy; (4) access
to a smart phone (Android or OS); (5) ability to perform mild-to-moderate
physical activity, such as walking; (6) physician clearance; (7) willing to be
randomized to each study arm; and (8) willing to wear an activity tracker
throughout the 5-week study period. The principal exclusion criteria were:
(1) engagement in routine physical activity of ≥150 min per week during
the 4 weeks before screening (using The Godin–Shephard Leisure-Time
Physical Activity Questionnaire)17; (2) stage 4 cancer; (3) plans to re-locate
during the study; (4) structured physical activity as part of a program,
study, or consumer technology guide (e.g., Fitbit); (5) self-reported history
of a psychiatric condition that may prevent the participant from
performing study activities; and (6) pregnant or planning to become
pregnant during the study period.
After screening and randomization, there was a 1-week baseline period
followed by a 4-week intervention period. During the baseline period, we
conducted safety monitoring and established baseline physical activity for
each participant. Participants were instructed to not engage in any new
activities outside of their current physical activities’ during the baseline
period. The level of physical activities during baseline was not subjected to
any exclusion criteria. After the baseline period, the interventions began.
Measurements
At an initial visit, we obtained written informed consent, assessed
eligibility, and randomized the participant. Afterwards, we activated a
registration account through which we collected all subsequent data
remotely via sensors. Participants assigned to the non-control arms were
then introduced to the intelligent agents developed for their arm
—“MyCoach” for the voice assist arm, and “SmartText” for the text
messaging arm. Information about the participants, baseline date, and
anticipated date to start the intervention were recorded. During the same
visit, a wearable sensor (Fitbit Charge 2 HR) was provided to participants in
all three arms with instructions on installation, charging, and use. Each
wearable sensor had a serial number linking it to a research Application
Programming Interface (API) that enabled data monitoring and transfer
minute by minute.
Data were collected from the server, automatically recorded, and stored
in a secure database; hence, it was unnecessary for the participant to
return in-person the wearable device to download data. The wearable
sensor transmitted 5 weeks’ worth of physical activity data of each
participant—1-week baseline physical activity data, and 4 weeks of
intervention physical activity data. The wearable sensor also served as an
extension for the coaching agents to learn about the participant’s physical
activity behavior.
Randomization
We utilized Stratiﬁed Permuted Block Randomization to account for factors
that may inﬂuence the study outcome such as age, sex, and body mass
index. There were three allocations A, B, or C. We used 6 blocks of size 3.
Blocks were concealed in smart form (Microsoft 365 Enterprise/Excel 2109)
to eliminate guessing. We developed an automated tool to general
stratum and blocks using Microsoft smart form, which effectively
concealed the sequence within each block. At the randomization visit,
each participant reviewed and signed the IRB-approved written consent
form, then the Study Coordinator conducted the randomization assign-
ment using www.random.org.
Interventions
The trial tested two interventions compared to a control condition: (1) on-
demand, AI coaching using interactive digital voice assist via Amazon Echo
smart speaker, termed “MyCoach,” and (2) autonomous, data-driven smart
text messaging via mobile phone, termed “SmartText. The third arm,
“control”, received printed written information, speciﬁcally, a NCI publica-
tion about the beneﬁts of physical activity for cancer survivors that
recommended 10,000 steps per day of physical activity. In addition, the
same publication was sent electronically via email after the end of baseline
period to the control arm.
Voice-assisted AI “MyCoach” intervention.
Participants in this intervention
received personalized physical activity coaching via digital voice technol-
ogy between the agent (MyCoach, delivered through the Amazon Echo/
Alexa smart speaker) and the participant18. On the last day of the baseline
period, a study team member visited the participant, installed an Amazon
Echo device in the home, and gave instructions on how to use the voice
technology. The participant had to interact with MyCoach®, via the smart
speaker, to seek coaching; therefore, the intervention intensity and
frequency was dependent on the participant’s intention and motivation
to seek coaching. MyCoach used reinforced recommendation system to
learn about the participant behavior and general responses to maximize
rewards, some based on achieving the physical activity goal at least
10,000 steps per day. To enable reward feedback, the wearable sensor
provided real-time data to MyCoach. The connection between the
wearable sensor (Fitbit Charge HR2) and MyCoach was established using
voice technology during installation of the smart speaker. MyCoach and its
related databases were hosted on a secure local server at Johns Hopkins
University. MyCoach design and how the intervention worked is displayed
in Supplementary Fig. 1. Further details are published16.
Autonomous smart testing “SmartText” intervention.
Participants in this
arm received personalized physical activity coaching via text messages.
After baseline, the participants received three messages each day. The text
messages were initiated by an autonomous agent19, termed SmartText, a
goal-based agent designed to progressively increase physical activity. The
agent selects and then modiﬁes the message content after considering an
individual participant’s schedule, anthropometric measures, wearable
sensor feedback, personal preferences, and progress over time. All
computations were performed on a secure server, which received
minute-by-minute data from the wearable sensors and combined it with
the other participant data to formulate messages. The agent (SmartText)
acted as a unidirectional coach, i.e., the agent sent messages to the
participant, but the participant could not communicate with the agent.
SmartText design and how the intervention worked is displayed in
Supplementary Fig. 2. Further details are published16.
MyCoach and SmartText intervention uses a recommendation system
(AI-agent) to provide coaching, but the interventions differed substan-
tively16. SmartText used supervised goal-based model, while MyCoach uses
an unsupervised goal base model with a reward condition(s). The time-
speciﬁc parameter in MyCoach is inﬂuenced by priors, the user’s intent,
and the physical activities captured by the wearable sensor. The model is
connected to the Alexa voice interface using a proprietary Amazon
platform (Alexa console). Response selection (messaging) is done by the
agent using resource data bank. The SmartText arm message formulations
were unidirectional, while the messaging formulation for MyCoach is
bidirectional since it is dictated by the participant’s intent. The wearable
sensor served as an extension for the agent/model to get feedback.
Blinding
Due to the nature of the study interventions, study participants were not
blinded. However, outcome ascertainment was blinded, given that the
sensor collected and transferred data automatically.

Study outcome
The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of different
technological approaches in increasing physical activity among overweight
and/or obese cancer survivors captured by wearable sensors. The primary
outcome is the percentage of change in daily steps from the 1-week
baseline to the end of the 4-week intervention period. Participant wear-
time is validated using the heart rate sensor readings in the wearable
device. For more details, please check the published protocol16.
Data analysis and sample size
The primary endpoint was change in the average number of daily steps
from baseline to the end of follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was
used to determine the effects of each intervention compared to control and
to compare the two active interventions (MyCoach and SmartText). Mean
steps per day for baseline was calculated from 7 days of baseline data. Mean
steps per day during follow-up was calculated from 4 weeks of intervention
data. We computed average change in steps before and after intervention
within each arm using a regression model in which B0 represents the step
count per day, and B1 represents the regression coefﬁcient of the two-sided
t test by the stage of the study (baseline/follow-up) among the participants
in each arm. A cluster by unique participant ID term was included in the
regression model to treat each individual participant independently. The
change in changes across arms was then computed by ﬁtting a multiple
linear regression model in which B0 represents the step count per day for
each participant, B1 represents the trial period, and B2 represents the
interaction term by period/arm. Change from baseline to follow-up in the
control arm was the reference in the regression models. We adjusted for
baseline and clustered by participant ID. Finally, the same outcomes were
assessed using data from the ﬁnal week of follow-up only. All baseline and
follow-up summary measures are reported as mean and SD, and summary
outcomes as mean with 95% CIs and P values.
Of the 1470 total expected person-days in the trial, 34 person-days
(2.3%) were missing across the 3 study arms. Some were due to occasional
synchronization issues of the wearable devices; for religious purposes, one
participant speciﬁed days on which the wearable device would not be
activated. Missing person-days were imputed with the average steps from
the valid person-days. As for process measures, we reported measures of
adherence by study arm: (1) number of participants in control arm that
opened the written publication provided by email; (2) number of daily
messages sent and received by each participant in SmartText arm; and (3)
average number of daily interaction sessions in the MyCoach arm.
The sample size of 39 participants in total (13 per arm) was sufﬁcient to
detect a 2000 average steps/day, between-arm difference, assuming a
standard deviation of 1800 steps/day, with power of 0.80 and a 2-sided
alpha of 0.0520,21. To account for participant dropout, 42 participants were
recruited. We used SQL to query our server, Python 3.7 to prepare the
master data frame, and Stata/SE 15.1 for the statistical analysis.
