Abstract
Background: Despite the growing number of mobile health (mHealth) interventions targeting childhood obesity, few studies
have characterized user typologies derived from individuals’patterns of interactions with specific app features (digital phenotypes).
Objective: This study aims to identify digital phenotypes among 214 parent-child dyads who used the Aim2Be mHealth app
as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2019 and 2020, and explores whether participants’characteristics and
health outcomes differed across phenotypes.
Methods: Latent class analysis was used to identify distinct parent and child phenotypes based on their use of the app’s behavioral,
gamified, and social features over 3 months. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes
differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI z scores (zBMI),
diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes.
Results: Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified: socially engaged (35/214, 16.3%), independently engaged (18/214,
8.4%) (socially and independently engaged parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app,
respectively), fully engaged (26/214, 12.1%), partially engaged (32/214, 15%), and unengaged (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married
parents were more likely to be fully engaged than independently engaged (P=.02) or unengaged (P=.01) users. Socially engaged
parents were older than fully engaged (P=.02) and unengaged (P=.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes
among children: fully engaged (32/214, 15%), partially engaged (61/214, 28.5%), dabblers (42/214, 19.6%), and unengaged
(79/214, 36.9%) users. Fully engaged children were younger than dabblers (P=.04) and unengaged (P=.003) children. Dabblers
lived in higher-income households than fully and partially engaged children (P=.03 and P=.047, respectively). Fully engaged
children were more likely to have fully engaged (P<.001) and partially engaged (P<.001) parents than unengaged children.
Compared with unengaged children, fully and partially engaged children had decreased total sugar (P=.006 and P=.004, respectively)
and energy intake (P=.03 and P=.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use. Partially engaged children also had decreased
sugary beverage intake compared with unengaged children (P=.03). Similarly, children with fully engaged parents had decreased

zBMI, whereas children with unengaged parents had increased zBMI over time (P=.005). Finally, children with independently
engaged parents had decreased caloric intake, whereas children with unengaged parents had increased caloric intake over time
(P=.02).
Conclusions: Full parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions. Further research is needed to
understand program design elements that can affect participants’ engagement in supporting behavior change.

Introduction
Background
Childhood obesity remains a significant health problem in
Canada [1]. Evidence shows that family-based multicomponent
interventions that integrate self-regulatory strategies (ie, goal
setting, graded tasks, and self-monitoring) and support changes
at the familial and individual levels are necessary to significantly
affect child weight outcomes (eg, BMI, waist to hip ratio, and
total fat mass [2-9]). However, a 2018 meta-analysis [4] found
that family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions had
a small effect in reducing children’s BMI in efficacy trials versus
standard-of-care controls (β=−.16, 95% CI −0.24 to −0.07).
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a promising adjunct
or alternative to in-person treatments to support lifestyle
behavior change [10,11]. Several reviews [12-15] and
meta-analyses [16,17] have suggested that mHealth interventions
offer multiple advantages to in-person interventions (eg,
real-time data collection, intervention in natural environments,
lower costs, health behavior tracking with feedback, and
incorporation of gamified elements), which may appeal to
children and youth [12]. Data on the efficacy of mHealth
interventions for the prevention and management of childhood
obesity are promising but limited as this is still a rapidly
evolving field of research [12,14,18].
mHealth interventions for children living with obesity are most
often evaluated using randomized controlled trials and, in some
cases, evaluate the dose of the intervention received to provide
a better understanding of their effects [19-24]. Dose-response
analyses are often measured in terms of total minutes or
percentage of content examined; however, this approach does
not provide a nuanced picture of how users may benefit from
different mHealth intervention components (ie, what design
elements of the app may be more successful in engaging
participants and promoting health behavior change) [25,26].
Studies examining how intervention exposure affects behavior
change cannot solely focus on the quantity of the intervention
received, but must also consider how participants engage with
the active ingredients of the intervention—namely, the features
that support behavior change.
mHealth interventions are particularly well-suited to examine
in greater detail which components of the intervention
participants engage with through app analytics data. Recently,
there have been calls to develop analytical methods to process
the vast amounts of data that are available when using mHealth
technologies [27] and identify digital phenotypes (ie, user
typologies derived from individuals’ patterns of interactions
with specific app features) [28,29]. Although digital phenotypes
have been used in other areas of health research (eg, diabetes
[30], sleep [31], mental health [32]) and dietary and physical
activity behaviors in a nonclinical sample [33], little attention
has been paid to the treatment of obesity in childhood. Some
studies have investigated which app features participants use
[23,33] and individual characteristics associated with partial or
total use of an intervention [33-36]. However, most studies
evaluated usability derived from self-reported measures (eg,
asking participants about their preferences and use of app
features), total app use, or the use of individual features instead
of focusing on patterns of app use [23,34,37].
Objectives
To our knowledge, no study targeting childhood obesity has
identified user typologies based on participants’ engagement
with objectively measured components of an mHealth
intervention. To address this gap, this study aimed to (1) identify
digital phenotypes of Canadian children with overweight or
obesity and their parents who used an mHealth app (the Aim2Be
app [25]) over a 3-month period, (2) explore whether
participants’ characteristics differed by digital phenotype, and
(3) evaluate 3-month changes in children’s BMI z scores (zBMI)
and dietary, physical activity, and screen time behaviors across
digital phenotypes.
Methods
Study Design
This study was a secondary analysis of data collected from a
randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of the
Aim2Be app (version 2) to improve lifestyle behaviors and
adiposity among children with overweight or obesity [25,38].
The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03651284)
on August 29, 2018 [25]. The CONSORT-EHEALTH
(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and
Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) checklist
[39] is available in Multimedia Appendix 1. Data analyzed in
this study were collected from March 2019 to June 2020.

Ethics Approval
The evaluation protocol was approved by the Children’s and
Women’s Research Ethics Board at the University of British
Columbia (H16-03090/H17-02032), the Health Research Ethics
Board at the University of Alberta (Pro00076869), the Hospital
for Sick Children Research Ethics Board (REB1000059362),
the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (project 4250),
and the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics
Board (18/01E). All the participants provided web-based consent
before participating in the study.
Data Collection Protocol
The detailed study protocol has been published elsewhere [25].
The participating families (N=214) were recruited from 6 weight
management clinic sites across Canada, as well as through
Facebook. Children were eligible to participate if they were
aged 10 to 17 years and were overweight or obese, as defined
by the age- and sex-specific World Health Organization cutoffs
[40]. After providing consent, eligible participants completed
a web-based survey, three 24-hour dietary recalls, and received
assessment tools for height (measuring tape) weight (digital
scale), and physical activity (Fitbit Flex 2, Fitbit Inc) to complete
baseline measurements. Participants completed follow-up
assessments at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Families
randomized to the experimental group (107/214, 50%) had
access to the app after completing baseline measures. Waitlisted
control families (107/214, 50%) were given access to the app
after completing their assessment at the 3-month follow-up.
This study combined data collected from baseline to 3 months
in the intervention group, and from 3 to 6 months in the
waitlisted control group (Figure 1). Randomization was
successful, and participants’ characteristics did not differ
between the intervention and the waitlisted control group;
however, our analyses were not based on the randomization
group but dependent on users’ engagement.

The Aim2Be Intervention
The theoretical foundations of the Aim2Be app have been
described elsewhere [25]. Briefly, the app, which was cocreated
by Ayogo Health Inc [41] and the Childhood Obesity Foundation
with expert input, aimed to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors
among children and their parents by targeting dietary, physical
activity, screen time, and sleep behaviors while emphasizing
healthy body image, strong self-esteem, and living green [25].
The behavior change techniques incorporated in the app are
grounded in social cognitive theory [42], the Player Experience
and Need Satisfaction Model—an extension of the
self-determination theory [43,44]—and the Agency, Challenge,
Uncertainty, Discovery, and Outcomes framework [45]. The
content within different features of the app was also informed
by the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines [46] and the
Canadian dietary guidelines in place at the time of the study
(Canada’s Food Guide 2007) [47].
The Aim2Be app features fall under 3 broad domains:
behavioral, gamified, and social. The behavioral domain draws
on 
self-regulatory 
strategies 
such 
as 
goal 
setting,
self-monitoring, and graded tasks to facilitate behavior change
by strengthening self-regulatory skills [4,8]. The gamified
domain focuses on increasing participants’
enjoyment,
engagement, and motivation through various gamification
elements (eg, personalization, challenges, uncertainty). The

social domain facilitates peer support, behavior modeling, and
interaction with other app users or with a coach through different
interactive features (eg, answering poll questions, viewing poll
results, posting on the social wall, and responding to others’
posts). Social support is also provided to children through a
companion app for parents, which aims to facilitate behavioral
changes through a positive familial environment, reinforcement
strategies, and environmental and stimulus control. Figures 2
and 3 illustrate screenshots of the child and parent interventions,
respectively.
In addition to the parent companion app, 2 very similar versions
of Aim2Be were developed for preteens (aged 10-13 years) and
teenagers (aged 13-17 years), with 3 app features (ie, stages,
posting on a social wall, and responding to others’ posts)
available only to teenagers. As this study combined data from
both teenagers and preteens, features only available to both
groups were included in the analyses.

Measures
Use of Aim2Be App Features
App analytics (provided by Ayogo Health Inc [41]) were used
to track the number of times children and parents used each
Aim2Be app feature. The behavioral domain included the
following five features: (1) aims, indicating the number of
high-level goals chosen by users while indicating their perceived
importance and potential obstacles; (2) tasks, indicating the
number of activities users completed to accomplish their aims;
(3) check-ins, indicating the number of times users
self-monitored their progress regarding specific health behaviors,
with short recommendations on how to improve their behaviors;
(4) articles read, indicating the number of articles providing
educational content read by the user; and (5) articles reflected
on, indicating the number of written responses provided by the
user after reading an article.
The gamified domain included the following four features: (1)
quick wins, which involved simple tasks users completed to
engage in a healthy behavior or explore a new feature of the
app, and which allowed them to earn digital currency; (2)
stories, which involved the number of times users read choose
your own adventure stories (these stories used a user-guided
fictional character involved in a series of decision-making
processes); (3) quizzes, which involved short tests that the users
answered, allowing them to earn digital currency if they selected
the correct answer; and (4) collections, which involved digital
items the user purchased with digital currency within the app.
The parent app integrated only quick wins as the gamified
domain.
The social domain included the following four features: (1)
answer poll, which involved the number of 2-choice poll
questions from the social poll responded to by the users, with
feedback on the percentage of users who selected each option;
(2) digital coach, which involved the number of chat sessions
between the user and a digital coach with preprogrammed
prompts, questions, and answers; (3) live coach, which involved
the number of one-on-one messages the user sent to a live
trained health coach; and (4) posts, which involved the number
of times the user posted a message on a social wall, sharing
thoughts, feelings, or experiences with others. By design, the
live coach feature, analyzed as part of the social domain, was
not made available to participants randomized to the waitlisted

control group; therefore, data for these participants were missing
at random. In addition, only teens (119/214, 55.6%) had access
to the posting feature. Consequently, this feature was not
analyzed in the children’s sample as the missing data were
age-related.
Children’s zBMI
Parents were mailed a digital scale (Active Era) and a measuring
tape (HDX Corp) with instructions (using the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention home protocol [48]) to
accurately measure their child’s height and weight at home.
This procedure has been validated to assess children’s height
and weight at home [49]. Children’s height and weight were
then used to compute zBMI using the World Health Organization
Stata macro [40], where being overweight in childhood was
defined as zBMI >1 SD and ≤2 SD, and obesity was defined as
zBMI >2 SD.
Health Behaviors
Dietary Behaviors
Children’s dietary behaviors were evaluated with the Waterloo
Eating Behavior Questionnaire, a 24-hour web-based dietary
recall (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.39 to
0.71 for energy, carbohydrates, sugar, fiber, and fats, validated
against dietitian interviews) [50]. Children reported all foods
and beverages consumed on the previous day. Standardized
food group servings using the 2007 Canada’s Food Guide
classification framework were used to quantify the amount of
food consumed (eg, number of servings of vegetables and fruits)
[47]. A composite index of dietary quality (the Canadian Healthy
Eating Index [51]) was used as a measure of overall adherence
to the 2007 Canada’s Food Guide. The index ranges from 0 to
100 points, where scores <50, 50 to 80, and >80 indicate poor,
requiring improvement, and good dietary quality, respectively
[51]. Parents’ dietary behaviors were evaluated using 7 items
adapted from the Canadian Community Health Surveys [52].
Parents reported their own consumption of vegetables and fruits
(excluding fruit juices), 100% fruit juices, and sugar-sweetened
beverages.
Physical Activity
Children’s physical activity was evaluated using Fitbit Flex 2
(Fitbit Inc). Children wore the Fitbit for 7 to 14 days at baseline
and at 3 and 6 months, and their daily step count was obtained
by our team using Fitabase, a web-based platform designed for
research using Fitbits [53]. Furthermore, we computed the
children’s average number of daily steps. In addition, children
completed a web-based survey, which included 5 questions
from the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children
[54]; a 7-day recall inquiring about the amount of physical
activity with responses between none and more than 2 hours.
The total score of the questionnaire was significantly related to
moderate and vigorous physical activity using accelerometers
(r=0.33) [55]. Parents’ physical activity was evaluated using 7
items from the Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form
(repeatability reliability across different countries ranged from
0.32 to 0.88, with 75% of the correlation coefficients >0.65 and
a pooled coefficient of 0.76 [56]). Participants were asked about
the number of days and minutes spent sitting, walking, and
engaging in vigorous and moderate physical activity over the
past 7 days. The average daily time was calculated for sitting,
walking, and moderate and vigorous physical activity.
Screen Time
Children’s and parents’ screen time was evaluated with 2 items
adapted from the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire for adults
(intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.51 to 0.93 [57]).
Children and parents reported the time (minutes) spent watching
television; playing computer or video games; using a computer,
tablet, or mobile device outside of school or paid work; and
talking or texting on a cell phone during their most recent week
and weekend day. The average daily sedentary time was then
calculated.
Statistical Approach
Latent class analysis (LCA) in MPlus version 8 (Muthen and
Muthen [58]) was used to separately identify digital phenotypes
among children and parents. There is no fixed minimum sample
size for LCA as it depends on multiple factors (eg, number and
quality of indicators, class differentiation, and relative samples
in each class) [59]. Of relevance, previous Monte Carlo
simulations [60] have found that an LCA with 100 participants
can result in reliable solutions when conducted with robust
indicators, providing support for conducting an LCA with 214
participants. The LCA identified digital phenotypes based on
different use patterns for the various behavioral, social, and
gamified app features, similar to a recent study profiling child
users using an earlier version of Aim2Be [33]. As the
distribution of use for each feature was skewed, an individual’s
use of each app feature was ranked as no use (a participant never
used a given app feature), and among the remaining participants,
low use (a participant’s use of a feature was at or below the
median use), or high use (a participant’s use of a feature was
above the median use). The robust maximum likelihood
estimator with the expectation-maximization algorithm and
2000 random starts was used. The LCA used full information
maximum likelihood to handle data missing at random in the
live coach feature (no other variables included in the LCA had
missing data). Various fit and relative indices were used to
compare different k-class solutions to determine the best number
of classes to be retained with the LCA [59]. We first evaluated
the Bayesian information criterion, sample size–adjusted
Bayesian information criterion, Akaike information criterion,
consistent Akaike information criterion, and approximate weight
of evidence. For these indices, both a lower value and a
meaningful decrease after adding another class to the solution
are desirable. Second, we compared neighboring solutions of k
classes (eg, 3 vs 4 classes) with the relative indices of the
Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test, bootstrap
likelihood 
ratio 
test, 
and 
Bayes 
factor. 
For 
the
Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin and bootstrap likelihood ratio test,
a significant P value indicates a better fit of k classes than with
the previous model (k-1 classes). For the Bayes factor, higher
scores indicate stronger evidence supporting k classes than those
supporting k+1 classes. Third, we estimated how each model
was corrected by all models using the correct model probability
index, where higher values are desirable. Other indicators of
well-differentiated classes such as entropy and average posterior

probability were also evaluated, where desirable values were
>0.8% and >70%, respectively. Finally, the k-class solution
selected also considered practical and theoretical interpretability
and the relative sample size of each class. Although some
authors retained classes that encompassed at least 5% of the
sample [59], the authors recognized the limitations of estimating
classes with a low relative prevalence (1%-8%). This was
accounted for when selecting the final solution.
Multiple multinomial logistic regression models were used to
evaluate the associations between digital phenotypes included
as the dependent variable and demographic factors (children’s
and parents’ age and sex, parental educational attainment,
marital status, household income, ethnicity, and recruitment
site) as independent variables. Parental phenotypes were also
added as predictors of children’s phenotypes.
Mixed-effect models evaluated changes in health behaviors and
zBMI across children’s and parents’ phenotypes. One model
was run for each outcome (children’s zBMI, children’s and
parents’ diet, physical activity, and screen time). All models
included an interaction term between time and phenotype and
were adjusted for children’s and parents’ age and sex, parental
educational attainment, marital status, household income,
ethnicity, and recruitment site. Postestimation contrasts of
marginal linear predictions tested overall group differences. For
outcomes with borderline significance (P<.10) or significant
(P<.05) overall group differences, we conducted pairwise
comparisons and calculated the Cohen effect size as follows:
f2 = (R2
AB – R2
A) / (1 – R2
AB)
Here, B is the predictor of interest (eg, interaction phenotype
1×time), A is the set of all other predictors (ie, demographics,
time, and other phenotypes), R2
AB is the proportion of variance
that A and B together (ie, the full model) account for, and R2
A
is the proportion of variance the predictors explain in a reduced
model, with all fixed effects from the full model, except for the
effect of B and random effects constrained to be the same as
those from the full model. Therefore, f2 represents the proportion
of variance uniquely accounted for by B [61,62].
All regression analyses were performed using Stata (version
15; StataCorp) [63]. The significance level was set at P<.05.
Results
Demographic Characteristics of the Participants
From the 214 parent-child dyads, the mean age of the children
was 13 (SD 2.2) years, and the sample was evenly split among
boys (104/214, 48.6%) and girls (110/214, 51.4%).
Approximately 92.5% (198/214) of the participating parents
were mothers, and 71% (152/214) were married or living with
a partner. The mean age of parents was 44 (SD 6.2) years. Just
over half of the parents (120/214, 56.1%) had not completed a
university degree. Approximately 60.3% (129/214) of parents
self-identified as having a White or European descent, 16.8%
(36/214) reported mixed ethnicity, 5.6% (12/214) reported an
East or Southeast Asian descent, 4.2% (9/214) reported a South
Asian descent, and 3.3% (7/214) reported an indigenous descent.
Household income ranged from <CAD $50,000 (US $37,500;
36/214, 16.8%) to >CAD $150,000 (US $112,500; 35/214,
16.4%). Approximately 30.8% (66/214) of parents reported
incomes between CAD $50,000 (US $37,500) and CAD
$100,000 (US $75,000), and 25.7% (55/214) reported incomes
between CAD $100,000 (US $75,000) and CAD $150,000 (US
$112,500).
Identifying Digital Phenotypes
Table 1 summarizes the results from the LCA and Figure 4
provides plots for selecting LCA indices for both the child and
parent models. Fit indices and interpretability of the classes
supported a 4-class solution among children. By contrast, the
parent LCA fit indices pointed to a 5- or 6-class solution;
however, further evaluation of the potential solutions led to the
retention of the 5-class solution. Although 6 of the 11 indices
showed the 6-class solution as the best option, the relatively
small sample for 2 of the classes suggested an overextraction.
Therefore, the 5-class model was retained as the final solution
for the parents. In addition, the 5-class solution made more
substantive sense. Moreover, the average posterior probability
for both child- and parent-selected models ranged between 91%
and 99%, indicating well-differentiated classes for the 5-class
solution. Thus, our results suggest excellent differentiation
between the classes.
Figure 5 shows children’s and parents’ digital phenotypes (A
and B, respectively). Figure 5A shows 4 children’s digital
phenotypes (N=214): unengaged, dabblers, partially engaged,
and fully engaged. Unengaged (79/214, 36.9% of users) included
children who did not interact with most of the app features with
exception of check-ins. Dabblers (42/214, 19.6% of users)
regrouped children who did not use most behavioral features
of the app (eg, completing tasks and reading or reflecting on
articles) but predominantly interacted with gamified and social
features, including collections and the digital coach. Partially
engaged (61/214, 28.5% of users) included children who were
low users of the behavioral features, particularly regarding task
completion and reading and reflecting on articles but had greater
use of the check-in feature. Partially engaged children had
mixed interactions with the gamified and social features, with
greater use of the collections and the digital coach, respectively,
but rarely read stories or completed quizzes. Fully engaged
(32/214, 15% of users) comprised high users of most app
features and included children who engaged the most with the
active ingredients of the app (ie, the behavioral features such
as setting aims and completing tasks).
Figure 5B shows 5 parental digital phenotypes (N=214):
unengaged, socially engaged, independently engaged, partially
engaged, and fully engaged. Unengaged (103/214, 48.1% of
users) included parents who did not use most of the features,
with the exception of check-ins. Socially engaged (35/214,
16.4% of users) regrouped parents who engaged with the social
features of the app by creating posts on the social wall,
answering poll questions, and interacting with the live health
coach. However, socially engaged parents had low use of the
behavioral and gamified features and, in particular, did not
complete any tasks within the app. Independently engaged

of the social features (the only social feature they used involved
direct messages with the live health coach but did not interact
with other parents). Instead, independently engaged parents
focused their attention on the behavioral features of the app and
mostly set aims, read articles, and completed check-ins;
however, they also interacted with all the behavioral features
to some degree. Partially engaged (32/214, 15% of users)
included parents who had a mixed use of most app features,
indicating that their engagement with some behavioral (eg, aims
and check-ins) and social (eg, posts) features was evenly split
between low and high use. Partially engaged parents tended to
be high users of the article feature, low users of the answer poll
feature, and nonusers of the digital coach feature. Hence, their
overall engagement with the behavioral features tended to be
greater than with the gamified and social features. Finally, fully
engaged parents (26/214, 12.1% of users) included users who
interacted extensively with all app features, except the digital
coach feature.

Demographic Characteristics Associated With Digital
Phenotypes
Table 2 and Table 3 show the distribution of demographic
factors across child and parent digital phenotypes, respectively,
with relative risk ratios and significance levels available in
Multimedia Appendix 2 (Tables S1 and S2). The results are
presented separately for children and parents. Children in the
fully engaged phenotype were 1 to 1.5 years younger than
children belonging to the dabblers (P=.04) and unengaged
(P=.003) phenotypes. Furthermore, children from the dabblers
phenotype were more likely to be in a household with an income
>CAD $80,000 (US $63,771) than children belonging to the
fully and partially engaged phenotypes (P=.03 and P=.047,
respectively). Parents in the socially engaged phenotype were
2 to 3 years older than parents in the fully engaged (P=.02) and
unengaged (P=.01) phenotypes. Moreover, fully engaged parents
were more likely to be married, common law, or living with a
partner than parents belonging to the independently engaged
(P=.02) and unengaged (P=.01) phenotypes, who were more
likely to be single, divorced, or widowed.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of parental digital phenotypes
across children’s phenotypes, highlighting how their phenotypes
were strongly associated. At one end of the spectrum, fully

with a given child phenotype. Within groups that share the same number and color, groups that do not share the same letter are significantly different
from one another and are compared with the reference group (ie, unengaged users).
Changes in Health Outcomes Across Digital
Phenotypes
Table 4 summarizes the 3-month changes in zBMI, diet, physical
activity, and screen time across children’s and parents’ digital
phenotypes, with statistically significant (P<.05) or borderline
significant (P<.10) comparisons shown in Figure 7, where
panels A to C show child outcomes across child phenotypes,
and panels D and E show child outcomes across parent
phenotypes.
Multiple group comparisons showed that changes in the total
sugar intake of children differed across phenotypes (P=.01;
Figure 7A-C). Children belonging to the fully engaged (P=.01;
f2=0.04) or partially engaged (P=.004; f2=0.05) phenotypes
reduced their total sugar intake over 3 months compared with
children in the unengaged phenotype (reference group), who
increased their total sugar intake over time. Regarding children’s
total daily energy intake and energy intake from sugary
beverages, we found borderline differences (P=.07 and P=.09)
that became significant in individual pairwise comparisons.
Children from the fully engaged (P=.03; f2=0.01), partially
engaged (P=.04; f2=0.03), and dabblers (P=.03; f2=0.00)
phenotypes decreased their total energy intake over 3 months
compared with the unengaged children who increased their
daily energy intake over time. Finally, children from the
partially engaged phenotype decreased their intake of sugary
beverages compared with unengaged children who did not
(P=.01; f2=0.02). In this case, fully engaged children did not
differ significantly from unengaged children; however, as shown
in Figure 7C, children’s intake of sugary beverages in the fully
engaged
group trended downward, whereas unengaged
children’s intake trended upward (P=.12).
Differential changes in outcomes among children were also
observed across the parental phenotypes (Figure 7D and 7E).
Multiple group comparisons showed borderline significant
changes in children’s zBMI and total daily energy intake across
parental phenotypes (P=.06 and P=.08, respectively), which
became significant in individual pairwise comparisons.
Specifically, children whose parents were fully engaged
significantly decreased their zBMI (P=.01; f2=0.05) compared
with children with unengaged parents (reference group) whose
zBMI slightly increased. Similarly, children whose parents
belonged to the independently engaged phenotype decreased
their daily caloric intake (P=.02; f2=0.03) compared with
children with unengaged parents whose daily caloric intake
increased over 3 months. Figure 7E also shows trends of
decreased caloric intake among children with fully and partially
engaged parents compared with children with unengaged
parents; however, these trends were not statistically significant
(P=.11 and P=.07, respectively).

Discussion
Principal Findings
This is the first digital phenotyping study of an mHealth
intervention targeting health behavior changes among children
with overweight or obesity and their parents. We evaluated user
typologies based on how children and parents interacted with
different features of the Aim2Be app. We found 4 child
(unengaged, dabblers, partially engaged, and fully engaged)
and 5 parent (unengaged, socially, independent, partially
engaged, and fully engaged) phenotypes, which illustrate the
ways in which participants used the behavioral, gamified, and
social features of the Aim2Be app. As expected, based on
Aim2Be’s conceptual framework [25], our results demonstrated
that specific patterns of use supported behavior change, whereas
others did not, meaning that greater engagement with the active
ingredients of the app improved children’s dietary and weight
outcomes.
Comparison With Prior Work
Given the scarcity of research on the digital phenotypes of
mHealth users in the context of childhood obesity, it is difficult
to compare our findings with those of previous studies.
However, our results are similar to a recently published study
profiling children’s (but not parents’) engagement with an older
version of Aim2Be [33], where the 4 child profiles that emerged
were similar, although our study examined 6 additional app
features. Interestingly, the results previously observed in the
prevention context [33] were replicated in our study using a
clinical sample of children. Importantly, users with distinct
patterns of engagement obtained different health benefits
depending on whether they interacted with the active ingredients
of the app. When lifestyle behavior modification interventions
required in-person attendance, dose-response studies identified
a minimum of 26 hours of contact for the intervention to
improve children’s outcomes [4]. However, our digital
phenotype analyses illustrate that new approaches are needed
to conduct dose-response analyses in the context of mHealth
interventions, especially when users have the freedom to select
which app features they engage with. As users interact with the
Aim2Be app quite differently, this variability must be accounted
for when assessing whether the intervention can influence the
mediators and outcomes targeted by the app.

In this study, we found that fully engaged children with Aim2Be
(eg, set goals, completed tasks, and read articles) experienced
more desirable behavior changes than unengaged users.
Specifically, children who engaged more fully with the app
decreased their intake of total daily calories, total sugars, and
sugary beverages. Our findings align with existing research
[22,33] suggesting that mHealth interventions have the potential
to improve children’s dietary behaviors. Furthermore, in
exploratory analyses examining the aims that were most often
set and completed among Aim2Be users (data not shown), we
found that “Drop sugary drinks” was the most common aim
chosen by children, which validates our findings related to lower
total sugar and energy from sugary drinks among fully and
partially engaged children. These results highlight the
importance of increasing engagement with the app’s active
ingredients, namely, setting specific goals and completing tasks
related to those goals to promote health behavior change among
children.
In this study, fully engaged children were more likely to be
younger and have fully or partially engaged parents. These
associations could indicate that the app was more appealing to
younger children, as shown by other research [34], or that
parents dedicated more attention to their children when they
were younger than when they were older. In addition, younger
children might be more easily influenced by their parents, which
may explain their use of the Aim2Be app. These findings are
aligned with previous studies reporting that parental
self-monitoring (a behavioral strategy) and adherence to eHealth
interventions were significant predictors of adolescents’
self-monitoring and adherence [33,64].
We also found that children whose parents were fully or partially
engaged with the app’s behavioral features decreased their zBMI
and total daily energy intake more than children whose parents
only engaged with the social features or who did not engage
with the app at all. Our findings are consistent with a qualitative
study [65] showing that participation as a family is one of the
main factors identified by both children and parents to facilitate
behavior change. Indeed, current guidelines [4,15,66] for the
treatment of childhood obesity include a family-based approach.
Taken together, our findings reinforce the critical role that
parents play in lifestyle interventions to support their children’s
adherence and improvement of health outcomes, even in the
mHealth context.
This study also revealed that family structure was associated
with parental phenotypes. Fewer single-parent households
belonged to the fully and partially engaged phenotypes than
parents who lived with a partner or were married, which may
reflect that more independent, time-scarce (and therefore
task-oriented) parents [67]. Interestingly, single-parent
households were also likely to belong to the independently
engaged phenotype (ie, parents who only engaged with the
behavioral app features such as aims and tasks), and children
whose parents belonged to this phenotype reduced more of their
total daily energy than other phenotypes. In fact, previous
research found that parents of young children decreased their
use of mHealth apps when they had limited time or only used
the app to find specific information of interest [67]. This could
explain why independently engaged parents did not use the
gamified or social domains but used the domain exclusively
focused on behavioral change and why their children decreased
their energy intake over time.
Limitations and Strengths
This study had several limitations and strengths. First, our
sample was relatively small and not powered to detect significant
changes across multiple digital phenotypes in these secondary
analyses. This could have limited our ability to detect clinically
meaningful changes in health outcomes, although some changes
were observed. In addition, overall adherence to the app was
low, which limited our ability to detect more phenotypes and
perhaps to observe some between-group changes. Moreover,
our study included a clinical sample (children with overweight
or obesity); thus, our findings are limited to this population.
Nevertheless, we used a detailed dietary assessment (24-hour
dietary recalls), both self-reported and objective measures of
physical activity, and objective measures of app usability
through app analytics. Finally, we used a novel approach to
examine intervention efficacy, which showed positive effects
that are not observed [38] using more traditional analysis.
Future Directions
Overall, 3 key messages from our findings point to future
directions in mHealth research. First, even in the mHealth
context, parental engagement matters as it can increase
children’s adherence to a lifestyle intervention and provide the
household environment that supports behavior change. Thus,
whether a lifestyle intervention is delivered in person or on the
web, parents should be involved as they are active agents of
change. Second, dose-response analyses should assess how (and
not only how much) the app is being used by the participants,
as users’full engagement with the active ingredients of the app
seems to be a critical factor for the success of mHealth
interventions. Finally, as participants’engagement with specific
features of an app is key to promoting behavior change, future
research should examine how we design program components
that ensure users interact with the active ingredients of the
mHealth intervention.
Conclusions
This study showed that distinct patterns of use exist among both
parents and children who used a family-based lifestyle mHealth
app, namely, Aim2Be. Identifying who uses mHealth apps and
how can help us understand and develop more tailored
interventions to support various users in a health behavior
change process. Our findings point to the importance of
optimizing users’ full engagement with the active ingredients
of the app as a critical factor for the success of mHealth
interventions and highlight the need for further research to
understand program design elements that can influence
participant engagement.
