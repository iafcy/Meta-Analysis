Purpose: Given the prevalence of physical inactivity among American adults, convenient, low-cost 
interventions are strongly indicated. This study determined the 6- and 12-month effectiveness of 
telephone interventions delivered by health educators or by an automated computer system in promoting 
physical activity. Design: Initially inactive men and women age 55 years and older (N (cid:1) 218) in stable 
health participated. Participants were randomly assigned to human advice, automated advice, or health 
education control. Measures: The validated 7-day physical activity recall interview was used to estimate 
minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical activity differences by experimental arm were 
verified on a random subsample via accelerometry. Results: Using intention-to-treat analysis, at 6 
months, participants in both interventions, although not differing from one another, showed significant 
improvements in weekly physical activity compared with controls. These differences were generally 
maintained at 12 months, with both intervention arms remaining above the target of 150 min per week 
of moderate to vigorous physical activity on average. Conclusion: Automated telephone-linked delivery 
systems represent an effective alternative for delivering physical activity advice to inactive older adults. 
Regular physical activity plays an important role in the preven- 
tion and control of a range of chronic health conditions (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 1996), but 30% or less 
of middle-aged and older adults engage regularly in health- 
enhancing physical activities (U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services and National Center for Chronic Disease Preven- 
tion and Health Promotion, 2002), and 29% or more report no

leisure-time physical activity at all (U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services and National Center for Chronic Disease Preven- 
tion and Health Promotion, 2002). Given this, promoting regular 
physical activity in an efficient and cost-effective manner remains 
a significant clinical and public health challenge (U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, 2001; Wang et al., 2004). 
The Task Force on Community Preventive Services reviewed 
interventions to increase regular physical activity and rated indi- 
vidually adapted health behavior change interventions delivered 
via telephone or other formats as effective and strongly recom- 
mended for broader dissemination (Kahn et al., 2002; Task Force 
on Community Preventive Services, 2001). In addition to freeing 
both participant and provider from the setting-based constraints 
characteristic of face-to-face approaches, the telephone has been 
identified, from a communication theory perspective, as the richest 
medium next to face-to-face communication (Webster & Trevino, 
1995). This is due to its ability to allow for preexisting, “natural” 
elements of verbal communication as well as to allow the devel- 
opment of a personalized focus in a one-on-one discussion 
(Webster & Trevino, 1995). Such telephone counseling, based on 
well-established theories of behavior change, that is, social cognitive 
theory (Bandura, 2001) and the transtheoretical model (Marcus & 
Simkin, 1994), has been effective in promoting physical activity in 
diverse populations of initially inactive middle-aged and older adults 
(Castro & King, 2002; Hooker et al., 2005; King, Baumann, 
O’Sullivan, Wilcox, & Castro, 2002). 



Emerging telecommunication technologies provide one poten- 
tially effective method for delivering ongoing, individually tai- 
lored physical activity telephone advice and support to large num- 
bers of people at potentially lower cost per person (Marcus, Nigg, 
Riebe, & Forsyth, 2000). Extending the reach of telecommunica- 
tion technologies to promote physical activity has recently been 
accomplished through the development and successful evaluation 
of telephone-linked, interactive voice response systems for deliv- 
ering physical activity advice (Jarvis, Friedman, Heeren, & 
Cullinane, 1997; Pinto et al., 2002). However, few automated 
delivery programs have been formally evaluated or compared with 
programs delivered by trained health professionals (Jarvis et al., 
1997; Pinto et al., 2002). 
The Community Health Advice by Telephone (CHAT) trial 
evaluated the effectiveness of telephone-based physical activity 
guidance and support delivered via a trained health educator or an 
automated system across an extended (12-month) period. Both 
programs were developed to optimize the natural elements of “real 
time” personalized verbal communication (communication theory) 
in combination with an emphasis on empirically supported cogni- 
tive and behavioral processes of change, for example, personal 
commitment, enlisting support, self-efficacy enhancement, self- 
monitoring (social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical model). 
We sought to answer the following primary question in this trial: 
Among underactive community-dwelling adults age 55 years and 
older, how effective was the automated advice system in promot- 
ing regular, moderate-intensity or more vigorous (MOD(cid:2)) phys- 
ical activity in the short term (i.e., 6 months) and longer term (i.e., 
12 months) relative to a similar program delivered by a trained 
health educator or to an attention-control arm? This study also 
examined differences in selected perceived functioning and well- 
being outcomes across the three study arms, in light of the impor- 
tance of such outcomes to the daily quality of life of older adults 
and the growing literature linking such functioning and well-being 
outcomes to regular physical activity (Rejeski & Mihalko, 2001). 


The methods for the CHAT trial have been described in detail 
elsewhere (King, Friedman, et al., 2002) and will be described 
briefly here. Study eligibility criteria consisted of the following: 1) 
ages 55 years and older; 2) not initially engaged in more than 60 
minutes per week of moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical 
activity over the previous 6 months; 3) free of any medical con- 
dition that would limit participation in moderate-intensity exercise; 
4) body mass index (BMI) (cid:1) 40; 5) average alcohol intake (cid:1) 3 
drinks per day; 6) able to speak and understand English suffi- 
ciently to provide informed consent and participate in study inter- 
vention and assessment procedures; 7) regular access to a touch- 
tone phone; 8) not planning to move from the area over the study 
period; and 9) willing to be randomized to any of the three study 
arms. Major recruitment strategies consisted of promotion in local 
media outlets, along with distribution of flyers and brochures to 
local health clinics, pharmacies, senior centers, and other commu- 
nity settings. Individuals who met initial eligibility requirements 
during a telephone screen underwent baseline medical and psy- 
chosocial assessment. Following stratification by gender, subjects 
were randomly assigned, using a computerized version of the 
Efron procedure (Efron, 1971), to one of three 12-month experi- 
mental arms: 1) a home-based moderate-intensity physical activity 
program delivered primarily via a trained telephone counselor (i.e., 
Human Advice arm); 2) a home-based moderate-intensity physical 
activity program delivered primarily via an automated, computer- 
controlled interactive telephone system (i.e., Automated Advice 
arm); or 3) a health education attention-control arm. Blinded 
evaluation of individuals enrolled in the three arms occurred at 
baseline, 6, and 12 months (i.e., all study assessment staff were 
blinded to participant study arm assignment). The appropriate 
university institutional review boards approved the study protocol. 
Human advice arm. This arm consisted primarily of 
telephone-assisted physical activity counseling by a trained health 
educator (King, Haskell, Taylor, Kraemer, & DeBusk, 1991). 
Individuals received an initial 
in-person 30-40 minute health 
educator-led instructional session, including development of an 
individualized plan emphasizing a gradual progression of activity 
frequency, duration, and intensity towards a goal of 30 minutes or 
more of moderate-intensity endurance exercise (primarily brisk 
walking) on most days of the week (Pate et al., 1995). The 
remaining intervention contacts occurred via brief (i.e., 10 to 15 
minutes) structured counselor-initiated telephone calls that oc- 
curred on a bi-weekly, then monthly basis. Each participant was 
scheduled to receive approximately 15 contacts during the study 
year during which they received individualized information, sup- 
port, and problem-solving around physical activity barriers. Dis- 
cussion of cognitive and behavioral strategies, derived from Social 
Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 2001) and the Transtheoretical 
Model, (Marcus & Simkin, 1994) occurred as appropriate to each 
person’s stage of motivational readiness for change (Marcus & 
Simkin, 1994). Telephone contacts were supplemented with infor- 
mational mailings and use of a Yamax Digi-walker pedometer to 
provide individualized activity feedback to the participant 
(AccuSplit, San Jose, CA) (Bassett et al., 1996). All participants in 
this arm recorded information about their physical activity levels 
(e.g., type, frequency, duration, steps accumulated on the pedom- 
eter) on a daily basis, and then reported this information to their 
telephone counselor during their regular telephone contacts. 
Automated advice arm. This arm consisted primarily of 
telephone-assisted physical activity counseling by an automated 
telephone-linked computer (TLC) system (Pinto et al., 2002). The 
counseling content delivered in the TLC-based physical activity 
program was modeled after the counseling protocol utilized in the 
Human Advice arm and was similarly based on Social Cognitive 
Theory and the Transtheoretical Model (King, Friedman, et al., 
2002). Individuals randomized to this arm received an initial 
in-person health educator-led instructional session that was iden- 
tical to that in the Human Advice arm, with the exception of 
additional instructions in the use of the TLC system. The content 
of the counseling delivered by TLC was consistent with that 
delivered by the health educators, including physical activity as- 
sessment, progress evaluation, 
individualized problem-solving, 
goal-setting, feedback, and delivery of positive support and tai- 
lored advice. The total number and schedule of ‘counselor’- 
initiated contacts by the TLC system, using a programmed out- 
dialer, was the same as that scheduled in the Human Advice arm. 
TLC ‘spoke’ to participants over the telephone using computer- 
controlled speech generation. The users communicated using the 


touch-tone keypad of their telephones (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto et 
al., 2002). At the beginning of each call, participants in each 
intervention were asked whether they had experienced any phys- 
ical symptoms or complaints that could interfere with their phys- 
ical activity program. Participants in both interventions responding 
‘yes’ to this question were told to stop exercising and contact their 
personal physician to discuss the health issues further. This issue 
was assessed on the next call in both intervention arms. 
Intervention quality assurance procedures for the two interven- 
tion arms included weekly evaluation of telephone counseling 
session number, content, and length. For the Human Advice arm, 
this was accomplished through review of counselor summary 
forms completed at the time of each contact and independent 
review of audio-taped telephone contacts for appropriate content 
(approximately one-third of telephone contacts—which were rou- 
tinely audio-taped by counseling personnel after securing partici- 
pant permission–were randomly selected for independent review 
by study investigators and non-study doctoral level clinical psy- 
chologists) (King, Friedman, et al., 2002). For the Automated 
Advice arm, quality control was accomplished through semi- 
weekly evaluation of the technical performance of the automated 
system via TLC’s automatic contact summarization database, as 
well as daily monitoring of the automated system’s telephone 
‘help’ line, which was used by participants to report any problems 
related to interacting with the TLC system (King, Friedman, et al., 
2002). 

Individuals randomized to this arm 
were offered weekly health education classes that focused on a 
variety of non-physical activity topics of interest to middle- and 
older aged adults such as nutrition and home safety, and were 
asked not to change their usual physical activity patterns during the 
12-month study period. At the end of 12 months, persons in this 
arm were offered a six-month health educator-delivered telephone- 
based exercise program. 

Stanford 7-day physical activity recall (PAR). The 7-Day PAR 
(Blair et al., 1985) served as the primary measure of physical 
activity. The PAR provides an estimate of energy expenditure and 
minutes per week engaged in MOD(cid:2) activity, as defined by the 
most recent Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al., 
2000). The PAR is a validated and extensively used structured 
interview in which the participant estimates the amount of time 
spent each day during the past seven days in four intensity cate- 
gories of activity: sleep, and moderate, hard, and very hard phys- 
ical activity (Sallis et al., 1985). Inter-rater and test-retest reliabili- 
ties have been reported in the .69 –.86 range (Gross, Sallis, Buono, 
Roby, & Nelson, 1990; Rauh, Hovell, Hofstetter, Sallis, & 
Gleghorn, 1992), and concurrent validity in the .75-.84 range 
(Dubbert, Weg, Kirchner, & Shaw, 2004). Time in light activity is 
derived by adding minutes spent in sleep to the total number of 
minutes spent in the assessed physical activity categories, then 
subtracting this sum from 24 hours. The PAR-based mean daily 
energy expenditure estimates (kcal/kg-1/day-1) from MOD(cid:2) activ- 
ity was considered to be the primary study outcome measure (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). 
The PAR was supplemented with the CHAMPS physical activ- 
ity questionnaire for older adults (Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001). This 
instrument has been found to provide a valid and reliable estimate 
of energy expenditure in middle- and older-aged adults (King, 
Baumann, et al., 2002; King, Pruitt, et al., 2000; Stewart, Mills, et 
al., 2001; Stewart, Verboncoeur, et al., 2001). Three-month stabil- 
ity coefficients have been reported to be in the .70 –.84 range for 
the caloric expenditure measure in community samples of older 
adults (Harada, Chiu, King, & Stewart, 2001; Stewart, Mills, et al., 
2001). The instrument has also been shown to have concurrent 
validity when compared with interviewer-collected physical activ- 
ity data (King, Pruitt, et al., 2000; Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001), as 
well as sensitivity to change with a moderate-intensity physical 
activity program in at least six different community samples of 
middle-age and older women and men (Hooker et al., 2005; King, 
Baumann, et al., 2002; King, Pruitt, et al., 2000b; Stewart, Ver- 
boncoeur, et al., 2001). In addition to energy expenditure esti- 
mates, estimates of mean times per week engaged in 30 minutes or 
more of moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD(cid:2)) physical 
activity and mean minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) activity can also be 
derived from the CHAMPS (Stewart, Mills, et al., 2001). We also 
evaluated the sensitivity of the Yale Physical Activity Survey in 
the current study (DiPietro, Casperson. Ostfeld, & Nadel, 1993), 
but given that this instrument, in contrast to the other two instru- 
ments described above, was not found to be sensitive to change in 
this study, it will not be discussed further. 
Objective physical activity measurement. Approximately 26% 
(25.7%) of study participants (n (cid:1) 56) were randomly selected 
from across the three study arms to wear an accelerometer (CSA 
Actigraph, model #7164; Computer Science and Applications, 
Shalimar, FL; currently manufactured by Manufacturing Technol- 
ogies, Inc., http://www.mtiactigraph.com) that recorded body 
movement continuously for up to 7 days during approximately the 
mid-point of the intervention (i.e., 6 months). Accelerometry pro- 
vides a valid and reliable indicator of amount of physical activity, 
and is considered to be the most efficient and effective means of 
validating physical activity behavior in epidemiological and RCT 
research (King, Baumann, et al., 2002; King et al., 1991; Pruitt, 
Haskell, Bolen, Ahn, & King, 2003, Pruitt, Varady, Haskell, 
Bolen, & King, 2002). In order to more accurately identify 
moderate-intensity activity, 
individualized accelerometer count 
‘thresholds’ were determined by having participants wear the 
accelerometer at 6 months while walking on a level treadmill at a 
pace required to elicit a heart rate of 65–75% of maximal predicted 
heart rate (Pruitt et al., 2002, 2003). These individualized activity 
count thresholds were subsequently applied to the accelerometry 
data collected in the field to determine amount of time spent in 
MOD(cid:2) activity. 

Two perceived functioning and well-being questionnaires of 
particular relevance for older adults were collected at baseline, 6, 
and 12 months. The Vitality Plus Scale (VPS) is a 10-item ques- 
tionnaire that assesses, on a 5-point scale, current well-being 
constructs that have been associated with regular physical activity 
and are relevant for older adults, including sleep quality, energy 
level, mood, constipation, morning stiffness, and general pain 
(Myers et al., 1999). Participants also completed a validated 9-item 
questionnaire evaluating satisfaction with body function (e.g., fit- 
ness, stamina) and appearance (Reboussin et al., 2000). 



Based on previous literature investigating telephone-based 
physical activity interventions in similarly-aged samples (Jarvis et 
al., 1997; King, Baumann, et al., 2002; King et al.,1991; Pinto et 
al., 2002), a sample size of approximately 61 participants com- 
pleting the study per cell was judged to be adequate for detecting 
a 30 minute per week difference across 7 days as measured by the 
PAR in moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity at 
90% power with 2-sided alpha set at .05 (Kraemer & Thiemann, 
1987). Analysis of variance (general linear models procedure) 
(Spector, Goodnight, Sall, & Sarle, 1985) was used to evaluate 
between-arm differences at baseline. Analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) (Spector et al., 1985) was used to assess change 
across the initial 6-month adoption phase as well as across the 
entire 12-month intervention period (Marcus, Dubbert, et al., 
2000). In analyzing change, main effects for arm assignment and 
gender along with their interactions were evaluated, with baseline 
levels of the dependent variables serving as covariates. Because 
the gender x arm interaction was non-significant in all analyses, 
the results from the more straightforward analyses without the 
interaction term are presented. Chi-square analyses were con- 
ducted at 6 and 12 months comparing the percentages of the three 
arms reaching the Surgeon General’s recommendation of at least 
150 minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) activity (U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, 1996). Alpha was set at .05 using a 
2-tailed test of significance. 
We incorporated intent-to-treat principles for the primary out- 
come of interest, i.e., physical activity measured using the PAR, 
whereby, for participants with missing or incomplete PAR data at 
both 6 and 12 months (n (cid:1) 19), their baseline values were used and 
for participants missing 6-month data only (n (cid:1) 13), the calculated 
mid-point between their baseline and 12-month values was used. 
For participants missing 12-month data only (n (cid:1) 10), an inspec- 
tion of secondary physical activity data sources occurred (i.e., 
12-month CHAMPS questionnaires, logged reports of physical 
activity occurring during the 7-12 month intervention period that 
were collected as part of all exercise advisor [automated or human] 
interactions). If the data from these secondary sources indicated 
that participants were at least as active as their 6-month PAR data 
indicated, then the 6-month values were used (Simkin-Silverman, 
Wing, Boraz, & Kuller, 2003). If no secondary data were available 
for the participant or indicated less physical activity was occurring 
relative to the 6-month PAR, then baseline values were used. Eight 
of the 10 participants missing only 12-month data had corroborat- 
ing data from secondary sources indicating physical activity levels 
that were similar to or greater than those reported on their 6-month 
PAR. For these participants, 6-month PAR values were used at 12 
months. For the 2 participants without corroborating data, baseline 
values were used. The intent-to-treat analyses led to results that 
were comparable to those conducted using the available data only. 
The intent-to-treat analyses are reported for the PAR outcomes. 
For those ANCOVAs and chi-square analyses that reached statis- 
tical significance, pre-planned comparisons between arms were con- 
ducted using the least squares means procedure in SAS (Spector et al., 
1985). Because this was the first study to evaluate the impact of 
automated telephone advice for physical activity on the secondary 
outcomes concerning rated function and well-being, we conducted 
these exploratory analyses using the available data. 


A summary of participant flow and retention is shown in Figure 
1. Of the 218 individuals enrolled in CHAT, 189 (86.7%) had 6- 
and 12-month 7-Day PAR data. These retention rates were not 
significantly different across the 3 study arms (Human Advice (cid:1)

trol (cid:1) 62/70, or 88.6%; p (cid:3) .10). Those with 12-month 7-Day 
PAR data were comparable to those without 12-month PAR data 
(n (cid:1) 29) on the major baseline variables of interest, with the 
following exceptions: Those without 12-month 7-Day PAR data 
reported fewer baseline days per week in which they engaged in 
moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity lasting at 
least 30 minutes (M (cid:1) 0.59, SD (cid:1) 1.28 days/wk) relative to 
participants with 12-month data (M (cid:1) 1.23, SD (cid:1) 1.65 days/wk; 
t(52) (cid:1) 3.11, p (cid:1) .003); and participants without 12-month PAR 
data had higher rated stress scores at baseline, as measured via the 
Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarch, & Mermelstein, 1983), 
(M (cid:1) 23.2 (cid:4) 7.7) relative to subjects with 12-month data (M (cid:1) 
20.4, SD (cid:1) 6.6; t(215) (cid:1) 2.06, p (cid:1) .04). Descriptive baseline data 
by arm are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for selected variables. (Raw 
data are shown to allow for comparisons with other studies and to 
provide clinically meaningful information.) Participants were sim- 
ilar across the three study arms on the major baseline variables of 
interest (all p values (cid:3) .20). Similar to many individuals in this age 
group, a large proportion of participants (Human Advice arm (cid:1) 
47.3%; Automated Advice arm (cid:1) 59.5%; Control arm (cid:1) 51.4%) 
were on medications for a range of chronic conditions, including 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and asthma. 
Table 3 shows the number and total duration of telephone 
contacts over 12 months by intervention arm. (This table includes 
all participants who were randomized to the two intervention arms, 
with the exception of those participants who dropped out of the 
intervention early because of initial dissatisfaction with their arm 
assignment [n (cid:1) 1 in the Human Advice arm] or initial technical 
difficulties with the TLC system [n (cid:1) 5 in the Automated Advice 
arm].) Although the automated system made a significantly larger 
mean number of total call attempts to establish contact over the 
12-month period, t(139) (cid:1) 13.3, p (cid:5) .0001, a somewhat (though 
not significantly) greater number of total calls were actually com- 
pleted in the Human Advice relative to the Automated Arm (see 
Table 3). The average call length was also greater in the Human 
Advice Arm relative to the Automated Arm, t(139) (cid:1) 6.3, p (cid:5) 
.0001. At the end of the 12-month intervention period, mean 
participant satisfaction ratings from both intervention arms were 
generally positive with respect to their CHAT exercise advisor 
(ratings of (cid:3) 4 on a 6-point scale), although the overall satisfaction

ratings were higher for the Human Advice arm than for the

rating (cid:1) 4.3, SD (cid:1) 1.0; t(43.5) (cid:1) 7.1, p (cid:1) .0001.) 
Five participants randomized to the Automated Arm reported 
initial technical problems with the TLC system early in the project 
and soon afterwards dropped out of the study. All reported prob- 
lems were fixed. Forty-one Automated Arm participants (55%) 
utilized the TLC telephone help line at least once during the 
intervention to obtain assistance with the TLC system. The ques- 
tions directed to the independent staff manning the TLC help line 
were typically simple in content (e.g., forgotten password; system 
called at wrong time) and were able to be resolved by the TLC 
programming staff with minimal difficulty, typically within 24 
hours of notification. 
For the Control arm, average attendance to the weekly health 
education workshops equaled 5.7 sessions across the 12-month 
period. For the 26 subjects who attended at least one workshop, 
mean attendance rates across the year equaled 14.8 sessions 
(range (cid:1) 1-50 out of 50). Participants who missed any workshop 
received the relevant informational materials through the mail. 

At 6 months, both the Human Advice and Automated Advice 
arms, while not significantly different from one another ( p (cid:1) .73), 
had significantly greater mean energy expenditure in MOD(cid:2) 
activity than the Control arm (F(4, 217) (cid:1) 4.73, p (cid:1) .01 (see 
Figure 2). Similarly, both the Human Advice and Automated 
Advice arms, while not significantly different from one another 
( p (cid:1) .65), had significantly greater mean minutes/week spent in 
MOD(cid:2) activity than the Control arm, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 4.73, p (cid:1) .01. 
Comparable arm differences were found for the number of days 
per week engaged in 30 minutes or more of MOD(cid:2) activity ( p 
values for Human Advice vs. Control (cid:1) .0001; for Automated 
Advice vs. Control (cid:1) .003) (see Table 2 for means). 
The ANCOVAs using the CHAMPS data mirrored the PAR 
results in showing significant differences between the two 
physical activity arms and Controls for mean energy expendi- 
ture (kcal/kg-1/day-1) in MOD(cid:2) activities (F(4, 217) (cid:1) 7.73, 
p (cid:1) .0006); mean minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) activity, F(4, 
217) (cid:1) 8.93, p (cid:1) .0002; and number of times per week engaged 
in 30 minutes or more of MOD(cid:2) activity, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 4.57, 
p (cid:1) .01 (see Table 2 for means). 
As expected, the CHAMPS-based means were generally higher 
than those found with the PAR. This is because the CHAMPS 
questionnaire involves self-reporting of ‘usual activity levels’ over the 
previous 4-week period and has participants choose categories reflect- 
ing varying ranges of minutes/week engaged in each activity. In 
contrast, the PAR asks them to report actual minutes engaged in each 
activity for each day of a specified period, with the interview format 
providing a level of probing and clarification absent from the paper- 
and-pencil CHAMPS (King, Pruitt, et al., 2000). Because of these 
constraints, the CHAMPS and similar questionnaires are best utilized 
to understand relative differences in physical activity across individ- 
uals and/or across time as opposed to absolute physical activity levels 
for each individual as targeted in the PAR. 
At six months, a significantly greater percentage of subjects in 
the Human Advice (52.7%) and Automated Advice (44.6%) arms

Adherence to prescribed physical activity intensity: Information 
assessed by the objective activity monitor. Participants ran- 
domly selected to wear the Actigraph activity monitor at 6 
months wore it for an average of 5.8 days (range (cid:1) 2–7 days), 
with similar numbers of days and hours worn per day across 
arms ( p (cid:3) .10). Given the reduced sample size for this sub- 
study (n (cid:1) 56), and the fact that the Human and Automated 
Advice arms did not differ in any of the Actigraph-derived 
measures ( p values .28), the two arms were combined and 
compared to the Control arm. Intervention participants showed 
more physical activity relative to Controls based on the mean 
number of accelerometer counts accumulated per hour averaged 
across days worn (i.e., mean number of counts was 31.3% 
greater for intervention [M (cid:1) 20,606, SD (cid:1) 8,641 counts] 
versus controls [M (cid:1) 15,690, SD (cid:1) 6,058 counts]) ( p (cid:1) .045). 
In addition, the mean number of minutes spent in the individ- 
ual’s MOD(cid:2) activity range accumulated over 5 to 7 days was 
significantly greater in the two intervention arms (M (cid:1) 112.5, 
SD (cid:1) 118.3) relative to the Control arm (mean minutes (cid:1) 36.8, 
SD (cid:1) 35.2), t(35.1) (cid:1) 3.1, p (cid:1) .004. These data provide an 
objective indicator that, on the days in which the accelerometer 
was worn, Intervention participants engaged in greater amounts 
of physical activity both in general and in their targeted inten- 
sity range relative to Controls.

greater than the Control arm, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 3.14, p (cid:1) .045, although 
the results were somewhat stronger for the Human Advice arm 
relative to the Automated Advice arm (see Table 2). Similar arm 
differences were found for PAR-based number of days per week 
engaged in 30 minutes or more of MOD(cid:2) activity (see Table 2). 
The 12-month ANCOVAs using the CHAMPS data mirrored 
the 7-Day PAR results in showing significant differences between 
the two physical activity arms and the Control arm for mean 
kcal/kg-1/day-1 in MOD(cid:2) activity, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 3.66, p (cid:1) .03; 
mean minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) activity, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 3.24, p (cid:1)

activity, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 2.78, p (cid:1) .05. 
At 12 months, a significantly greater percentage of subjects in 
the Human Advice arm (51.4%) achieved the Surgeon General’s 
150 or more minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) activity relative to 
Control (30.0%), X2(2) (cid:1) 7.0, p (cid:5) .03. The Automated Advice 
arm (44.6%) was not significantly different from either the Human 
Advice arm ( p (cid:1) .51) or the Control arm ( p (cid:1) .10). 
Safety of the Two Telephone-Based Physical Activity 
Interventions 

Twelve-month results from the 7-Day PAR for each of the three 
arms are shown in Figure 2. Mean energy expenditure in MOD(cid:2) 
activity for both the Human Advice and Automated Advice arms, 
while not significantly different from one another ( p (cid:1) .60), 
remained significantly greater than the Control arm, F(4, 217) (cid:1) 
3.4, p (cid:1) .036. Similarly, mean minutes/wk in MOD(cid:2) activity for 
both the Human Advice and Automated Advice arms, while not 
significantly different from one another ( p (cid:1) .66), remained 
No physical activity-related cardiac events occurred. Physical 
activity-related non-cardiac injuries were few and were similar in 
number across study arms ( p (cid:3) .10). These included mild mus- 
cular fatigue, strain, or soreness during the initial 3 - 4 months of 
intervention (experienced by approximately 22% [i.e., 31/141] of 
persons across the two physical activity arms). Such physical 
activity-related symptoms are typical for under-active individuals 
initiating a regular physical activity regimen; they were treated 
primarily at home and did not interfere with participation.

Changes in Physical Functioning and Well-Being at 6 
and 12 Months 
At 6 months, the three arms were not significantly different in 
Vitality Plus or Satisfaction with Fitness scores ( p values (cid:3) .10). 
At 12 months, the Human Advice arm had significantly greater 
improvements on both of these measures (adjusted Ms (cid:1) 37.5, 
SD (cid:1) 6.1 for Vitality Plus and 36.0, SD (cid:1) 12.3 for Satisfaction 
with Fitness) relative to the Control arm (adjusted Ms (cid:1) 34.8, 
SD (cid:1) 5.8 and 30.0, SD (cid:1) 11.9, respectively, p values (cid:5) .04). 
Neither of these arms significantly differed from the Automated 
Advice arm at 12 months on these scales (adjusted Ms (cid:1) 35.9, 
SD (cid:1) 6.3 for Vitality Plus and 32.8, SD (cid:1) 12.1 for Satisfaction 
with Fitness; p (cid:3) .19). 

The results of this study provide the first systematic evidence 
that automated, telephone-based computer systems can lead to 
improvements in physical activity levels over an extended time 
period. The automated system, which was developed using estab- 
lished behavioral principles and strategies (Bandura, 2001; 
Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984), achieved significant physical 
activity increases in a community-based sample of middle- and 
older-aged adults that were comparable to those achieved by 
trained health educators at 6 months. By 12 months the effective- 
ness of the automated system appeared to diminish relative to 
Human Advice (i.e., mean number of minutes per week in MOD(cid:2) 
physical activity relative to Control was no longer significant at the 
.05 level with the current sample size). The mean minutes per 
week of MOD(cid:2) activity in the Automated Advice arm did remain, 
however, above the 150 minutes per week of MOD(cid:2) activity 
recommended by the Surgeon General and other national bodies 
(Pate et al., 1995; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
1996). The proportions of Automated Advice participants meeting 
or exceeding the national recommendations at 6 and 12 months 
compares favorably to those seen in recent physical activity trials 
evaluating mediated and face-to-face interventions (Marcus et al., 
1998; The Writing Group for Activity Counseling Trial Research 
Group, 2001). However, improvements in the two rated function- 
ing and well-being variables at 12 months were not as great in the 
Automated Advice as in the Human Advice Arm, suggesting that 
such automated systems may be less potent in influencing physical 
activity-related aspects of well-being that may be important to 
quality of life as well as continued physical activity participation 
(Rejeski & Mihalko, 2001). 
The results expand the potential physical activity program 
choices available to health care providers and other community 
organizations. Such choices are important, given the substantial 
percentage of inactive individuals in this age group and the dif- 
fering needs and preferences of subgroups of middle- and older- 
aged adults in this health area (King et al., 1997). While random- 
ized clinical trial (RCT) research is based on evaluation of mean 
differences between study arms, means may conceal subgroup 
differences (reflected in the reasonably large standard deviations 
observed across the three arms at 6 and 12 months) in program 
response that are important to consider when making clinical or 
public health-based intervention decisions (King et al., 1997; U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Systematically 
exploring subgroup differences in response to automated versus 
human-delivered programs is strongly recommended in future 
research, as is systematic evaluation of the relative cost- 
effectiveness of the two interventions when delivered in more 
‘real-world’ settings. 
Although the current study sample was largely white, well- 
educated, and reasonably healthy, 
the original automated, 
telephone-based system was developed and successfully tested in 
less-educated, lower income samples of primary care patients, 
30-50% of whom were ethnic minorities (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto 
et al., 2002). The acceptability of the system among such groups in 
the earlier studies is encouraging, although continued exploration 
of its utility with a broader range of population segments is 
indicated. It appears, based on our results, that the use of an 
out-dialer that is programmed to make scheduled telephone con- 
tacts is an effective alternative to relying on participants to initiate 
a call into the system on a regular basis (Pinto et al., 2002). 
While the one-year intervention period for this study is longer 
than that used in prior investigations of automated counseling 
systems for physical activity (Jarvis et al., 1997; Pinto et al., 2002), 
the question remains concerning whether the declines generally 
observed in the Automated Advice arm between 6 and 12 months 
might continue, rendering the Automated Advice program ineffec- 
tive eventually in maintaining adequate physical activity levels 
over the long-run. This question deserves further exploration, as do 
methods of combining the two methods (Human and Automated 
advice) to yield potentially less costly yet effective long-term 
intervention effects. 
We conclude that delivery of individualized advice and support 
via telephone-based automated systems is an effective and attrac- 
tive option for middle- and older-aged adults that should be con- 
sidered for improving regular physical activity participation. In the 
current study, both automated and health educator-based programs 
resulted in improvements in physical activity levels that have been 
linked to important health outcomes in aging adults (U.S. Depart- 
ment of Health and Human Services, 1996). Such telephone-based 
programs can provide a more convenient and flexible channel for 
delivering ongoing advice and support for the relatively large 
proportion of the American public who find it difficult to attend 
structured, setting-based classes or programs on a regular basis 
(King, Castro, et al., 2000; Wilcox, King, Brassington, & Ahn, 
1999). Future research should focus on systematic evaluation of 
which subgroups of individuals should be matched to which pro- 
gram (human vs. automated advice vs. a combination of the two 
program types) to optimize sustained behavior change in a 
resource-efficient manner, as well expanding the exploration of 
automated counseling delivery systems to more diverse, under- 
served populations.
