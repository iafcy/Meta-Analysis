Background: Behavioral eHealth and mobile health interventions have been moderately successful in increasing physical 
activity, although opportunities for further improvement remain to be discussed. Chatbots equipped with natural language 
processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors 
and smartphones. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical 
activity. 
Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of a machine learning–based physical 
activity chatbot. 
Methods: A quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. 
Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily 
updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring, sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement, 
and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants, 
the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, sent general motivational messages, and 
checked participants’ activity history (ie, the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and 
acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical 
activity. 
Results: Among 116 participants, 95 (81.9%) were female, 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship, 101 (87.1%) were White, and 
82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. 
Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113, 82.3%). Most of the participants 
scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113, 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113, 87.6%) as at least “OK.” About one-third (40/113, 
35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future, and 53.1% (60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more 
active. On average, 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. 
At follow-up, participants recorded more steps (increase of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase 
of 154.2 min/week; 3.58 times higher at follow-up; 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical 
activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up. 
Conclusions: The machine learning–based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants’ physical 
activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However, the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality 
and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of 
intervention.

Background 
It has been established that physical activity reduces the risk of 
mortality and many health conditions such as cardiovascular 
diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer [1]. However, less than 
half of Australian adults meet the physical activity guidelines 
of at least 150 minutes of vigorous-moderate-intensity physical 
activity per week [2]. It was estimated that physical inactivity 
accounted for 53.8 billion in health care costs and an additional 
13.7 billion in productivity losses worldwide in 2013 [3]. 
Therefore, interventions to increase physical activity are needed 
[4]. To date, many of these interventions have been delivered 
face-to-face and are expensive [5]. Therefore, there is a need 
for low-cost interventions targeting large populations. 
With the advancement of mobile technology, people can access 
the internet almost everywhere and at any time. It is estimated 
in 2019 that 4.48 billion people are active internet users, 4.07 
billion are unique mobile internet users, and 3.66 billion are 
active mobile social media users [6]. This indicates that mobile 
health (mHealth) has the potential to offer a great platform for 
behavior change interventions that can reach a large number of 
people at a low cost. In the last decade, many eHealth and 
mHealth interventions targeting physical activity have been 
examined [7-10], many of which use email, SMS, and websites 
as delivery tools. Overall, these interventions have been able 
to produce moderate effect sizes in increasing physical activity 
[7-10]. As such, there is still room to further increase the 
effectiveness of behavioral eHealth and mHealth interventions. 
One often cited problem in this area is the low levels of 
engagement and interaction with eHealth and mHealth 
interventions [11]. As there is evidence that the more 
participants use the interventions, the more effective the 
interventions tend to be [5,12], an important aim is to design 
eHealth and mHealth interventions that will lead to higher levels 
of engagement. 
The use of chatbots is a potential innovative avenue for 
levels of engagement. A chatbot or 
achieving higher 
conversational agent is a computer program that can interact 
with users [13]. Equipped with natural language processing 
capability, a modern chatbot can effectively engage in 
conversations with users [14]. Chatbots can help save human 
resources while providing instant responses to requests. In 
particular, chatbots can also help users monitor participants’ 
progress by continuously evaluating physical activity data from 
wearable sensors and smartphones. Applying machine learning 
algorithms can also enable chatbots to provide personalized 
activity recommendations to a specific user. Chatbots can be 
embedded into different platforms, such as websites, apps, 
messaging programs or other social media to reach large 
numbers of people easily and conveniently. As such, chatbots 
have been adopted across many industries, such as finance, 
e-commerce, and health care [14-16].

Recent 
that health behavior change 
interventions using chatbots have mostly focused on mental 
health [17,18]. Among the few studies that used chatbots to 
promote physical activity and healthy diet [19], only 2 evaluated 
increases in physical activity [20,21]. However, the study 
conducted in Switzerland was designed to test differences in 
daily step goals among 3 groups (cash incentives vs charity 
incentives vs no incentives) rather than the effectiveness of the 
chatbot [21]. Only one study in Australia evaluated the 
effectiveness of a chatbot in improving diet and physical activity 
[20]. Although this study focused more on diet than physical 
activity, it did show a large increase in physical activity 
(approximately 110 moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
min/week). However, the chatbot evaluated in this study did 
not provide automatic daily updates that remind the participants 
about their physical activity goals and did not automatically 
adjust participants’ goals based on their current physical activity 
level. 
Objectives 
Given the lack of studies on the effectiveness of physical activity 
chatbots, the aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, 
interactive machine 
usability, and effectiveness of an 
learning–based physical activity chatbot that uses natural 
language processing and adaptive goal setting. 

Study Design and Participants 
A quasi-experimental design without a control group was 
conducted with outcomes evaluated at 2 time points—baseline 
and 6 weeks after participants started to use the chatbot. 
Prospective participants were recruited from a list of people 
who had previously used the 10,000 Steps program [22]. To be 
eligible, potential participants had to be inactive (<20 min/day 
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), live in Australia, 
have internet access and a smartphone, aged at least 18 years, 
self-reported motivation to improve physical activity (targeting 
those in need of support to become more active), not already 
participating in another physical activity program, not already 
owning and used a physical activity tracking device (eg, 
pedometer, Fitbit [Fitbit LLC], and Garmin) within the last 12 
months, and able to safely increase their activity levels. Those 
who were interested in the study and clicked on the link attached 
to the invitation emails were directed to a web-based survey. 
Prospective participants were provided with a participant 
information sheet and contact details of the research team and 
then asked to answer a series of screening questions to assess 
eligibility. If eligible, they completed a web-based consent form 
and baseline survey questions. After 6 weeks, the participants 
were asked to complete a follow-up web-based survey to assess 
changes over time. 
Owing to an unexpected Facebook policy change (we used the 
Messenger app to host the chatbot, which is owned by Facebook) 
that blocked the chatbot from sending out new messages to 
JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2021 | vol. 9 | iss. 11 | e28577 | p. 2 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


participants who did not respond to the previous message within 
24 hours, we were forced to stop the study at that point. As the 
recruitment was rolling, 48 participants had already completed 
the study when the Facebook policy change was implemented. 
For those who were still engaged in the study at that time, a 
follow-up survey was sent to them immediately at the time of 
implementation of this policy, resulting in a shorter intervention 
period. 
Invitation emails were sent to 13,670 email addresses registered 
in the 10,000 Steps program database between September and 
November 2020 (Figure 1). A total of 2.14% (292/13, 670) of 
people completed the eligibility survey during the recruitment 
period, with 58.9% (172/292) people deemed eligible. Eligible 
people were contacted by phone for verification. This resulted 
in 9 people being excluded from the study because they did not 
meet the eligibility criteria upon verification, were no longer 
interested, or had an illness or injury that prevented them from 
taking part. When recruitment closed, 12 people were placed 
on a waitlist. Another 16 people were excluded because they 
were unable to be recontacted or to connect to the chatbot, and 
15 withdrew because of an illness or personal issues. As a result, 
120 participants were enrolled at baseline. However, only 116 
completed the follow-up surveys. 

This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Committee of the Central Queensland University (application 
#0000022181). This study was retrospectively registered on the 
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12621000345886). 
Procedures 
Participants who agreed to participate, provided written consent, 
and completed the baseline survey were mailed a package 
including a Fitbit Flex 1 activity tracker (with instructions on 
how to use it), a participant information sheet, and instructions 
on how to download the Fitbit app on their smartphone and how 
to create a Fitbit account. Follow-up phone calls were conducted 
to ensure that participants received the package and were able 
to install the Fitbit app and use the Fitbit device. 
Participants wore their Fitbit for 7 days to collect their baseline 
physical activity data before connecting to the chatbot. To 
connect to the chatbot, participants were instructed to download 
and open the Messenger app on their smartphones and complete 
the secure verification process (only study participants were 
able to connect with the chatbot). Once verified, the participants 
started to receive daily messages and were able to interact with 
the chatbot. Participants were asked to engage with the chatbot 
(intervention) for a period of 6 weeks. 
Follow-up surveys were sent to the participants via email. Four 
reminders (a combination of text messages, email, and phone 
calls), each of which was 3 days apart, were sent to ask 
participants to complete the follow-up survey. A research 
assistant was available during the intervention period to assist 
participants with any technical issues that the participants may 
encounter. 
Intervention 
The chatbot, named Ida, was created and technically managed 
by an Australian company called SmartAI. However, the natural 
language processing capability was powered by Dialogflow 
(Google Inc), an advanced Google machine learning platform 
for creating conversational artificial intelligence applications. 
The Facebook Messenger app was selected for the deployment 
of the chatbot because of its popularity. The Fitbit Flex 1 device

(page number not for citation purposes) 


was used to measure the participants’ daily physical activity. 
Fitbit activity data were synced from the Fitbit platform to the 
chatbot platform and used by the chatbot to monitor the 
participants’ progress over time. 
The intervention was designed using the COM-B model. The 
COM-B model forms the core of the Behavior Change Wheel, 
a behavioral system focusing on 3 components: capability, 
opportunity, and motivation [23]. As explained below, the 
increase 
messages delivered by 
participants’ motivation (ie, motivational messages), capability 
(ie, through ongoing adaptive feedback on goal achievement), 
and opportunity (ie, educational content and activity reminders 
throughout the day helped participants become more aware of 
physical activity opportunities). The chatbot supported 
participants through 2 groups of actions: proactive and reactive. 


Proactive actions include the following: (1) Providing an update 
on participants’ physical activity level achieved the previous 
day and informing them of the goal they needed to achieve on 
the current day. This message was sent early in the morning at 
the time selected by each participant. (2) Sending out 1 or 2 
additional messages later in the day to encourage participants 
trying to achieve their daily goal or indicate they were doing 
great and had already achieved the goal when the message was 
sent. The number of messages and times was selected by each 
participant. (3) Automatically adjusting the daily activity goals 
based on the average physical activity level achieved during the 
7 previous days. The type of goal (step counts or minutes) and 
the amount per day (eg, 8000 steps/day or 35 min/day) that the 
participant wanted to achieve by the end of the study was also 
chosen by each participant. The goal was automatically adjusted 
to increase by 500 steps/day or 5 minutes of moderate-vigorous 
physical activity/day if the participant, on average, met their 
current goal over the last 7 days [24,25]. If not, the same goal 
was used. We used a combination of moderate and vigorous 
physical activity assessed by Fitbit to calculate the physical 
activity min/week. The information needed to personalize the 
chatbot was collected during the verification phone calls and 
added to the participants’ profile page on the chatbot platform, 
which was only accessible to the research team. 
Reactive actions, which occurred when the participants sent a 
request for information to the chatbot, include (1) providing 
sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, (2) 
sending general motivational messages to encourage participants 
to become more active, and (3) checking participants’ activity 
history (ie, the step counts or minutes that were achieved on 
any day) as requested. Examples of these messages are shown 
in Figure 2.

Measures 
Demographic characteristics were self-reported at baseline. 
Age, height, weight, years of schooling, and average daily work 
time (hours) were used as continuous variables; categorical 
variables included gender (male or female), marital status (not 
in a relationship or in a relationship), ethnicity (White or other), 
living area (major city, regional, or remote area), work status 
(full-time or other), and annual household income (≥Aus 
$130,000 [US $94,900], Aus $78,000 to <Aus $130,000 [US 
$56,940- $94900], or <Aus $78,000 [US $56,940]). Weight 
was also self-reported at follow-up. BMI was calculated as 
weight (kg)/height (m2) and was analyzed as a secondary 
outcome. 
Physical activity was objectively measured using the Fitbit Flex 
1. Although this device records both step counts and physical 
activity minutes, only step counts were used in the analysis. 
This is because the Fitbit only recorded the minutes if a user 
was active for at least 10 minutes, whereas all steps were 
counted regardless of whether they occurred during bouts of 
activity (10 minutes) or not. 
Self-reported physical activity was assessed at baseline (before 
receiving a Fitbit) and follow-up using the Active Australia 
Survey [26]. These questions asked about minutes participants 
spent on walking, moderate and vigorous physical activity per 
day, and the number of days they spent engaging in these 
activities in the last week. The total amount of time spent 
engaging in walking and moderate and vigorous physical activity 
in a week was calculated by adding the above times (with 
vigorous physical activity time doubled as per scoring 
instructions) [26]. Participants who spent at least 150 minutes 
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week were 
categorized as meeting the Australian physical activity 
guidelines. 
Usability and acceptability were assessed at follow-up using 
the System Usability Scale (SUS) [27] and other self-reported 
questions. The SUS includes 10 questions with 5 response 
options from strongly agree to strongly disagree. As 
recommended, the original scores for each question were 
converted to new scores, summed, and multiplied by 2.5, to 
generate an SUS score between 0 and 100 [27]. We used the 
cutoffs suggested by Bangor et al [28] to classify the SUS scores 
into 4 groups: excellent (85.58-100), good (72.75-85.57), OK 
(52.01-72.74), and poor (0-52.00). Other self-reported questions 
asked about the usefulness of the chatbot, willingness to use 
the chatbot in the future and recommend it to others, whether 
a participant experienced any technical issues, Fitbit wear time, 
and frequency of using the Fitbit app. 
Power and Data Analysis 
Posthoc power calculation was conducted for Fitbit step counts 
using the following parameters: difference in means, SDs, and 
correlation between step counts at 2 time points. The posthoc 
power for this study was 81.3%. 
Fitbit data were cleaned and processed using the Python v3.7 
(Python Software Foundation). As step counts of <1000 indicate 
that the Fitbit was not worn all day [29,30], these counts were 
removed. A 7-day moving average for the daily mean steps was 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
generated and used to show changes in steps over the study 
period. Average step counts were also calculated for weeks with 
at least 4 days of valid data; however, only data in the first week 
as baseline data (before the date that participants connected to 
the chatbot) and the last week of participation as follow-up data 
were used in the outcome analysis. As participation duration 
was different among the participants, doing this allowed the 
analysis to be performed for all participants together. 
SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for the analysis. Baseline 
characteristics were compared among those participating <4 
weeks, 4 to <6 weeks, and ≥6 weeks using Fisher exact tests 
for categorical variables and Welch analysis of variance for 
continuous variables, except for daily work time and total 
physical activity minutes, which were 
tested using 
Kruskal–Wallis tests. As a robustness check, the analysis was 
performed separately for 2 samples, a full sample and a 
subsample (excluding those using the chatbot <4 weeks). This 
ensures that the results reflect the effectiveness of the 
intervention for those with sufficient exposure to the chatbot. 
Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify changes 
in the outcomes. Normal distribution and identity link were 
used for BMI and Fitbit step counts. As total physical activity 
minutes were highly skewed, PROC TRANSREG was used to 
conduct the Box-Cox transformation analysis, and as a result, 
a fourth root transformation was applied. Generalized linear 
mixed models with normal distribution and log link were used 
for the transformed total physical activity minutes. Estimates 
were converted back into ratios for interpretative purposes. 
Empirical estimators were used to obtain the robust SEs. Binary 
distribution and logit link were used to determine the outcome 
of meeting physical activity guidelines. For each outcome, 2 
models were run to generate crude estimates and estimates 
adjusted for sample characteristics including age, gender, marital 
status, years of schooling, ethnicity, household income, living 
area, work status, and daily work time. Differences in BMI, step 
counts, and total physical activity minutes between the follow-up 
and baseline were reported with a 95% CI. Odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95% CIs were reported for meeting the physical activity 
guidelines. All P values were 2-sided and considered significant 
if <.05. 

Baseline Characteristics 
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the sample. Most 
of the participants were female (95/116, 81.9%), in a relationship 
(85/116, 73.3%), White (101/116, 87.1%), and full-time workers 
(82/116, 70.7%). The participants had an average age of 49.1 
(SD 9.3) years, with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2, 
and 81.9% (95/116) of the participants were either overweight 
or obese. The average step count was <6000 (SD 2391) 
steps/day. Only 13.8% (16/116) of the participants met the 
physical activity guideline. There were no significant differences 
in these characteristics among those with different participation 
durations (P>.05). Among the 116 participants, 17 participated 
in <4 weeks, 51 between 4 and <6 weeks, and 48 at least 6 
weeks.

was 61.6 (9.7) with majority of the participants scoring the 
chatbot as OK (89/113, 78.8%) or good (12/113, 10.6%). 
Although less than half would recommend the chatbot to others 
JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2021 | vol. 9 | iss. 11 | e28577 | p. 6 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


(49/113, 43.4%) and about one-third (40/113, 35.4%) would 
continue to use the chatbot in the future, more than half (60/113, 
53.1%) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. 
About one-third thought the chatbot was quite or very useful in 
helping them increase confidence for engaging in regular 
physical activity, and in helping them stay motivated to 
participate in physical activity. About one-quarter thought the 
chatbot was useful in helping them overcome barriers, increase 
support they receive, and plan for physical activity during the 
study period. Most of the participants (106/113, 93.8%) read 
the messages that the chatbot sent out, and about half of the 
participants sent messages to the chatbot at least once a day. 
On average, the participants sent 6.7 messages to the chatbot 
per week and spent 5.1 minutes with the chatbot per day. About 
one-quarter liked very much the messages that the chatbot sent 
out. However, only 43.4% (49/113) thought that the chatbot 
understood their messages most of the time. Most participants 
experienced technical issues (93/113, 82.3%) and stopped 
receiving the chatbot messages at any time during the study 
(95/113, 84.1%).

The average usability for Fitbit was 64.0 (SD 11.1) with majority 
scoring the Fitbit usability as OK (77/113, 68.1%) or Good 
(22/113, 19.5%). More than half of the participants used the 
Fitbit app at least twice a day. On average, the participants wore 
the Fitbit for 5.4 weeks, 6.7 days per week, and 19.5 h/day. 
Effectiveness of the Intervention 
Figure 3 shows changes in the average number of Fitbit steps 
per day over the study period. The average steps increased 
throughout the study. Data for the first 7 days of Fitbit use, 
before receiving access to the chatbot, did not show an increase 
in mean step (Figure 4).

Table 3 shows improvement in the outcomes between follow-up 
and baseline. For both samples, BMI was improved but was not 
statistically significant at follow-up compared with baseline. 
On average, participants recorded significantly more steps at 
follow-up compared with baseline in the full sample (increase 
of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and in the subsample that 
excludes those with <4 weeks of exposure to the chatbot 
(increase of 564, 95% CI 120-1009 steps/day). Similarly, the 
total physical activity minutes at follow-up were 3.58 (95% CI 
2.28-5.63) times higher in the full sample and 4.17 (95% CI 
2.55-6.80) times higher in the subsample than at baseline, 
representing an increase 154.2 and 176.6 min/week, respectively. 
Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity 
guideline at follow-up compared with baseline in the full sample 
(OR 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) and in the subsample (OR 6.41, 
95% CI 3.14-13.09).

Principal Findings 
This study examined the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness 
of a physical activity chatbot with natural language processing 
capability and adaptive goal setting delivered via the Facebook 
Messenger app. Significant improvements in both the step count 
and self-reported physical activity were observed. These findings 
are consistent with those from another Australian study 
examining a combined diet and physical activity chatbot using 
natural language processing [20]. The effect on self-reported 
physical activity in this study (approximately 160 min/week) 
was similar to an increase of approximately 110 min/week of 
physical activity measured by accelerometers after a 12-week 
intervention in another study [20]. However, the effect measured 
by the Fitbits appeared to be smaller, as the average step count 
only increased by approximately 600 steps/day or 4200 
steps/week, which roughly corresponds to an increase of 42 
minutes of physical activity per week (assuming it takes 
approximately 10 minutes to take 1000 steps) [20]. The 
differences between self-reported and objectively measured 
physical activity are likely due to recall and social desirability 
bias [31]. It is also worth noting that an increase of 1000 
steps/day can help reduce all-cause mortality risk between 6% 
and 36%, although an increase of approximately 600 steps may 
not have a similar effect [32]. In addition, the technical issues 
experienced in this study might have reduced the effectiveness 
of the intervention and explained the differences between the 
2 studies. Moreover, it is possible that a longer study duration 
would have resulted in higher effectiveness, and that 6 weeks 
was not long enough to demonstrate the full potential of the 
chatbot. Those in the subsample that excluded those who had 
<4 weeks of exposure to the chatbot, had a higher increase in 
the total physical activity minutes compared with the full 
sample, which indicates that more exposure might have resulted 
in better outcomes. Finally, we also found a study that used a 
chatbot to promote stair climbing, and it also reported a 
significant increase in physical activity after 12 weeks of

intervention, although it is not clear how physical activity was 
measured and what the effect size was [33]. 
The findings showed that the participants liked the chatbot with 
some even asking for continuing to use it after they completed 
the 6-week trial. Nevertheless, usability for both the chatbot 
and the Fitbit was rated as OK for majority of the participants. 
For most usability and acceptability indicators, less than half 
of the participants provided answers in favor of the chatbot. 
This level of usability (SUS scores of 61.6) is comparable with 
the 2 psychological therapy chatbots with SUS scores of 63.6 
and 57.0 [34] but lower than that of asthma management (SUS 
score of about 83) [35] and depression prevention chatbots (SUS 
score of approximately 75.7) [36]. A study by Nadarzynski et 
al [37] also showed higher acceptability, with 67% of 
participants who would like to use a health chatbot. The lower 
acceptability in this study is likely due to technical issues that 
most participants experienced during the study. Some technical 
issues related to the use of the Fitbit, including malfunctioning 
Fitbits and broken bands and cables, were expected and dealt 
with by the research team. Most of the other technical issues 
(eg, the chatbot stopped sending daily notifications and 
difficulties connecting to the chatbot) were fixed by the 
management company. However, one issue beyond the control 
of the management company that resulted in the end of the study 
was that Facebook changed its policy to block the chatbot 
sending out messages to participants who did not respond to 
the chatbot within 24 hours. Facebook implemented this new 
policy to prevent chatbots from spamming its Messenger app 
users, however, inadvertently disabled the functionality of the 
chatbot, which sent messages wanted by our participants. 
Despite our efforts, it was not possible to contact Facebook to 
explain and reverse the situation. The Facebook policy change 
offers the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between 
high engagement and low usability scores; that is, most 
participants used the chatbot until the end of the implementation, 
but at the time of the Facebook policy change, they experienced 
serious technical issues undermining the usability of the chatbot. 
Previous studies have also shown higher usability of Fitbit use 
[38-40] compared with this study. A possible explanation might 
be that because of budgetary reasons, the research team was 
forced to use Fitbit Flex 1, which is an old model in this study. 
Apart from being outdated in terms of user expectations (newer 
models with better functionality dominate the market), the long 
shelf life of the Fitbits meant that battery and connectivity 
problems were more prevalent than normal. We recommend 
the use of newer and higher-quality activity trackers to increase 
the feasibility of future chatbot-based physical activity 
interventions. Furthermore, we recommend that future chatbots 
be hosted on flexible messaging platforms that can be contacted 
for assistance in dealing with similar issues should they arise. 
However, the disadvantage of using such platforms is that people 
may be less familiar with the platform and more reluctant to 
use them, as few of their friends and family are likely to use 
those messaging services. In addition, rather than relying on an 
external technical company to develop and host the chatbot, it 
would be better if the research team is capable of doing this by 
itself, so that upgrading chatbot functionality and responding 
to potential technical problems is faster and more efficient.

The results also showed that BMI did not significantly improve 
at follow-up. This finding is not surprising, as our study did not 
target weight loss and therefore, no direct activity related to 
weight loss or weight maintenance was delivered. This is 
different from the other Australian chatbot-based physical 
activity interventions, which showed a significant decrease in 
weight at week 12 [20]. However, that study also included a 
large dietary component and allowed more time (12 weeks) for 
weight loss to occur [20]. As this study was not designed to 
evaluate the effect of each component (diet and physical activity) 
separately, 
the 
improvement in weight was due to increases in physical activity. 
Furthermore, current evidence regarding the effects of physical 
activity and exercise on weight loss is not strong [41]. 




Strengths and Limitations 
This study has several strengths: (1) both objective and 
subjective measures of physical activity were used to obtain 
accurate and complementary data on the effectiveness of the 
intervention [42] and (2) a high retention rate means that 
selection bias due to loss to follow-up was likely minimal. 
However, this study also has limitations. First, as the study was 
designed as a quasi-experiment without a control group, it was 
not possible to control for unknown confounders. It is also likely 
that the increase in steps occurred just by using the Fitbit [43]. 
However, it is worth noting that step counts in the baseline week 
before the participants started using the chatbot did not increase 
(Figure 4). Second, the sample (majority were women and White 
with high BMI) was not representative of the broader Australian 
population, so generalizability of the findings may be limited, 
although external validity was not the main focus of the 
intervention. Third, the technical issues caused by Facebook’s 
policy changes, which were beyond the research team’s control, 
were likely responsible for a reduction in chatbots’ usability, 
acceptability, and effectiveness. Finally, the short duration of 
the intervention (6 weeks) is a limitation, and the effects of 
chatbot interventions with a longer duration need to be 
examined. 
Conclusions 
The machine learning–based physical activity chatbot was able 
to significantly increase participants’ physical activity and was 
moderately accepted by the participants. However, a Facebook 
policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and 
indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot 
deployment so that this type of intervention could be 
successfully delivered. 
Future studies with stronger designs, such as randomized 
controlled trials, in which the effect of the activity trackers can 
be isolated, are needed to confirm these findings. Research is 
also required to determine whether chatbot-based interventions 
could be effective for broader populations. Furthermore, 
technology to develop and evaluate more comprehensive chatbot 
interventions already exists. In addition to natural language 
processing, Fitbit integration and adaptive goal setting, it is 
possible to use deep reinforcement learning with feedback loops 
and integrate more real-time data sources (eg, GPS and weather 
data) to enable chatbots to personally tailor and continuously 
adapt cues to action to ensure the timing, frequency, context,

and content are optimally suited for each participant. It is 
important that such comprehensive physical activity chatbots
