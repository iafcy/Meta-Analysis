OBJECTIVES: To compare the efﬁcacy of a computer- 
based physical activity program (Embodied Conversational 
Agent—ECA) with that of a pedometer control condition 
in sedentary older adults. 
DESIGN: Single-blind block-randomized controlled trial 
stratiﬁed according to clinic site and health literacy status. 
SETTING: Three urban ambulatory care practices at 
Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 
2011. 
PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N = 263; mean age 71.3; 
61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school 
diploma or less). 
INTERVENTION: ECA participants were provided with 
portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 
2 months and were directed to connect their pedometers 
to the computer using a data cable and interact with a 
computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss 
walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants 
were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA 
in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 
10 months. Control participants were given a control 
pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for 
an equivalent period of 
Intervention participants 
time. 
were also provided with pedometers. 
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was average 
daily step count for the 30 days before the 12-month inter- 
view. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count 
for the 30 days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes 
were also stratiﬁed according to health literacy level. 
RESULTS: ECA participants walked signiﬁcantly more 
steps than control participants at 2 months (adjusted mean 
4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P = .01), but this effect waned

by 12 months (3,861 vs 3,383, P = .09). For participants 
with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group 
walked signiﬁcantly more than controls at both 2 months 
(P = .03) and 12 months (P = .02), while those with inad- 
equate health literacy failed to show signiﬁcant differences 
between treatment groups at either time point. Interven- 
tion participants were highly satisﬁed with the program. 
CONCLUSION: An automated exercise promotion system 
deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among 
older adults over the short-term. Effective methods for 
long-term maintenance of behavior change are needed.

linear, 
dose-response relationship between physical activity 
and all-cause mortality for older men and women.1–3 
Epidemiological studies have found lower risk of cardio- 
vascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, 
stroke, breast cancer, colon cancer, and disability in more 
physically active or ﬁt individuals.4,5 Physical activity has 
a beneﬁcial 
function and 
inﬂuence on psychological 
decreases the incidence of depression in older adults.6 
Late-life exercise improves strength, aerobic capacity, ﬂexi- 
bility, and physical function.7 Regular walking has been 
associated with signiﬁcantly better postural 
stability, 
greater ankle plantar ﬂexor and knee extensor strength, 
and signiﬁcantly fewer falls in older adults than in those 
who do not walk regularly.8 
Older adults who are sedentary can begin an exercise 
program and still reap the beneﬁts in later life. Healthy 
older adults adapt to moderate- to high-intensity cardio- 
vascular training similarly to younger adults, and most 
health outcomes appear to be achievable with moderate 
levels of exercise.9 Low- 
to moderate-intensity aerobic 
activities such as walking and stationary cycling at 60% of

maximal predicted heart rate have been associated with 
in cardiovascular efﬁciency and 
modest 
mobility tasks.10 Moreover, a change from a sedentary to 
a more-active lifestyle in midlife or beyond is associated 
with lower mortality.11,12 
Despite these beneﬁts, only approximately 25% of 
men and 20% of women aged 65 and older meet the 
national guidelines for regular physical activity.13 The 
demographic groups at highest risk of inactivity are minor- 
ities and those with low income or educational back- 
grounds,14 and it is clear that this is a driver of health 
disparities.15,16 Although there have been many physical 
intervention studies conducted in older adults,17,18 these 
interventions are not typically designed to meet the needs 
of individuals with limited educational attainment and low 
health literacy, so interventions designed for populations 
with low educational backgrounds and health literacy are 
needed. 
This study investigated the use of a new technology 
for health behavior change speciﬁcally targeting older 
adults with low levels of health literacy. The primary aim 
was to test the efﬁcacy of an embodied conversational 
agent (ECA)-based physical activity intervention designed 
speciﬁcally for older adults that could be deployed from 
outpatient clinics, targeting individuals who are in need 
of greater mobility. The intervention had two phases: a 
2-month intensive intervention phase delivered on take- 
home tablet computers, followed by a 12-month mainte- 
nance phase delivered on outpatient waiting room kiosk 
computers. The intervention was compared with a control 
pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for 
an equivalent period of time. It was hypothesized that 
intervention participants would have signiﬁcantly greater 
physical activity levels (measured according to pedometer 
steps) than controls at the end of the 2 and 12 months. 

A two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was 
conducted to compare the ECA intervention with a control 
pedometer intervention. All participants were assessed in 
person at baseline, at 
the active phase of 
the intervention (2 months), and at the conclusion of the 
intervention (12 months). 


Participants were 263 older adults recruited from three 
outpatient clinics at Boston Medical Center between April 
2009 and September 2011. The institutional review board 
at Boston University Medical Campus approved the study. 
Community-dwelling adults who attended the geriatrics 
or internal medicine ambulatory care clinics at Boston 
Medical Center and were aged 65 and older, English 
speaking, inactive (not engaged in regular moderate-inten- 
sity or greater physical activity ≥3 d/wk for at 
least 
20 min/d over the previous 6 months),13 free of any medi- 
cal condition that would limit participation in a walking 
program, and stable on all medications 
least 
3 months were eligible. Individuals were excluded if they 
had cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog score <2),19 signiﬁ- 
cant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 

(PHQ-9) score ≥16),20 were at high risk of falls, or had a 
less than 0.5 m/s 
timed maximal walking velocity of 
(0.2 m/s is considered frail).21 

Trained research assistants who administered structured 
research protocols collected data in face-to-face sessions in 
a private room. Potential participants who agreed to be in 
the study and passed ﬁnal screening procedures completed 
the baseline assessment, which included sociodemographic 
information, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9),20 cognitive 
status (Mini-Cog),19 ﬁtness and mobility (timed maximal 
walking velocity),22 and health literacy. Health literacy 
was assessed using the Test of Functional Health Literacy 
in Adults (TOFHLA),23 and participants were split into 
adequate and inadequate health literacy groups, using a 
TOFHLA cutoff of 23.24 All participants returned for 
assessments at 2 and 12 months, at which a different 
research assistant blinded to group assignment and ﬁndings 
from earlier data collection points collected data. 
Steps were measured using a digital pedometer 
(HJ-720ITC, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) to 
track daily steps throughout the walking program. This 
device provides valid and reliable step counts under a 
range of walking conditions in normal-weight and over- 
weight adults.25 All participants were instructed to wear 
the pedometer at the waist or in a pants pocket daily, to 
record their steps daily on paper log sheets, and to return 
the log sheets to the researchers monthly (by mail or in 
person). Research staff also electronically downloaded 
pedometer 
the 2- and 
12-month in-person interviews. Intervention participants 
also downloaded pedometer steps on the ECA computer 
(at home or in a waiting room kiosk) through a data cable 
each time they interacted with the ECA. 


Step count analyses were based on electronically 
recorded pedometer readings, excluding daily step values 
below the 5th percentile (233 steps) and above 20,000 
steps. A low-value cutoff of this kind is typically assigned 
in pedometer research because days with extremely low 
step counts probably represent minimal use of 
the 
device.26,27 A high-value cutoff is typically assigned in 
pedometer research because of the rare occurrence of high- 
value pedometer errors.28 Participants must have had at 
least 7 days of valid data to be included in analyses.29 
steps per day were averaged for the ﬁrst 
Pedometer 
2 weeks of the intervention as a baseline and 30 days 
before the 2-month interview and 30 days before the 
12-month interview as outcomes. 

Intervention participant use of the system was determined 
according to analysis of log ﬁles on the tablet and kiosk 
computers. 

The primary outcome measure was average daily step 
count for the 30 days before the end of the intervention at 
12 months. 





Average daily step count for the 30 days before the end of 
the active intervention phase at 2 months was also 
assessed, as were 2-month and 12-month step counts 
stratiﬁed according to health literacy level. 

Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed through a 
single question and semistructured interviews with partici- 
pants. 

An independent data safety monitoring board monitored 
the study for safety (but not efﬁcacy), reviewing all adverse 
event reports for determination of whether they were 
attributable to study participation. 

At study entry and at the end of baseline data collection, 
participants were randomized in blocks of six or eight, 
selected randomly, and stratiﬁed according to clinic site 
and health literacy status (inadequate vs adequate). 

The intervention used an ECA (Figure 1) on a take-home 
touch-screen tablet computer as the primary communica- 
tion medium to motivate participants to do more walking 
during the ﬁrst 2 months of the intervention. ECAs are 
animated computer characters that simulate face-to-face 
conversation using voice, hand gesture, gaze cues, and 
other nonverbal behavior to make the computer interface 
as acceptable and intuitive as possible for individuals who 
may have no prior experience with computers. Simulating 
face-to-face conversation is particularly important 
for 
individuals with low health literacy, because a face-to-face 
encounter with a health provider remains one of the best 
methods for communicating health information to individ- 
uals with low health literacy levels,30–32 and prior studies 
have indicated that this medium works well for individuals 
of all levels of health and computer literacy.33 ECAs have 
also been successfully used in several prior interventions 
promoting lifestyle health behavior change with younger 
adults, including physical activity promotion, in which sev- 
eral mechanisms were used to maintain long-term engage- 
ment in addition to behavior change counseling.34–38 In 
the simulated conversations, the ECA talks using synthetic 
speech and animated nonverbal behavior, and participants 
“talk” by selecting what they want to say from a multiple- 
choice list of options on the touch screen. 
At their baseline visit, participants in the ECA group 
were instructed on how to use the ECA system, were sent 
home with touch-screen tablet computers, and were 
instructed to conduct daily conversations with the ECA for 
2 months. At the 2-month interview, ECA participants 
returned their tablet computers (100% returned) and were 
provided instruction on how to use a kiosk computer in 
the clinic waiting room whenever they were at the clinic 
for regularly scheduled appointments. 
Daily conversations with the ECA consisted of dialogue 
and other media designed to promote health behavior 
change.38 A daily 5-minute conversation typically consisted 
of a greeting, social chat, and well-being check-in to deter- 
mine whether the participant needed to stop his or her walk- 
ing program and to provide empathic opportunities. The 
participant was instructed to connect his or her pedometer 
into the system to upload steps. Next, the virtual coach 
reviewed the participant’s progress relative to her or his 
short- and long-term goals, provided positive reinforcement 
if warranted, identiﬁed barriers to walking and engaged the 
participant in a problem-solving discussion for any barriers 
identiﬁed, and then negotiated a new short-term goal, if 
needed.39 The session ended with an exercise tip of the day. 
Each day’s dialogue was varied in content and structure and 
augmented with additional media to help maintain 
participant engagement and retention.33 The dialogue and 
animated character display were augmented with media 
consisting of various images, such as characters demonstrat- 





ing stretching exercises and the proper use of the pedometer 
and dynamically generated self-monitoring charts showing 
the participant’s step counts relative to goals over time. 
ECA conversations on the in-home tablet computer and in- 
clinic kiosks were identical. 

The control participants received pedometers, which they 
were encouraged to wear every day, and monthly logs to 
track their step counts. 

The study was designed to have 80% power (two-sided 
alpha = .05) to detect effect sizes of 0.4 at 2 months and 
0.5 at 12 months between the treatment and control 
groups based on pilot data40 and the literature.41 The 
necessary baseline sample size was 66 per study group. 
Because the study was stratiﬁed and randomized according 
to health literacy level, the total sample size required was 
264, with outcomes according to literacy level performed 
as a secondary analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to- 
in accordance with CONSORT guidelines.42 
treat basis, 
Separate linear regression analyses were performed for 
physical activity outcomes at 2 and 12 months using the 
log of average steps per day in the 30 days before the 2- 
month interview and the 30 days before the 12-month 
interview. Models were controlled for age, factors used in 
the stratiﬁed randomization (health literacy and clinic site), 
and sex, the one characteristic that appeared to differ 
according to randomization group. Baseline steps, which 
was deﬁned as the average steps per day in the ﬁrst 
2 weeks of the study from paper logs, were controlled for. 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted replacing missing 
or invalid electronic values with paper log values when 
available and then replacing excluded values as described 
above to test the effect of missing data on results. 




There were no signiﬁcant differences before the treatment 
between groups in participant demographic characteristics 
other than sex (Table 1). Of the 263 participants who 
completed the study, 63% self-identiﬁed as African Ameri- 
can, 61% were female, and 51% had an educational 
attainment of a high school diploma or less. Participants 
had a mean age (cid:1) SD at enrollment of 71.3 (cid:1) 5.4, and 
39.9% had low health literacy.

39.6%). 

Participants in the ECA intervention group interacted 
with the 
coach an average of 
virtual 
35.8 (cid:1) 19.7 times during the 60-day in-home intervention 
phase, with usage decreasing markedly after the ﬁrst 
week (from an average of 4.7 to 4.0 sessions/wk) and then 
gradually declining (to 3.3 sessions/wk). Participants accessed 
the ECA on the waiting room kiosks an average of 
1.0 (cid:1) 2.9 times during the 10-month period between 
returning the tablet computer at the 2-month interview 
and the end of the intervention at 12 months. 

Of the 263 participants who enrolled in the study, 250 
(95%) completed the 2-month assessment, and 226 (86%) 
completed the 12-month assessment (Figure 2). There were 
no signiﬁcant differences in rates of attrition between the 
groups, but there was a higher rate of pedometer data 
For the 200 participants with adequate pedometer data for 
analysis, the adjusted average number of daily steps for 
the 30 days before the 2-month interview was 3,499 for 
the control group and 4,041 for the intervention group 
(Figure 3, Table 2). For the 30 days before the 12-month 
interview, the adjusted average number of daily steps for 






the 128 participants available was 3,383 for the control 
group and 3,861 for the intervention group. At 2 months, 
this represents a statistically signiﬁcant intervention effect 
(P = .01), but this effect waned and was no longer signiﬁ- 
cant by 12 months (P = .09). 
For participants with inadequate health literacy, the 
adjusted average number of daily steps from the linear 
regression models for the 30 days before the 2-month inter- 
view was 3,116 in the control group and 3,604 in the inter- 
vention group (N = 69, P = .24), and for the 30 days 
before the 12-month interview, the adjusted average num- 
ber of daily steps was 2,852 in the control group and 3,064 
in the intervention group (N = 41, P = .63). For partici- 
pants with adequate health literacy, the adjusted average 
number of daily steps for the 30 days before the 2-month 
interview was 3,762 in the control group and 4,337 in the 
intervention group (N = 131, P = .03), and for the 30 days 
before the 12-month interview, the adjusted average num- 
ber of daily steps was 3,822 in the control group, and 4,681 
in the intervention group (N = 87, P = .02). 
The sensitivity analysis to test the effect of missing 
data on results conﬁrmed the general trends above but did 
not yield signiﬁcant differences between groups at either 
(P = .08 at 2-month interview, P = .11 at 
time point 
12-month interview). 

Intervention participants expressed a high level of satisfac- 
tion with the virtual coach, rating satisfaction an average 
6.0 on a scale from 1 (not at all satisﬁed) to 7 (very satis- 
ﬁed). Data from semistructured interviews also indicated 
high levels of satisfaction. When asked for their overall 
impressions of the intervention, 90% of the 125 responses 
were positive (e.g., “Gives me an incentive to get out there 
and walk.”). When asked whether the virtual coach helped 
them to walk more, 80% of 
the 112 responses were 
afﬁrmative.

two in the intervention group. The remainder of 
the 
adverse events was determined to be unrelated to the 
study. 

This study evaluated the efﬁcacy of an exercise-promotion 
intervention to improve physical activity in sedentary older 
adults. The intervention featured a novel conversational 
agent technology designed to increase its reach to persons 
with low health and computer literacy that could be 
deployed from primary care clinics. Study results demon- 
strate that participants were adherent to the initial 2-month 
intensive phase of the intervention and that it was more 
effective at increasing physical activity levels than a control 
group that was only given pedometers, but the subsequent 
10-month maintenance phase of the intervention was less 
successful; intervention participants used the waiting room 
kiosks once on average over the course of 10 months, and 
by the end of 12 months of follow-up, there were no signiﬁ- 
cant differences between the groups in number of daily 
steps. For participants with adequate health literacy, those 
in the intervention group did signiﬁcantly better at 2 and 
12 months than controls. For patients with inadequate 
health literacy, there were no signiﬁcant differences at 
either time point, although the trends were promising. 
As shown in Figure 3, the differences in group means 
—especially at 12 months—appear to be mostly due to 
walking declines in the control groups. This could be due 
to an initial novelty or the Hawthorne effect, causing an 
initial 
increase in walking behavior immediately after 
participants received their pedometers. It could be due to 
natural declines in mobility over the year in study partici- 
pants. It could also be due to differential dropout, with 
control group participants who were doing well with 
self-monitoring more likely to discontinue use over time. 
There are several possible reasons why the second 
phase of the study was not effective at maintaining behav- 
ior change. If the behavior change exhibited in the ﬁrst 
2 months was a simple dose-response function, then it is 
possible that the frequency of use of the ECA may have 
been insufﬁcient to maintain physical activity in the latter 
10 months. The waiting room kiosks may have been 
avoided because of concerns about privacy or may have 
been ignored or simply overlooked because of the time 
elapsed since last use, competing agendas that commonly 
arise during clinic visits, or uncertainty about how long 
the ECA interaction might take (wanting to be ready for 
the clinician when called from the waiting room). Future 
interventions should focus on ECA deployments using 
media that are more accessible than waiting room kiosks, 
such as web-based or smart phone–based applications that 
can be accessed daily and indeﬁnitely. 

low levels of health and computer 
literacy, most intervention participants had no difﬁculty 
using the take-home tablet computer system, satisfaction 
was generally very high, and all computers were returned 
at the end of 2 months. The study demonstrated very high 
retention and a low rate of adverse events, given the age 
of 
It also demonstrated signiﬁcant 
increases in walking, even though it used pedometers and 
log sheets as a control condition. Interventions that use 
only pedometers and step diaries have been found to be 
effective for increasing walking in younger adults,18 so the 
intervention had a signiﬁcantly higher bar to overcome 
than a nonintervention control. 

Despite the widespread use of pedometers in society, 
there is still a great deal of methodology that needs to 
be developed regarding their use in walking-promotion 
interventions. Although baseline measures in health behav- 
ior–change interventions are typically obtained before the 
start of the intervention, it was felt that a true preinterven- 
tion baseline measure of steps per day was not possible,

given the effect that pedometers alone can have on walking. 
In addition, the clinical signiﬁcance of daily step counts (or 
changes in daily step counts) is still lacking evidence and 
needs to be established, although physical activity in general 
has been shown to have many physical and mental health 
beneﬁts. The difference of 542 steps per day observed at 
2 months may have limited clinical signiﬁcance. A recent 
review of walking studies of older adults identiﬁed an asso- 
ciation between increases of 2,000 to 3,000 steps per day 
and increases in immune functioning, decreases in body 
mass index, and achievement of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention–recommended 30 minutes per day 
of moderate or greater physical activity through walking 
alone,13 although the dose-response relationships between 
steps per day and bone density of the hip and spine,43 mark- 
ers of inﬂammation,44 and health-related quality of life45 
appear to be linear and without threshold. 
Although there have been many physical intervention 
studies conducted with older adults,21,22 and there have 
been many health behavior interventions targeted at disad- 
vantaged populations,46 there are few studies of walking 
in urban, minority, low-income older adults. This is the 
ﬁrst study the authors are aware of that has attempted to 
reach this population with a walking intervention deployed 
from outpatient clinics afﬁliated with a safety net hospital. 
The results indicated that the study had partial success in 
reaching this population, although more work is needed to 
develop effective interventions for those with low health 
literacy. 

limitations to this study. Older 
adults with signiﬁcant cognitive impairments and mobility 
limitations were excluded, 667 of 990 eligible patients 
declined participation, and the study was conducted in a 
single metropolitan area (Boston), which may not be repre- 
sentative of all locales in the United States. The effect of 
seasonality on walking is especially relevant given New 
England winters, although the permuted block randomiza- 
tion scheme with small block sizes controlled for seasonal 
effects by enrolling equal numbers of participants in each 
arm of the study at each time of year. 
The lack of signiﬁcance at 12 months is possibly due 
in part to low power, because the sample size for the anal- 
ysis was smaller (128 at 12 months vs 200 at 2 months). 
Low power was particularly relevant for the subanalyses 
in participants with low literacy. Overall, 
the lack of 
pedometer data (76% of participants available for analysis 
at 2 months, 49% at 12 months) is somewhat surprising 
given the high retention rate in the study (95% at 
2 months, 86% at 12 months), and the increase in missing 
pedometer data was especially large in the intervention 
group. One explanation for this may be that the interven- 
tion participants thought the intervention was over once 
they returned their tablet computers, causing them to stop 
using their pedometers and resulting in a signiﬁcant drop 
in pedometer use in Months 3 to 12. Improving pedometer 
use adherence is a prerequisite for improving outcomes in 
pedometer-based walking interventions and should thus be 
the target of future research efforts. 
In spite of these limitations, the study demonstrated 
that an ECA-based intervention can be successfully deployed 
from outpatient clinics to the homes of older adults, that the 
individuals adhered to the intervention and were satisﬁed 
with it, and that it can be effective in increasing short-term 
physical activity. This study is one of the few physical 
activity interventions involving an urban, largely minority 
population with a high rate of inadequate health literacy.

dez for their assistance in developing the intervention.
