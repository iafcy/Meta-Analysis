            "abstract": "Flexibility is one of the hallmarks of human problem-solving. In everyday life, people adapt to changes in common tasks with little to no additional training. Much of the existing work on flexibility in human problem-solving has focused on how people adapt to tasks in new domains by drawing on solutions from previously learned domains. In real-world tasks, however, humans must generalize across a wide range of within-domain variation. In this work we argue that representational abstraction plays an important role in such within-domain generalization. We then explore the nature of this representational abstraction in realistically complex tasks like video games by demonstrating how the same model-based planning framework produces distinct generalization behaviors under different classes of task representation. Finally, we compare the behavior of agents with these task representations to humans in a series of novel grid-based video game tasks. Our results provide evidence for the claim that within-domain flexibility in humans derives from task representations composed of propositional rules written in terms of objects and relational categories."

            "abstract": "Background: Because obesity is associated with the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), the precise estimation of visceral fat mass before transplantation may be helpful. Herein, we addressed whether a deep-learning based volumetric fat quantification on pretransplant computed tomographic images predicted the risk of PTDM more precisely than body mass index (BMI). Methods: We retrospectively included a total of 718 nondiabetic kidney recipients who underwent pretransplant abdominal computed tomography. The 2D (waist) and 3D (waist or abdominal) volumes of visceral, subcutaneous, and total fat masses were automatically quantified using the deep neural network. The predictability of the PTDM risk was estimated using a multivariate Cox model and compared among the fat parameters using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Results: PTDM occurred in 179 patients (24.9%) during the median follow-up period of 5 years (interquartile range, 2.5-8.6 years). All the fat parameters predicted the risk of PTDM, but the visceral and total fat volumes from 2D and 3D evaluations had higher AUROC values than BMI did, and the best predictor of PTDM was the 3D abdominal visceral fat volumes [AUROC, 0.688 (0.636-0.741)]. The addition of the 3D abdominal VF volume to the model with clinical risk factors increased the predictability of PTDM, but BMI did not. Conclusions: A deep-learning based quantification of visceral fat volumes on computed tomographic images better predicts the risk of PTDM after kidney transplantation than BMI."

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      In plants, the spatial and genetic distance between mates can influence reproductive success and offspring fitness. Negative fitness consequences associated with the extremes of inbreeding and outbreeding suggest that there will be an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance (OOD), the scale and drivers of which remain poorly understood. In the bird-pollinated Anigozanthos manglesii (Haemodoraceae) we tested (1) for the presence of within-population OOD, (2) over what scale it occurs, and (3) for OOD under biologically realistic scenarios of multi-donor deposition associated with pollination by nectar-feeding birds.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We measured the impact of mate distance (spatial and genetic) on seed set, fruit size, seed mass, seed viability and germination success following hand pollination from (1) single donors across 0 m (self), <1 m, 1-3 m, 7-15 m and 50 m, and (2) a mix of eight donors. Microsatellite loci were used to quantify spatial genetic structure and test for the presence of an OOD by paternity assignment after multi-donor deposition.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Inter-mate distance had a significant impact on single-donor reproductive success, with selfed and nearest-neighbour (<1 m) pollination resulting in only ~50 seeds per fruit, lower overall germination success and slower germination. Seed set was greatest for inter-mate distance of 1-3 m (148 seeds per fruit), thereafter plateauing at ~100 seeds per fruit. Lower seed set following nearest-neighbour mating was associated with significant spatial genetic autocorrelation at this scale. Paternal success following pollination with multiple sires showed a significantly negative association with increasing distance between mates.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Collectively, single- and multi-donor pollinations indicated evidence for a near-neighbour OOD within A. manglesii. A survey of the literature suggests that within-population OOD may be more characteristic of plants pollinated by birds than those pollinated by insects."

This study evaluated whether floral longevity favours pollen removal from the anthers over fecundity (seed set) in an ornithophilous species that does not undergo pollen limitation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Field investigations were conducted on floral longevity, nectar production, pollinator behaviour, and variations in fruit set (FS), mean number of seeds per fruit (MSF) and pollen removal by hummingbirds (PR) during the anthesis of Salvia sellowiana in south-east Brazil.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Anthesis of flowers exposed to pollinators lasted 4 d, as well as on flowers with pollen removed from the anthers or deposited on the stigma. The longevity of bagged flowers was significantly higher (approx. 9 d). FS and PR reached 87.2 and 90 %, respectively, in natural conditions. PR increased gradually over the period of anthesis; however, FS and MSF reached their maxima in the first hours of anthesis. Nectar production was continuous, but the secretion rate was reduced after pollination. The removal of nectar from non-pollinated flowers stimulated its production.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The longevity of anthesis in S. sellowiana seems to be related to the mechanism of gradual dispensing of pollen, resulting in greater male reproductive success. This is in agreement with the pollen-donation hypothesis. The small number of ovules (four) of S. sellowiana and the high frequency and the foraging mode of its pollinators may favour the selection for floral longevity driven by male fitness in this system."

            "abstract": "Fleshy fruits are an essential part of the human diet providing vital vitamins, minerals and other health-promoting compounds. The texture of the ripe fruit has a significant effect on quality and influences consumer acceptance, shelf-life, resistance, and transportability. The development of rational approaches to improve texture and shelf-life depend on understanding the biological basis of fruit ripening. Until recently, work has focused on the isolation of ripening-related genes from a variety of fleshy fruits. However, little is known about the genes that regulate this complex developmental process or whether similar regulatory genes are active in all fruiting species. A major breakthrough would be the identification of generic genes associated with texture and other aspects of ripening in fleshy fruits. In tomato, a small number of single gene mutations exist, such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor), Never-ripe (Nr), and Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) which have pleiotropic effects resulting in the reduction or almost complete abolition of ripening. These mutations probably represent lesions in regulatory genes. The cloning of the wild-type alleles of RIN and NOR is reported by Moore et al. in this issue. This review focuses on the texture characteristics of the Cnr mutant. A possible framework for the molecular regulation of fruit texture is discussed and quantitative genetic approaches to determining the generic attributes of fruit texture are explored."

Whole-blood donors are assumed to be willing to convert to donate other SoHO as well as whole-blood. However, no reviews consider the evidence on conversion (i.e., willingness/intention, behaviour, retention, attrition). This rapid review provides a narrative synthesis of whole-blood donors' conversion to another SoHO, characteristics contributing to conversion, motives and deterrents, and interventions encouraging conversion. Sixty-five studies were reviewed. Most were cross-sectional and examined whole-blood donor conversion to organ (willingness/pledge for deceased donation), plasma or stem cell donation. Most examined conversion rather than characteristics contributing to conversion, motives, deterrents or interventions. Whole-blood donors appear willing to donate another SoHO, yet conversion rates are unclear. Besides self-efficacy, there is little consistency in reported characteristics of donors converting, and few theories applied to understand characteristics encouraging conversion. Intrinsic (altruism, self-esteem, curiosity) and extrinsic (perceived need, service experience, direct requests) motives and barriers (lifestyle, fearing reduced health) appear important and require further research. Interventions encouraging conversion need replication and may include in-person, in-centre approaches, raising awareness of the functional benefits of other SoHO (high need, usefulness), and developing promotional materials that pique donors' curiosity, invite questions, and encourage donor-initiated conversations about conversion. Centralising BCAs as a single business or partnering with other organisations appears mutually beneficial to encourage conversion and sustainable panels/resources. Research is needed to understand the impact of encouraging conversion on donors and organisations, and identify optimal management strategies for multi-SoHO donors."

Its reliability in measuring motor performance in children exposed to alcohol in utero or living in remote Australian Aboriginal communities is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective inter-rater and test-retest reliability study was conducted using the BOT-2 Short Form. A convenience sample of children (n = 30) aged 7 to 9 years participating in the Lililwan Project cohort (n = 108) study, completed the reliability study. Over 50% of mothers of Lililwan Project children drank alcohol during pregnancy. Two raters simultaneously scoring each child determined inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was determined by assessing each child on a second occasion using predominantly the same rater. Reliability was analysed by calculating Intra-Class correlation Coefficients, ICC(2,1), Percentage Exact Agreement (PEA) and Percentage Close Agreement (PCA) and measures of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty Aboriginal children (18 male, 12 female: mean age 8.8 years) were assessed at eight remote Fitzroy Valley communities. The inter-rater reliability for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.88 (95%CI, 0.77 - 0.94) to 0.92 (95%CI, 0.84 - 0.96) indicating excellent reliability. The test-retest reliability (median interval between tests being 45.5 days) for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.62 (95%CI, 0.34 - 0.80) to 0.73 (95%CI, 0.50 - 0.86) indicating fair to good reliability. The raw score MDC was 6.12.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The BOT-2 Short Form has acceptable reliability for use in remote Australian Aboriginal communities and will be useful in determining motor deficits in children exposed to alcohol prenatally. This is the first known study evaluating the reliability of the BOT-2 Short Form, either in the context of assessment for FASD or in Aboriginal children."

            "abstract": "Rising concerns about the short- and long-term detrimental consequences of administration of conventional pharmacopeia are fueling the search for alternative, complementary, personalized, and comprehensive approaches to human healthcare. Qigong, a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine, represents a viable alternative approach. Here, we started with the practical, philosophical, and psychological background of Ki (in Japanese) or Qi (in Chinese) and their relationship to Qigong theory and clinical application. Noting the drawbacks of the current state of Qigong clinic, herein we propose that to manage the unique aspects of the Eastern 'non-linearity' and 'holistic' approach, it needs to be integrated with the Western \"linearity\" \"one-direction\" approach. This is done through developing the concepts of \"Qigong breathing signatures,\" which can define our life breathing patterns associated with diseases using machine learning technology. We predict that this can be achieved by establishing an artificial intelligence (AI)-Medicine training camp of databases, which will integrate Qigong-like breathing patterns with different pathologies unique to individuals. Such an integrated connection will allow the AI-Medicine algorithm to identify breathing patterns and guide medical intervention. This unique view of potentially connecting Eastern Medicine and Western Technology can further add a novel insight to our current understanding of both Western and Eastern medicine, thereby establishing a vitality score index (VSI) that can predict the outcomes of lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions."

However, majority of these end-to-end dialogue systems incorporate only user semantics as inputs in the learning process and ignore other useful user behavior and information. Sentiment of the user at the time of conversation plays an important role in securing maximum user gratification. So, incorporating sentiment of the user during the policy learning becomes even more crucial, more so when serving composite tasks of the user.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      As a first step towards enabling the development of sentiment aided VA for multi-intent conversations, this paper proposes a new dataset, annotated with its corresponding intents, slot and sentiment (considering the entire dialogue history) labels, named SentiVA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. In order to integrate these multiple aspects, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) specifically options based VA is proposed to learn strategies for managing multi-intent conversations. Along with task success based immediate rewards, sentiment based immediate rewards are also incorporated in the hierarchical value functions to make the VA user adaptive.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Empirically, the paper shows that task based and sentiment based immediate rewards cumulatively are required to ensure successful task completion and attain maximum user satisfaction in a multi-intent scenario instead of any of these rewards alone.\n    \n\n\n          Practical implications:\n        \n      \n      The eventual evaluators and consumers of dialogue systems are users.

            "abstract": "Bananas are model fruits for studying starch conversion and climactericity. Starch degradation and ripening are two important biological processes that occur concomitantly in banana fruit. Ethylene biosynthesis and postharvest fruit ripening processes, i.e. starch degradation, fruit softening, and sugar accumulation, are highly correlated and thus could be controlled by a common regulatory switch. However, this switch has not been identified. In this study, we transformed red banana (Musa acuminata L.) with sense and anti-sense constructs of the MaMADS36 transcription factor gene (also MuMADS1, Ma05_g18560.1). Analysis of these lines showed that MaMADS36 interacts with 74 other proteins to form a co-expression network and could act as an important switch to regulate ethylene biosynthesis, starch degradation, softening, and sugar accumulation. Among these target genes, musa acuminata beta-amylase 9b (MaBAM9b, Ma05_t07800.1), which encodes a starch degradation enzyme, was selected to further investigate the regulatory mechanism of MaMADS36. Our findings revealed that MaMADS36 directly binds to the CA/T(r)G box of the MaBAM9b promoter to increase MaBAM9b transcription and, in turn, enzyme activity and starch degradation during ripening. These results will further our understanding of the fine regulatory mechanisms of MADS-box transcription factors in regulating fruit ripening, which can be applied to breeding programs to improve fruit shelf-life."

Yet, the very existence of normal sleep in patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state is still a matter of debate. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of overnight polysomnographic records of 40 patients with chronic disorders of consciousness aimed at the possibility of establishing the connection between the degree of impaired consciousness and the presence and organization of polysomnographic graphical elements, associated with stages of sleep in normal individuals. Specialized software based on expert system artificial intelligence was developed to calculate indices and parameters that characterize sleep. It was shown that a remarkably low percentage of patients have a rhythmic change in sleep patterns, what indicates the prevalence of violations of the Sleep-Wake cycle in a vegetative state and minimally conscious state. Sleep spindles were not found in records, however, the absence can originate from the limitations of polysomnographic method applied to patients with severe brain damage. A positive correlation between the rhythmic change of sleep patterns, better outcome and CRS-R scores was confirmed."

This paper proposes a technique for the estimate of key foot clearance parameters using inertial sensor (accelerometers and gyroscopes) data. Fifteen features were extracted from raw inertial sensor measurements, and a regression model was used to estimate two key foot clearance parameters: First maximum vertical clearance (m x 1) after toe-off and the Minimum Toe Clearance (MTC) of the swing foot. Comparisons are made against measurements obtained using an optoelectronic motion capture system (Optotrak), at 4 different walking speeds. General Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) were used to estimate the desired parameters from the sensor features. Eight subjects foot clearance data were examined and a Leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) method was used to select the best model. The best average Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) across all subjects obtained using all sensor features at the maximum speed for m x 1 was 5.32 mm and for MTC was 4.04 mm. Further application of a hill-climbing feature selection technique resulted in 0.54-21.93% improvement in RMSE and required fewer input features. The results demonstrated that using raw inertial sensor data with regression models and feature selection could accurately estimate key foot clearance parameters."

As determined using flow cytometry, fruit growth was characterized by high cell division activity in tomato during the first week after anthesis and followed by endoreduplications (DNA replication without cell divisions). D-type cyclins are considered to be important parts of the signal transduction for stimulation of DNA replication and cell division. To study the function of D cyclins in fruit development, full-length cDNA clones for three D cyclin genes were isolated from young tomato fruit. They were classified as D3 cyclins by sequence similarities and a phylogenetic analysis and named as LeCycD3;1, LeCycD3;2 and LeCycD3;3. The deduced amino acid sequences for LeCycD3;1-3 contained a retinoblastoma-binding motif and a PEST-destruction motif. Pollination and fertilization were followed by a high increase in the transcript levels of LeCycD3;1-3 in young fruit. Using in situ hybridization, high expression of LeCycD3;3 was detected in the vascular tissue of young fruit suggesting a role in vascular development. The D3 cyclins are probably involved in transducing the signals leading to fruit growth by cell divisions. Distinct differences were detected in their temporal and spatial expression patterns suggesting that they play different roles in fruit development as well as in the development of other plant organs."

In recent years, with the popularization of smartphones, the elderly have increasingly accepted technological products that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI). However, there is not much research on using artificial intelligence bracelets to enhance elders' motivation and participation in exercise. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of sports smart bracelets and multi-sport training programs on the motivation of the elderly in Macau. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with a randomized trial design in a 12 week multi-sport exercise training intervention. According to the evaluation, a total of sixty elders' pre- and post-test data were included in this study. Results: After 12 weeks of multi-sport exercise training, the evaluation scores on the exercise motivation scale (EMS) increased significantly in the group wearing exercise bracelets and those taking part in the multi-component exercise program, and the degree of progress reached a statistically significant level, but the control group did not show any statistically significant difference. The influence of the combination of sports smart bracelets and multi-sport training programs on elders' motivation is clearer. Conclusions: The use of sports smart bracelets by elderly people in conjunction with diverse exercise training can effectively enhance elders' motivation and increase their participation in regular exercise.

Reliable and efficient pose estimation from still images represents an important part of more complex algorithms, such as tracking human body pose in a video sequence, where it can be used to automatically initialise the tracker on the first frame. The quality of the initialisation influences the performance of the tracker in the subsequent frames. We formulate the body pose estimation as an analysis-by-synthesis optimisation algorithm, where a generic 3D human body model is used to illustrate the pose and the silhouettes extracted from the images are used as constraints. A simple test with gradient descent optimisation run from randomly selected initial positions in the search space shows that a more powerful optimisation method is required. We investigate the suitability of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) for solving this problem and compare its performance with an equivalent algorithm using Simulated Annealing (SA). Our tests show that the PSO outperforms the SA in terms of accuracy and consistency of the results, as well as speed of convergence."

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, and its burden is expected to increase in most developed countries over the next few decades. Because AF can be silent, it is often not diagnosed until an AF-related complication occurs, such as stroke. AF is also associated with increased risk of heart failure, lower quality of life, and death. Anticoagulation has been shown to dramatically decrease embolic risk in the setting of atrial fibrillation, resulting in growing interest in early detection of previously undiagnosed AF. Newly developed monitoring devices have improved the detection of AF and have been recommended in guidelines for screening of AF in individuals aged 65 years and over. While screening is currently targeted to these older individuals, younger patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are at higher risk of AF and stroke than the general population, indicating a need for targeted early detection of AF in this group. Compared to individuals without OSA, those with OSA are four times more likely to develop AF, and the risk of AF is strongly associated with OSA severity. The overall prevalence of AF among individuals with OSA remains unknown because of limitations related to study design and to the conventional methods previously used for AF detection. Recent and emerging technological advances may improve the detection of undiagnosed AF in high-risk population groups, such as those with OSA. In this clinical review, we discuss the methods of screening for AF and the applications of newer technologies for AF detection in patients with OSA. We conclude the review with a brief description of our research agenda in this area."

Multiple lifestyle interventions, in combination, may interact synergistically for enhanced benefits. While the impacts of lifestyle interventions on subjective measures of mood are well-documented, their impacts on ICN dynamics are not well-established. In this study, we assessed the validity of EEG-derived measures of ICN dynamics as potential markers of mood disorders, by tracking ICN dynamics and mood symptoms through the course of a longitudinal exercise intervention. Specifically, we investigated the separate and combined effects of aerobic exercise and mindfulness-like neurofeedback training on task-linked ICN dynamics of the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). Participants were assigned pseudo-randomly into four experimental conditions-Control, Running, Neurofeedback, and Combined, performing the corresponding intervention for 16 sessions across 8 weeks. Intervention-linked changes in ICN dynamics were studied using EEG-based neuroimaging scans before and after the 8-week intervention, during which participants performed multiple blocks of autobiographical memory recall (AM) and working memory (WM) trials, designed to activate the DMN and CEN, respectively, and to activate the SN in conjunction with the task-appropriate network. The EEG-based features for classification of the three core networks had been identified in our prior research from simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI during the same AM and WM tasks. We categorized participants as \"responders\" or \"non-responders\" based on whether the exercise intervention increased their aerobic capacity (VO2-max) (Running/Combined group), and/or neurofeedback increased the percentage time spent in the calm mindfulness state (Neurofeedback/Combined group). In responders, compared to each intervention alone, the combined exercise-neurofeedback intervention resulted in a more healthy CEN-SN synchrony pattern. Interestingly, non-responders to neurofeedback exhibited a maladaptive pattern of persistent, task-inappropriate DMN-SN synchrony which we speculate could be linked to depressive rumination. Furthermore, the CEN-SN synchrony at baseline predicted NFB response with up to 80% accuracy, demonstrating the potential utility of such network-based biomarkers in personalizing intervention plans."

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the genetic control of sugar metabolism is essential to enhance fruit quality and promote fruit consumption. The sugar content and composition of fruits varies with species, cultivar and stage of development, and is controlled by multiple enzymes. A QTL (quantitative trait locus) study was performed on peach fruit [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch], the model species for Prunus Progeny derived from an interspecific cross between P. persica cultivars and P. davidiana was used. Dynamic QTLs for fresh weight, sugars, acids, and enzyme activities related to sugar metabolism were detected at different stages during fruit development. Changing effects of alleles during fruit growth were observed, including inversions close to maturity. This QTL analysis was supplemented by the identification of genes annotated on the peach genome as enzymes linked to sugar metabolism or sugar transporters. Several cases of co-locations between annotated genes, QTLs for enzyme activities and QTLs controlling metabolite concentrations were observed and discussed. These co-locations raise hypotheses regarding the functional regulation of sugar metabolism and pave the way for further analyses to enable the identification of the underlying genes. In conclusion, we identified the potential impact on fruit breeding of the modification of QTL effect close to maturity."

            "abstract": "Multiply sired fruits provide unambiguous evidence that pollen from two or more donors was deposited on a stigma and successfully fertilized ovules. Such multiple paternity within fruits can have important consequences for both parental and offspring fitness, but little is known about the frequency of multiple paternity or the mechanisms causing it. In this study we quantify the extent of multiple paternity in replicate experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens (square-stem monkeyflower) and use observations of pollinator behavior to infer mechanisms generating multiply sired fruits. In each array, floral displays were trimmed to two, four, eight, or 16 flowers per plant to span the range of display sizes observed in nature. In our sample of 204 fruits, more than 95% had two or more outcross pollen donors. The number of sires per fruit averaged 4.63 ± 0.10 (mean ± 1 SE), including selfs, and did not vary significantly with floral display treatment. Patterns of bumble bee foraging, combined with limited pollen carryover, suggest that observed levels of multiple paternity cannot be fully explained by single probes that deposited mixed pollen loads. Multiple probes to flowers, each delivering pollen from 1-3 different sires, are more likely to have caused the observed patterns. These sequential visits may reduce the potential for pollen competition and female choice based on pollen tube growth rate."

These interacting assemblages may also be altered (directly or indirectly) by introduced species, especially on oceanic islands. In this study, we analyzed the effects of opportunistic nectar-feeding passerine birds and native (semi-slugs) and introduced (rats) floral herbivores on the reproductive success of Canarina canariensis. •\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Manual pollination experiments were conducted to determine plant breeding system and pollen limitation.

We analyzed the impact of nectar production on different estimates of fitness, comparing nectarful against nectarless individuals in size, mating system, seed traits, and fruit set in a 1-ha scrubland. Of the reproductive individuals (358), 46% were nectarful and 54% were nectarless. Neither tree size nor flowering phenology differed between nectar morphs. Fixation indices (F) for both progeny (F = -0.2) and adults (F = -0.45) were negative, and high heterozygosities were found in adults and progeny (H = 0.45). No differences were found between nectar morphs for F, H, and single (t(s) = 1.1) and multilocus (t(m) = 1.03) outcrossing rates. Controlled pollinations showed differences between selfing and control treatments with no differences between nectar morphs. Nectarless individuals produced significantly more pollen grains than did nectar producers, but all other measured floral traits showed no differences. Nectarful trees were visited by pollinators 21 times more often and had a significantly higher overall fruit set than did nectarless trees. No differences between nectar morphs in seed mass or in percentage seed germination were found, but heavier seeds tended to have higher heterozygosities. Both morphs had similar success as females, but nectarless trees had ∼7% higher male function. We discuss three possible scenarios for the evolution of the fixed dimorphism in nectar production, two involving unstable phases (substitution of one morph by the other, and evolution towards dioecy) and one stable scenario (maintenance of the dimorphic system)."

Explanations for this vary, but usually involve mechanisms of innate dormancy.

Rates of water uptake and desiccation, and seedling emergence were compared with and without the fruit. Finally, germinability of seeds extracted from fruits was determined after various periods of moist conditions followed by a range of dry conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Most seeds rapidly take up water within the fruit, but they do not fully imbibe when compared with naked seeds. The seed coat is more important than the dry fruit wall in maintaining seed dormancy. The presence of a dry fruit slows emergence from the soil by up to 6-8 weeks. The fruit slows the rate of desiccation of the seed to a limited extent. The presence of the fruit for a few days during imbibition somehow primes more seeds to germinate than if the fruit is absent; longer moist periods within the pod appear to induce dormancy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The fruit certainly modifies the seed environment as external conditions change between wet and dry, but not to a great extent.

RPSL considers four aspects: 1) it preserves the rank order information of the within-class samples in a local patch; 2) it maximizes the margin between the between-class samples on the local patch; 3) the L1-norm penalty is introduced to obtain the parsimony property; and 4) it models the classification error minimization by utilizing the least-squares error minimization.

            "abstract": "Identifying daily oviposition events for individual broiler breeders is important for bird management. Identifying non-laying birds in a flock that might be caused by improper nutrition or diseases can guide diet changes or disease treatments for these individuals. Oviposition depends on follicle maturation and egg formation, and follicle maturation can be variable. As such, the day and time of oviposition events of individual birds in a free-run flock can be hard to predict. Based on a precision feeding (PF) system that can record the feeding activity of individual birds, a recent study reported a machine learning model to predict daily egg-laying events of broiler breeders. However, there were 2 limitations in that study: 1) It could only be used to identify daily egg-laying events on a subsequent day; 2) The prediction outputs that were binary labels were unable to indicate more details among the outputs with the same label. To improve the previous approach, the current study aimed to predict and output the probability of daily oviposition events occurring using a specific time point in 1 day. In the current study, 706 egg-laying events recorded by nest boxes with radio frequency identification of hens and 706 randomly selected no-egg-laying events were used. The anchor point was newly defined in the current study as a specific time point in 1 day, and 26 features around the anchor point were created for all events (706 egg-laying events and 706 no-egg-laying events). A feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model was built for prediction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.9409, indicating that the model had an outstanding classification performance. The ANN model could predict oviposition events on the current day, and the output was a probability that could be informative to indicate the likelihood of an oviposition event for an individual breeder. In situations where total egg production was known for a group, the ANN model could predict the probability of daily oviposition events occurring of all individual birds and then rank them to choose those most likely to have laid an egg."

In this paper we present an example of how artificial intelligence can support psychology in this process, illustrating the development of a probabilistic predictor in the form of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). The predictor regards the change in the intention to do home-based physical activity after message exposure. The data used to construct the predictor are those of a study on the effects of framing in communication to promote physical activity at home during the Covid-19 lockdown. The theoretical reference is that of psychosocial research on the effects of framing, according to which similar communicative contents formulated in different ways can be differently effective depending on the characteristics of the recipient. Study participants completed a first questionnaire aimed at measuring the psychosocial dimensions involved in doing physical activity at home. Next, they read recommendation messages formulated with one of four different frames (gain, non-loss, non-gain, and loss). Finally, they completed a second questionnaire measuring their perception of the messages and again the intention to exercise at home. The collected data were analyzed to elicit a DBN, i.e., a probabilistic structure representing the interrelationships between all the dimensions considered in the study. The adopted procedure was aimed to achieve a good balance between explainability and predictivity. The elicited DBN was found to be consistent with the psychosocial theories assumed as reference and able to predict the effectiveness of the different messages starting from the relevant psychosocial dimensions of the recipients. In the next steps of our project, the DBN will form the basis for the training of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for the synthesis of automatic interaction strategies. In turn, the DRL system will train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that will guide the online interaction process. The discussion focuses on the advantages of the proposed procedure in terms of interpretability and effectiveness."

            "abstract": "Technological advancements in the past decades have improved dietary intake and physical activity measurements. This report reviews current developments in dietary intake and physical activity assessment in youth. Dietary intake assessment has relied predominantly on self-report or image-based methods to measure key aspects of dietary intake (e.g., food types, portion size, eating occasion), which are prone to notable methodologic (e.g., recall bias) and logistic (e.g., participant and researcher burden) challenges. Although there have been improvements in automatic eating detection, artificial intelligence, and sensor-based technologies, participant input is often needed to verify food categories and portions. Current physical activity assessment methods, including self-report, direct observation, and wearable devices, provide researchers with reliable estimations for energy expenditure and bodily movement. Recent developments in algorithms that incorporate signals from multiple sensors and technology-augmented self-reporting methods have shown preliminary efficacy in measuring specific types of activity patterns and relevant contextual information. However, challenges in detecting resistance (e.g., in resistance training, weight lifting), prolonged physical activity monitoring, and algorithm (non)equivalence remain to be addressed. In summary, although dietary intake assessment methods have yet to achieve the same validity and reliability as physical activity measurement, recent developments in wearable technologies in both arenas have the potential to improve current assessment methods.\n    \n\n\n          Theme information:\n        \n      \n      This article is part of a theme issue entitled Innovative Tools for Assessing Diet and Physical Activity for Health Promotion, which is sponsored by the North American branch of the International Life Sciences Institute."

            "abstract": "The diversity in wealth and social status is present not only among humans, but throughout the animal world. We account for this observation by generating random variables that determine the social diversity of players engaging in the prisoner's dilemma game. Here the term social diversity is used to address extrinsic factors that determine the mapping of game payoffs to individual fitness. These factors may increase or decrease the fitness of a player depending on its location on the spatial grid. We consider different distributions of extrinsic factors that determine the social diversity of players, and find that the power-law distribution enables the best promotion of cooperation. The facilitation of the cooperative strategy relies mostly on the inhomogeneous social state of players, resulting in the formation of cooperative clusters which are ruled by socially high-ranking players that are able to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large temptation to defect. To confirm this, we also study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity and find that cooperation deteriorates as the spatial correlation length increases. Our results suggest that the distribution of wealth and social status might have played a crucial role by the evolution of cooperation amongst egoistic individuals."

            "abstract": "Auxin is an important hormone playing crucial roles during fruit growth and ripening; however, the metabolic impact of changes in auxin signalling during tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) ripening remains unclear. Here, we investigated the significance of changes in auxin signalling during different stages of fruit development by analysing changes in tomato fruit quality and primary metabolism using mutants with either lower or higher auxin sensitivity [diageotropica (dgt) and entire mutants, respectively]. Altered auxin sensitivity modifies metabolism, through direct impacts on fruit respiration and fruit growth. We verified that the dgt mutant plants exhibit reductions in fruit set, total fruit dry weight, fruit size, number of seeds per fruit, and fresh weight loss during post-harvest. Sugar accumulation was associated with delayed fruit ripening in dgt, probably connected with reduced ethylene levels and respiration, coupled with a lower rate of starch degradation. In contrast, despite exhibiting parthenocarpy, increased auxin perception (entire) did not alter fruit ripening, leading to only minor changes in primary metabolism. By performing a comprehensive analysis, our results connect auxin signalling and metabolic changes during tomato fruit development, indicating that reduced auxin signalling led to extensive changes in sugar concentration and starch metabolism during tomato fruit ripening."

Planned movement is governed by Hamilton's equations, where potential energy is supplied by potentials expressed in the striatum. To test the model in realistic situations, a dynamic simulation of a two-link robot arm was used. Normal movement is modeled and shown to exhibit observed experimental properties.

The research focused in particular on the implementation of pattern recognition methods for the evaluation of performed exercises on training machines. The data acquisition was carried out using way and cable force sensors attached to various weight machines, thereby enabling the measurement of essential displacement and force determinants during training. On the basis of the gathered data, it was consequently possible to deduce other significant characteristics like time periods or movement velocities. These parameters were applied for the development of intelligent methods adapted from conventional machine learning concepts, allowing an automatic assessment of the exercise technique and providing individuals with appropriate feedback. In practice, the implementation of such techniques could be crucial for the investigation of the quality of the execution, the assistance of athletes but also coaches, the training optimization and for prevention purposes. For the current study, the data was based on measurements from 15 rather inexperienced participants, performing 3-5 sets of 10-12 repetitions on a leg press machine. The initially preprocessed data was used for the extraction of significant features, on which supervised modeling methods were applied. Professional trainers were involved in the assessment and classification processes by analyzing the video recorded executions. The so far obtained modeling results showed good performance and prediction outcomes, indicating the feasibility and potency of AI techniques in assessing performances on weight training equipment automatically and providing sportsmen with prompt advice.

In this work, a model was developed describing cell proliferation and DNA endoreduplication over the whole fruit development, from the pre-anthesis period until maturation. In each mitotic cycle of duration tau, the proportion of cells proceeding through division depends on a constant parameter rho and on the progressive decline of the proliferating capacity . The non-dividing cells may either stop the reduplication fully, or switch to repeated syntheses of DNA without cell division, resulting in cell endoreduplication. A single constant parameter sigma describes the proportion of cells that moves from one to the next class of DNA content after each lapse of time tauE, considered to be the minimum time required for an endocycle. The model calculates the total number of cells and their distribution among eight classes of ploidy level. The dynamic patterns of cell proliferation and ploidy were compared with those obtained experimentally on two contrasting tomato genotypes. The approach developed in this model should allow the future integration of new knowledge concerning the genetic and environmental control of the switch from complete to incomplete cell cycle."

Thirty males and 30 females were paired either continuously (C; mates together all the time) or non-continuously (NC; pairs met only three times a week for 5 min). Separation-reunion tests evaluated parental pair bond. Egg yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels were evaluated, and the somatic and behavioural development of C and NC chicks was assessed. Our results revealed that members of C pairs were attached to their mates and, although no significant differences in androgen levels could be evidenced between egg sets, a higher proportion of C pairs' eggs were fertilized and their chicks appeared less emotive and more social. Our results revealed that the parental relationship can modulate the behavioural development of their offspring, probably via non-genetic effects, and this could play a major role in the emergence of inter-individual variability."

A more clinically and patient-oriented role of the community pharmacist in primary care makes the dispensation of medication an adequate situation for an effective, rapid, easy, and reproducible screening of MCI. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 728 non-institutionalized participants older than 65. A total of 167 variables were collected such as age, gender, educational attainment, daily sleep duration, reading frequency, subjective memory complaint, and medication. Two screening tests were used to detect possible MCI: Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants classified as positive were referred to clinical diagnosis. A decision tree and predictive models are presented as a result of applying techniques of machine learning for a more efficient enrollment. Results: One hundred and twenty-eight participants (17.4%) scored positive on MCI tests. A recursive partitioning algorithm with the most significant variables determined that the most relevant for the decision tree are: female sex, sleeping more than 9 h daily, age higher than 79 years as risk factors, and reading frequency. Moreover, psychoanaleptics, nootropics, and antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory drugs achieve a high score of importance according to the predictive algorithms. Furthermore, results obtained from these algorithms agree with the current research on MCI. Conclusion: Lifestyle-related factors such as sleep duration and the lack of reading habits are associated with the presence of positive in MCI test. Moreover, we have depicted how machine learning provides a sound methodology to produce tools for early detection of MCI in community pharmacy.

            "abstract": "Image seam carving algorithm should preserve important and salient objects as much as possible when changing the image size, while not removing the secondary objects in the scene. However, it is still difficult to determine the important and salient objects that avoid the distortion of these objects after resizing the input image. In this paper, we develop a novel depth-aware single image seam carving approach by taking advantage of the modern depth cameras such as the Kinect sensor, which captures the RGB color image and its corresponding depth map simultaneously. By considering both the depth information and the just noticeable difference (JND) model, we develop an efficient JND-based significant computation approach using the multiscale graph cut based energy optimization. Our method achieves the better seam carving performance by cutting the near objects less seams while removing distant objects more seams. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first work to use the true depth map captured by Kinect depth camera for single image seam carving. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach produces better seam carving results than previous content-aware seam carving methods."

Conventional formula-based techniques have been demonstrated to over- or under-predict the risk of CVD in the Australian population. This study assessed the ability of machine learning models to predict CVD mortality risk in the Australian population and compare performance with the well-established Framingham model. Data is drawn from three Australian cohort studies: the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS), the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle study, and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS). Four machine learning models for predicting 15-year CVD mortality risk were developed and compared to the 2008 Framingham model. Machine learning models performed significantly better compared to the Framingham model when applied to the three Australian cohorts. Machine learning based models improved prediction by 2.7% to 5.2% across three Australian cohorts. In an aggregated cohort, machine learning models improved prediction by up to 5.1% (area-under-curve (AUC) 0.852, 95% CI 0.837-0.867). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) was up to 26% with machine learning models. Machine learning based models also showed improved performance when stratified by sex and diabetes status. Results suggest a potential for improving CVD risk prediction in the Australian population using machine learning models."

            "abstract": "Fleshy fruits have evolved to be attractive to frugivores in order to enhance seed dispersal, and have become an indispensable part of the human diet. Here we review the recent advances in the understanding of transcriptional regulation of fleshy fruit development and ripening with a focus on tomato. While aspects of fruit development are probably conserved throughout the angiosperms, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, it is shown that the likely orthologues of Arabidopsis genes have distinct functions in fleshy fruits. The model for the study of fleshy fruit development is tomato, because of the availability of single gene mutants and transgenic knock-down lines. In other species, our knowledge is often incomplete or absent. Tomato fruit size and shape are co-determined by transcription factors acting during formation of the ovary. Other transcription factors play a role in fruit chloroplast formation, and upon ripening impact quality aspects such as secondary metabolite content. In tomato, the transcription factors NON-RIPENING (NOR), COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (CNR), and RIPENING INHIBITOR (MADS-RIN) in concert with ethylene signalling regulate ripening, possibly in response to a developmental switch. Additional components include TOMATO AGAMOUS-LIKE1 (TAGL1), APETALA2a (AP2a), and FRUITFULL (FUL1 and FUL2). The links between this highly connected regulatory network and downstream effectors modulating colour, texture, and flavour are still relatively poorly understood. Intertwined with this network is post-transcriptional regulation by fruit-expressed microRNAs targeting several of these transcription factors. This important developmental process is also governed by changes in DNA methylation levels and possibly chromatin remodelling."

            "abstract": "Reproductive fitness of a plant is ultimately determined by both number and quality of seed offspring. This is determined by sexual selection of pollen microspores and ovules during pollination and fertilization. These processes may include pollen competition and seed abortion, which reduce the number of microspores and ovules available for final seed production. Thus, even an excess of pollen microspores to ovules does not result in fertile seeds equal to ovule number. We investigated pollen requirements of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum cultivar 'Bluecrop') for maximal seed production and how fertile seed number translates into fruit quality, since fruit quality would ultimately determine the dispersal of its offspring. We demonstrate that individual blueberry flowers with a mean of 106 ovules reach their maximum fruit set and mass and minimum time to ripen when 125 outcross pollen tetrads pollinate a flower, compared to 10 or 25. Three hundred tetrads resulted in the increase of fertile seeds, but did not result in a further increase of fruit mass or fruit set, or decrease in time to ripen. We also examined the effect of pure and mixed loads of self and outcross pollen (25 and 125 tetrads), and found no differences in fertile seed number, fruit mass, or percentage fruit set when pollen loads were either 25 self or outcross pollen tetrads, although number of days to ripen was significantly shorter by 8 d with 25 outcross tetrads. When the pollen load of 125 tetrads consisted of self or a 50:50 mixture of self and outcross pollen, fruit mass, days to ripen, and percentage fruit set were not different from loads of 125 outcross pollen. In addition, a pollen load of 25 outcross tetrads resulted in fertile seed number and fruit quality in between that of 25 self, and 125 self, 125 mixed, or 125 outcross tetrads. Large, small, and flat seed types were identified, and only large seeds (length = 1.7 mm) were fertile. These results improve our understanding of pollen load size and source requirements of a crop plant and the limits to pollen transfer when translated to fruit growth."

Traditional health promotion programs by human professionals have limitations in terms of cost and reach. Due to labor shortages and to save costs, there has been a growing emphasis in the medical field on building health guidance systems using artificial intelligence (AI).

Treatment group II received video messages from a companion, in addition to the text messages (combined text message and human video message intervention by AI).

Further, human intervention with AI and video messaging significantly reduced the body fat percentage (BFP) of participants after 3 months compared to the control group, and the rate of reduction was greater in the group with more individualized intervention.

The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal."

Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, can automatically interact with individuals through natural conversation. They may be more engaging than one-way messaging interventions. To our knowledge, physical activity chatbots have not been developed with low-income participants, nor in Spanish-the second most dominant language in the U.S. We recommend best practices for physical activity chatbots in English and Spanish for low-income women. Methods: We designed a prototype physical activity text-message based conversational agent based on various psychotherapeutic techniques. We recruited participants through SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education) in California (Alameda County) and Tennessee (Shelby County). We conducted qualitative interviews with participants during testing of our prototype chatbot, held a Wizard of Oz study, and facilitated a co-design workshop in Spanish with a subset of our participants. Results: We included 10 Spanish- and 8 English-speaking women between 27 and 41 years old. The majority was Hispanic/Latina (n = 14), 2 were White and 2 were Black/African American. More than half were monolingual Spanish speakers, and the majority was born outside the US (>50% in Mexico). Most participants were unfamiliar with chatbots and were initially skeptical. After testing our prototype, most users felt positively about health chatbots. They desired a personalized chatbot that addresses their concerns about privacy, and stressed the need for a comprehensive system to also aid with nutrition, health information, stress, and involve family members. Differences between English and monolingual Spanish speakers were found mostly in exercise app use, digital literacy, and the wish for family inclusion. Conclusion: Low-income Spanish- and English-speaking women are interested in using chatbots to improve their physical activity and other health related aspects. Researchers developing health chatbots for this population should focus on issues of digital literacy, app familiarity, linguistic and cultural issues, privacy concerns, and personalization. Designing and testing this intervention for and with this group using co-creation techniques and involving community partners will increase the probability that it will ultimately be effective."

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has been widely used in pulmonary nodule recognition, and the algorithm of Multiple Kernel Learning Support Vector Machine (MKL-SVM) has achieved good results therein. Based on grid search, however, the MKL-SVM algorithm needs long optimization time in course of parameter optimization; also its identification accuracy depends on the fineness of grid. In the paper, swarm intelligence is introduced and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is combined with MKL-SVM algorithm to be MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm so as to realize global optimization of parameters rapidly. In order to obtain the global optimal solution, different inertia weights such as constant inertia weight, linear inertia weight, and nonlinear inertia weight are applied to pulmonary nodules recognition. The experimental results show that the model training time of the proposed MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm is only 1/7 of the training time of the MKL-SVM grid search algorithm, achieving better recognition effect. Moreover, Euclidean norm of normalized error vector is proposed to measure the proximity between the average fitness curve and the optimal fitness curve after convergence. Through statistical analysis of the average of 20 times operation results with different inertial weights, it can be seen that the dynamic inertial weight is superior to the constant inertia weight in the MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm. In the dynamic inertial weight algorithm, the parameter optimization time of nonlinear inertia weight is shorter; the average fitness value after convergence is much closer to the optimal fitness value, which is better than the linear inertial weight. Besides, a better nonlinear inertial weight is verified."

            "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization the percentage of healthcare dependent population, such as elderly and people with disabilities, among others, will increase over the next years. This trend will put a strain on the health and social systems of most countries. The adoption of robots could assist these health systems in responding to this increased demand, particularly in high intensity and repetitive tasks. In a previous work, we compared a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) with a Virtual Agent (VA) during the execution of a rehabilitation task. The SAR consisted of a humanoid R1 robot, while the Virtual Agent represented its simulated counter-part. In both cases, the agents evaluated the participants' motions and provided verbal feedback. Participants reported higher levels of engagement when training with the SAR. Given that the architecture has been proven to be successful for a rehabilitation task, other sets of repetitive tasks could also take advantage of the platform, such as clinical tests. A commonly performed clinical trial is the Timed Up and Go (TUG), where the patient has to stand up, walk 3 m to a goal line and back, and sit down. To handle this test, we extended the architecture to evaluate lower limbs' motions, follow the participants while continuously interacting with them, and verify that the test is completed successfully. We implemented the scenario in Gazebo, by simulating both participants and the interaction with the robot. A full interactive report is created when the test is over, providing the extracted information to the specialist. We validate the architecture in three different experiments, each with 1,000 trials, using the Gazebo simulation. These experiments evaluate the ability of this architecture to analyse the patient, verify if they are able to complete the TUG test, and the accuracy of the measurements obtained during the test. This work provides the foundations towards more thorough clinical experiments with a large number of participants with a physical platform in the future. The software is publicly available in the assistive-rehab repository and fully documented."

            "abstract": "Biomedical HIV prevention strategies are playing an increasingly prominent role in addressing HIV epidemics globally, but little is known about their use in Japan, where persistent HIV disparities and a recently stable, but not declining, national epidemic indicate the need for evolving approaches. We conducted an ethnographic study to determine the context of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) use and to identify directions for future research and action in Japan. We used data from observational fieldwork in the Kansai region and Tokyo Metropolitan Area (n = 178 persons observed), qualitative interviews (n = 32), documents and web-based data sources (n = 321), and email correspondences (n = 9) in the period 2013-2016. Drug approvals by Japan's regulatory agencies, insurance coverage for medications, and policies by healthcare institutions and government agencies were the main factors affecting PrEP and PEP legality, use, and awareness. Awareness and the observable presence of PrEP and PEP were very limited, particularly at the community level. PrEP and PEP held appeal for Japanese scientists and activists, and for study participants who represented various other stakeholder groups; however, significant concerns prevented open endorsements. Japanese health officials should prioritize a national discussion, weigh empirical evidence, and strongly consider formal approval of antiretroviral (ARV) medications for use in PrEP and both occupational and nonoccupational PEP. Once approved, social marketing campaigns can be used to advertise widely and increase awareness. Future research would benefit from theoretical grounding in a diffusion of innovations framework. These findings can inform current and future ARV-based prevention strategies at a critical time in the international conversation."

In VR feedback conditions, we observed a decreased level of perceived exertion and an increased level of enjoyment of physical activity, when compared to a regular exercise situation (no VR feedback). We also observed a shift in the subjects' attentional focus, from association (in the absence of VR feedback) to dissociation (in VR feedback conditions). Moreover, the presence of a virtual coach in the VR environment triggered a systematic regulation of the (virtual) displacement speed, whose relationship with perceived enjoyment and exertion require further work."

We developed a haptic-based environment to investigate the dynamics of two-player training performing time-constrained reaching movements using the ARMin rehabilitation robot. We implemented a challenge level adaptation algorithm that controlled a virtual damping coefficient to reach a desired success rate. We tested the algorithm's effectiveness in regulating the success rate during game play in a simulation with computer-controlled players, in a feasibility study with six unimpaired players, and in a single session with one stroke patient. The algorithm demonstrated its capacity to adjust the damping coefficient to reach three levels of success rate (low [50%], moderate [70%], and high [90%]) during singleplayer and multiplayer training. For the patient - tested in single-player mode at the moderate success rate only - the algorithm showed also promising behavior. Results of the feasibility study showed that to increase the player's willingness to play at a more challenging task condition, the effect of the challenge level adaptation - regardless of being played in single player or multiplayer mode - might be more important than the provision of multiplayer setting alone. Furthermore, the multiplayer setting tends to be a motivating and encouraging therapy component. Based on these results we will optimize and expand the multiplayer training platform and further investigate multiplayer settings in stroke therapy."

The mechanics of the game require memorizing geometric shapes while the player progresses in two modes, autonomous or manual, with two levels of difficulty depending on the number of elements to remember. The application is developed in the Unity 3D video game engine considering the optimization of computational resources to improve the performance in the processing and maintaining adequate benefits for the user, while the generated data is stored and sent to a remote server. The maze task was assessed with 29 subjects in a controlled environment. The obtained results show a significant correlation between participants' response accuracy in both the maze task and a face-pair test.

Therefore, we studied associations of depression diagnosis, severity, and BMI with perceptual body size (PBS) and body image dissatisfaction (BID). Cross-sectional data from 882 remitted depressed patients, 242 currently depressed patients and 325 healthy controls from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used. Depressive disorders (DSM-IV based psychiatric interview), standardized self-reported depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) and BMI were separately and simultaneously related to body image (the Stunkard Figure Rating scale) using linear regression analyses. Thereafter, interaction between depression and BMI was investigated. Analyses were adjusted for demographic and health variables. Higher BMI was associated with larger PBS (B = 1.13, p < .001) and with more BID (B = 0.61, p < .001). Independent of this, depression severity contributed to larger PBS (B = 0.07, p < .001), and both current (B = 0.21, p = .001) and remitted depression diagnosis (B = 0.12, p = .01) as well as depression severity (B = 0.11, p < .001) contributed to BID. There was no interaction effect between BMI and depression in predicting PBS and BID. In general, depression (current, remitted and severity) and higher BMI contribute independently to a larger body size perception as well as higher body image dissatisfaction. Efforts in treatment should be made to reduce body dissatisfaction in those suffering from depression and/or a high BMI, as BID can have long-lasting health consequences, such as development of anorexia and bulimia nervosa and an unhealthy lifestyle."

            "abstract": "Physalis species show a significant variation in berry size; however, the underlying molecular basis is unknown. In this work, we showed that cell division difference in the ovaries might contribute to the ultimate berry size variation within Physalis species, and that mRNA abundance of Physalis floridana Cell Number Regulator1 (PfCNR1), the putative orthologue of the tomato fruit weight 2.2 (FW2.2), was negatively correlated with cell division in the ovaries. Moreover, heterochronic expression variation of the PfCNR1 genes in the ovaries concomitantly correlated with berry weight variation within Physalis species. In transgenic Physalis, multiple organ sizes could be negatively controlled by altering PfCNR1 levels, and cell division instead of cell expansion was primarily affected. PfCNR1 was shown to be anchored in the plasma membrane and to interact with PfAG2 (an AGAMOUS-like protein determining ovary identity). The expression of PfCYCD2;1, a putative orthologue of the mitosis-specific gene CyclinD2;1 in the cell cycle was negatively correlated with the PfCNR1 mRNA levels. PfAG2 was found to selectively bind to the CArG-box in the PfCYCD2;1 promoter and to repress PfCYCD2;1 expression, thus suggesting a PfAG2-mediated pathway for PfCNR1 to regulate cell division. The interaction of PfCNR1 with PfAG2 enhanced the repression of PfCYCD2;1 expression. The nuclear import of PfAG2 was essential in the proposed pathway. Our data provide new insights into the developmental pathways of a cell membrane-anchored protein that modulates cell division and governs organ size determination. This study also sheds light on the link between organ identity and organ growth in plants."

However, which training is most effective in terms of a performance improvement remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of training responses during a 16 weeks training period prior to an absolved marathon. The analysis was performed on unsupervised fitness app data (Runtastic) from 6,771 marathon finishers. Differences in training volume and intensity between three response and three marathon performance groups were analyzed. Training response was quantified by the improvement of the velocity of 10 km runs Δv 10 between the first and last 4 weeks of the training period. Response and marathon performance groups were classified by the 33.3rd and 66.6th percentile of Δv 10 and the marathon performance time, respectively. Results: Subjects allocated in the faster marathon performance group showed systematically higher training volume and higher shares of training at low intensities. Only subjects in the moderate and high response group increased their training velocity continuously along the 16 weeks of training. Conclusion: We demonstrate that a combination of maximized training volumes at low intensities, a continuous increase in average running speed up to the aimed marathon velocity and high intensity runs ≤ 5 % of the overall training volume was accompanied by an improved 10 km performance which likely benefited the marathon performance as well. The study at hand proves that unsupervised workouts recorded with fitness apps can be a valuable data source for future studies in sport science."

Transmission electron microscopy showed that each stage was characterized by a specific plastidial type following the unusual sequence amyloplast-->chloroplast-->chromoplast. Plastidial transitions were accompanied by profound modifications in the pigmental composition, in particular, in the pattern of carotenoids and their precursors. The HPLC analysis of the carotenoids showed that, besides the two usual all-trans metabolic pathways leading to lutein through alpha-carotene and to auroxanthin through beta-carotene, an additional cis-isomeric biosynthetic pathway leading to cis-neoxanthin through cis-beta-carotene exists. During the pre-ripening stages, the three pathways were present even if with qualitative and quantitative variations. When complete ripening was reached, a block occurred at the cyclization level causing the accumulation of both all-trans (i.e. gamma-carotene and neurosporene) and cis-isomer (i.e. lycopene and zeta-carotene) carotene precursors. Because of the occurrence of unusual pigments and the presence of the three main plastidial types, the fruit of A. italicum may constitute a most instructive model for the study of carotenogenesis."

DCD was identified through total scores on the movement assessment battery for children 2 (MABC-2) equal to or less than the 16th percentile as well as parents' report that the child's deficits in motor skills interfered with at least two daily life activities. The sample included a group of children with DCD (n=22, M age=8.70 [SD=1.36], 16 boys [73%]) and a control group of typical children (n=47, M age=8.90 [SD=1.52], 34 boys [72%]). Measures included the strength subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency (BOT-2), the six minutes' walk test (6MWT) with heart rate measure, BMI and the percentage of body fat. Significant differences between DCD and typical children were found on all variables of physical fitness and weight. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis (group/gender) also revealed significant interactions for the percentage of body fat (F=8.51, p<.005) and BMI (F=4.50, p<.038) meaning that less fit children are more obese. The current study supports previous findings that children with DCD are less physically fit and more overweight compared to typically developing children.

            "abstract": "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill.) represents a model species for all fleshy fruits due to its biological cycle and the availability of numerous genetic and molecular resources. Its importance in human nutrition has made it one of the most valuable worldwide commodities. Tomato fruit size results from the combination of cell number and cell size, which are determined by both cell division and expansion. As fruit growth is mainly driven by cell expansion, cells from the (fleshy) pericarp tissue become highly polyploid according to the endoreduplication process, reaching a DNA content rarely encountered in other plant species (between 2C and 512C). Both cell division and cell expansion are under the control of complex interactions between hormone signalling and carbon partitioning, which establish crucial determinants of the quality of ripe fruit, such as the final size, weight, and shape, and organoleptic and nutritional traits. This review describes the genes known to contribute to fruit growth in tomato."

            "abstract": "The Theory of Planned Behaviour model (Ajzen, 1985) was used to determine whether long-term experience with Intelligent Speed Adaption (ISA) prompts a change in speed related cognitions. The study examines data collected as part of a project examining driver behaviour with an intervening but overridable ISA system. Data was collected in four six-month field trials. The trials followed an A-B-A design (28 days driving with no ISA, 112 days driving with ISA, 28 days driving without ISA) to monitor changes in speeding behaviour as a result of the ISA system and any carry-over effect of the system. Findings suggested that following experience with the system, drivers' intention to speed significantly weakened, beyond the removal of ISA support. Drivers were also less likely to believe that exceeding the speed would 'get them to their destination more quickly' and less likely to believe that 'being in a hurry' would facilitate speeding. However, the positive change in intentions and beliefs failed to translate into behaviour. Experience with the ISA system significantly reduced the percentage of distance travelled whilst exceeding the speed limit but this effect was not evident when the ISA support was removed."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Navicular drop is a common plantar deformity which makes the plantar medial longitudinal arch (MLA) collapse and leads to other deformities in lower extremities. Active structures are from intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscle activities such as abductor hallucis (AbdH), tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis brevis, flexor digitorum brevis during dynamic situations. As AbdH plays a role as a dynamic elevator of MLA, the importance of AbdH has been emphasized and the proper recruitment of both intrinsic and extrinsic muscle is crucial for stabilization of MLA during dynamic weight bearing condition. Because the short foot (SF) exercise is difficult to perform and tends to activate the intrinsic muscles concentrically rather than a natural coordination of concentric-isometric-eccentric activation, we have developed the guidance-tubing SF gait (GFG) exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We investigated the effect of GFG exercise on muscle activity, AbdH:TA activity ratio, MLA angle, and foot pressure distribution during walking compared to SF gait (SFG) exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-two subjects with flexible flat feet were divided into two groups and performed SFG exercise with (GFG) and without guidance-tubing (SFG) for seven serial days.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      AbdH muscle activity significantly increased from foot flat to heel rise in the GFG group (p = 0.006).

            "abstract": "Fruits represent an important part of the human diet and show extensive variation in size and shape between and within cultivated species. The genetic basis of such variation has been studied most extensively in tomato, where currently six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involving these traits have been fine-mapped and the genes underlying the QTLs identified. The genes responsible for the cloned QTLs belong to families with a few to many members. FASCIATED is encoded by a member of the YABBY family, CNR/FW2.2 by a member of the Cell Number Regulator family, SlKLUH/FW3.2 by a cytochrome P450 of the 78A class (CYP78A), LOCULE NUMBER by a member of the WOX family including WUSCHEL, OVATE by a member of the Ovate Family Proteins (OFP), and SUN by a member of the IQ domain family. A high portion of the history and current diversity in fruit morphology among tomato cultivars can be explained by modifications at four of these cloned QTLs. In melon, a number of QTLs involved in fruit morphology have been mapped, but the molecular basis for these QTLs is unknown. In the present review, we examine the current knowledge on the molecular basis of fruit morphology in tomato and transfer that information in order to define candidate genes of melon fruit shape and size QTLs. We hypothesize that different members of the gene families identified in tomato may have a role in the regulation of fruit morphology in other species. We anchored the published melon QTL map on the genome sequence and identified the melon family members of the six cloned tomato QTLs in the genome. We investigated the co-localization of melon fruit morphology QTLs and the candidate genes. We found that QTLs for fruit weight co-localized frequently with members of the CNR/FW2.2 and KLUH/FW3.2 families, as well as co-localizations between OFP family members and fruit-shape QTLs, making this family the most suitable to explain fruit shape variation among melon accessions."

            "abstract": "Background: Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of askNivi, a free sexual and reproductive health information service. Methods: We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats. Results: Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to askNivi, and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common. Conclusions: Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy. Text mining is one way to better understand how users engage with interventions like askNivi and maximize what artificial intelligence has to offer."

Challenges in access to diabetes specialists and educators, low adherence to medications, and inadequate motivational support for proper disease self-management contribute to poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Simultaneously, high patient volumes and low reimbursement rates limit physicians' time spent on lifestyle behavior counseling. These barriers to efficient diabetes care lead to high rates of diabetes-related complications, driving healthcare costs up and reducing the quality of patients' lives. Considering recent advancements in healthcare delivery technologies such as smartphone applications, telemedicine, m-health, device connectivity, machine-learning technology, and artificial intelligence, there is significant opportunity to achieve better efficiency in diabetes care and increase patient involvement in diabetes self-management, which ultimately may put an end to soaring diabetes-related healthcare expenditures.

            "abstract": "The grapevine reproductive cycle has a number of unique features. Inflorescences develop from lateral meristems (anlagen) in latent buds during spring and summer and enter a dormant state at a very immature stage before completing development and producing flowers and berries the following spring. Lateral meristems are unique structures derived from the shoot apical meristem and can either develop into an inflorescence or a tendril. How the grapevine plant controls these processes at the molecular level is not understood, but some progress has been made by isolating and studying the expression of flowering genes in wild-type and mutant grapevine plants. Interestingly, a number of flowering genes are also expressed during berry development. This paper reviews the current understanding of the genetic control of grapevine flowering and the impact of viticulture management treatments and environmental variables on yield. While the availability of the draft genome sequence of grapevine will greatly assist future molecular genetic studies, a number of issues are identified that need to be addressed--particularly rapid methods for confirming gene function and linking genes to biological processes and traits. Understanding the key interactions between environmental factors and genetic mechanisms controlling the induction and development of inflorescences, flowers, and berries is also an important area that requires increased emphasis, especially given the large seasonal fluctuations in yield experienced by the crop and the increasing concern about the effect of climate change on existing wine-producing regions."

Our secondary aim was to generate and cross-validate predictive equations for VAT and SAT using these simple clinical and BIA-derived variables. Measures of truncal adiposity were measured using 1.5-T MRI (VAT, SAT, and TrF %(MRI)) and Tanita (Tokyo, Japan) 8-electrode body composition analyzer BC-418 (TrF %(BIA)) in 13 female FPLD patients. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined among the various adiposity parameters (BMI, WC, WHR, SAT, VAT, TrF %(MRI), TrF %(BIA), and TF %). Equations to estimate VAT and SAT were determined among 6 of the 13 FPLD subjects using multilinear regression analysis, and the best equations were then cross-validated in the remaining 7 subjects. Variables entered into the model included age, BMI, WC, WHR, TrF %(BIA), and TF %. The TrF %(MRI) showed moderate correlation (r = 0.647, P = .02) with the TrF %(BIA), but the discrepancy between the 2 variables increased with increasing truncal adiposity. The strongest correlate for TrF %(MRI) was BMI (r = 0.886, P < .0001). Visceral adipose tissue was poorly associated with simple clinical measures of BMI, WC, and WHR, but was inversely correlated with TF %, TrF %(BIA), and SAT. The TF % was the strongest correlate for both SAT and VAT. Thus, the best regression equation for VAT included age, BMI, WC, and TF % (R(2) = 1.0), whereas that for SAT only included TF % (R(2) = 0.75). The corresponding standard error of the estimate for the predictive equations was approximately 0.03 % and 18.5 % of the mean value of VAT and SAT, respectively. In the cross-validation study, differences between predicted and observed values of SAT were larger than those of VAT. We conclude that, among female FPLD patients, (1) no simple clinical anthropometric measure correlates well with VAT, whereas BMI correlates well with SAT; (2) BIA measure of TF % most strongly correlated with both VAT and SAT; and (3) based on the cross-validation study, VAT but not SAT could be more reliably estimated using the regression equations derived."

            "abstract": "Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), which belong to the Solanaceae family, are among the most cultivated and consumed fleshy fruits worldwide and constitute excellent sources of many essential nutrients, such as vitamins A, C, and E, calcium, and carotenoids. While fruit ripening is a highly regulated and complex process, tomato and pepper have been classified as climacteric and non-climacteric fruits, respectively. These fruits differ greatly in shape, color composition, flavor, and several other features which undergo drastic changes during the ripening process. Such ripening-related metabolic and developmental changes require extensive alterations in many cellular and biochemical processes, which ultimately leads to fully ripe fruits with nutritional and organoleptic features that are attractive to both natural dispersers and human consumers. Recent data show that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are involved in fruit ripening, during which molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), NADPH, nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), interact to regulate protein functions through post-translational modifications. In light of these recent discoveries, this review provides an update on the nitro-oxidative metabolism during the ripening of two of the most economically important fruits, discusses the signaling roles played by ROS/RNS in controlling this complex physiological process, and highlights the potential biotechnological applications of these substances to promote further improvements in fruit ripening regulation and nutritional quality. In addition, we suggest that the term 'nitro-oxidative eustress' with regard to fruit ripening would be more appropriate than nitro-oxidative stress, which ultimately favors the consolidation of the plant species."

The sports indicators of this experiment include regional GDP, total output of sports industry, sports practitioners, local financial sports expenditures, the number of policies, the number of people participating in physical exercise, and fitness venues and facilities. The realization results show that these variables develop at a relatively small rate under normal conditions, and then predict the data in the next few years under the healthy and sustainable development of the next few years through the mental model. The growth rates of various indicators of the sports economy have increased significantly, and they have been optimized by about 20% compared with the normal development."

Limited functional genomics resources and whole genome association studies could be substantially improved through the application of molecular approach for the characterization of gene content and identification of molecular markers. The massive parallel pyrosequencing of two pepper varieties, the highly pungent, Saengryeg 211, and the non-pungent, Saengryeg 213, including de novo transcriptome assembly, functional annotation, and in silico discovery of potential molecular markers is described. We performed 454 GS-FLX Titanium sequencing of polyA-selected and normalized cDNA libraries generated from a single pool of transcripts obtained from mature fruits of two pepper varieties.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A single 454 pyrosequencing run generated 361,671 and 274,269 reads totaling 164.49 and 124.60 Mb of sequence data (average read length of 454 nucleotides), which assembled into 23,821 and 17,813 isotigs and 18,147 and 15,129 singletons for both varieties, respectively. These reads were organized into 20,352 and 15,781 'isogroups' for both varieties. Assembled sequences were functionally annotated based on homology to genes in multiple public databases and assigned with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Sequence variants analyses identified a total of 3,766 and 2,431 potential (Simple Sequence Repeat) SSR motifs for microsatellite analysis for both varieties, where trinucleotide was the most common repeat unit (84%), followed by di (9.9%), hexa (4.1%) and pentanucleotide repeats (2.1%).

In particular, when herbivory influences floral display, we hypothesize that pollinator visitation will be altered accordingly. Here we studied the indirect effects of feeding by two beetles, Neogalerucella calmariensis and N. pusilla, released as a biological control, on plant-pollinator interactions and fitness in the invasive plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two herbivory treatments (ambient and simulated) were applied to plants in a naturally occurring population of purple loosestrife.

The first was to build a motivational message system for a virtual agent assisting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) therapy based on domain knowledge from experts. The second was to test the hypotheses that (1) computer-generated motivating messages influence users' motivation to continue with therapy, trust in a good therapy outcome, and the feeling of being heard by the agent and (2) personalized messages outperform generic messages on these factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A system capable of generating motivational messages was built by analyzing expert (N=13) knowledge on what types of motivational statements to use in what situation. To test the 2 hypotheses, a Web-based study was performed (N=207). Participants were asked to imagine they were in a certain situation, specified by the progression of their symptoms and initial trust in a good therapy outcome. After this, they received a message from a virtual agent containing either personalized motivation as generated by the system, general motivation, or no motivational content.

Personalization of the messages was also shown to be important in those situations where the symptoms were getting worse. In these situations, personalized messages outperformed general messages both in terms of motivation to continue and trust in a good therapy outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Expert input can successfully be used to develop a personalized motivational message system. Messages generated by such a system seem to improve people's motivation and trust in PTSD therapy as well as the user's feeling of being heard by a virtual agent. Given the importance of motivation, trust, and therapeutic alliance for successful therapy, we anticipate that the proposed system can improve adherence in e-mental therapy for PTSD and that it can provide a blueprint for the development of an adaptive system for persuasive messages based on expert input."

One of the most unsettling lessons from recent psychological research is that people are routinely mistaken about the origins of their behavior. Yet philosophical orthodoxy holds that the exercise of morally responsible agency typically requires accurate self-awareness. If the orthodoxy is right, and the psychology is to be believed, people characteristically fail to meet the standards of morally responsible agency, and we are faced with the possibility of skepticism about agency. Unlike many philosophers, I accept the unsettling lesson from psychology. I insist, however, that we are not driven to skepticism. Instead, we should reject the requirement of accurate self-awareness for morally responsible agency. In Talking to Our Selves I develop a dialogic theory, where the exercise of morally responsible agency emerges through a collaborative conversational process by which human beings, although afflicted with a remarkable degree of self-ignorance, are able to realize their values in their lives."

Our goal is to harness the extensive knowledge of the Arabidopsis BR signaling network to improve productivity in crop species. This first requires identifying components of the conserved network and their function in the target species. Here, we investigated the function of SlBIM1a, the closest tomato homolog of AtBIM1, which is highly expressed in fruit. SlBIM1a-overexpressing lines displayed severe plant and fruit dwarfism, and histological characterization of different transgenic lines revealed that SlBIM1a expression negatively correlated with fruit pericarp cell size, resulting in fruit size modifications. These growth phenotypes were in contrast to those found in Arabidopsis, and this was confirmed by the reciprocal ectopic expression of SlBIM1a/b in Arabidopsis and of AtBIM1 in tomato. These results determined that BIM1 function depends more on the recipient species than on its primary sequence. Yeast two-hybrid interaction studies and transcriptomic analyses of SlBIM1a-overexpressing fruit further suggested that SlBIM1a acts through its interaction with SlBZH1 to govern the transcriptional regulation of growth-related BR target genes. Together, these results suggest that SlBIM1a is a negative regulator of pericarp cell expansion, possibly at the crossroads with auxin and light signaling."

However, the composition of diet has not been clearly established. Macronutrients such as saturated fatty acids (SFA), trans-fats, simple sugars and animal proteins have a harmful effect on the liver. On the other hand, monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), polyunsaturated (PUFAs) omega-3-fats, plant-based proteins and dietary fibres are considered to be beneficial to the liver. The impact of specific micronutrients is less well-known. Nutrients are part of the food we eat. Food makes up our meals, which compose our dietary patterns. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients usually follow Western diets which are rich in soda, frozen junk food, juice, red meat, lard, processed meats, whole fat dairy foods, fatty snack foods, take-away foods, cakes and biscuits and poor in cereals, whole grains, fruit, vegetables, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and fish. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet (MD) is beneficial for NAFLD even when it is iso-caloric or there are no changes in body weight. A new approach, called 'nutritional geometry' considers the importance of integrating nutrition, animals and the environment. The goal of this approach is to combine nutrients and foods in a model to understand how food components interact to regulate the properties of diets affecting health and disease. The use of algorithms developed by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a personalized diet for patients can provide customized nutritional counselling to prevent and treat NAFLD."

Using long-term data, fruit set was quantified in two populations over 16 consecutive years (2004-2019). Artificial hand pollination was performed to test the hypothesis that fruit set was pollinator-limited and that selfing led to decreased seed set and viability. Annual variation (2016-2019) in selection gradients was calculated for three colour traits (brightness, contrast and the number of spots on the labellum), flower size (spur length, labellum length and width) and plant size (number of flowers, plant height).\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Fruit set was, on average, low (~12 %) and severely pollinator-limited.

In this work we used acceleration data from a wristwatch in order to identify long-term activities. We compare the use of Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields for the segmentation task.

Obesity is largely determined by modifiable lifestyle behaviours such as low physical activity levels, sedentary behaviour and consumption of energy dense diets. It is increasingly being recognised that effective responses must go beyond interventions that only focus on a specific individual, social or environmental level and instead embrace system-based multi-level intervention approaches that address both the individual and environment. The EU-funded project \"sustainable prevention of obesity through integrated strategies\" (SPOTLIGHT) aims to increase and combine knowledge on the wide range of determinants of obesity in a systematic way, and to identify multi-level intervention approaches that are strong in terms of Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM).\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      SPOTLIGHT comprises a series of systematic reviews on: individual-level predictors of success in behaviour change obesity interventions; social and physical environmental determinants of obesity; and on the RE-AIM of multi-level interventions.

Previous research investigated the influence of gaze by manipulating mutual eye contact. Therefore, gaze and body direction have been changed as a whole, resulting in only congruent gaze and body directions (averted or directed) of another person. Here, we aimed to disentangle these effects by using short animated sequences of virtual agents posing with either direct or averted body or gaze. Attention allocation by means of eye movements, facial muscle response, and emotional experience to agents of different gender and facial expressions were investigated. Eye movement data revealed longer fixation durations, i.e., a stronger allocation of attention, when gaze and body direction were not congruent with each other or when both were directed towards the observer. This suggests that direct interaction as well as incongruous signals increase the demands of attentional resources in the observer. For the facial muscle response, only the reaction of muscle zygomaticus major revealed an effect of body direction, expressed by stronger activity in response to happy expressions for direct compared to averted gaze when the virtual character's body was directed towards the observer. Finally, body direction also influenced the emotional experience ratings towards happy expressions. While earlier findings suggested that mutual eye contact is the main source for increased emotional responding and attentional allocation, the present results indicate that direction of the virtual agent's body and head also plays a minor but significant role."

            "abstract": "Salinization of water and soil has a negative impact on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) productivity by reducing growth of sink organs and by inducing senescence in source leaves. It has been hypothesized that yield stability implies the maintenance or increase of sink activity in the reproductive structures, thus contributing to the transport of assimilates from the source leaves through changes in sucrolytic enzymes and their regulation by phytohormones. In this study, classical and functional physiological approaches have been integrated to study the influence of metabolic and hormonal factors on tomato fruit sink activity, growth, and yield: (i) exogenous hormones were applied to plants, and (ii) transgenic plants overexpressing the cell wall invertase (cwInv) gene CIN1 in the fruits and de novo cytokinin (CK) biosynthesis gene IPT in the roots were constructed. Although salinity reduces fruit growth, sink activity, and trans-zeatin (tZ) concentrations, it increases the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) during the actively growing period (25 days after anthesis). Indeed, exogenous application of the CK analogue kinetin to salinized actively growing fruits recovered sucrolytic activities (mainly cwInv and sucrose synthase), sink strength, and fruit weight, whereas the ethylene-releasing compound ethephon had a negative effect in equivalent non-stressed fruits. Fruit yield was increased by both the constitutive expression of CIN1 in the fruits (up to 4-fold) or IPT in the root (up to 30%), owing to an increase in the fruit number (lower flower abortion) and in fruit weight. This is possibly related to a recovery of sink activity in reproductive tissues due to both (i) increase in sucrolytic activities (cwInv, sucrose synthase, and vacuolar and cytoplasmic invertases) and tZ concentration, and (ii) a decrease in the ACC levels and the activity of the invertase inhibitor. This study provides new functional evidences about the role of metabolic and hormonal inter-regulation of local sink processes in controlling tomato fruit sink activity, growth, and yield under salinity."

            "abstract": "Physical activity is widely known to be one of the key elements of a healthy life. The many benefits of physical activity described in the medical literature include weight loss and reductions in the risk factors for chronic diseases. With the recent advances in wearable devices, such as smartwatches or physical activity wristbands, motion tracking sensors are becoming pervasive, which has led to an impressive growth in the amount of physical activity data available and an increasing interest in recognizing which specific activity a user is performing. Moreover, big data and machine learning are now cross-fertilizing each other in an approach called \"deep learning\", which consists of massive artificial neural networks able to detect complicated patterns from enormous amounts of input data to learn classification models. This work compares various state-of-the-art classification techniques for automatic cross-person activity recognition under different scenarios that vary widely in how much information is available for analysis. We have incorporated deep learning by using Google's TensorFlow framework. The data used in this study were acquired from PAMAP2 (Physical Activity Monitoring in the Ageing Population), a publicly available dataset containing physical activity data. To perform cross-person prediction, we used the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation technique. When working with large training sets, the best classifiers obtain very high average accuracies (e.g., 96% using extra randomized trees). However, when the data volume is drastically reduced (where available data are only 0.001% of the continuous data), deep neural networks performed the best, achieving 60% in overall prediction accuracy. We found that even when working with only approximately 22.67% of the full dataset, we can statistically obtain the same results as when working with the full dataset. This finding enables the design of more energy-efficient devices and facilitates cold starts and big data processing of physical activity records."

            "abstract": "To avoid serious diabetic complications, people with type 1 diabetes must keep their blood glucose levels (BGLs) as close to normal as possible. Insulin dosages and carbohydrate consumption are important considerations in managing BGLs. Since the 1960s, models have been developed to forecast blood glucose levels based on the history of BGLs, insulin dosages, carbohydrate intake, and other physiological and lifestyle factors. Such predictions can be used to alert people of impending unsafe BGLs or to control insulin flow in an artificial pancreas. In past work, we have introduced an LSTM-based approach to blood glucose level prediction aimed at \"what-if\" scenarios, in which people could enter foods they might eat or insulin amounts they might take and then see the effect on future BGLs. In this work, we invert the \"what-if\" scenario and introduce a similar architecture based on chaining two LSTMs that can be trained to make either insulin or carbohydrate recommendations aimed at reaching a desired BG level in the future. Leveraging a recent state-of-the-art model for time series forecasting, we then derive a novel architecture for the same recommendation task, in which the two LSTM chain is used as a repeating block inside a deep residual architecture. Experimental evaluations using real patient data from the OhioT1DM dataset show that the new integrated architecture compares favorably with the previous LSTM-based approach, substantially outperforming the baselines. The promising results suggest that this novel approach could potentially be of practical use to people with type 1 diabetes for self-management of BGLs."

            "abstract": "Ethylene has long been considered the key regulator of ripening in climacteric fruit. Recent evidence showed that auxin also plays an important role during fruit ripening, but the nature of the interaction between the two hormones has remained unclear. To understand the differences in ethylene- and auxin-related behaviours that might reveal how the two hormones interact, we compared two plum (Prunus salicina L.) cultivars with widely varying fruit development and ripening ontogeny. The early-ripening cultivar, Early Golden (EG), exhibited high endogenous auxin levels and auxin hypersensitivity during fruit development, while the late-ripening cultivar, V98041 (V9), displayed reduced auxin content and sensitivity. We show that exogenous auxin is capable of dramatically accelerating fruit development and ripening in plum, indicating that this hormone is actively involved in the ripening process. Further, we demonstrate that the variations in auxin sensitivity between plum cultivars could be partially due to PslAFB5, which encodes a TIR1-like auxin receptor. Two different PslAFB5 alleles were identified, one (Pslafb5) inactive due to substitution of the conserved F-box amino acid residue Pro61 to Ser. The early-ripening cultivar, EG, exhibited homozygosity for the inactive allele; however, the late cultivar, V9, displayed a PslAFB5/afb5 heterozygous genotype. Our results highlight the impact of auxin in stimulating fruit development, especially the ripening process and the potential for differential auxin sensitivity to alter important fruit developmental processes."

Both of them are expressed during flower and mesocarp development. Here a detailed analysis of a gene that belongs to the PLENA subfamily of MADS-box genes is shown. The expression of this PLENA-like gene (PpPLENA) increases during fruit ripening, and its ectopic expression in tomato plants causes the transformation of sepals into carpel-like structures that become fleshy and ripen like real fruits. Interestingly, the transgenic berries constitutively expressing the PpPLENA gene show an accelerated ripening, as judged by the expression of genes that are important for tomato fruit ripening. It is suggested that PpPLENA might interfere with the endogenous activity of TAGL1, thereby activating the fruit ripening pathway earlier compared with wild-type tomato plants."

However, the mechanism by which the expression levels of KLUH affect organ size is poorly understood. We found that higher expression of SlKLUH increased cell proliferation in the pericarp within 5 d post-anthesis in tomato near-isogenic lines. Differential gene expression analyses showed that lower expression of SlKLUH was associated with increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Lipidomic analysis revealed that repression of SlKLUH mainly increased the contents of certain non-phosphorus glycerolipids and phospholipids and decreased the contents of four unknown lipids. Co-expression network analyses revealed that lipid metabolism was possibly associated with but not directly controlled by SlKLUH, and that this gene instead controls photosynthesis-related processes. In addition, many transcription factors putatively involved in the KLUH pathway were identified. Collectively, we show that SlKLUH regulates fruit and seed weight which is associated with altered lipid metabolism. The results expand our understanding of fruit and seed weight regulation and offer a valuable resource for functional studies of candidate genes putatively involved in regulation of organ size in tomato and other crops."

Methods: We conducted tree-based RF feature importance of Black kidney transplant recipients in United States from 2015 to 2019 in the UNOS database using the number of nodes, accuracy decrease, gini decrease, times_a_root, p value, and mean minimal depth. Feature interaction analysis was also performed to evaluate the most frequent occurrences in the RF classification run between correlated and uncorrelated pairs. Results: A total of 22,687 Black kidney transplant recipients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 1330 (6%) had acute rejection within 1 year after kidney transplant. Important variables in the RF models for acute rejection among Black kidney transplant recipients included recipient age, ESKD etiology, PRA, cold ischemia time, donor age, HLA DR mismatch, BMI, serum albumin, degree of HLA mismatch, education level, and dialysis duration. The three most frequent interactions consisted of two numerical variables, including recipient age:donor age, recipient age:serum albumin, and recipient age:BMI, respectively. Conclusions: The application of tree-based RF feature importance and feature interaction network analysis framework identified recipient age, ESKD etiology, PRA, cold ischemia time, donor age, HLA DR mismatch, BMI, serum albumin, degree of HLA mismatch, education level, and dialysis duration as important variables in the RF models for acute rejection among Black kidney transplant recipients in the United States."

The difficulties in identifiying not only genes or genomic regions but also individual target compounds for plant breeding are addressed. Ample variability in the levels of almost any volatile compound exists, not only in the populations derived from interspecific crosses but also in heirloom varieties and even in commercial hybrids. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for all tomato aroma volatiles have been identified in collections derived from both intraspecific and interspecific crosses with different wild tomato species and they (i) fail to co-localize with structural genes in the volatile biosynthetic pathways and (ii) reveal very little coincidence in the genomic regions characterized, indicating that there is ample opportunity to reinforce the levels of the volatiles of interest. Some of the identified genes may be useful as markers or as biotechnological tools to enhance tomato aroma. Current knowledge about the major volatile biosynthetic pathways in the fruit is summarized. Finally, and based on recent reports, it is stressed that conjugation to other metabolites such as sugars seems to play a key role in the modulation of volatile release, at least in some metabolic pathways."

The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the effects of short periods of exposure to high temperature on flower production (FN), the proportion of flowers forming fruits (fruit-set) and the number of pegs and pods per plant (RNt); (ii) whether fruit-set is affected by high temperature during different periods of daylight in each diurnal cycle; and (iii) whether responses to temperature were qualitative or quantitative. Plants of cv. ICGV 86015 were grown in controlled environments at a day/night temperature of 28/22 degrees C from sowing until 9 d after flowering (DAF). Then, cohorts of plants were: (a) exposed to day temperature of 28, 34, 42 or 48 degrees C for 2, 4 or 6 d; or were (b) exposed to 34, 42 or 48 degrees C for 6 d either throughout a 12 h day (08.00 to 20.00 h, WD), or only during the first 6 h (AM) or second 6 h (PM) of the day. Values of RNt were significantly reduced by high temperature, by duration of exposure, and by timing of exposure. Variation in FN was quantitatively related to floral bud temperatures during the day over the range 28-43 degrees C. In contrast, only floral bud temperatures > 36 degrees C during AM and WD significantly reduced fruit-set and hence RNt, whereas high PM temperature had no effect on fruit-set. These findings indicate that the response of RNt to day temperature is quantitative and can be modelled by combining the responses of FN and fruit-set to temperature."

According to the adaptation and anticipation model (ADAM) of sensorimotor synchronization, precise yet flexible interpersonal coordination is supported by reactive error correction mechanisms and anticipatory mechanisms that exploit systematic patterns in stimulus timing to plan future actions. Here, we provide a tutorial introduction to the computational architecture of ADAM and present a series of single- and dual-virtual agent simulations that examine the model parameters that produce ideal synchronization performance in different tempo conditions. In the single-agent simulations, a virtual agent synchronized responses to steady tempo sequence or a sequence containing gradual tempo changes. Parameters controlling basic reactive error (phase) correction were sufficient for producing ideal synchronization performance at the steady tempo, whereas parameters controlling anticipatory mechanisms were necessary for ideal performance with a tempo-changing sequence. In the dual-agent simulations, two interacting virtual agents produced temporal sequences from either congruent or incongruent internal performance templates specifying a steady tempo or tempo changes. Ideal performance was achieved with reactive error correction alone when both agents implemented the same performance template (either steady tempo or tempo change). In contrast, anticipatory mechanisms played a key role when one agent implemented a steady tempo template and the other agent implemented a tempo change template. These findings have implications for understanding the interplay between reactive and anticipatory mechanisms when agents possess compatible versus incompatible representations of task goals during human-human and human-machine interaction."

The control scheme presents a model free decentralized output feedback adaptive high-order sliding mode control to solve the trajectory tracking problem in each degree of freedom of the exoskeleton. A high order sliding mode differentiator estimates the unmeasured states and, by means of a dynamical state extension, it approximates the unknown dynamical model of the exoskeleton.

Here, we describe the independent mapping and cloning of a common causative APRR2 gene regulating pigment accumulation in melon and watermelon. We initially show that the APRR2 transcription factor is causative for the qualitative difference between dark and light green rind in both crops. Further analyses establish the link between sequence or expression level variations in the CmAPRR2 gene and pigment content in the rind and flesh of mature melon fruits. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of young fruit rind color in a panel composed of 177 diverse melon accessions did not result in any significant association, leading to an earlier assumption that multiple genes are involved in shaping the overall phenotypic variation in this trait. Through resequencing of 25 representative accessions and allelism tests between light rind accessions, we show that multiple independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CmAPRR2 gene are causative of the light rind phenotype. The multi-haplotypic nature of this gene explains the lack of detection power obtained through genotyping by sequencing-based GWAS and confirms the pivotal role of this gene in shaping fruit color variation in melon. This study demonstrates the power of combining bi- and multi-allelic designs with deep sequencing, to resolve lack of power due to high haplotypic diversity and low allele frequencies. Due to its central role and broad effect on pigment accumulation in fruits, the APRR2 gene is an attractive target for carotenoid bio-fortification of cucurbit crops."

During static experiments, absolute crank torque measurements were used to estimate thigh muscle strengths in response to maximum FES intensities of 70 mA, 105 mA, and 140 mA at fixed crank positions on an FES-LCE. During dynamic experiments, changes in power output measurements were used to classify rider performance as 'Fatigue' or 'No Fatigue' during short-duration FES-LCE at maximum stimulation intensities of 70 mA, 105 mA, and 140 mA and flywheel resistance levels of 0/8th, 1/8th, and 2/8th kilopounds. A Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model was developed to classify static offline muscle strength observations with online rider performances. PAC's discriminatory power was compared with logistic regression (LR), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and an artificial neural network (ANN) model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PAC and ANN learning models correctly identified 100% of the training examples.

Although PAC did not perform best during cross-validation, this model has many advantages over the other methods. PAC can adapt to changes in classification schemes and is more amenable to theoretical analyses than the other methods. PAC learning has an intuitive design and may be a practical choice for classifying muscle strength profiles with well-defined performance criteria."

In the last years, researchers as well as companies have been increasingly investigating wearable devices for fitness applications with the aim of improving user's health, in terms of cardiovascular benefits, loss of weight or muscle strength. Dedicated GPS devices, accelerometers, step counters and heart rate monitors are already commercially available, but they are usually very limited in terms of user interaction and artificial intelligence capabilities. This significantly limits the training and motivation support provided by current systems, making them poorly suited for untrained people who are more interested in fitness for health rather than competitive purposes. To better train and motivate users, we propose the mobile personal trainer (MOPET) system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and material:\n        \n      \n      MOPET is a wearable system that supervises a physical fitness activity based on alternating jogging and fitness exercises in outdoor environments. By exploiting real-time data coming from sensors, knowledge elicited from a sport physiologist and a professional trainer, and a user model that is built and periodically updated through a guided autotest, MOPET can provide motivation as well as safety and health advice, adapted to the user and the context. To better interact with the user, MOPET also displays a 3D embodied agent that speaks, suggests stretching or strengthening exercises according to user's current condition, and demonstrates how to correctly perform exercises with interactive 3D animations.\n    \n\n\n          Results and conclusion:\n        \n      \n      By describing MOPET, we show how context-aware and user-adaptive techniques can be applied to the fitness domain.

Such traits can influence the ability to self, and the timing at which selfing occurs, which in turn affects the costs of selfing. Species that display variation in autonomous selfing provide an opportunity to dissect the phenotypic changes that contribute to variability in the mating system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a common garden, we measured dichogamy and herkogamy in 24 populations of the protandrous mixed-mating herb Campanula americana, and related these to autonomous fruit set (autonomy). We then measured the timing of self-pollen deposition and fruit production in populations with high and low autonomy, and determined whether pollen germinability across floral development contributes to variation in autonomy.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Populations that transitioned more rapidly to female phase displayed elevated autonomous selfing, but herkogamy was unassociated with autonomous selfing. Selfing occurred more rapidly in highly autonomous populations because of greater self-pollen deposition early in female phase. Pollen germinability in low-autonomy populations remained constant across floral development, but in high-autonomy populations it increased after floral anthesis and was highest near the onset of female phase.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Reduced dichogamy, elevated self-pollen deposition, and higher pollen germination late in male phase contribute to both earlier selfing and greater selfing. These traits vary among populations, likely reflecting past selection on the mating system. While delayed selfing bears fewer fitness costs, the evolution of earlier selfing may be favored if self-pollen availability decreases over floral development."

Since the trunks of Adansonia possess a thick and fire-resistant bark and wildfires occur regularly in its habitat (savannah), we examined with the African Adanonia digitata and the Australian Adansonia gregorii whether the fruit offers protection against high heat typically experienced in wildfires. Heat-resistance tests were conducted by applying a simple heat test based on known temperature and temperature residence times occurring in savannah fires and complemented by tests to reveal the impact of heat on germination since long-term seed dormancy is known for Adansonia. Germination tests with acid treated and heat treated seeds were performed to establish if heat also increased germination rate as effectively as acid treatments have been found to do. Heat was found to increase germination rate, but not as effectively as treatment with acid, therefore fruits exposed to high temperatures experienced in wildfires may have a better chance of germination than fruits that were not exposed to wildfires. The ability of the investigated fruits to protect seeds from high temperatures suggests that wildfires may have played a role in the evolution of the hard-shell structure typically found in Adansonia."

Furthermore, the level of LBP may vary at different times of the day. However, the role of the time-sequence property of sitting behavior in relation to LBP has not been considered. During the dynamic sitting, small changes, such as slight or big sways, have been identified. Therefore, it is possible to identify the motif consisting of such changes, which may be associated with the incidence, exacerbation, or improvement of LBP. Method: Office chairs installed with pressure sensors were provided to a total of 22 office workers (age = 43.4 ± 8.3 years) in Japan. Pressure sensors data were collected during working days and hours (from morning to evening). The participants were asked to answer subjective levels of pain including LBP. Center of pressure (COP) was calculated from the load level, the changes in COP were analyzed by applying the Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering (TICC) analysis, COP changes were categorized into several states. Based on the states, common motifs were identified as a recurring sitting behavior pattern combination of different states by motif-aware state assignment (MASA). Finally, the identified motif was tested as a feature to infer the changing levels of LBP within a day. Changes in the levels of LBP from morning to evening were categorized as exacerbated, did not change, or improved based on the survey questions. Here, we present a novel approach based on social spider algorithm (SSA) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the prediction of LBP. The specificity and sensitivity of the LBP inference were compared among ten different models, including SSA-PNN. Result: There exists a common motif, consisting of stable sitting and slight sway. When LBP level improved toward the evening, the frequency of motif appearance was higher than when LBP was exacerbated (p < 0.05) or the level did not change. The performance of the SSA-PNN optimization was better than that of the other algorithms. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 59.20, 72.46, 40.94, and 63.24%, respectively. Conclusion: A lower frequency of a common motif of the COP dynamic changes characterized by stable sitting and slight sway was found to be associated with the exacerbation of LBP in the evening. LBP exacerbation is predictable by AI-based analysis of COP changes during the sitting behavior of the office workers."

We investigated the contribution of motor unit (MU) behavior and muscle size to submaximal force production in chronically strength-trained athletes (ST) versus untrained controls (UT). Sixteen ST (age: 22.9 ± 3.5 yr; training experience: 5.9 ± 3.5 yr) and 14 UT (age: 20.4 ± 2.3 yr) performed maximal voluntary isometric force (MViF) and ramp contractions (at 15%, 35%, 50%, and 70% MViF) with elbow flexors, whilst high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was recorded from the biceps brachii (BB). Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and discharge rates (DRs) of MUs identified from the submaximal contractions were assessed. The neural drive-to-muscle gain was estimated from the relation between changes in force (ΔFORCE, i.e. muscle output) relative to changes in MU DR (ΔDR, i.e. neural input). BB maximum anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSAMAX) was also assessed by MRI. MViF (+64.8% vs. UT, P < 0.001) and BB ACSAMAX (+71.9%, P < 0.001) were higher in ST. Absolute MU RT was higher in ST (+62.6%, P < 0.001), but occurred at similar normalized forces. MU DR did not differ between groups at the same normalized forces. The absolute slope of the ΔFORCE - ΔDR relationship was higher in ST (+66.9%, P = 0.002), whereas it did not differ for normalized values. We observed similar MU behavior between ST athletes and UT controls. The greater absolute force-generating capacity of ST for the same neural input demonstrates that morphological, rather than neural, factors are the predominant mechanism for their enhanced force generation during submaximal efforts.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we observed that recruitment strategies and discharge characteristics of large populations of motor units identified from biceps brachii of strength-trained athletes were similar to those observed in untrained individuals during submaximal force tasks. We also found that for the same neural input, strength-trained athletes are able to produce greater absolute muscle forces (i.e., neural drive-to-muscle gain). This demonstrates that morphological factors are the predominant mechanism for the enhanced force generation during submaximal efforts."

In this paper, a novel framework is presented for reconstructing the 3-D model of the human body from a sequence of RGB-D frames. The reconstruction is performed in real time while the human subject moves arbitrarily in front of the camera. The method employs a novel parameterization of cylindrical-type objects using Cartesian tensor and b-spline bases along the radial and longitudinal dimension respectively. The proposed model, dubbed tensor body, is fitted to the input data using a multistep framework that involves segmentation of the different body regions, robust filtering of the data via a dynamic histogram, and energy-based optimization with positive-definite constraints. A Riemannian metric on the space of positive-definite tensor splines is analytically defined and employed in this framework.

In this review, we briefly explain the life cycle and reproduction strategies of different geophytes and what is known about the physiological aspects related to these processes. Subsequently, an in-depth overview is provided of the molecular and genetic pathways driving these processes. In the evolution of plants, the PEBP gene family has expanded, followed by neo- and subfunctionalization. Careful characterization revealed that differential expression and differential protein complex formation provide the members of this gene family with unique functions, enabling them to mediate the crosstalk between the two reproductive events in geophytes in response to environmental and endogenous cues.

One criticism of this test is that it is somewhat subjective. Our objective is to explore the reliability of this technique and its association with sleep-disordered breathing.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Prospective study performed in an academic tertiary care center.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An analysis of MM scores from 180 consecutive patients obtained independently by two examiners was completed. These scores were compared with each other and with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) obtained from polysomnographic studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Collapse of the soft palate (PAL), lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW), and base of the tongue (BOT) was rated on a five-point scale (0-4). The mean scores determined by the faculty examiner were 2.47, 2.06, and 1.58, respectively; the mean scores determined by the resident examiner were 2.34, 2.25, and 1.48, respectively. The scores of the two examiners correlated to within +/- 1 unit 83.9% of the time at the PAL, 91.1% at the LPW, and 85.0% at the BOT. The degree of correlation was not influenced by year of training of the resident. When the AHI was converted to a four-point scale based on severity, the score correlated within +/- 1 of the average MM score 72.1% of the time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite the subjective nature of the MM, the five-point scale can be used by independent examiners to achieve an evaluation of the upper airway that is reproducible. The preoperative severity of sleep-disordered breathing based on the AHI is moderately correlated with the MM score."

            "abstract": "Understanding of product-soft tissue interface and related discomfort is essential while designing wearable devices. Although pressure thresholds at the perception of discomfort and pain have been measured in the past, associated tissue deformation is yet to be studied. This data can provide a holistic understanding of user discomfort and be a valuable reference for ergonomic product design. Hence, in the current study, tissue deformation at discomfort and pain threshold was measured using an ultrasound indentation device at 18 landmarks for 83 Chinese adults on the head and face. Results show that deformation was higher in the facial region than the scalp and forehead, with maximum deformation in the cheek area and minimum in the forehead region for both thresholds. Also, for most landmarks, the tissue deformation data showed no significant relationship with age and Body Mass Index (BMI). Nearly half of the landmarks exhibited significant gender-based differences. Overall, the measured data showed acceptable within-session and between-session reliability. Practitioner Summary: In this study, tissue deformation was measured in different head regions for discomfort and pain thresholds, and corresponding deformation maps were developed. Measured tissue deformation data showed no significant relationship with BMI and age. This data can be a useful reference in the design, testing, and evaluation of headgears."

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that being overweight may provide an advantage with respect to mortality in older people, although this has not been investigated fully. Therefore, to confirm that and elucidate the underlying mechanism, we investigated mortality in older people using explainable artificial intelligence (AI) with the gradient-boosting algorithm XGboost. Baseline body mass indexes (BMIs) of 5699 people (79.3 ± 3.9 years) were evaluated to determine the relationship with all-cause mortality over eight years. In the unadjusted model, the first negative (protective) BMI range for mortality was 25.9−28.4 kg/m2. However, in the adjusted cross-validation model, this range was 22.7−23.6 kg/m2; the second and third negative BMI ranges were then 25.8−28.2 and 24.6−25.8 kg/m2, respectively. Conversely, the first advancing BMI range was 12.8−18.7 kg/m2, which did not vary across conditions with high feature importance. Actual and predicted mortality rates in participants aged <90 years showed a negative-linear or L-shaped relationship with BMI, whereas predicted mortality rates in men aged ≥90 years showed a blunt U-shaped relationship. In conclusion, AI predicted that being overweight may not be an optimal condition with regard to all-cause mortality in older adults. Instead, it may be that a high normal weight is optimal, though this may vary according to the age and sex."

            "abstract": "In the last decade, great progress has been made in clarifying the main determinants of anthocyanin accumulation in grape berry skin. However, the molecular details of the fine variation among cultivars, which ultimately contributes to wine typicity, are still not completely understood. To shed light on this issue, the grapes of 170 F1 progeny from the cross 'Syrah'×'Pinot Noir' were characterized at the mature stage for the content of 15 anthocyanins during four growing seasons. This huge data set was used in combination with a dense genetic map to detect genomic regions controlling the anthocyanin pathway both at key enzymatic points and at particular branches. Genes putatively involved in fine tuning the global regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis were identified by exploring the gene predictions in the QTL (quantitative trait locus) confidence intervals and their expression profile during berry development in offspring with contrasting anthocyanin accumulation. New information on some aspects which had scarcely been investigated so far, such as anthocyanin transport into the vacuole, or completely neglected, such as acylation, is provided. These genes represent a valuable resource in grapevine molecular-based breeding programmes to improve both fruit and wine quality and to tailor wine sensory properties according to consumer demand."

Developing a reproducible PI model using clinical information is important as it would reflect the actual clinical setting and improve the effectiveness of TEAM treatment. In this paper, we suggest a novel deep learning-based PI model with feature extraction using a deep autoencoder and k-means clustering through a cross-sectional study of sleep disturbance patient data. The data were obtained from an anonymous electronic survey in the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) members from August 16, 2021, to September 20, 2021. The survey instrument consisted of six sections: demographics, medical history, military duty, sleep-related assessments (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Berlin questionnaire, and sleeping environment), diet/nutrition-related assessments [dietary habit survey questionnaire and nutrition quotient (NQ)], and gastrointestinal-related assessments [gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) and Bristol stool scale]. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a deep autoencoder were used to extract features, which were then clustered using the k-means clustering method. The Calinski-Harabasz index, silhouette coefficient, and within-cluster sum of squares were used for internal cluster validation and the final PSQI, Berlin questionnaire, GSRS, and NQ scores were used for external cluster validation. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test and chi-squared test were used for between-cluster comparisons. Among 4,869 survey responders, 2,579 patients with sleep disturbances were obtained after filtering using a PSQI score of >5. When comparing clustering performance using raw data and extracted features by PCA and the deep autoencoder, the best feature extraction method for clustering was the deep autoencoder (16 nodes for the first and third hidden layers, and two nodes for the second hidden layer). Our model could cluster three different PI types because the optimal number of clusters was determined to be three via the elbow method. After external cluster validation, three PI types were differentiated by changes in sleep quality, dietary habits, and concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms. This model may be applied to the development of artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems through electronic medical records and clinical trial protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of TEAM treatment."

After 5 h exposure to high solar irradiance, either with or without ultraviolet (UV) radiation, surface colour changes, pigment composition, photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant metabolites and enzyme activities, and selected flavonoids and antioxidant proteins in exocarp tissue were evaluated. The imposed photo-oxidative stress reproduced the symptoms observed on attached fruit. Both high temperature and solar irradiance caused fruit surface discoloration with faster degradation of chlorophyll (Chl) than carotenoids (Car), leading to an increase in the Car/Chl ratio. Surface bleaching was mostly caused by visible light, whereas elevated temperatures were mostly responsible for the inactivation of photosynthesis, measured as decreased F(v)/F(m). Ascorbate, glutathione, and total soluble protein concentrations decreased in the exocarp as the duration of exposure increased. Specific activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase increased with exposure, suggesting that these proteins were conserved during the imposed stress. GR protein expression remained stable during the imposed stress, whereas, MDHAR protein expression increased. Quercetin and kaempferol concentrations increased rapidly upon exposure, but not to UV radiation, suggesting rapid photo-protection in response to visible light; however, naringenin synthesis was not induced.

In three sets of experiments, we (1) partition the sources of seed-size variance in Lobelia inflata into components attributable to fruit size, relative fruit position, and parental identity; (2) examine the influence of pregermination conditions and seed size on time to germination; and (3) assess the fitness consequences of seed size and germination timing under seminatural, harsh conditions. Seed-size variance is attributable to both parental identity and fruit position within an individual. Distal fruits produce larger but fewer seeds. No significant correlation exists between fruit size and seed size, but a trade-off is found between the number and size of seeds contained in a fruit after correcting for fruit size. The timing of germination is influenced by seed size, light conditions before winter, and winter duration. Germination timing influences survival, and despite small seed size in this species (2 × 10 g/seed), seed size has a persistent and significant association with both final plant size and the probability of survival to autumn."

In order to study the genetic control of this characteristic, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed from an intraspecific cross between a cherry tomato line with a good overall aroma intensity and an inbred line with medium flavour but bigger fruits. A total of 38 traits involved in organoleptic quality were evaluated. Physical traits included fruit weight, diameter, colour, firmness, and elasticity. Chemical traits were dry matter weight, titratable acidity, pH, and the contents of soluble solids, sugars, lycopene, carotene, and 12 aroma volatiles. A panel of trained assessors quantified sensory attributes: flavour (sweetness and sourness), aroma (overall aroma intensity, together with candy, lemon, citrus fruit, and pharmaceutical aromas) and texture (firmness, meltiness, mealiness, juiciness, and skin difficult to swallow). RILs showed a large range of variation. Molecular markers were used to map a total of 130 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the 38 traits. They were mainly distributed in a few chromosome regions. Major QTLs (R(2) >30%) were detected for fruit weight, diameter, colour, firmness, meltiness, and for six aroma volatiles. The relationships between instrumental measures and sensory traits were analysed with regard to the QTL map. A special insight was provided about the few regions where QTLs are related to multiple traits. A few examples are shown to illustrate how the simultaneous analysis of QTL segregation for related traits may aid in understanding the genetic control of quality traits and pave the way towards QTL characterization."

            "abstract": "Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome-a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases."

Taking AI-powered Smart TV (AI TV) as a typical research object, this study (1) develops a theoretical model by integrating the technology acceptance model with users' smart service belief factors and (2) employs the user experience type as an original moderator. Using data from 585 AI TV users, the structural equation modeling analysis suggests that perceived two-way communication, perceived personalization, and perceived co-creation as three belief factors, are important antecedent constructs in the extended technology acceptance model. The analysis also suggests that the user experience type exerts positive moderating effects on two-way communication and personalization to attitude toward behavior and purchase intention. This study thus contributes to the literature on smart service by identifying and studying smart service belief factors. The addition of smart service belief factors as antecedents, as well as user experience type as a moderator, are crucial to expand the generalizability of TAM to the smart media service context.

The suitability of the method is tested in gene circuit reconstruction experiments, varying the network dimension and/or characteristics, the amount of gene expression data used for inference and the noise level present in expression profiles. The reconstruction method inferred the network topology and the regulatory parameters with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance is limited to the amount of expression data used and the noise level present in the data. The proposed fitness function has been found more suitable for identifying correct network topology and for estimating the accurate parameter values compared to the existing ones.

The previous season's cumulated foliar damage had the largest impact on reproductive characters, in particular a negative effect on the numbers of inflorescences, flowers and pollen grains, indirectly affecting the numbers of infructescences and fruits, and a positive one on the amount of foliar damage during flowering.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For perennial and proleptic species, the dynamics of resource acquisition and allocation patterns for reproduction promote and extend the effects of herbivore damage to longer periods than a single reproductive event and growing season, through the interactions among different components of female and male fitness."

            "abstract": "The identification of different meat cuts for labeling and quality control on production lines is still largely a manual process. As a result, it is a labor-intensive exercise with the potential for not only error but also bacterial cross-contamination. Artificial intelligence is used in many disciplines to identify objects within images, but these approaches usually require a considerable volume of images for training and validation. The objective of this study was to identify five different meat cuts from images and weights collected by a trained operator within the working environment of a commercial Irish beef plant. Individual cut images and weights from 7,987 meats cuts extracted from semimembranosus muscles (i.e., Topside muscle), post editing, were available. A variety of classical neural networks and a novel Ensemble machine learning approaches were then tasked with identifying each individual meat cut; performance of the approaches was dictated by accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions), precision (the ratio of correctly predicted objects relative to the number of objects identified as positive), and recall (also known as true positive rate or sensitivity). A novel Ensemble approach outperformed a selection of the classical neural networks including convolutional neural network and residual network. The accuracy, precision, and recall for the novel Ensemble method were 99.13%, 99.00%, and 98.00%, respectively, while that of the next best method were 98.00%, 98.00%, and 95.00%, respectively. The Ensemble approach, which requires relatively few gold-standard measures, can readily be deployed under normal abattoir conditions; the strategy could also be evaluated in the cuts from other primals or indeed other species."

Oral administration of B. wexlerae to mice induce metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory effects that decrease both high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. The beneficial effects of B. wexlerae are correlated with unique amino-acid metabolism to produce S-adenosylmethionine, acetylcholine, and L-ornithine and carbohydrate metabolism resulting in the accumulation of amylopectin and production of succinate, lactate, and acetate, with simultaneous modification of the gut bacterial composition.

In this study, we compared these variables and fruit yield for two shrub species, Vaccinium angustifolium and Vaccinium myrtilloides, to test the hypothesis that phenology is linked to the plants' allometric traits, which are predictors of fruit production.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We measured leaf and flower phenology and the above-ground biomass of both Vaccinium species in a commercial wild lowbush blueberry field (Quebec, Canada) over a 2-year crop cycle; 1 year of pruning followed by 1 year of harvest. Leaf and flower phenology were measured, and the allometric traits of shoots and buds were monitored over the crop cycle.

This difference was related to the allometric characteristics of the buds due to differences in carbon partitioning by the plants during the pruning year. Through structural equation modelling, we identified that the earlier leafing in V. angustifolium was related to a lower leaf bud number, while earlier flowering was linked to a lower number of flowers per bud. Despite differences in reproductive allometric traits, vegetative biomass still determined reproductive biomass in a log-log scale model.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Growing buds are competing sinks for non-structural carbohydrates. Their differences in both number and characteristics (e.g. number of flowers per bud) influence levels of fruit production and explain some of the phenological differences observed between the two Vaccinium species.

            "abstract": "Millions of people worldwide engage in online role-playing with their avatar, a virtual agent that represents the self. Previous behavioral studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar, gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills. The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar, and familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe, a region associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one's bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, suggesting relatively greater emotional self-involvement with one's avatar. Post-scanning behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with play duration. These findings significantly advance our knowledge about the brain's plasticity to self-identify with virtual agents and the human cognitive-affective potential to live and learn in virtual worlds."

Participants were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development, 3rd edition (TGMD-3), Victorian Fundamental Movement skills manual, and the balance subtest from the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2 (BOT-2). Independent sample t-tests and a one way between groups ANOVA with planned comparisons were used analyse sex and age differences. Mastery or near mastery of skills ranged from 16% for overhand throw, to 75.3% for run. Girls scored significantly higher than boys in the locomotor and balance subtests with the boys outperforming the girls in object control skills. Improvements in ability can be seen over time (F(8,1968) = 70.18, p < 0.001), with significant increases in FMS proficiency seen up to the age of 10, after which proficiency begins to decline.

The model achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.90 when tested against expert manual segmentations on 25 image sets. Tested on 1400 image sets, the model successfully segmented 99.4% of the cases. Automatic imputation of missing EAT volumes had an error of less than 3.1% with up to 20% of the slices in image sets missing. The most important predictors of EAT volumes were weight and waist, while EAT attenuation was predicted mainly by EAT volume. A model with excellent performance, capable of fully automatic handling of the most common challenges in large scale EAT quantification has been developed.

In gynodioecious species, in which hermaphroditic and female plants coexist, a variety of factors (e.g., hermaphrodite self-fertility or rarity or pollinator discrimination against females) might be expected to lead to stronger pollen limitation in females than in hermaphrodites. On the other hand, females have been found to be superior compared to hermaphrodites in low-nutrient conditions. The effects of supplemental hand-pollination and resource addition on the reproductive output of the self-fertile gynodioecious perennial Geranium sylvaticum (Geraniaceae) were tested for several populations that differ in their female frequency (4.4-23.0%). Both pollen and resource availability limited fruit set and the number of seeds produced per plant; however, seed set (i.e., the number of seeds produced per fruit) was limited only by resources. Because pollen limitation in females did not correlate with female frequency, our results suggest that pollen limitation in females does not depend on the frequency of the pollen-producing hermaphrodites. Furthermore, because pollen and resource availability limited reproductive output of both sex morphs, these factors may not contribute significantly to maintenance and evolution of gynodioecy in G. sylvaticum."

The last step in their biosynthesis involves an alcohol acyltransferase that catalyses the esterification of an acyl moiety of acyl-CoA with an alcohol. This study identified a novel strawberry alcohol acyltransferase gene (FaAAT2) whose expression pattern during fruit receptacle growth and ripening is in accordance with the production of esters throughout strawberry fruit ripening. The full-length FaAAT2 cDNA was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was analysed with acyl-CoA and alcohol substrates. The semi-purified FaAAT2 enzyme had activity with C1-C8 straight-chain alcohols and aromatic alcohols in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Cinnamyl alcohol was the most efficient acyl acceptor. When FaAAT2 expression was transiently downregulated in the fruit receptacle by agroinfiltration, the volatile ester production was significantly reduced in strawberry fruit. The results suggest that FaAAT2 plays a significant role in the production of esters that contribute to the final strawberry fruit flavour."

Genotype study was performed in 151 healthy individuals, who were anonymized and randomly selected from the TALAVERA study. The decision tree analysis was performed using the R package rpart.

The participant group consisted of 78 men and 73 women, who 100 individuals showed body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 and 51 BMI < 25 kg/m2. Chi-square analysis revealed that individuals with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 showed higher frequency of the allelic variation Ala67Ala in AgRP rs5030980 with respect to those with BMI <25 kg/m2. However, the variant Thr67Ala in AgRP rs5030980 was the most frequently found in individuals with BMI <25 kg/m2. There were no statistical differences in the other analyzed SNPs. Decision tree learning revealed that carriers of the allelic variants AgRP (rs5030980) Ala67Ala, ADRB2 (rs1042714) Gln27Glu or Glu27Glu, INSIG2 (rs7566605) 73 + 9802 with CC or GG genotypes and PPARG (rs1801282) with the allelic variants of Ala12Ala or Pro12Pro, will most likely develop overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2).

            "abstract": "beta-galactosidases have been detected in a wide range of plants and are characterized by their ability to hydrolyse terminal non-reducing beta-D-galactosyl residues from beta-D-galactosides. These enzymes have been detected in a wide range of plant organs and tissues. In a search for differentially expressed genes during the abscission process in citrus, sequences encoding beta-galactosidase were identified. Three cDNA fragments of a beta-galactosidase gene were isolated from a cDNA subtraction library constructed from mature fruit abscission zones 48 h after the application of a mature fruit-specific abscission agent, 5-chloro-3-methyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole (CMN-pyrazole). Based on sequence information derived from these fragments, a full-length cDNA of 2847 nucleotides (GenBank accession number AY029198) encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated from mature fruit abscission zones by 5'- and 3'-RACE approaches. The beta-galactosidase cDNA encoded a protein of 737 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 82 kDa. The deduced protein was highly homologous to plant beta-galactosidases expressed in fruit ripening. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that at least two closely related beta-galactosidase genes were present in 'Valencia' orange. Temporal expression patterns in mature fruit abscission zones indicated beta-galactosidase mRNA was detected 48 h after treatment of CMN-pyrazole and ethephon in mature fruit abscission zones. beta-galactosidase transcripts were detected in leaf abscission zones only after ethephon application. The citrus beta-galactosidase was expressed in stamens and petals of fully opened flowers and young fruitlets. The results suggest that this beta-galactosidase may play a role during abscission as well as early growth and development processes in flowers and fruitlets."

The aim of this study was to find associations between individual lifestyle factors, which may contribute to cognitive impairment (CI) in people with SMCs and to conduct a literature review on the relationship between internet use and CI in subjects over 50 years old, as a related factor. This was a case-controlled study that included 497 subjects aged over 50 years with SMCs who were recruited from 19 community pharmacies. Three screening tests were used to detect possible CIs, and individuals with at least one test result compatible with a CI were referred to primary care for evaluation. Having self-referred SMC increased the odds of obtaining scores compatible with CI and this factor was significantly related to having feelings of depression (OR = 2.24, 95% CI [1.34, 3.90]), taking anxiolytics or antidepressants (OR = 1.93, 95% CI [1.23, 3.05]), and being female (OR = 1.83, 95% CI [1.15, 2.88]). Thirty percent of our sample obtained scores compatible with CI. Age over 70 years increased the odds of obtaining scores compatible with CI. A high-level education, reading, and daily internet use were factors associated with a reduced risk of positive scores compatible with CI (37-91%, 7-18%, and 67-86%, respectively), while one extra hour television per day increased the risk by 8-30%. Among others, modifiable lifestyle factors such as reading, and daily internet usage may slow down cognitive decline in patients over 50 with SMCs. Four longitudinal studies and one quasi-experimental study found internet use to be beneficial against CI in patients over 50 years of age."

            "abstract": "Ecological theories suggest that environmental, social, and individual factors interact to cause obesity. Yet, many analytic techniques, such as multilevel modeling, require manual specification of interacting factors, making them inept in their ability to search for interactions. This paper shows evidence that an explainable artificial intelligence approach, commonly employed in genomics research, can address this problem. The method entails using random intersection trees to decode interactions learned by random forest models. Here, this approach is used to extract interactions between features of a multi-level environment from random forest models of waist-to-height ratios using 11,112 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. This study shows that methods used to discover interactions between genes can also discover interacting features of the environment that impact obesity. This new approach to modeling ecosystems may help shine a spotlight on combinations of environmental features that are important to obesity, as well as other health outcomes."

It does not aim for the support of solutions of producing enough or more food for increasing population (sustainable nutrition), neither does it contradict other similar concepts [sustainable nutrition security, nutritional life cycle assessment (LCA)]. However, it calls for more definite estimation of the carrying capacity of the environment on personal, local, and national levels for the development of more efficient solutions of nutrition balanced in the limits of environmental carrying capacity.

Using wearable devices for fall detection has a high cost and may cause inconvenience to the daily lives of the elderly. In this paper, we present an automated fall detection approach that requires only a low-cost depth camera. Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects. Experimenting with the dataset shows that our approach can achieve up to 91.15% sensitivity, 77.14% specificity, and 86.83% accuracy. On a public dataset, our approach performs comparably to state-of-the-art fall detection methods that need multiple cameras."

Then, in the inner loop control, a sliding mode iterative learning controller (SMILC) based on the variable boundary saturation function was designed to achieve the tracking of the reference trajectory. The experiment results showed that, in the designed dual closed loop control strategy, a variable impedance controller can effectively reduce trajectory tracking errors and adaptively modify the reference trajectory synchronizing with the motion intention of patients; the designed sliding mode iterative learning controller can effectively reduce chattering in sliding mode control and excellently achieve the tracking of rehabilitation robot's reference trajectory.

In this paper we screened for naturally-occurring xylose utilizing oleaginous yeasts as cell factories for lipid production, since pentose sugar catabolism plays a major role in efficient utilization of lignocellulosic feedstocks. Glycerol utilization, which is also beneficial in yeast-based oil production as glycerol is a common by-product of biodiesel production, was investigated as well.

For such highly flexible length sequences, fixed length generation using copy padding introduces a significant level of bias which makes a large number of lncRNA sequences very much identical to each other and eventually derail classifier generalizeability. Empirical evaluation reveals that within 50 residues of only the starting region of long lncRNA sequences, a highly informative distribution for lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction is contained, a crucial finding exploited by the proposed BoT-Net approach to optimize the lncRNA fixed length generation process.\n    \n\n\n          Availability:\n        \n      \n      BoT-Net web server can be accessed at https://sds_genetic_analysis.opendfki.de/lncmiRNA/."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between different levels of health-related physical fitness measurements and obesity status in Taiwanese adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the National Physical Fitness Survey in Taiwan (HPFSIT) database. Responses from 60,056 participants, aged 23-64 years from the database were collected in the present study. Data from a standardized structured questionnaire and health-related physical fitness tests were analyzed. The quartiles of each physical fitness measurement were used for unconditional logistic regression analyses. Our results indicated clear trends in the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and overweight/obesity. Overweight and obesity were associated with a 10% to 60% increased risk of low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in men and a 10% to almost 30% increased risk in women. However, the association between muscle strength/endurance and obesity status as well as flexibility and obesity status needs further investigation."

Incidence of a AAA (defined as 3 cm diameter) was calculated as a function of age and body mass index (BMI) of greater than or less than a BMI 25 for various patient groups. Age was grouped into one of three categories in 15-year intervals (35-50 years, 50-65 years, and 65 to 80 years). Most patients were Caucasian (n = 8575) and the largest group of patients with a AAA was the Caucasian male (198 of 279 total detected AAAs). A machine learning algorithm was written, with learning inputs from the acquired patient database. Of all groups, Caucasian males were found to have the highest incidence of AAA, with males in general higher than females. Smoking within the past two years was highly associated with AAA incidence, and a past history of smoking to a lesser extent. The incidence of AAA increased with age. When dividing groups into two cohorts by a BMI of 25, generally middle-aged patients with a BMI > 25 had a higher incidence of a AAA. However, in general, the older age group with a BMI < 25 had a higher incidence of AAA. The addition of machine learning allows one to note the effect of an input keeping other input parameters constant. This helps identify a parameter that may be an independent predictor of a particular outcome. When using BMI as the single changing input, an increasing BMI was associated with an increased probability of a AAA, most significantly in middle-aged patients, and then narrowing to similar probabilities in older age. This AAA screening program is ongoing. As data continues to be collected with particularly those patient groups presently underrepresented, questions as to an association of AAA with BMI as a function of age, and also an improvement in machine learning algorithm accuracy for various patient populations will continue."

First, related literature is studied to understand the physical education system of college students. Then, the current situation of physical exercise of college students is investigated through the interview survey, and the mathematical statistics method is used to analyze the survey results. Moreover, the necessity and paths to carry out health education are discussed through the analysis of the physical exercise behavior of college students. Finally, the college smart sports classroom (SSC) is constructed using AI and the big data analysis method. The experimental results indicate that more than 50% of college students can actively participate in physical exercise. Besides, boys are more likely to take dangerous coping behaviors, while girls are more prone to choose to resist coping behaviors. In addition, there is little difference in age of the distribution of different coping behaviors in physical exercise. Freshmen are more inclined to take risky coping behaviors, and the quantity of students taking resistant coping behaviors increases with the increase of grades. Therefore, relevant physical health education for college students can promote the good habit of health exercise. This study can provide a reliable experimental basis for the development of sports education in the future."

            "abstract": "Although autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis plays an important role in the ripening of climacteric fruits, our knowledge of the network that promotes it remains limited. We identified white fruit (wf), a tomato mutant that produces immature fruit that are white and that ripen slowly. We found that an inversion on chromosome 10 disrupts the LUTESCENT2 (L2) gene, and that white fruit is allelic to lutescent2. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we knocked out L2 in wild type tomato and found that the l2-cr mutants produced phenotypes that were very similar to white fruit (lutescent2). In the l2-cr fruit, chloroplast development was impaired and the accumulation of carotenoids and lycopene occurred more slowly than in wild type. During fruit ripening in l2-cr mutants, the peak of ethylene release was delayed, less ethylene was produced, and the expression of ACO genes was significantly suppressed. We also found that exogenous ethylene induces the expression of L2 and that ERF.B3, an ethylene response factor, binds to the promoter of the L2 gene and activates its transcription. Thus, the expression of L2 is regulated by exogenous ethylene. Taken together, our results indicate that ethylene may affect the expression of L2 gene and that L2 participates in autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis during tomato fruit ripening."

            "abstract": "Application of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data enables reconstruction and classification of cognitive status from brain activity. However, previous studies using MVPA have extracted information about cognitive status that is experienced simultaneously with fMRI scanning, but not one that will be observed after the scanning. In this study, by focusing on activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), we demonstrate that MVPA on fMRI data is capable of predicting subsequent recognition performance. In this experiment, six runs of fMRI signals were acquired during encoding of phonogram stimuli. In the analysis, using data acquired in runs 1-3, we first conducted MVPA-based voxel-wise search for the clusters in the MTL whose signals contained the most information about subsequent recognition performance. Next, using the fMRI signals acquired in runs 1-3 from the selected clusters, we trained a classifier function in MVPA. Finally, the trained classifier function was applied to fMRI signals acquired in runs 4-6. Consequently, we succeeded in predicting the subsequent recognition performance for stimuli studied in runs 4-6 with significant accuracy. This accurate prediction suggests that MVPA can extract information that is associated not only with concurrent cognitive status, but also with behavior in the near future."

Identical symptoms were observed on many trees in fields interplanted with other crops and in home gardens on two of the five islands of American Samoa. A Phytophthora sp. was consistently isolated on water agar from symptomatic stems, fruits, and roots. The fungus was grown in pure culture on V8 juice medium at 25°C under continuous fluorescent illumination, and was identified, on the basis of spherical to broadly ovoid (34 to 67 × 40 to 50 µm), intercalary to terminal sporangia, chlamydospores (20 × 40 µm), and uniform to uneven hyphae (5 to 7 µm wide), as Phytophthora nicotianae Breda de Haan (= P. parasitica Dastur) (1,2). Ten 4-week old papaya seedlings grown on pasteurized soil in 15-cm pots were inoculated with a 2-ml suspension of 100 sporangia per ml in sterile water applied to the soil surface. Six uninoculated plants were used as controls. Two mature fruit that had reached the climacteric point were inoculated with 200 µl of sterile water containing approximately 20 sporangia. Inoculum was placed inside a 1-cm-diameter rubber circle that had been attached to the surface of the fruit to prevent run-off. Two uninoculated fruits served as controls. Inoculations of seedlings and fruit were conducted three times. Wilting symptoms developed on inoculated plants in less than 5 days and plant death accompanied by crown rot occurred in 14 days. Inoculated fruit developed lesions covered with a whitish fungal growth within 10 days after inoculation. Plants and fruits exposed to sterile water were healthy. The pathogen was reisolated from the diseased plants and fruits and it was morphologically identical to the original isolate, confirming its role as the causative agent of the disease. The wide distribution of diseased plants over an estimated one-quarter of the area of the island of Tutuila (approximately 24 sq. km) and on the adjacent island of Ofu indicates that the disease was not of recent introduction.

The prevalence of obesity continues to rise and this places a huge economic burden on the healthcare system. Existing approaches to obesity treatment tend to focus on individual responsibility and diet and exercise, failing to recognise the complexity of the condition and the need for a whole-system approach. A new approach is needed that recognises the complexity of obesity and provides patient-centred, multidisciplinary care which more closely meets the needs of each individual with obesity. This review will discuss the role that digital health could play in this new approach and the challenges of ensuring equitable access to digital health for obesity care. Existing technologies, such as telehealth and mobile health apps and wearable devices, offer emerging opportunities to improve access to obesity care and enhance the quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of weight management interventions and long-term patient support. Future application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to obesity care could see interventions become increasingly automated and personalised."

Allelic variation at the amino acid level was confirmed for 37 of these candidates. Furthermore, out of the 127 gene-metabolite co-locations, some 56 were recovered following correlation of parallel transcript and metabolite profiling.

This can be enhanced by a user-centered design to, for example, explore and integrate user preferences for intervention techniques and features.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to examine adult users' preferences for techniques and features in mobile apps for 24-hour movement behaviors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 86 participants (mean age 37.4 years [SD 9.2]; 49/86, 57% female) completed a Web-based survey. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) were based on a validated taxonomy v2 by Abraham and Michie, and engagement features were based on a list extracted from the literature. Behavioral data were collected using Fitbit trackers. Correlations, (repeated measures) analysis of variance, and independent sample t tests were used to examine associations and differences between and within users by the type of health domain and users' behavioral intention and adoption.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Preferences were generally the highest for information on the health consequences of movement behavior self-monitoring, behavioral feedback, insight into healthy lifestyles, and tips and instructions. Although the same ranking was found for techniques across behaviors, preferences were stronger for all but one BCT for PA in comparison to the other two health behaviors. Although techniques fit user preferences for addressing PA well, supplemental techniques may be able to address preferences for sleep and SB in a better manner. In addition to what is commonly included in apps, sleep apps should consider providing tips for sleep. SB apps may wish to include more self-regulation and goal-setting techniques. Few differences were found by users' intentions or adoption to change a particular behavior. Apps should provide more self-monitoring (P=.03), information on behavior health outcome (P=.048), and feedback (P=.04) and incorporate social support (P=.048) to help those who are further removed from healthy sleep. A virtual coach (P<.001) and video modeling (P=.004) may provide appreciated support to those who are physically less active. PA self-monitoring appealed more to those with an intention to change PA (P=.03). Social comparison and support features are not high on users' agenda and may not be needed from an engagement point of view. Engagement features may not be very relevant for user engagement but should be examined in future research with a less reflective method.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this study provide guidance for the design of digital 24-hour movement behavior interventions. As 24-hour movement guidelines are increasingly being adopted in several countries, our study findings are timely to support the design of interventions to meet these guidelines."

            "abstract": "While physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging, a significant proportion of midlife and older adults remain insufficiently active. This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted, community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named \"Carmen\" to deliver interactive, individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses, comparative cost analysis of the two programs, potential mediators of intervention success, and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention.

Therefore, using HMM as probabilistic model to model the health checkup data is considered to be suitable, and HMM can express the process of health condition changes of a person. In this paper, a HMM with six states placed in a 2×3 matrix was prepared. We collected training features including the time-series health checkup data. Each feature consists of eight inspection parameters such as BMI, SBP, and TG. The HMM was then built using the training features. In the experiments, we built five HMMs for different gender and age conditions (e.g. male 50's) using thousands of training feature vectors, respectively. Investigating the HMMs we found that the HMMs can model three health risk levels. The models can also represent health transitions or changes, indicating the possibility of estimating the risk of lifestyle-related diseases."

            "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine the contribution of soccer players' anthropometric features to predict their physical performance. Sixteen players, from a professional youth soccer academy, were recruited. Several anthropometric features such as corrected arm muscle area (AMAcorr), arm muscle circumference (AMC) and right and left suprapatellar girths (RSPG and LSPG) were employed in this study. Players' physical performance was assessed by the change of direction (COD), sprint (10-m and 20-m), and vertical jump (CMJ) tests, and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (Yo-Yo IRT1). Using an extra tree regression (ETR) model, the anthropometric features permitted to accurately predict 10-m sprint, 20-m sprint and Yo-Yo IRTL 1 performance (p < 0.05). ETR showed that upper-body features as AMAcorr, and AMC affected 10-m and 20-m sprint performances, while lower-body features as RSPG and LSPG influenced the Yo-Yo IRTL 1 (Overall Gini importance ≥ 0.22). The model predicting COD and CMJ presented a poor level of prediction, suggesting that other factors, rather than anthropometric features, may concur to predict their changes in performance. These findings demonstrated that the upper- and lower-body anthropometric features are strictly related to sprint and aerobic fitness performance in elite youth soccer."

Although several commercial-grade technologies are available to clinicians for evaluating movement limitations, they require one-on-one time-consuming assessments with limited reproducibility across care settings. To address these limitations, a wearable inertial sensors for exergames (WISE) system has been designed with: (I) an animated virtual coach to deliver instruction and (II) a subject-model whose movements are animated by real-time sensor measurements from the WISE system worn by a subject. This paper examines the WISE system's accuracy and usability for the assessment of upper limb range of motion (ROM).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventeen neurologically intact subjects were recruited to participate in a usability study of the WISE system.

NCCT imaging biomarkers associated with metabolic syndrome in the chest include premature coronary artery calcification, acceleration of large vessel arterial and valvular calcifications associated with atherosclerosis, and pulmonary arterial enlargement from pulmonary hypertension associated with sleep apnea. These easily identified imaging biomarkers have prognostic implications for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These NCCT chest-imaging biomarkers are likely targets for artificial intelligence algorithms to harvest for longitudinal assessment of their individual and multifactorial contributions to chronic disease, MACE, and mortality.

            "abstract": "The synthesis and modification of the cell wall must involve the production of new cell wall polymers and enzymes. Their targeted secretion to the apoplast is one of many potential control points. Since Rab GTPases have been strongly implicated in the regulation of vesicle trafficking, a review of their involvement in cell wall metabolism should throw light on this possibility. Cell wall polymer biosynthesis occurs mainly in the Golgi apparatus, except for cellulose and callose, which are made at the plasma membrane by an enzyme complex that cycles through the endomembrane system and which may be regulated by this cycling. Several systems, including the growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, cell wall softening in fruit, and the development of root nodules, are now being dissected. In these systems, secretion of wall polymers and modifying enzymes has been documented, and Rab GTPases are highly expressed. Reverse genetic experiments have been used to interfere with these GTPases and this is revealing their importance in regulation of trafficking to the wall. The role of the RabA (or Rab11) GTPases is particularly exciting in this respect."

The evolution process results, as in nature, from genetic variation combined with natural selection imposed by the finiteness of the environment. The selection criteria (fitness values) are not imposed, but rather emerge from the interactions of the organisms with each other and with the environment.

            "abstract": "Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology under artificial intelligence algorithm, the postoperative nursing effects of pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation exercise on gastrointestinal tract rectal cancer (RC) patients were investigated. A total of 88 patients receiving RC anus-preserving surgery in hospital were selected. The included patients were divided randomly into the experimental group (44 cases) and the control group (44 cases). Patients in the control group engaged in Kegel motion, while patients in the experimental group underwent self-designed comprehensive pelvic floor training. Anorectum function rating scale and quality of life questionnaire for colorectal cancer (EORTC QLQ-CR29) were utilized to compare and analyze anus functions and living quality of patients in the two groups. Besides, all patients in two groups received MRI examinations, and images were processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The results showed that in MRI images, there were significant signal differences between lesion tissues and normal tissues. After being processed by an artificial intelligence algorithm, the definition of MRI images was remarkably enhanced with clearer lesion edges. The quality of images was also significantly improved. Besides, the comparison of anus functions of patients in two groups showed that the differences demonstrated statistical meaning after the intervention (P < 0.05). In conclusion, artificial intelligence algorithm-based MRI and comprehensive pelvic floor muscle exercise showed significant application prospects and values in the recovery of patients' intestinal functions after RC anus-preserving surgery."

            "abstract": "In Japanese pear, the application of GA3+4 during the period of rapid fruit growth resulted in a marked increase in pedicel diameter and bigger fruit at harvest. To elucidate the relationship between pedicel capacity and fruit growth and to determine the main factor responsible for larger fruit size at harvest, fruit growth and pedicel vascularization after GA application were examined and the carbohydrate fluxes were monitored in a spur unit by non-invasive techniques using 13C tracer. Histological studies of fruit revealed that GA increased the cell size of the mesocarp but not the cell number and core size. The investigation of carbon partitioning showed that an increase in the specific rate of carbohydrate accumulation in fruit or the strength of fruit should be responsible for an increase of fruit weight in GA-treated trees. Observation of pedicel vascularization showed that an increase in pedicel cross-sectional area (CSA) by GA application mainly resulted from phloem and xylem CSA, but it is unlikely that an increase in the transport system is the direct factor for larger fruit size. Therefore, it can be concluded that larger fruit size resulting from GA application during the period of rapid fruit growth caused an increase in the cell size of the mesocarp and increased carbon partitioning to the fruit. Although GA is closely involved with pedicel vascularization, it seems that photosynthate accumulation in fruit is limited by the sink strength of fruit rather than by the transport capacity of the pedicel."

Egerton 747, which was produced in southern Italy, around the year 1300. A dozen more original illustrations were found, most of them from Italy, produced during the ensuing two centuries that can be positively identified as watermelon. In most herbal-type manuscripts, the foliage is depicted realistically, the plants shown as having long internodes, alternate leaves with pinnatifid leaf laminae, and the fruits are small, round and striped. The manuscript that contains the most detailed and accurate image of watermelon is the Carrara Herbal, British Library ms. Egerton 2020. In the agriculture-based manuscripts, the foliage, if depicted, is not accurate, but variation in the size, shape and coloration of the fruits is evident. Both red-flesh and white-flesh watermelons are illustrated, corresponding to the typical sweet dessert watermelons so common today and the insipid citron watermelons, respectively. The variation in watermelon fruit size, shape and coloration depicted in the illustrations indicates that at least six cultivars of watermelon are represented, three of which probably had red, sweet flesh and three of which appear to have been citrons. Evidently, citron watermelons were more common in Mediterranean Europe in the past than they are today."

            "abstract": "Policies related to the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms have led to questions regarding how teachers can help cultivate inclusive learning communities where all children are supported and valued. In play-based kindergarten programs, teachers are tasked with ensuring goals for children's learning and development are cultivated in play. However, debates persist regarding the optimal role of the teacher in play and how to meaningfully support the play of children with disabilities. The current multiple case study explored the perspectives and approaches of three kindergarten teachers who highly valued, and strived to enable, participation and inclusion in play-based learning, referred to here as enactors. A minimum of three hours of observation were conducted in each classroom in the fall, and semi-structured teacher interviews were conducted in the fall and spring of the school year. Enactors shared some common themes related to implementing play-based learning to promote inclusion, including a balance of child agency and teacher guidance, involvement that is child-centred and flexible, and the importance of supporting social interactions in play. These views informed both common and unique practices observed in play, including one-on-one conversations, supporting small groups, becoming an active play partner, and collaboratively addressing problems that arose in play. These results illustrate ways enactors gave meaning to the concept of inclusion through their play practices, providing salient examples of play alongside teachers' craft knowledge to help support inclusive play-based learning practices going forward."

Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) that are fully digital may increase reach by overcoming these barriers. The aim of this research was to examine the reach of Lark's DPP, a fully digital artificial-intelligence-powered DPP. This study assessed geographic features and demographic characteristics of a sample of Lark DPP commercial health plan members with complete data (N = 16,327) and compared several demographic features with a large composite sample of members from DPPs across the nation (NDPP; N = 143,489) and a National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) sample of prediabetic adults in the United States (NHIS; N = 2118). Examination of the Lark DPP sample revealed that 24.4% of members lived in rural areas, 30.8% lived in whole county health professional shortage areas, and only 7.6% of members lived in a zip code with an in-person DPP. When comparing the Lark sample with the NDPP and NHIS samples, Lark DPP enrollees tended to be younger and have a higher body mass index (BMI) (p's < 0.001). Lark provides convenient access to a DPP for individuals living in hard-to-reach areas who may face barriers to participating in in-person or telephonic DPPs or who prefer a digital program. Compared with the NDPP sample, Lark is also reaching younger and higher BMI users, who are traditionally difficult to enroll and have a high need for intervention."

            "abstract": "Physical exercise (PE) is beneficial for both physical and psychological health aspects. However, excessive training can lead to physical fatigue and an increased risk of lower limb injuries. In order to tailor training loads and durations to the needs and capacities of an individual, physical fatigue must be estimated. Different measurement devices and techniques (i.e., ergospirometers, electromyography, and motion capture systems) can be used to identify physical fatigue. The field of biomechanics has succeeded in capturing changes in human movement with optical systems, as well as with accelerometers or inertial measurement units (IMUs), the latter being more user-friendly and adaptable to real-world scenarios due to its wearable nature. There is, however, still a lack of consensus regarding the possibility of using biomechanical parameters measured with accelerometers to identify physical fatigue states in PE. Nowadays, the field of biomechanics is beginning to open towards the possibility of identifying fatigue state using machine learning algorithms. Here, we selected and summarized accelerometer-based articles that either (a) performed analyses of biomechanical parameters that change due to fatigue in the lower limbs or (b) performed fatigue identification based on features including biomechanical parameters. We performed a systematic literature search and analysed 39 articles on running, jumping, walking, stair climbing, and other gym exercises. Peak tibial and sacral acceleration were the most common measured variables and were found to significantly increase with fatigue (respectively, in 6/13 running articles and 2/4 jumping articles). Fatigue classification was performed with an accuracy between 78% and 96% and Pearson's correlation with an RPE (rate of perceived exertion) between r = 0.79 and r = 0.95. We recommend future effort toward the standardization of fatigue protocols and methods across articles in order to generalize fatigue identification results and increase the use of accelerometers to quantify physical fatigue in PE."

They must reliably connect rather heavy fruits to the branch and cope with increasing fruit weight, which induces dynamic stresses under oscillating wind loads. This study focuses on tissue modification of these small, exposed structures during fruit development.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A combination of microscopic, static and dynamic mechanical tests, as well as Raman spectroscopy, was used to study structure-function relationships in peduncles of one cultivar and 12 wild species, representatively chosen from all sections of the genus Malus. Tissue differentiation and ontogenetic changes in mechanical properties of Malus peduncles were observed throughout one growing season and after successive removal of tissues.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Unlike in regular stems, the vascular cambium produces mainly phloem during secondary growth. Hence, in addition to a reduced xylem, all species developed a centrally arranged sclerenchyma ring composed of fibres and brachysclereids. Based on differences in cell-wall thickness, and proportions and arrangement of sclereids, two types of peduncle construction could be distinguished. Fibres provide an increased maximum tensile strength and contribute most to the overall axial rigidity of the peduncles. Sclereids contribute insignificantly to peduncle strength; however, despite being shown to have a lower elastic modulus than fibres, they are the most effective tissue in stiffening peduncles against bending.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The experimental data revealed that sclereids originating from cortical parenchyma act as 'accessory' cells to enhance proportions of sclerenchyma during secondary growth in peduncles. The mechanism can be interpreted as an adaptation to continuously increasing fruit loads. Under oscillating longitudinal stresses, sclereids may be regarded as regulating elements between maintenance of stiffness and viscous damping, the latter property being attributed to the cortical parenchyma."

To that end, we introduce a conceptual framework based on autonomic systems to host DT run-time models based on a structured and systematic approach. We argue that the convergence between DT and self-adaptation is the key to building smarter, resilient and trustworthy CPS that can self-monitor, self-diagnose and-ultimately-self-heal. The conceptual framework eases dependability assessment, which is essential for the certification of autonomous CPS operating with artificial intelligence and machine learning in critical applications.

Although they have yielded impressive results in terms of model accuracy and predictive ability, most of these applications are based on \"Black-box\" algorithms and more interpretable models have been claimed by the research community. The recent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) revolution offers a solution for this issue, were rule-based approaches are highly suitable for explanatory purposes. The further integration of the data mining process along with functional-annotation and pathway analyses is an additional way towards more explanatory and biologically soundness models. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing, knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline, we work on in vivo temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations, we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result, we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications."

Six focus group interviews with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Interview questions were designed to generate discussion on benefits, challenges, and pragmatic considerations for incorporating AI into office settings. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an iterative approach. Two primary constructs emerged. First, participants shared perspectives related to preferences and concerns regarding communication and interactions with the technology. Second, numerous conversations highlighted the dualistic nature of a system that collects large amounts of data; that is, the potential benefits for behavior change to improve health and the pitfalls of trust and privacy. Across both constructs, there was an overarching discussion related to the intersections of AI with the complexity of work performance. Numerous thoughts were shared relative to future AI solutions that could enhance the office workplace. This study's findings indicate that the acceptability of AI in the workplace is complex and dependent upon the benefits outweighing the potential detriments.

The main adaptations relied on the literature on tomato and mainly concerned: (i) the decrease in cell wall extensibility coefficient during fruit development; (ii) the increase in the membrane reflection coefficient to solute from 0 to 1, which accounted for the switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, and (iii) the negative influence of the initial fruit weight on the maximum rate of active carbon uptake based on the assumption of higher competition for carbon among cells in large fruits containing more cells. A sensitivity analysis was performed and the model was calibrated and evaluated with satisfaction on 17 experimental datasets obtained under contrasting environmental (temperature, air vapour pressure deficit) and plant (plant fruit load and fruit position) conditions. Then the model was used to analyse the variations in the main fluxes involved in tomato fruit growth and accumulation of carbon in response to virtual carbon and water stresses. The conclusions are that this model, integrating simple biophysical laws, was able to simulate the complex fruit behaviour in response to external or internal factors and thus it may be a powerful tool for managing fruit growth and quality."

What patient competences are chatbots aimed at? Which chatbot technical enablers are of most interest in the health domain? We identify 30 articles related to health chatbots from 2014 to 2018. We analyze the selected articles qualitatively and extract a triplet <technicalEnablers, competence, illness> for each of them. This data serves to provide a first overview of chatbot-mediated behavior change on the health domain. Main insights include: nutritional disorders and neurological disorders as the main illness areas being tackled; \"affect\" as the human competence most pursued by chatbots to attain change behavior; and \"personalization\" and \"consumability\" as the most appreciated technical enablers. On the other hand, main limitations include lack of adherence to good practices to case-study reporting, and a deeper look at the broader sociological implications brought by this technology."

It could appear then a suitable task for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Indeed, machine learning algorithms have been applied to sleep scoring for many years. As a result, several software products offer nowadays automated or semi-automated scoring services. However, the vast majority of the sleep physicians do not use them. Very recently, thanks to the increased computational power, deep learning has also been employed with promising results. Machine learning algorithms can undoubtedly reach a high accuracy in specific situations, but there are many difficulties in their introduction in the daily routine. In this review, the latest approaches that are applying deep learning for facilitating and accelerating sleep scoring are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the state of the art methods. Then the obstacles in introducing automated sleep scoring in the clinical practice are examined. Deep learning algorithm capabilities of learning from a highly heterogeneous dataset, in terms both of human data and of scorers, are very promising and should be further investigated."

            "abstract": "Leaf abscission is a common response of plants to drought stress. Some species, such as citrus, have evolved a specific behaviour in this respect, keeping their leaves attached to the plant body during water stress until this is released by irrigation or rain. This study successfully reproduced this phenomenon under controlled conditions (24h of water stress followed by 24h of rehydration) and used it to construct a suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library enriched in genes involved in the early stages of rehydration-promoted leaf abscission after water stress. Sequencing of the library yielded 314 unigenes, which were spotted onto nylon membranes. Membrane hybridization with petiole (Pet)- and laminar abscission zone (LAZ)-enriched RNA samples corresponding to early steps in leaf abscission revealed an almost exclusive preferential gene expression programme in the LAZ. The data identified major processes such as protein metabolism, cell-wall modification, signalling, control of transcription and vesicle production, and transport as the main biological processes activated in LAZs during the early steps of rehydration-promoted leaf abscission after water stress. Based on these findings, a model for the early steps of citrus leaf abscission is proposed. In addition, it is suggested that CitbHLH1, the putative citrus orthologue of Arabidopsis BIGPETAL, may play major roles in the control of abscission-related events in citrus abscission zones."

Investigations were conducted, therefore, to verify the occurrence of the ripening process in the calyx. Ethylene production increased in both ripening fruit and red calyx, as did tissue contents of its immediate precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. In addition, an increase in the mRNA of polygalacturonase [poly(1,4-[alpha]-D-galacturonide) glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.15], an enzyme that in tomato is present in large amounts only in ripening fruit, was established in both ripe fruit and red calyx by RNA gel blot analysis. Ultrastructural studies showed that the disruption of cell walls in red calyx was indistinguishable from that occurring in ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the developmental program of the calyx changed in several aspects to resemble that of tomato fruit."

For potential patients, the prediction is based only on noninvasive measures such as anthropomorphic measures, symptoms, age, and other lifestyle factors so that the proposed prediction tool can be conveniently used without any laboratory or ultrasound test results. For clinical providers who can access patients' medical test results, prediction models using all predictor variables can be adopted to help health providers diagnose patients with PCOS.

Our aim is to describe the development of an evidence and theory-based intervention to improve physical activity in older adults with T2D, subsumed in a multi-behavior intervention via a mobile application with an ACA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Overall decisions on the multi-behavior intervention design, such as the use of standardized behavior change techniques (BCTTv1), guided the development of the physical activity component. Firstly, recommendations on ambulatory activity were used to select the target behavior (walking). Meta-research on effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) was then identified. One meta-analysis linked effective BCTs with the three basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory (SDT). This meta-analysis, taken together with additional evidence on SDT, led to the selection of this theory to inform the design. BCTs were extracted from meta-research; we selected the most appropriate to be operationalized via the conversational agent through multidisciplinary discussions. Rules governing the dialogue flow and BCTs tailoring, taking the form \"if some conditions hold then execute some action,\" were derived based on the Basic Psychological in Exercise Scale (competence, autonomy, and relatedness scores), in conjunction with published evidence and multidisciplinary discussions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirteen BCTs were implemented in the prototype via the ACA (e.g., goal setting behavior 1.1).

To improve activity monitoring, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach to classify physical movement activity patterns.

The first dataset is from the UCI machine learning repository, which contains 14 different activities-of-daily-life (ADL) and is collected from 16 volunteers who carried a single wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer. The second dataset includes ten other ADLs and is gathered from eight volunteers who placed the sensors on their hips. Our experiment results show that the RNN model provides accurate performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in classifying the fundamental movement patterns with an overall accuracy of 84.89% and an overall F1-score of 82.56%.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Little research has examined associations between disaster-related home loss and multiple domains of health and well-being, with extended long-term follow-up and comprehensive adjustment for pre-disaster characteristics of survivors.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      We examined the longitudinal associations between disaster-induced home loss and 34 indicators of health and well-being, assessed ∼9y post-disaster.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used data from a preexisting cohort study of Japanese older adults in an area directly impacted by the 2011 Japan Earthquake (n=3,350 and n=2,028, depending on the outcomes). The study was initiated in 2010, and disaster-related home loss status was measured in 2013 retrospectively. The 34 outcomes were assessed in 2020 and covered dimensions of physical health, mental health, health behaviors/sleep, social well-being, cognitive social capital, subjective well-being, and prosocial/altruistic behaviors. We estimated the associations between disaster-related home loss and the outcomes, using targeted maximum likelihood estimation and SuperLearner. We adjusted for pre-disaster characteristics from the wave conducted 7 months before the disaster (i.e., 2010), including prior outcome values that were available.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, we found that home loss (vs. no home loss) was associated with increased posttraumatic stress symptoms (standardized difference=0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.65), increased daily sleepiness (0.38; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.54), lower trust in the community (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.53, -0.18), lower community attachment (-0.60; 95% CI: -0.75, -0.45), and lower prosociality (-0.39; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.24). We found modest evidence for the associations with increased depressive symptoms, increased hopelessness, more chronic conditions, higher body mass index, lower perceived mutual help in the community, and decreased happiness. There was little evidence for associations with the remaining 23 outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Home loss due to a disaster may have long-lasting adverse impacts on the cognitive social capital, mental health, and prosociality of older adult survivors. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10903."

            "abstract": "Dietary fats are essential ingredients of a healthy diet. Their production, however, impacts the environment and its capacity to sustain us. Growing knowledge across multiple disciplines improves our understanding of links between food, health and sustainability, but increases apparent complexity. Whereas past dietary guidelines placed limits on total fat intake especially saturated fats, recent studies indicate more complex links with health. Guidelines differ between regions of general poverty and malnutrition and those where obesity is a growing problem. Optimization of production to benefit health and environmental outcomes is hindered by limited data and shared societal goals. We lack a detailed overview of where fats are being produced, and their environmental impacts. Furthermore, the yields of different crops, for producing oils or feeding animals, and the associated land needs for meeting oil demands, differ greatly. To illuminate these matters, we review current discourse about the nutritional aspects of edible fats, summarize the inferred environmental implications of their production and identify knowledge gaps."

            "abstract": "Fruit is important for human health, and applying deficit irrigation in fruit production is a strategy to regulate fruit quality and support environmental sustainability. Responses of different fruit quality variables to deficit irrigation have been widely documented, and much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of these responses. We review the effects of water shortage on fruit water accumulation considering water transport from the parent plant into the fruit determined by hydraulic properties of the pathway (including xylem water transport and transmembrane water transport regulated by aquaporins) and the driving force for water movement. We discuss water relations and solute metabolism that affect the main fruit quality variables (e.g. size, flavour, nutrition, and firmness) at the cellular level under water shortage. We also summarize the most recent advances in the understanding of responses of the main fruit quality variables to water shortage, considering the effects of variety, the severity of water deficit imposed, and the developmental stage of the fruit. We finally identify knowledge gaps and suggest avenues for future research. This review provides new insights into the stress physiology of fleshy fruit, which will be beneficial for the sustainable production of high-quality fruit under deficit irrigation."

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      Summer squash, the young fruits of Cucurbita pepo, are a common, high-value fruit vegetable. Of the summer squash, the zucchini, C. pepo subsp. pepo Zucchini Group, is by far the most cosmopolitan. The zucchini is easily distinguished from other summer squash by its uniformly cylindrical shape and intense colour. The zucchini is a relatively new cultivar-group of C. pepo, the earliest known evidence for its existence having been a description in a book on horticulture published in Milan in 1901. For this study, Italian-language books on agriculture and cookery dating from the 16th to 19th centuries have been collected and searched in an effort to follow the horticultural development and culinary use of young Cucurbita fruits in Italy.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The results indicate that Cucurbita fruits, both young and mature, entered Italian kitchens by the mid-16th century. A half-century later, round and elongate young fruits of C. pepo were addressed as separate cookery items and the latter had largely replaced the centuries-old culinary use of young, elongate bottle gourds, Lagenaria siceraria Allusion to a particular, extant cultivar of the longest fruited C. pepo, the Cocozelle Group, dates to 1811 and derives from the environs of Naples. The Italian diminutive word zucchini arose by the beginning of the 19th century in Tuscany and referred to small, mature, desiccated bottle gourds used as containers to store tobacco. By the 1840s, the Tuscan word zucchini was appropriated to young, primarily elongate fruits of C. pepo The Zucchini Group traces its origins to the environs of Milan, perhaps as early as 1850. The word zucchini and the horticultural product zucchini arose contemporaneously but independently. The results confirm that the Zucchini Group is the youngest of the four cultivar-groups of C. pepo subsp. pepo but it emerged approximately a half-century earlier than previously known."

The optimal linear observer for performing a detection task, called the Hotelling observer in the medical literature, can be regarded as a generalization of the familiar prewhitening matched filter. Performance on the detection task is limited by randomness in the image data, which stems from randomness in the object, randomness in the imaging system, and randomness in the detector outputs due to photon and readout noise, and the Hotelling observer accounts for all of these effects in an optimal way. If multiple temporal frames of images are acquired, the resulting data set is a spatio-temporal random process, and the Hotelling observer becomes a spatio-temporal linear operator. This paper discusses the theory of the spatio-temporal Hotelling observer and estimation of the required spatio-temporal covariance matrices. It also presents a parallel implementation of the observer on a cluster of Sony PLAYSTATION 3 gaming consoles. As an example, we consider the use of the spatio-temporal Hotelling observer for exoplanet detection."

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI HIP, a planning software based on AI technology, can quickly and automatically identify acetabular and femur morphology, and automatically match the optimal prosthesis size. However, the accuracy and feasibility of its clinical application still needs to be further verified. The purposes of this study were to investigate the accuracy and time efficiency of AI HIP in preoperative planning for primary THA, compared with 3D mimics software and 2D digital template, and further analyze the factors that influence the accuracy of AI HIP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A prospective study was conducted on 53 consecutive patients (59 hips) undergoing primary THA with cementless prostheses in our department.

Acetabular dysplasia (P = 0.021), rather than sex and BMI, was an influential factor in the accuracy of AI HIP templating. Compared to patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the accuracy of acetabular cup in the non-DDH group was better (P = 0.021), but the difference in the accuracy of the femoral stem between the two groups was statistically insignificant (P = 0.062).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      AI HIP showed excellent reliability for component size in THA.

The second one relies on wearable sensors and has the detection of eating behaviours as its main goal."

            "abstract": "As governments and healthcare systems grow increasingly concerned with the current obesity 'epidemic', sociological interest in the condition has also increased. Despite the emergence of work discussing obesity as a social phenomenon, the sociological dimensions of medical weight-loss treatments for obesity remain underexplored. This paper reports on a conversation analytic (CA) study and describes how moral issues surrounding weight and patienthood become visible when doctors and patients discuss obesity. Consultations in two UK National Health Service clinics were video-recorded and analysed to identify recurring patterns of interaction. This paper describes how patients answer opening questions: questions which begin the consultation, enabling patients to report their medical status. Analysis reveals that when producing their answers, patients typically imply either 'success' or 'lack of success' in their weight-loss progress. Whilst doing so, they construct their personal agency in different ways, crediting themselves for implied successes and resisting responsibility for lack of success. Through interaction the doctor and patient collaboratively construct obesity as a moral issue. The moral obligations invoked share similarities with certain perceived normative dynamics surrounding obesity and the responsibilities of patienthood. These findings have relevance to healthcare practice and add to sociological understanding of the modern obesity 'crisis'."

            "abstract": "Background: The use of chatbots may increase engagement with digital behavior change interventions in youth by providing human-like interaction. Following a Person-Based Approach (PBA), integrating user preferences in digital tool development is crucial for engagement, whereas information on youth preferences for health chatbots is currently limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of adolescents' expectations and preferences for health chatbots and describe the systematic development of a health promotion chatbot. Methods: Three studies in three different stages of PBA were conducted: (1) a qualitative focus group study (n = 36), (2) log data analysis during pretesting (n = 6), and (3) a mixed-method pilot testing (n = 73). Results: Confidentiality, connection to youth culture, and preferences when referring to other sources were important aspects for youth in chatbots. Youth also wanted a chatbot to provide small talk and broader support (e.g., technical support with the tool) rather than specifically in relation to health behaviors. Despite the meticulous approach of PBA, user engagement with the developed chatbot was modest. Conclusion: This study highlights that conducting formative research at different stages is an added value and that adolescents have different chatbot preferences than adults. Further improvement to build an engaging chatbot for youth may stem from using living databases."

In this study, we divided 30 mice into five groups: untreated mice, mice with depression-like behaviors, mice with depression-like behaviors treated with consumed leucine, mice with depression-like behaviors treated with exercise training, mice with depression-like behaviors treated with exercise training along with consumed leucine. According to artificial intelligence biological analysis, we found some mediators such as lncRNAs profile and Kdr/Vegfα/Pten/Bdnf interactions network in the hippocampus region and ileum tissue which could be decisive molecules in the brain-gut axis. Moreover, KDR as a principal cutpoint protein in the network was identified as the pharmaceutical approach for major depressive ameliorating based on pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking outcomes. Furthermore, we indicated that the mRNA and protein level of the Pten enhanced and Vegfα/Kdr/Bdnf mRNAs, as well as the protein level of KDR, decreased in mice with depression-like behaviors. Moreover, exercise and leucine ameliorated the brain-gut axis in mice with depression-like behaviors. Exercise and leucine regulated the lncRNAs network in the hippocampus and ileum of mice with depression-like behaviors. We suggest that the lncRNAs profiles could be considered as diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers, and exercise + leucine might be a practical approach to improve depression."

The amount of data generated from various sensor systems is growing proportionally every year. Therefore, it is necessary to look for more progressive solutions to these problems. Methods of implementing artificial intelligence are becoming a new trend in this area. At first, an experimental platform with two separate groups of fiber Bragg grating sensor arrays (horizontally and vertically oriented) installed into the top pavement layers was created. Interrogators were connected to sensor arrays to measure pavement deformation caused by vehicles passing over the pavement. Next, neural networks for visual classification with a closed-circuit television camera to separate vehicles into different classes were used. This classification was used for the verification of measured and analyzed data from sensor arrays. The newly proposed neural network for vehicle classification from the sensor array dataset was created. From the obtained experimental results, it is evident that our proposed neural network was capable of separating trucks from other vehicles, with an accuracy of 94.9%, and classifying vehicles into three different classes, with an accuracy of 70.8%.

In the current manuscript, we propose an automated smartphone application which monitors and evaluates the user's adherence to MD using images of the food and drinks that they consume. We define a set of rules for automatic adherence estimation, which focuses on the main MD food groups. We use a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a graph convolutional network to detect the types of foods and quantities from the users' food images and the defined set of rules to evaluate the adherence to MD. Our experiments show that our system outperforms a basic CNN in terms of recognizing food items and estimating quantity and yields comparable results as experienced dietitians when it comes to overall MD adherence estimation. As the system is novel, these results are promising; however, there is room for improvement of the accuracy by gathering and training with more data and certain refinements can be performed such as re-defining the set of rules to also be able to be used for sub-groups of MD (e.g., vegetarian type of MD)."

            "abstract": "Dietary habits represent the main determinant of health. Although extensive research has been conducted to modify unhealthy dietary behaviors across the lifespan, obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities are increasingly observed worldwide. Individually tailored interventions are nowadays considered a promising frontier for nutritional research. In this narrative review, the technologies of importance in a pediatric clinical setting are discussed. The first determinant of the dietary balance is represented by energy intakes matching individual needs. Most emerging studies highlight the opportunity to reconsider the widely used prediction equations of resting energy expenditure. Artificial Neural Network approaches may help to disentangle the role of single contributors to energy expenditure. Artificial intelligence is also useful in the prediction of the glycemic response, based on the individual microbiome. Other factors further concurring to define individually tailored nutritional needs are metabolomics and nutrigenomic. Since most available data come from studies in adult groups, new efforts should now be addressed to integrate all these aspects to develop comprehensive and-above all-effective interventions for children. IMPACT: Personalized dietary advice, specific to individuals, should be more effective in the prevention of chronic diseases than general recommendations about diet. Artificial Neural Networks algorithms are technologies of importance in a pediatric setting that may help practitioners to provide personalized nutrition. Other approaches to personalized nutrition, while promising in adults and for basic research, are still far from practical application in pediatrics."

Flower-visiting ants were studied to determine whether they are antagonists or mutualists and whether they could influence floral or breeding system evolution in gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana). Ant and flying pollinator (bees/flies) access to plants was manipulated, and visitation, fruit, and seed set were assessed. Ants visited flowers of hermaphrodites more often than those of females when bees and flies were excluded, but visited the sex morphs equally when they were present. Insect class did not influence fruit or seed set of hermaphrodites. In contrast, ants had both positive and negative effects on seed set in females. Females visited only by ants had 90% of the seed set of those visited only by bees/flies, and their seed set increased with ant visitation. The spatial pattern of seed set, however, suggests that ants may also damage pistils. Lastly, in contrast to bees and flies, ants failed to increase visitation with floral display size, suggesting that ant presence at flowers could reduce selection on this attractive trait. Findings suggest that when in high abundance, flower-visiting ants could affect breeding system and floral evolution in this gynodioecious plant."

Pollen vitality was lower in the hermaphrodites than in the males. Anther development requires nutrients, and carbohydrates are the basic nutrients; abnormal carbohydrate metabolism will result in pollen abortion.

Most of the hermaphroditic pollen grains were empty, with degradation of the cytoplasm, absence of an intine layer and defective exines. There was a significant differential expression between male and hermaphroditic flowers of several key genes that are involved in sugar metabolism, transport and intine development.

In this study, anthocyanin biosynthesis induced by different light intensities in apple (Malus domestica) was found to be largely dependent on the functions of the MdMYB1 and MdTCP46 transcription factors. The expression of MdTCP46 was responsive to high light intensity, and under these conditions it promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis by direct interactions with MdMYB1 that enhanced the binding of the latter to its target genes. MdTCP46 also interacted with a bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad (BTB) protein, MdBT2, that is responsive to high light intensity, which ubiquitinated MdTCP46 and mediated its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. Our results demonstrate that the dynamic regulatory module MdBT2-MdTCP46-MdMYB1 plays a key role in modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis at different light intensities in apple, and provides new insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of TCP proteins."

Combining data for up to 703,901 individuals from 51 studies in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies yields 99 loci that associate with self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time (MVPA), leisure screen time (LST) and/or sedentary behavior at work. Loci associated with LST are enriched for genes whose expression in skeletal muscle is altered by resistance training. A missense variant in ACTN3 makes the alpha-actinin-3 filaments more flexible, resulting in lower maximal force in isolated type IIA muscle fibers, and possibly protection from exercise-induced muscle damage. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses show that beneficial effects of lower LST and higher MVPA on several risk factors and diseases are mediated or confounded by body mass index (BMI).

Obesity had been reported to increase TG and is associated with dyslipidemia, which also predisposes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the effect of the blood lipid profile on TG has not been studied extensively. To gain more insight into the associations of TG, body mass index (BMI) and lipid profile, we studied TG in relation to these parameters in a large Italian population cohort, the Moli-sani study (N = 22,546; age ≥ 35 years; 48% men). TG was measured in plasma samples collected at the enrollment of subjects in the Moli-sani study. TG was triggered with 1 or 5 pM tissue factor, and TG parameters lag time, peak, ETP, time-to-peak (TTP) and velocity index (VI). Additionally, thrombomodulin was added to assess the function of the activated protein C system during TG. In both women and men, overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) were significantly associated with higher ETP, peak and VI (all p < 0.001). High total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly associated with increased ETP and peak (all p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that the ETP is positively associated with both plasma LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, whereas the velocity index is positively associated with HDL cholesterol. Additionally, ETP, peak and VI were significantly associated with the plasma triglycerides content. In conclusion, our study shows significant associations of high BMI and blood lipid levels with increased TG parameters, and this hypercoagulability may partly explain the increased risk of CVD in individuals with obesity and/or dyslipidemia."

Greater variability in score estimates was generated by the computerized adaptive testing version, which led to a relative reduction in sensitivity as defined by the standardized response mean. Extreme scores were generally more difficult for the computer adaptive format to estimate with as much accuracy as scores in the mid-range of the scale. However, the reduction in accuracy and sensitivity, which did not influence the group effect results in this study, is counterbalanced by the large reduction in testing burden."

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      A reduction in offspring fitness resulting from mating between neighbours is interpreted as biparental inbreeding depression. However, little is known about the relationship between the parents' genetic relatedness and biparental inbreeding depression in their progeny in natural populations. This study assesses the effect of kinship between parents on the fitness of their progeny and the extent of spatial genetic structure in a natural population of Rhododendron brachycarpum.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Kinship coefficients between 11,858 pairs of plants among a natural population of 154 R. brachycarpum plants were estimated a priori using six microsatellite markers. Plants were genotyped, and pairs were selected from among 60 plants to vary the kinship from full-sib to unrelated. After a hand-pollination experiment among the 60 plants, offspring fitness was measured at the stages of seed maturation (i.e. ripening) under natural conditions, and seed germination and seedling survival under greenhouse conditions. In addition, spatial autocorrelation was used to assess the population's genetic structure.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Offspring fitness decreased significantly with increasing kinship between parents. However, the magnitude and timing of this effect differed among the life-cycle stages. Measures of inbreeding depression were 0.891 at seed maturation, 0.122 (but not significant) at seed germination and 0.506 at seedling survival. The local population spatial structure was significant, and the physical distance between parents mediated the level of inbreeding between them.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The level of inbreeding between individuals determines offspring fitness in R. brachycarpum, especially during seed maturation. Genetic relatedness between parents caused inbreeding depression in their progeny. Therefore, biparental inbreeding contributes little to reproduction and instead acts as a selection force that promotes outcrossing, as offspring of more distant (less related) parents survive better."

These platforms engage users in multidirectional communication and provide public health programs with the tools to inform and engage diverse audiences on a range of public health issues, as well as monitor opinions and behaviors on health topics.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper details the process used by the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Breakthrough RESEARCH to apply social media monitoring and social listening techniques in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, and Togo for the adaptive management of the Merci Mon Héros campaign. We documented how these approaches were applied and how the lessons learned can be used to support future public health communication campaigns.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The process involved 6 steps: (1) ensure there is a sufficient volume of topic-specific web-based conversation in the target countries; (2) develop measures to monitor the campaign's social media strategy; (3) identify search terms to assess campaign and related conversations; (4) quantitatively assess campaign audience demographics, campaign reach, and engagement through social media monitoring; (5) qualitatively assess audience attitudes, opinions, and behaviors and understand conversation context through social media listening; and (6) adapt campaign content and approach based on the analysis of social media data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed posts across social media platforms from November 2019 to October 2020 based on identified key search terms related to family planning, reproductive health, menstruation, sexual activity, and gender. Based on the quantitative and qualitative assessments in steps 4 and 5, there were several adaptive shifts in the campaign's content and approach, of which the following 3 shifts are highlighted. (1) Social media monitoring identified that the Facebook campaign fans were primarily male, which prompted the campaign to target calls to action to the male audience already following the campaign and shift marketing approaches to increase the proportion of female followers. (2) Shorter videos had a higher chance of being viewed in their entirety. In response to this, the campaign shortened video lengths and created screenshot teasers to promote videos. (3) The most negative sentiment related to the campaign videos was associated with beliefs against premarital sex. In response to this finding, the campaign included videos and Facebook Live sessions with religious leaders who promoted talking openly with young people to support intergenerational discussion about reproductive health.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Prior to launching health campaigns, programs should test the most relevant social media platforms and their limitations. Inherent biases to internet and social media access are important challenges, and ethical considerations around data privacy must continue to guide the advances in this technology's use for research. However, social listening and social media monitoring can be powerful monitoring and evaluation tools that can be used to aid the adaptive management of health campaigns that engage populations who have a digital presence."

            "abstract": "The exploitation of synthetic polyploids for producing seedless fruits is well known in watermelon. Tetraploid progenitors of triploid watermelon plants, compared with their diploid counterparts, exhibit wide phenotypic differences. Although many factors modulate alternative splicing (AS) in plants, the effects of autopolyploidization on AS are still unknown. In this study, we used tissues of leaf, stem, and fruit of diploid and tetraploid sweet watermelon to understand changes in gene expression and the occurrence of AS. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed along with reverse transcription quantitative PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR to demonstrate changes in expression and splicing. All vegetative tissues except fruit showed an increased level of AS in the tetraploid watermelon throughout the growth period. The ploidy levels of diploids and the tetraploid were confirmed using a ploidy analyser. We identified 5362 and 1288 genes that were up- and downregulated, respectively, in tetraploid as compared with diploid plants. We further confirmed that 22 genes underwent AS events across tissues, indicating possibilities of generating different protein isoforms with altered functions of important transcription factors and transporters. Arginine biosynthesis, chlorophyllide synthesis, GDP mannose biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose degradation pathways were upregulated in autotetraploids. Phloem protein 2, chloroplastic PGR5-like protein, zinc-finger protein, fructokinase-like 2, MYB transcription factor, and nodulin MtN21 showed AS in fruit tissues. These results should help in developing high-quality seedless watermelon and provide additional transcriptomic information related to other cucurbits."

The present study examined whether the proposed non-pharmaceutical, multi-component exercise training which combined Tai-Chi exercise, Aerobic fitness, and thera-band therapy protects against age-related neurocognitive and physical deterioration in the older participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Participants with aMCI in the quasi-experimental design were assigned to the multi-component exercise group or care control group. Evaluations of neuropsychological function and functional fitness were performed before and after 12-weeks intervention, and after 24-weeks follow-up. Our results showed that the multi-component intervention significantly improved various domains of neurocognitive function, particularly in memory- and frontal-related cognition, and better performance on functional fitness, including muscle strength, cardiopulmonary endurance, and agility. Furthermore, such beneficial effects were preserved after 24 weeks. The findings provide supportive evidence that non-pharmaceutically multi-component intervention with Tai-Chi style practice as a core exercise may protect against age-related neurocognitive and physical deficits and lay the path on developing age-friendly intervention programs to delay, or even reverse, the progression of MCI to dementia."

            "abstract": "Cell production is an essential facilitator of fruit growth and development. Cell production during carpel/floral-tube growth, fruit set, and fruit growth, and its regulation by cell cycle genes were investigated in apple (Malus×domestica Borkh.). Cell production was inhibited during late carpel/floral-tube development, resulting in growth arrest before bloom. Fruit set re-activated cell production between 8 d and 11 d after full bloom (DAFB) and triggered fruit growth. The early phase of fruit growth involved rapid cell production followed by exit from cell proliferation at ∼24 DAFB. Seventy-one cell cycle genes were identified, and expression of 59 genes was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. Changes in expression of 19 genes were consistently associated with transitions in cell production during carpel/floral-tube growth, fruit set, and fruit growth. Fourteen genes, including B-type cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and A2-, B1-, and B2-type cyclins, were positively associated with cell production, suggesting that availability of G2/M phase regulators of the cell cycle is limiting for cell proliferation. Enhanced expression of five genes including that of the putative CDK inhibitors, MdKRP4 and MdKRP5, was associated with reduced cell production. Exit from cell proliferation at G0/G1 during fruit growth was facilitated by multiple mechanisms including down-regulation of putative regulators of G1/S and G2/M phase progression and up-regulation of KRP genes. Interestingly, two CDKA genes and several CDK-activating factors were up-regulated during this period, suggesting functions for these genes in mediating exit from cell proliferation at G0/G1. Together, the data indicate that cell cycle genes are important facilitators of cell production during apple fruit development."

Human motion can be used to provide remote healthcare solutions for vulnerable people by identifying particular movements such as falls, gait and breathing disorders. This can allow people to live more independent lifestyles and still have the safety of being monitored if more direct care is needed. At present wearable devices can provide real-time monitoring by deploying equipment on a person's body. However, putting devices on a person's body all the time makes it uncomfortable and the elderly tend to forget to wear them, in addition to the insecurity of being tracked all the time. This paper demonstrates how human motions can be detected in a quasi-real-time scenario using a non-invasive method. Patterns in the wireless signals present particular human body motions as each movement induces a unique change in the wireless medium. These changes can be used to identify particular body motions. This work produces a dataset that contains patterns of radio wave signals obtained using software-defined radios (SDRs) to establish if a subject is standing up or sitting down as a test case. The dataset was used to create a machine learning model, which was used in a developed application to provide a quasi-real-time classification of standing or sitting state. The machine-learning model was able to achieve 96.70% accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm using 10 fold cross-validation. A benchmark dataset of wearable devices was compared to the proposed dataset and results showed the proposed dataset to have similar accuracy of nearly 90%.

This cross-sectional study evaluated the Nintendo Wii as a measure of exertion (heart rate [HR], respiration rate [RR], and caloric expenditure) and balance testing for youth with MTBI in a clinical setting. Twenty-four youth with MTBI, ages 9-18, played six Wii games.

More recently, with the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments around the world have made unprecedented efforts to contain the epidemic by implementing quarantine measures, social distancing, and isolating infected individuals. Social behavioral adaptations (e.g., social distancing, isolation, etc.) impact children's and adolescents' lifestyle activities and lead to increased incidence of psychosocial problems, worsening of preexisting mental illness, and fears of infection, uncertainty, isolation, and stress. In light of this, this study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the behaviors and lifestyles of the children and adolescent population of Pakistan. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 323 children and adolescents by targeting parents of children and adolescents in the age group of 4-18 years living in Pakistan. The study was conducted from April 2021 to September 2021. A well-designed structured questionnaire was used to collect data about the sociodemographic profile, attitudes, and behavioral factors impacted by COVID-19 in children and adolescents. SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to enter and analyze data. Results Parents or caregivers of a total of 189 male and 134 female children aged between four and 18 years took part in this study. During COVID-19, the consumption of fast food and fried foods by children and adolescents increased significantly. In this study, out of 323 participants, almost all (289, 89.5%) had increased their screen time significantly. Nearly half of the total individuals experienced the feeling of depression and loneliness during the pandemic. Additionally, some children and adolescents felt fearful when leaving home. COVID-19 lockdowns have led to many changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle habits. They reduced physical contact with others due to the fear of transmission of COVID-19. Based on our findings, the pandemic and its containment strategies have adversely affected the behaviors, lifestyles, and attitudes of children and adolescents. Conclusion Governments around the world have imposed social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to adverse short-term and long-term negative mental health issues such as unhappiness, fear, worry, irritability, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Interventions are needed to focus on building resilience in children and adolescents, addressing their fears and concerns through better communication, encouraging routine and physical activity, and taking measures to alleviate loneliness."

Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer.

            "abstract": "Introduction: Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application. Methods: The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running. Results: The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies \"monitoring of behavior,\" \"feedback,\" \"goal setting,\" \"reminders,\" \"rewards,\" and \"providing instruction.\" An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed."

            "abstract": "Ethylene production in pear fruit was studied at 2 degrees C. Several observations showed that the inhibiting effect of CO2 on ethylene production did not operate only via the binding site of the ethylene binding protein. Ethylene production of freshly harvested pears was stimulated by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), but unaffected or inhibited by CO2 which points to different action sites for both molecules. In climacteric pears, where ethylene production was strongly inhibited by 1-MCP, a range of applied CO2 partial pressures was able to inhibit ethylene production further, to an extent similar to untreated pears. In the case of pears that had been stored for a period of 25 weeks, CO2 only had a clear effect after 1-MCP pretreatment. Respiration measurements showed that the effect of CO2 on ethylene production did not operate via an effect on respiration. Ethylene production models based on measurements of whole pears were used to study CO2 effects. Kinetic parameters derived from the models point to the conversion from ACC to ethylene by ACC oxidase as a possible action site for CO2 inhibition."

            "abstract": "First and second ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) represent the boundaries of the moderate-heavy and heavy-severe exercise intensity. Currently, VTs are primarily detected visually from cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) data, beginning with an initial data screening followed by data processing and statistical analysis. Automated VT detection is a challenging task owing to the high signal to noise ratio typical of CPET data. Recurrent neural networks describe a machine learning form of Artificial Intelligence that can be used to uncover complex non-linear relationships between input and output variables. Here we proposed detection of VTs using a single neural network classifier, trained with a database of 228 laboratory CPET data. We tested the neural network performance against the judgement of 7 couples of board-certified exercise-physiologists on 25 CPET tests. The neural network achieved expert-level performances across the tasks (mean absolute error was 9.5% (r = 0.79) and 4.2% (r = 0.94) for VT1 and VT2, respectively). Estimation errors are compatible with the typical error of the current gold standard visual methodology. The neural network demonstrated VT detecting and exercise intensity level classifying at a high competence level. Neural networks could potentially be embedded in CPET hardware/software to extend the reach of exercise physiologists beyond their laboratories."

Identifying persons with MCI (PwMCI) from adults of a similar age without cognitive complaints is a significant challenge. The main aims of this study were to determine whether generic speech differences were evident between PwMCI and healthy controls (HC), whether such differences were identifiable in responses to recent or remote memory questions, and to determine which speech variables showed the clearest between-group differences. This study analysed recordings of 8 PwMCI (5 females, 3 males) and 14 HC of a similar age (8 females, 6 males). Participants were recorded interacting with an intelligent virtual agent: a computer-generated talking head on a computer screen which asks pre-recorded questions when prompted by the interviewee through pressing the next key on a computer keyboard. Responses to recent and remote memory questions were analysed. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test for statistically significant differences between PwMCI and HC on each of 12 speech variables, relating to temporal characteristics, number of words produced and pitch. It was found that compared to HC, PwMCI produce speech for less time and in shorter chunks, they pause more often and for longer, take longer to begin speaking and produce fewer words in their answers. It was also found that the PwMCI and HC were more alike when responding to remote memory questions than when responding to recent memory questions. These findings show great promise and suggest that detailed speech analysis can make an important contribution to diagnostic and stratification systems in patients with memory complaints."

            "abstract": "In the Republic of Korea, one of the most widely discussed subjects related to future logistics technology is the drone-based delivery (transportation) system. Much (around 75%) of Korea's territory consists of mountainous areas; however, the costs of installing internet facilities for drone landing sites are very high compared to other countries. Therefore, this paper proposes the power-line communication (PLC) system introduced in the author's previous study as an alternative solution. For the system design, a number of lightning rods are used together with a monitoring system. The system algorithm performs substantial data analysis. Also, as the author found that instantaneous high-voltage currents were a major cause of fire incidents, a three-phase three-wire connection was used for the installation of the lightning rods (Bipolar Conventional Air Terminal). Thus, based on the PLC technology, an artificial intelligence (AI) which avoids lightning strikes at the drone landing site by interworking with a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system when a drone flies over the mountain regions is proposed in this paper. The algorithm was implemented with C++ and Unity/C#, whereas the application for the part concerning the integrated sensing was developed with Java Android."

Large pollen loads were more likely to initiate fruit production than small pollen loads, and the former fruits contained more seeds and a greater total seed mass. No further increases in seed number or mass occurred for pollen loads above 4,000 grains. The weight of individual seeds was unaffected by pollen load. Effects of pollen donor were generally larger than effects of pollen load, and fruit production from small loads of pollen from one donor were sometimes equal to fruit production from larger pollen loads from another donor. The ratio of pollen grains deposited to resultant seeds increased with pollen load, and several explanations are proposed. Seeds from heavy pollinations emerged better than seeds from light pollinations, but did not differ in speed of germination or in the performance of seedlings up to 126 days. The emergence differences are probably due to differing intensities of pollen tube competition."

Breaking news of the Zika outbreak for instance, made it to the main media titles internationally. Perceiving disease risks motivate people to adapt their behavior toward a safer and more protective lifestyle. Computational science is instrumental in exploring patterns of disease spread emerging from many individual decisions and interactions among agents and their environment by means of agent-based models. Yet, current disease models rarely consider simulating dynamics in risk perception and its impact on the adaptive protective behavior. Social sciences offer insights into individual risk perception and corresponding protective actions, while machine learning provides algorithms and methods to capture these learning processes. This article presents an innovative approach to extend agent-based disease models by capturing behavioral aspects of decision-making in a risky context using machine learning techniques. We illustrate it with a case of cholera in Kumasi, Ghana, accounting for spatial and social risk factors that affect intelligent behavior and corresponding disease incidents.

            "abstract": "Recognizing complex human activities usually requires the detection and modeling of individual visual features and the interactions between them. Current methods only rely on the visual features extracted from 2-D images, and therefore often lead to unreliable salient visual feature detection and inaccurate modeling of the interaction context between individual features. In this paper, we show that these problems can be addressed by combining data from a conventional camera and a depth sensor (e.g., Microsoft Kinect). We propose a novel complex activity recognition and localization framework that effectively fuses information from both grayscale and depth image channels at multiple levels of the video processing pipeline. In the individual visual feature detection level, depth-based filters are applied to the detected human/object rectangles to remove false detections. In the next level of interaction modeling, 3-D spatial and temporal contexts among human subjects or objects are extracted by integrating information from both grayscale and depth images. Depth information is also utilized to distinguish different types of indoor scenes. Finally, a latent structural model is developed to integrate the information from multiple levels of video processing for an activity detection. Extensive experiments on two activity recognition benchmarks (one with depth information) and a challenging grayscale + depth human activity database that contains complex interactions between human-human, human-object, and human-surroundings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multilevel grayscale + depth fusion scheme. Higher recognition and localization accuracies are obtained relative to the previous methods."

However, when a robot interacts with several people, neurorobotics plays an important role to determine the person to look at and those to pay attention to among the others. There are several factors which can influence the decision: who is speaking, who he/she is speaking to, where people are looking, if the user wants to attract attention, etc. This article presents a novel method to decide who to pay attention to when a robot interacts with several people. The proposed method is based on a competitive network that receives different stimuli (look, speak, pose, hoard conversation, habituation, etc.) that compete with each other to decide who to pay attention to. The dynamic nature of this neural network allows a smooth transition in the focus of attention to a significant change in stimuli. A conversation is created between different participants, replicating human behavior in the robot. The method deals with the problem of several interlocutors appearing and disappearing from the visual field of the robot. A robotic head has been designed and built and a virtual agent projected on the robot's face display has been integrated with the gaze control. Different experiments have been carried out with that robotic head integrated into a ROS architecture model. The work presents the analysis of the method, how the system has been integrated with the robotic head and the experiments and results obtained."

Thus, maintaining targeted glycemic control by BOT is limited in some patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of replacing basal insulin by sitagliptin therapy in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients on BOT. Forty-nine subjects were sequentially recruited for the 52-week, prospective, single arm study. Patients on BOT therapy were switched from basal insulin to sitagliptin. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c in 52 weeks. The secondary endpoints were dropout rate, changes in body weight, frequency of hypoglycemia, and relationship between change in HbA1c and insulin secretion capacity evaluated by glucagon loading test. The average dose of basal insulin was 15.0±8.4 units. Sixteen subjects (31.3%) were dropped because replacement by sitagliptin was less effective for glycemic control. In these subjects, diabetes duration was longer, FPG and HbA1c at baseline were higher, and insulin secretion capacity was lower. Change in HbA1c in 52 weeks was - 4 mmol/mol (95% CI - 5 to - 4 mmol/mol) (p<0.05). Change in body weight was - 0.71 kg (95% CI - 1.42 to - 0.004 kg) (p<0.05). Frequency of hypoglycemia was decreased from 1.21±1.05 to 0.06±0.24 times/month. HbA1c level was improved if C-peptide index (CPI) was over 1.19. In conclusion, basal insulin in BOT can be replaced by sitagliptin with a decrease in HbA1c level and frequency of hypoglycemia in cases where insulin secretion capacity was sufficiently preserved."

But, finding people and localizing their limbs is hard because people can move fast and unpredictably, can appear in a variety of poses and clothes, and are often surrounded by limb-like clutter. We develop a completely automatic system that works in two stages; it first builds a model of appearance of each person in a video and then it tracks by detecting those models in each frame (\"tracking by model-building and detection\"). We develop two algorithms that build models; one bottom-up approach groups together candidate body parts found throughout a sequence. We also describe a top-down approach that automatically builds people-models by detecting convenient key poses within a sequence. We finally show that building a discriminative model of appearance is quite helpful since it exploits structure in a background (without background-subtraction). We demonstrate the resulting tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames of unscripted indoor and outdoor activity, a feature-length film (\"Run Lola Run\"), and legacy sports footage (from the 2002 World Series and 1998 Winter Olympics). Experiments suggest that our system 1) can count distinct individuals, 2) can identify and track them, 3) can recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view, 4) can identify body configuration accurately, and 5) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

Overall, there are examples of microbes impacting every phenological transition. While most studies have focused on flowering time, microbial effects remain important for host survival and fitness across all phenological phases. Microbe-mediated changes in nutrient acquisition and phytohormone signaling can release plants from stressful conditions and alter plant stress responses inducing shifts in developmental events. The frequency and direction of phenological effects appear to be partly determined by the lifestyle and the underlying nature of a plant-microbe interaction (i.e., mutualistic or pathogenic), in addition to the taxonomic group of the microbe (fungi vs. bacteria).

A total of 740 participants (51.3% male and 48.7% female) structured with 2 sections, first with general demographic information and second with more targeted questions for each demographic were surveyed. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and General Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7) standard scales were utilized to measure the stress, sleep disorders and anxiety. Experimental results showed positive correlation between PSQI and GAD-7 scores for the participants. After adjusting for age and gender, occupation does not have an effect on sleep quality (PSQI), but it does have an effect on anxiety (GAD-7). Student community in spite of less susceptible to COVID-19 infection found to be highly prone to psychopathy mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the connectivity between lower social status and mental health issues. Random Forest model for college students indicates clearly the stress induced factors as anxiety score, worry about inability to understand concepts taught online, involvement of parents, college hours, worrying about other work load and deadlines for the young students studying in Universities."

Cox regression analysis of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year patient survival, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year censored kidney transplant survival, and 1-year, 3-year and 5-year uncensored kidney transplant survival was performed. First, the body mass index (BMI), psoas muscle index (PMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) served as independent variates. Second, the cut-off values for sarcopenia and obesity served as independent variates. The 1-year uncensored and censored kidney transplant survival was influenced by reduced PMI (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively) and reduced SMI (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively); 3-year uncensored kidney transplant survival was influenced by increased VAT (p = 0.04); and 3-year censored kidney transplant survival was influenced by reduced SMI (p = 0.05). Additionally, sarcopenia influenced 1-year uncensored kidney transplant survival (p = 0.05), whereas obesity influenced 3-year and 5-year uncensored kidney transplant survival. In summary, AI-based body composition analysis may aid in predicting short- and long-term kidney transplant survival."

            "abstract": "With the online presence of more than half the world population, social media plays a very important role in the lives of individuals as well as businesses alike. Social media enables businesses to advertise their products, build brand value, and reach out to their customers. To leverage these social media platforms, it is important for businesses to process customer feedback in the form of posts and tweets. Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotion, either positive, negative or neutral, associated with these social media texts. The presence of sarcasm in texts is the main hindrance in the performance of sentiment analysis. Sarcasm is a linguistic expression often used to communicate the opposite of what is said, usually something that is very unpleasant, with an intention to insult or ridicule. Inherent ambiguity in sarcastic expressions make sarcasm detection very difficult. In this work, we focus on detecting sarcasm in textual conversations from various social networking platforms and online media. To this end, we develop an interpretable deep learning model using multi-head self-attention and gated recurrent units. The multi-head self-attention module aids in identifying crucial sarcastic cue-words from the input, and the recurrent units learn long-range dependencies between these cue-words to better classify the input text. We show the effectiveness of our approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets from social networking platforms and online media. Models trained using our proposed approach are easily interpretable and enable identifying sarcastic cues in the input text which contribute to the final classification score. We visualize the learned attention weights on a few sample input texts to showcase the effectiveness and interpretability of our model."

Meanwhile, multimorbidity and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), lead to global public health and resource limitations. We introduce a novel user-centered paradigm of ageing based on wearable-driven artificial intelligence (AI) that may harness the autonomy and independence that accompany functional limitation or disability, and possibly elevate life expectancy in older adults and people with PD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ActiveAgeing is a 4-year, multicentre, mixed method, cyclic study that combines digital phenotyping via commercial devices (Empatica E4, Fitbit Sense, and Oura Ring) with traditional evaluation (clinical assessment scales, in-depth interviews, and clinical consultations) and includes four types of participants: (1) people with PD and (2) their informal caregiver; (3) healthy older adults from the Helgetun living environment in Norway, and (4) people on the Helgetun waiting list. For the first study, each group will be represented by N = 15 participants to test the data acquisition and to determine the sample size for the second study. To suggest lifestyle changes, modules for human expert-based advice, machine-generated advice, and self-generated advice from accessible data visualization will be designed.

Each time a disk reappeared on the screen its position was randomly varied. As in a videogame, participants had to click on the disks to increase their score. The results showed that, even in the case of such a simple system, subjects believed that the figural elements they were interacting with had some form of mental states, although their confidence in these beliefs varied in the different experimental conditions. The confidence level of the attributions, in fact, was not the same for all the different mental states considered, and it varied also both with the number of elements being displayed as well as with some personality traits of the subjects."

At baseline, participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs. charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of the study, participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not receiving a self-monitoring prompt. Primary outcome was the achievement of personalized daily step goals.\n## RESULTS\nStudy participants were more active and healthier than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives increased step-goal achievement by 8.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 14.1] and, only in the no-incentive control group, action planning increased step-goal achievement by 5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2, 10.4].

India has the world's largest population aged between 10 and 40 years. At the same time, India has a large number of individuals with diabetes, hypertension and kidney diseases, who are at a high risk of developing COVID-19. A vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, may offer immediate protection from the causative agent of COVID-19, however, the protective memory may be short-lived. Even if vaccination is broadly successful in the world, India has a large and diverse population with over one-third being below the poverty line. Therefore, the success of a vaccine, even when one becomes available, is uncertain, making it necessary to focus on alternate approaches of tackling the disease. In this review, we discuss the differences in COVID-19 death/infection ratio between urban and rural India; and the probable role of the immune system, co-morbidities and associated nutritional status in dictating the death rate of COVID-19 patients in rural and urban India. Also, we focus on strategies for developing masks, vaccines, diagnostics and the role of drugs targeting host-virus protein-protein interactions in enhancing host immunity. We also discuss India's strengths including the resources of medicinal plants, good food habits and the role of information technology in combating COVID-19.

Volleyball is one of the most popular sports in the world. It attracts people all over the world with its strong team appeal and its own unique charm. This study mainly discusses the characteristics of shoulder joint dysfunction in volleyball players and the effect of rehabilitation training under the background of artificial intelligence. By sorting out the development process of artificial intelligence technology, it can be analyzed that artificial intelligence technology already has a certain knowledge reserve, can make corresponding mechanized feedback, and can make correct judgments based on experience in more complex situations. This study compared volleyball athletes with handicap and barrier-free shoulder joints and observed the characteristics of shoulder pain, stability, and flexibility caused by subacromial impingement syndrome. It also looked at whether subacromial impingement syndrome athletes differ in volleyball spiking sequence and mobilization and recruitment of muscle power during swing spikes compared to athletes with normal shoulder function in the full kinetic chain. According to the volleyball intelligent competition platform, the implementation and application of ideas such as data collection, result feedback, adjustment of training plan, implementation of training plan, and real-time monitoring are regularly monitored. On the one hand, through timely assessment and detection of shoulder function of volleyball players, functional training is carried out for weaknesses to prevent injury; on the other hand, after a mild injury occurs, timely targeted training should be taken to find and correct wrong actions, and strengthen the weak part of muscle strength, so as to reduce the probability of repeated injury and improve sports performance and athletic ability. In the new system, after collecting and sorting, testers can directly upload to the web page in the form of Excel for automatic filling, grasp the test information of athletes in time, generate automatic warning, and save time. The monitoring content determined by this study mainly includes three index systems, including load, training preparation performance, and recovery. According to the self-provided evaluation system of relevant test equipment and the experience of expert coaches, the evaluation standards for each index are formulated. There was a statistically significant difference in the scores between the rehabilitation group and the pre-rehabilitation group during the study (P < 0.05). This study attempts to find the characteristics and rules of FMS scores of women's volleyball players of different levels, so as to provide more targeted physical training for volleyball players, promote the all-round development of physical fitness, and avoid the risk of sports injuries. This study provides more effective and comprehensive recommendations for the prevention and recovery of shoulder injuries in volleyball players.

            "abstract": "Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user's access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user's behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA's utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings."

Responses may also depend on when in the life cycle stress occurs. Here, it is predicted that the timing of initiation of a stress, defoliation, would affect the pattern of plastic responses. These differences should occur because some components of reproduction, such as flower number, are determined earlier in a plant's life than others, such as individual seed mass.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To test this prediction, 50 % artificial defoliation treatments were initiated at four different times for Sesbania macrocarpa and S. vesicaria.

Stangeria represents an isolated southern African cycad lineage previously thought to be wind-pollinated. Unlike in most other cycads, there is no evidence of cone thermogenesis in Stangeria. We found that the scent of both male and female Stangeria cones mimics that of fermented fruit, the main volatiles being esters of acetic acid, ketones, and aldehydes. We found a large variety of insect visitors on the cones, the most common ones being sap and rove beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae) and fruit flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Of these, only sap beetles (Nitidulidae) were able to effect pollination under experimental conditions. Because sap beetles are also pollinators of Cycas and members of several ancient angiosperm families, their role in the pollination of Stangeria adds interesting details to the role this group of insects has played in the history of plant-pollinator interactions."

However, complex individual variations in dietary behaviours, genotypes, gene expression and composition of the microbiome are increasingly recognised. Advances in digital tools and artificial intelligence can help individuals more easily track nutrient intakes and identify nutritional gaps. However, the influence of these nutrients on health outcomes can vary widely among individuals depending upon life stage, genetics and microbial composition. For example, folate may elicit favourable epigenetic effects on brain development during a critical developmental time window of pregnancy. Genes affecting vitamin B12 metabolism may lead to cardiometabolic traits that play an essential role in the context of obesity. Finally, an individual's gut microbial composition can determine their response to dietary fibre interventions during weight loss. These recent advances in understanding can lead to a more complete and integrated approach to promoting optimal health through personalised nutrition, in clinical practice settings and for individuals in their daily lives. The purpose of this review is to summarise presentations made during the DSM Science and Technology Award Symposium at the 13th European Nutrition Conference, which focused on personalised nutrition and novel technologies for health in the modern world."

            "abstract": "Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to rely on colonoscopy and/or fecal occult blood testing since other (non-invasive) risk-stratification systems have not yet been implemented into European guidelines. In this study, we evaluate the potential of machine learning (ML) methods to predict advanced adenomas (AAs) in 5862 individuals participating in a screening program for colorectal cancer. Adenomas were diagnosed histologically with an AA being ≥ 1 cm in size or with high-grade dysplasia/villous features being present. Logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms were evaluated for AA prediction. The mean age was 58.7 ± 9.7 years with 2811 males (48.0%), 1404 (24.0%) of whom suffered from obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), 871 (14.9%) from diabetes, and 2095 (39.1%) from metabolic syndrome. An adenoma was detected in 1884 (32.1%), as well as AAs in 437 (7.5%). Modelling 36 laboratory parameters, eight clinical parameters, and data on eight food types/dietary patterns, moderate accuracy in predicting AAs with XGBoost and LR (AUC-ROC of 0.65-0.68) could be achieved. Limiting variables to established risk factors for AAs did not significantly improve performance. Moreover, subgroup analyses in subjects without genetic predispositions, in individuals aged 45-80 years, or in gender-specific analyses showed similar results. In conclusion, ML based on point-prevalence laboratory and clinical information does not accurately predict AAs."

            "abstract": "In rehabilitation from neuromuscular trauma or injury, strengthening exercises are often prescribed by physical therapists to recover as much function as possible. Strengthening equipment used in clinical settings range from low-cost devices, such as sandbag weights or elastic bands to large and expensive isotonic and isokinetic devices. The low-cost devices are incapable of measuring strength gains and apply resistance based on the lowest level of torque that is produced by a muscle group. Resistance that varies with joint angle can be achieved with isokinetic devices in which angular velocity is held constant and variable torque is generated when the patient attempts to move faster than the device but are ineffective if a patient cannot generate torque rapidly. In this paper, we report the development of a versatile rehabilitation device that can be used to strengthen different muscle groups based on the torque generating capability of the muscle that changes with joint angle. The device is low cost, is smaller than other commercially available machines, and can be programmed to apply resistance that is unique to a particular patient and that will optimize strengthening. The core of the device, a damper with smart magnetorheological fluids, provides passive exercise force. A digital adaptive control is capable of regulating exercise force precisely following the muscle strengthening profile prescribed by a physical therapist. The device could be programmed with artificial intelligence to dynamically adjust the target force profile to optimize rehabilitation effects. The device provides both isometric and isokinetic strength training and can be developed into a small, low-cost device that may be capable of providing optimal strengthening in the home."

However, without adequate recognition of individual differences, these guidelines may be applied using an approach that \"one-size-fits-all.\" Within the shifting paradigm toward an increasingly personalized approach to medicine and health, it is apparent that fitness components display a significant age-related increase in variability. Therefore, it is both logical and necessary to perform an accurate individualized assessment of multiple fitness components prior to optimal prescription for a personalized exercise program.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of the study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel tool able to remotely assess balance, flexibility, and strength using smartphone sensors (accelerometer/gyroscope), and subsequently deliver personalized exercise programs via the smartphone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled 52 healthy volunteers (34 females) aged 65+ years, with normal cognition and low fall risk.

Programs included graded exercises for upper/lower body, flexibility, strength, and balance (dynamic, static, and vestibular).

Exposure of these fruit to different concentrations of exogenous ethylene showed that flesh softening, volatile biosynthesis, and starch degradation, had differing ethylene sensitivity and dependency. Early ripening events such as the conversion of starch to sugars showed a low dependency for ethylene, but a high sensitivity to low concentrations of ethylene (0.01 microl l(-1)). By contrast, later ripening events such as flesh softening and ester volatile production showed a high dependency for ethylene but were less sensitive to low concentrations (needing 0.1 microl l(-1) for a response). A sustained exposure to ethylene was required to maintain ripening, indicating that the role of ethylene may go beyond that of ripening initiation. These results suggest a conceptual model for the control of individual ripening characters in apple, based on both ethylene dependency and sensitivity."

In order to verify whether fruit water status is an important driver of carbohydrate composition in tomato fruit, an adaptation of the SUGAR model proposed previously by M. Génard and M. Souty was used. Two versions of the model, with or without integrating the influence of fruit water content on carbohydrate metabolism, were proposed and then assessed with the data sets from two genotypes, Levovil and Cervil, grown under different conditions. The results showed that, for both genotypes, soluble sugars and starch were better fitted by the model when the effects of water content on carbohydrate metabolism were taken into consideration. Water content might play a regulatory role in the carbon metabolism from sugars to compounds other than sugars and starch in Cervil fruit, and from sugars to starch in Levovil fruit. While water content influences tomato fruit carbohydrate concentrations by both metabolism and dilution/dehydration effects in the early developmental stage, it is mainly by dilution/dehydration effects in the late stage. The possible mechanisms underlying the effect of the fruit water content on carbohydrate metabolism are also discussed."

Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma-linolenic and palmitic acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively. Palmitic acid, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium explained >30%, followed by Bacteroides group with 20% and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) almost with 15% of importance.

However, the development of such a closed-loop regulatory system to date has been hampered by two main issues: 1) the limited knowledge on the complex human physiological process of glucose-insulin metabolism that prevents a precise modeling of the biological blood glucose control loop; and 2) the vast metabolic biodiversity of the diabetic population due to varying exogneous and endogenous disturbances such as food intake, exercise, stress, and hormonal factors, etc. In addition, current attempts of closed-loop glucose regulatory techniques generally require some form of prior meal announcement and this constitutes a severe limitation to the applicability of such systems. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent insulin schedule based on the pseudo self-evolving cerebellar model articulation controller (PSECMAC) associative learning memory model that emulates the healthy human insulin response to food ingestion. The proposed PSECMAC intelligent insulin schedule requires no prior meal announcement and delivers the necessary insulin dosage based only on the observed blood glucose fluctuations. Using a simulated healthy subject, the proposed PSECMAC insulin schedule is demonstrated to be able to accurately capture the complex human glucose-insulin dynamics and robustly addresses the intraperson metabolic variability. Subsequently, the PSECMAC intelligent insulin schedule is employed on a group of type-1 diabetic patients to regulate their impaired blood glucose levels. Preliminary simulation results are highly encouraging. The work reported in this paper represents a major paradigm shift in the management of diabetes where patient compliance is poor and the need for prior meal announcement under current treatment regimes poses a significant challenge to an active lifestyle."

Application of new technologies utilizing artificial intelligence techniques have shown promising potential for tailoring predictive medicine to the individual patient, but further validation of their role in clinical decision-making is warranted. In the meantime, individuals with IMIDs should be encouraged to adopt behavioral interventions targeting at modifiable lifestyle CVD risk factors, whereas rheumatologists need to be well aware of the unfavorable effects of antirheumatic medication on various CVD risk factors and outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many universities to transition rapidly to delivering online education. However, little is known about the impact of this drastic change on students' school adaptation. This cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire, including assessments of impressions of online education, study engagement, mental health, and lifestyle habits. In total, 1,259 students were assessed. The characteristics of school adaptation were analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The proportion of mental health problems was compared among different groups based on a cluster analysis. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of cluster membership. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The two-step cluster analysis determined three clusters: school adaptation group, school maladaptation group, and school over-adaptation group. The last group significantly exhibited the most mental health problems. Membership of this group was significantly associated with being female (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.06-1.91), being older (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.01-1.44), those who considered online education to be less beneficial (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.64-2.88), shorter sleep time on weekdays (OR = 0.826; 95% CI 0.683-.998), longer sleep time on holidays (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.03-1.43), and worse restorative sleep (OR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.81-2.86). The results suggest that academic staff should understand distinctive features of school adaptation owing to the rapid transition of the educational system and should develop support systems to improve students' mental health.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite their increasing prevalence and potential, eHealth applications for behavior change suffer from a lack of adherence and from dropout. Advances in virtual coach technology provide new opportunities to improve this. However, these applications still do not always offer what people need. We, therefore, need a better understanding of people's needs and how to address these, based on both actual experiences of users and their reflections on envisioned scenarios.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a longitudinal study in which 671 smokers interacted with a virtual coach in five sessions. The virtual coach assigned them a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking or increasing physical activity in each session. Participants provided feedback on the activity in the next session. After the five sessions, participants were asked to describe barriers and motivators for doing their activities. In addition, they provided their views on videos of scenarios such as receiving motivational messages. To understand users' needs, we took a mixed-methods approach. This approach triangulated findings from qualitative data, quantitative data, and the literature.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 14 main themes that describe people's views of their current and future behaviors concerning an eHealth application. These themes relate to the behaviors themselves, the users, other parties involved in a behavior, and the environment. The most prevalent theme was the perceived usefulness of behaviors, especially whether they were informative, helpful, motivating, or encouraging. The timing and intensity of behaviors also mattered. With regards to the users, their perceived importance of and motivation to change, autonomy, and personal characteristics were major themes. Another important role was played by other parties that may be involved in a behavior, such as general practitioners or virtual coaches. Here, the themes of companionableness, accountability, and nature of the other party (i.e., human vs AI) were relevant. The last set of main themes was related to the environment in which a behavior is performed. Prevalent themes were the availability of sufficient time, the presence of prompts and triggers, support from one's social environment, and the diversity of other environmental factors. We provide recommendations for addressing each theme.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The integrated method of experience-based and envisioning-based needs acquisition with a triangulate analysis provided a comprehensive needs classification (empirically and theoretically grounded). We expect that our themes and recommendations for addressing them will be helpful for designing applications for health behavior change that meet people's needs. Designers should especially focus on the perceived usefulness of application components. To aid future work, we publish our dataset with user characteristics and 5,074 free-text responses from 671 people."

            "abstract": "The rare endemic Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii (Jones cycladenia) has low levels of sexual reproduction. Enzyme electrophoresis was used to explore possible causes of low seed set and high fruit abortion by assessing the clonal structure and genetic diversity in populations. The seven populations studied were composed of multiple, highly interdigitated clones; thus low fruit set is not likely to be due to a scarcity of mates. Genotype frequencies did not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, suggesting that populations are not highly inbred. Jones cycladenia exhibited high levels of genetic diversity at both the population level (A = 1.7; P = 37; He = 0.14) and the taxon level (A = 2.7; P = 60) in comparison to other plants. These data suggest that genetic drift is unlikely to have left this taxon genetically depauperate. Furthermore, we detected little divergence among geographically disjunct populations of Jones cycladenia (FST = 0.10). In comparison, Jones cycladenia populations were highly differentiated from a population of the taxon's close relative, C. h. var. humilis (mean genetic identity = 0.76). Our study suggests that other reasons for low fruit set in Jones cycladenia, such as resource or pollinator limitation, or genetic load, should be explored in future research."

(Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 37:1874-1886, 2011) studied relative-frequency judgments of items drawn from two distinct categories. The experiments showed that the judged frequencies of categories of sequentially encountered stimuli are affected by the properties of the experienced sequences. Specifically, a first-run effect was observed, whereby people overestimated the frequency of a given category when that category was the first repeated category to occur in the sequence. Here, we (1) interpret these findings as reflecting the operation of a judgment heuristic sensitive to sequential patterns, (2) present mathematical definitions of the sequences used in Kusev et al. (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 37:1874-1886, 2011), and (3) present a mathematical formalization of the first-run effect-the judgments-relative-to-patterns model-to account for the judged frequencies of sequentially encountered stimuli. The model parameter w accounts for the effect of the length of the first run on frequency estimates, given the total sequence length. We fitted data from Kusev et al. (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 37:1874-1886, 2011) to the model parameters, so that with increasing values of w, subsequent items in the first run have less influence on judgments. We see the role of the model as essential for advancing knowledge in the psychology of judgments, as well as in other disciplines, such as computer science, cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction."

Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia.

Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species.

            "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with sleep-related phenotypes (SRPs). The fact that whether they share a common genetic etiology remains largely unknown. We explored the shared genetics and causality between AD and SRPs by using high-definition likelihood (HDL), cross-phenotype association study (CPASSOC), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), and bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) in summary-level data for AD (N = 455,258) and summary-level data for seven SRPs (sample size ranges from 359,916 to 1,331,010). AD shared a strong genetic basis with insomnia (r g = 0.20; p = 9.70 × 10-5), snoring (r g = 0.13; p = 2.45 × 10-3), and sleep duration (r g = -0.11; p = 1.18 × 10-3). The CPASSOC identifies 31 independent loci shared between AD and SRPs, including four novel shared loci. Functional analysis and the TWAS showed shared genes were enriched in liver, brain, breast, and heart tissues and highlighted the regulatory roles of immunological disorders, very-low-density lipoprotein particle clearance, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, and positive regulation of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified three potential drug target genes (APOE, MARK4, and HLA-DRA) that interacted with known FDA-approved drug target genes. The CPASSOC and TWAS demonstrated three regions 11p11.2, 6p22.3, and 16p11.2 may account for the shared basis between AD and sleep duration or snoring. MR showed insomnia had a causal effect on AD (ORIVW = 1.02, P IVW = 6.7 × 10-6), and multivariate MR suggested a potential role of sleep duration and major depression in this association. Our findings provide strong evidence of shared genetics and causation between AD and sleep abnormalities and advance our understanding of the genetic overlap between them. Identifying shared drug targets and molecular pathways can be beneficial for treating AD and sleep disorders more efficiently."

            "abstract": "A number of news items and case reports describing complex behaviours (e.g. sleep driving, sleep cooking, sleep eating, sleep conversations, sleep sex) associated with the use of hypnosedative medications have recently received considerable attention. Regulatory agencies examining these reports have subsequently issued warnings regarding the potential of hypnosedative agents to produce complex behaviours. Despite these warnings, little is known about the likelihood, presentation, treatment or prevention of hypnosedative-induced complex behaviours. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the clinical presentation, incidence, mechanism and management of sleep-related behaviours induced by nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists (NBRAs).Review of the literature identified ten published case reports of NBRA-induced complex behaviours involving 17 unique patients. Fifteen of the 17 patients described in the case reports had taken zolpidem, one had taken zaleplon and one had taken zopiclone. The complex behaviours most commonly reported were sleep eating, sleepwalking with object manipulation, sleep conversations, sleep driving, sleep sex and sleep shopping. Elevated serum concentrations resulting from increased medication dose or drug-drug interactions appeared to play a role in some but not all cases. Sex, age, previous medication exposure and concomitant disease states were not consistently found to be related to the risk of experiencing a medication-induced complex behaviour.From a pharmacological standpoint, enhancement of GABA activity at GABAA receptors (particularly alpha1-GABAA receptors) is a possible mechanism for hypnosedative complex behaviours and amnesia. Evidence suggests that complex behaviour risk may increase with both dose and binding affinity at alpha1-GABAA receptors. The amnesia that accompanies complex behaviours is possibly due to inhibition of consolidation of short- to long-term memory, suggesting that the risk may extend to non-GABAergic hypnosedatives. While amnesia and GABA-related receptor actions are the most frequently discussed mechanisms for complex behaviours in the literature, they do not fully explain such behaviours, suggesting that other mechanisms and factors probably play a role.A number of potential strategies are available to manage or prevent hypnosedative-induced complex behaviours. These include lowering the dose of, or stopping, the offending hypnosedative, switching to a different hypnosedative, treating patients with other classes of medications, using nonpharmacological treatment strategies for patients with sleep disorders, examining drug regimens for potential drug interactions that may predispose patients to experiencing complex behaviours, administering hypnosedative medications appropriately and selecting patients more carefully for treatment in terms of their likelihood of experiencing medication adverse effects."

            "abstract": "The distribution of saltmarsh dodder (Cuscuta salina) worldwide is restricted to areas of high salinity, where it parasitizes a variety of salt-tolerant plants. Because dodders do not maintain root connections to the soil, this pattern of parasitization may be related to the effects of salt stress on the host that increase the ability of attached dodders to more easily transfer host contents. This study explored whether a saline host environment is required for successful infection and whether stem contents of potential hosts become more concentrated in response to salinity. Fecundity of dodder was highest when hosts (Beta vulgaris) were grown either without salt or at high (250 mmol/L) salinity; it produced significantly fewer flowers and fruit at intermediate salinities. Stem constituents of two unparasitized host species had high conductivity and elevated levels of dissolved sugars at increasing salinities. Nitrate content of stems was also increased by salinity, but declined at the extreme salinity (400 mmol/L). Salinity effects on host suitability may partially explain differences in growth and vigor of C. salina in certain areas of salt marsh, but information on nonrandom dispersal of C. salina seeds may be needed to fully explain this parasite's distribution."

In the literature there are several regularization parameter selection methods for Tikhonov regularization problems (e.g., the discrepancy principle and the generalized cross-validation method). However, to our knowledge, these selection methods have not been applied to TV regularization problems. The main aim of this paper is to develop a fast TV image restoration method with an automatic selection of the regularization parameter scheme to restore blurred and noisy images. The method exploits the generalized cross-validation (GCV) technique to determine inexpensively how much regularization to use in each restoration step. By updating the regularization parameter in each iteration, the restored image can be obtained. Our experimental results for testing different kinds of noise show that the visual quality and SNRs of images restored by the proposed method is promising. We also demonstrate that the method is efficient, as it can restore images of size 256 x 256 in approximately 20 s in the MATLAB computing environment."

In this species, these imbalances can be related to differences in two growth characteristics, fruit growth duration until reaching a given size and fruit abortion. Both are related to distribution, and environmental factors as well as canopy architecture play a key role in their differentiation. Furthermore, events leading to a fruit reaching its harvestable size before or simultaneously with a prior fruit can be observed. Functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) allow for interactions between environmental factors, canopy architecture and physiological processes. Here, we tested hypotheses which account for these interactions by introducing dominance and abortion thresholds for the partitioning of assimilates between growing fruits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using the L-System formalism, an FSPM was developed which combined a model for architectural development, a biochemical model of photosynthesis and a model for assimilate partitioning, the last including a fruit growth model based on a size-related potential growth rate (R(P)). Starting from a distribution proportional to R(P), the model was extended by including abortion and dominance. Abortion was related to source strength and dominance to sink strength.

Expression levels of CsMYB60 and the key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were higher in black-spine inbred lines than that in white-spine lines at different developmental stages. The insertion of a Mutator-like element (CsMULE) in the second intron of CsMYB60 decreased its expression in a white-spine line. Transient overexpression assays indicated that CsMYB60 is a key regulatory gene and Cs4CL is a key structural gene in the pigmentation of black spines. In addition, the DNA methylation level in the CsMYB60 promoter was much lower in the black-spine line compared with white-spine line.

            "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are chronic medical conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accurate macronutrient and energy estimation could be beneficial in attempts to manage DM and obesity, leading to improved glycemic control and weight reduction, respectively. Existing dietary assessment methods are subject to major errors in measurement, are time consuming, are costly, and do not provide real-time feedback. The increasing adoption of smartphones and artificial intelligence, along with the advances in algorithms and hardware, allowed the development of technologies executed in smartphones that use food/beverage multimedia data as an input, and output information about the nutrient content in almost real time. Scope of this review was to explore the various image-based and video-based systems designed for dietary assessment. We identified 22 different systems and divided these into three categories on the basis of their setting for evaluation: laboratory (12), preclinical (7), and clinical (3). The major findings of the review are that there is still a number of open research questions and technical challenges to be addressed and end users-including health care professionals and patients-need to be involved in the design and development of such innovative solutions. Last, there is a clear need that these systems should be validated under unconstrained real-life conditions and that they should be compared with conventional methods for dietary assessment."

            "abstract": "The incorporation of telemedicine and artificial intelligence for early screening and assessment of severity of life-style disorders has a great potential for better assessment in a busy outpatient clinic and thereby curtail down the related morbidities. A computer based algorithm based upon standardized questionnaire (from established assessment tools) is designed to assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). In addition the incorporation of basic screening questions of anamnesis help in suggesting a probable diagnosis of sleep related disorder as well. The overall data at our center has been analyzed to establish the existing pattern of sleep related disorders. Of 850 healthy subjects screened, prevalence of snoring was 20.47% while OSAS was seen in 4.20% (N = 25) in males and 2.64% (N = 8) in females. The parasomnia was most prevalent (14.71%), followed by insomnia (10.24%), periodic leg movement (6.59%), bruxism (1.65%) and narcolepsy (0.59%). Hypertension, laryngopharyngeal reflux and obesity were the common co-morbidities in OSAS while family history of hypertension and diabetes were common in snorers. A significant association with OSA was seen with diabetes mellitus, neck circumference and nasal obstruction, while, obesity and apnoeic episodes were more significantly associated with OSA than snorers. Increased waist to hip ratio was appreciated in both the OSAS and snorers. The algorithm based online assessment is likely to diagnose the occult clinical cases as well as assess the risk of OSAS. In routine outpatient clinic, a clinician may better assess the patient morbidity with a comprehensive availability of symptoms and moreover enhance the post-treatment compliance. In addition a smartphone based computerized assessment for general population may be designed for other lifestyle disorders as well."

            "abstract": "Malnutrition, including both undernutrition and obesity, is a significant problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In order to study malnutrition and develop effective intervention strategies, it is crucial to evaluate nutritional status in LMICs at the individual, household, and community levels. In a multinational research project supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we have been using a wearable technology to conduct objective dietary assessment in sub-Saharan Africa. Our assessment includes multiple diet-related activities in urban and rural families, including food sources (e.g., shopping, harvesting, and gathering), preservation/storage, preparation, cooking, and consumption (e.g., portion size and nutrition analysis). Our wearable device (\"eButton\" worn on the chest) acquires real-life images automatically during wake hours at preset time intervals. The recorded images, in amounts of tens of thousands per day, are post-processed to obtain the information of interest. Although we expect future Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to extract the information automatically, at present we utilize AI to separate the acquired images into two binary classes: images with (Class 1) and without (Class 0) edible items. As a result, researchers need only to study Class-1 images, reducing their workload significantly. In this paper, we present a composite machine learning method to perform this classification, meeting the specific challenges of high complexity and diversity in the real-world LMIC data. Our method consists of a deep neural network (DNN) and a shallow learning network (SLN) connected by a novel probabilistic network interface layer. After presenting the details of our method, an image dataset acquired from Ghana is utilized to train and evaluate the machine learning system. Our comparative experiment indicates that the new composite method performs better than the conventional deep learning method assessed by integrated measures of sensitivity, specificity, and burden index, as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve."

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is present in early stages of alcohol abuse and increases the likelihood of cardiovascular events. Given the nonlinear pattern of dynamic interaction between sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and para sympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the complex relationship with lifestyle factors, machine learning (ML) algorithms are best suited for analyzing alcohol impact over heart rate variability (HRV), because they allow the analysis of complex interactions between multiple variables. This study aimed to characterize autonomic nervous system dysfunction by analysis of HRV correlated with cardiovascular risk factors in young individuals by using machine learning. Materials and Methods: Total of 142 young adults (28.4 ± 4.34 years) agreed to participate in the study. Alcohol intake and drinking patterns were assessed by the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) questionnaire and the YAI (Yearly Alcohol Intake) index. A short 5-min HRV evaluation was performed. Post-hoc analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the impact of alcohol intake on HRV. Results: Binge drinkers presented slight modification in the frequency domain. Heavy drinkers had significantly lower time-domain values: standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD), compared to casual and binge drinkers. High frequency (HF) values were significantly lower in heavy drinkers (p = 0.002). The higher low-to-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) that we found in heavy drinkers was interpreted as parasympathetic inhibition. Gradient boosting machine learner regression showed that age and alcohol consumption had the biggest scaled impact on the analyzed HRV parameters, followed by smoking, anxiety, depression, and body mass index. Gender and physical activity had the lowest impact on HRV. Conclusions: In healthy young adults, high alcohol intake has a negative impact on HRV in both time and frequency-domains. In parameters like HRV, where a multitude of risk factors can influence measurements, artificial intelligence algorithms seem to be a viable alternative for correct assessment."

            "abstract": "Leaf blotch and stem-end rot caused by Gnomonia comari P. Karst. (anamorph, Zythia fragariae Laibach) were observed in a strawberry fruit production field at Watsonville, CA, in 1996. Z. fragariae has been known for years to attack leaves and cause leaf blotch but this is the first time that the perfect stage, G. comari, was identified and documented to infect fruits and cause stem-end rot in California. Symptoms on leaves included pin-point lesions, brownish to purplish blotches, and characteristic large V-shaped lesions. On the fruit, infection showed more frequently on the calyx. Symptoms on the calyx ranged from small lesions on the sepals to a completely infected calyx that turned necrotic and brittle. Calyx infection was observed on seemingly healthy green and ripe fruits. Infected fruits ripened prematurely and turned pale red to brownish in color. They remained firm but were often invaded by secondary organisms including Botrytis cinerea. When infected leaves and fruits were surface sterilized and incubated under humid condition, perithecia and pycnidia readily developed on the lesions. Ascospores oozed from the tip of the perithecial neck while numerous spores oozed out of the pycnidium. The pathogen was identified as G. comari based on size and morphology of the perithecia, asci, and ascospores (1), and the spores were identified as Z. fragariae based on morphology of the conidia and conidiophores (2). Both the spores and ascospores produced pycnidia and perithecia on potato dextroxe agar at room temperature. Inoculation of healthy leaves and fruits with each fungus resulted in development of symptoms of leaf blotch and stem-end rot similar to those observed in the field. G. comari and Z. fragariae were reisolated from newly developing lesions on symptomatic leaves and fruits. Since 1996, stem-end rot has been observed more frequently in fruit production areas in the central coast of California, particularly during wet years. Reference: (1) A. Bolay. Ber. Schweiz. Bot.

The application of computer vision in assisted agricultural production significantly improves work efficiency due to the rapid development of information technology and artificial intelligence. Based on object detection and stereo cameras, this paper proposes an intelligent method for vegetable recognition and size estimation. The method obtains colorful images and depth maps with a binocular stereo camera. Then detection networks classify four kinds of common vegetables (cucumber, eggplant, tomato and pepper) and locate six points for each object. Finally, the size of vegetables is calculated using the pixel position and depth of keypoints. Experimental results show that the proposed method can classify four kinds of common vegetables within 60 cm and accurately estimate their diameter and length. The work provides an innovative idea for solving the vegetable's non-contact measurement problems and can promote the application of computer vision in agricultural automation."

            "abstract": "Humans have evolved the unique capacity to efficiently communicate using the spoken word. Hearing plays a key role as a receiver in this process and dysfunction leads to difficulties in listening and communication. It is widely accepted that effective communication is not adequately captured with current behavioral speech tests that principally focus on passive sound detection and speech recognition with idealized stimuli. To address the question of what it will take to obtain more ecologically valid outcomes from behavioral speech tests, recent approaches, and test paradigms devised to address some of the acknowledged shortcomings of current speech tests were reviewed. Additionally, some recent work which has focused on understanding brain function in social and dynamic interaction scenarios, so-called second person neuroscience, was reviewed. These reviews revealed that, while recent efforts in bridging the gap between behavioral speech tests and everyday communication situations represent important steps in the right direction, they are unlikely to provide a complete account of everyday communication situations. Further, brain imaging studies, together with our growing understanding of \"mirror\" neurons and the development of theories around embodied cognition, have demonstrated that the brain networks recruited during emotionally engaged interaction between interlocutors are far more complex when compared to that of a passive listener. Speech and nonspeech (e.g., gaze direction, body posture, etc.) interactions between the interlocutors give rise to the perception of effective interaction (sense of \"agency\") and activate neural networks important in decision-making and subsequent communication interaction. Successful conversational interaction represents the negotiation of a dynamic context and the emergence of a state of shared understanding between participants. In conclusion, to achieve highly ecologically valid outcomes related to communication, future testing will most likely require an interactive or conversational paradigm to elicit the brain states that are present in everyday social interactions."

Large floral displays often attract more pollinator visits, increasing outcross pollen receipt. However, pollinators frequently probe more flowers in sequence on large displays, potentially increasing self-pollination and reducing pollen export per flower. To better understand how floral display size influences male and female fitness, we manipulated display phenotypes and then used paternity analysis to quantify siring success and selfing rates.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To facilitate unambiguous assignment of paternity, we established four replicate (cloned) arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In each array, we trimmed displays to two, four, eight or 16 flowers. When fruits ripened, we counted the number of seeds per fruit and assigned paternity to 1935 progeny.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Siring success per flower declined sharply with increasing display size, while female success per flower did not vary with display. The rate of self-fertilization increased for large floral displays, but siring losses due to geitonogamous pollen discounting were much greater than siring gains through increased self-fertilization. As display size increased, each additional seed sired through geitonogamous self-pollination was associated with a loss of 9·7 seeds sired through outcrossing.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although total fitness increased with floral display size, the marginal return on each additional flower declined steadily as display size increased.

The advantage of the proposed approach is that FS patterns can be estimated in a portable and less invasive manner. To this end, first, we developed a wearable system for measuring inertial movements of hands and then conducted an experiment where participants were asked to walk and run while wearing a smartwatch. Second, we trained and tested the captured multivariate time series signals in supervised learning settings. The experimental results obtained demonstrated high and robust classification performances (weighted-average F1 score > 90%) when recent deep neural network models, such as 1D-CNN and GRUs, were employed.

We compared our results to previous results on this species from the 1960s in order to reveal putative changes in female frequencies. Because females may be maintained in gynodioecious populations if their seed production or offspring quality is higher than that of hermaphrodites, we explored reproductive success of females and hermaphrodites in detail in 11 populations for two consecutive years. Female frequencies varied from 0.4 to 27.2%; this variation is similar to that observed in the 1960s. Contrary to previous results that indicated lower seed production in females, females produced 1.2 and 1.7 times more seeds per flower than hermaphrodites in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Females also had higher fruit set than hermaphrodites. Thus, higher seed production of females partly explains the maintenance of gynodioecy in this species. Furthermore, female frequency correlated negatively with relative seed fitness of hermaphrodites suggesting that relative seed fitness is related to population sex ratio. Female frequency and the distance of the population from the most southern population also tended to correlate positively, suggesting that harsher environmental conditions in the north may benefit female plants. Given the observed yearly variation, our results also highlight the importance of temporal variation for the relative seed fitness of females and hermaphrodites."

It is mainly composed of data collection, data processing, and medical interface design, which embeds data request, data transmission, data analysis, and detailed tasks such as data compression and storage, and functions such as data display, image drawing, and alarm notification are realized by the medical interface. When the CPAP ventilator transmits respiratory data to the local medical terminal, it sends real-time respiratory information data packets.

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of inbreeding depression are necessary in order to predict the evolutionary dynamics of a population, but many studies estimate inbreeding depression based solely on components of female function such as fruit set, seed set, and seed quality. Because total fitness is achieved through both male and female functions in hermaphroditic plants, estimates of both male and female fitness are needed to estimate accurately the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Seedlings of a wild gourd, Cucurbita pepo subsp. texana, with coefficients of inbreeding of 0 and 0.75 were planted in an experimental garden, and several components of male and female fitness were measured over the course of the growing season. Fitness in inbred plants was confounded by both maternal and genetic inbreeding effects. Inbred individuals produced significantly fewer fruits than outcrossed individuals, and percentage germination of seeds from inbred individuals was significantly lower than seeds from outcrossed individuals. Inbred plants also produced significantly fewer staminate flowers and marginally fewer and smaller pollen grains per flower. Pollen from inbred plants also grew significantly more slowly in vitro than pollen from outcrossed plants. Multiplicative estimates of inbreeding depression revealed inbreeding depression for both male and female functions in wild gourd, but inbreeding depression through female function was stronger than inbreeding depression through male function."

In medical studies and in research exceptions shall be explained. We present a system that helps to explain cases that do not fit into a theoretical hypothesis. Our starting points are situations where neither a well-developed theory nor reliable knowledge nor a proper case base is available. So, instead of reliable theoretical knowledge and intelligent experience, we have just some theoretical hypothesis and a set of measurements. In this paper, we propose to combine CBR with a statistical model. We use CBR to explain those cases that do not fit the model. The case base has to be set up incrementally, it contains the exceptional cases, and their explanations are the solutions, which can be used to help to explain further exceptional cases."

            "abstract": "Many potential applications of artificial intelligence involve making real-time decisions in physical systems while interacting with humans. Automobile racing represents an extreme example of these conditions; drivers must execute complex tactical manoeuvres to pass or block opponents while operating their vehicles at their traction limits1. Racing simulations, such as the PlayStation game Gran Turismo, faithfully reproduce the non-linear control challenges of real race cars while also encapsulating the complex multi-agent interactions. Here we describe how we trained agents for Gran Turismo that can compete with the world's best e-sports drivers. We combine state-of-the-art, model-free, deep reinforcement learning algorithms with mixed-scenario training to learn an integrated control policy that combines exceptional speed with impressive tactics. In addition, we construct a reward function that enables the agent to be competitive while adhering to racing's important, but under-specified, sportsmanship rules. We demonstrate the capabilities of our agent, Gran Turismo Sophy, by winning a head-to-head competition against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers. By describing how we trained championship-level racers, we demonstrate the possibilities and challenges of using these techniques to control complex dynamical systems in domains where agents must respect imprecisely defined human norms."

The programme was based on cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The investigation particularly focused on factors that contribute to the maintenance of insomnia and tested whether treatment effects were stable over a period of 12 months.\n## METHOD\nFifty-six participants were randomly assigned either to web-based CBT-I or to the waiting-list control group. Included measures assessed insomnia severity, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression, anxiety and somatization. In the intervention group, a sleep diary was used to assess sleep continuity parameters, sleep quality and daytime performance.\n## RESULTS\nLarge between- and within-group effect sizes (d = 1.79, d = 1.59) for insomnia severity were found. The treatment group effect remained stable over the period of 12 months. Further, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression and somatization significantly decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group. On all sleep diary parameters, medium to large effects were revealed within the treatment group. Anxiety did not decrease significantly from pre- to post-assessment. For all measures except somatization and anxiety significant within-group effects were found at 12-month follow-up assessment indicating long-lasting effects.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study adds evidence to the literature on unguided online interventions for insomnia, and indicates that online CBT-I can have substantial long-term effects on relevant sleep-related outcome parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that sleep-related cognitions and safety behaviour can be successfully altered with an unguided CBT-I intervention.\n"

We separated out the effects of resource competition during flowering from those of inflorescence architecture, as well as identified the effects of sex morph and genotype. We found position-based variation in petal length, ovule, pollen, and flower number to be influenced more by architecture than by our resource manipulations during flowering. We also found both genotype- and sex-specific intra-inflorescence patterns. Furthermore, our data indicate that the sex morph-specific intra-inflorescence patterns result from architectural modifications of the basic pattern. In fact, sex-differential intra-inflorescence patterns suggest that fitness through male and female function may be maximized by different resource distribution patterns within the inflorescence and may have been modified by past selection. Specifically, females invested heavily in ovules at positions where fruit set was most likely (primary and secondary), at the expense of flower number and allocation per flower at more distal positions. Whereas functional males invested minimally in ovules at all flower positions and produced the most abundantly flowered inflorescences, hermaphrodites, on the other hand, showed intermediate patterns, implying a compromise between sex functions. We suggest that consideration of intra-inflorescence allocation and inflorescence architecture may reveal the mechanism underlying sexual dimorphism in flower allocation and number."

The data are drawn from two Swedish television documentaries on health encounters. Three major findings are presented. Firstly, the castings of the patients into the category 'old' are in several cases embedded in metaphors that either position the patient's body in the role of a victim of old age or in the role of a machine to routinely check. Secondly, the castings with a fateful approach to old age are ambivalent; whereas they serve as resources for the health professionals' normalizing of medical projects and perspectives, they can constitute sources of problems for the patients' doctorability and/or agency. Thirdly, the health professionals' perspectivating age ascriptions are negotiable; their design facilitates resistance to them, and the patients accept, modify, interrupt or reverse them."

            "abstract": "The different weight-number strategies of seed production displayed by individuals of a Mediterranean fire-prone plant species (Cistus ladanifer) were investigated in relation to seed germination responses to pre-germination heating. A control (no heating), a high temperature during a short exposure time (100 degrees C during 5 min) and a high temperature during a long exposure time (100 degrees C during 15 min) were applied to seeds from different individual plants with different mean seed weight. These pre-germination treatments resemble natural germination scenarios for the studied species, absence of fire, typical Mediterranean shrub fire, and severe fire with high fuel load. Seed germination was related to heat treatments and seed mass. Seed heating increased the proportion of seeds germinating compared with the control treatment. Mean seed weight was positively correlated to the proportion of germinated seeds but only within heat treatments. These results suggest that in periods without fire, the relative contributions to the population dynamics are equal for all seeds, regardless of their mass, whereas heavier seeds would be the main contribution after wildfire events. Since lighter seeds can be produced in higher quantities than heavier ones within a given fruit, the number of seedlings produced per fruit depended strongly on the germination conditions. In the absence of wildfire, fruits producing lighter seeds gave rise to more seedlings; nevertheless, they were numerically exceeded by those producing heavy seeds after a wildfire. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to their consequences on the population dynamics of this species, considering also additional information on stand flammability and changes in seed mass with plant age."

            "abstract": "Colorectal Cancer (CRC) has seen a dramatic increase in incidence globally. In 2019, colorectal cancer accounted for 1.15 million deaths and 24.28 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. In India, the annual incidence rates (AARs) for colon cancer was 4.4 per 100,000. There has been a steady rise in the prevalence of CRC in India which may be attributed to urbanization, mass migration of population, westernization of diet and lifestyle practices and a rise of obesity and metabolic risk factors that place the population at a higher risk of CRC. Moreoever, CRC in India differs from that described in the Western countries, with a higher proportion of young patients and more patients presenting with an advanced stage. This may be due to poor access to specialized healthcare and socio-economic factors. Early identification of adenomatous colonic polyps, which are well-recognized pre-cancerous lesions, at the time of screening colonoscopy has been shown to be the most effective measure used for CRC prevention. However, colonic polyps are frequently missed during colonoscopy and moreover, these screening programs necessitate man-power, time and resources for processing resected polyps, that may hamper penetration and efficacy in mid- to low-income countries. In the last decade, there has been significant progress made in the automatic detection of colonic polyps by multiple AI-based systems. With the advent of better AI methodology, the focus has shifted from mere detection to accurate discrimination and diagnosis of colonic polyps. These systems, once validated, could usher in a new era in Colorectal Cancer (CRC) prevention programs which would center around \"Leave in-situ\" and \"Resect and discard\" strategies. These new strategies hinge around the specificity and accuracy of AI based systems in correctly identifying the pathological diagnosis of the polyps, thereby providing the endoscopist with real-time information in order to make a clinical decision of either leaving the lesion in-situ (mucosal polyps) or resecting and discarding the polyp (hyperplastic polyps). The major advantage of employing these strategies would be in cost optimization of CRC prevention programs while ensuring good clinical outcomes. The adoption of these AI-based systems in the national cancer prevention program of India in accordance with the mandate to increase technology integration could prove to be cost-effective and enable implementation of CRC prevention programs at the population level. This level of penetration could potentially reduce the incidence of CRC and improve patient survival by enabling early diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we will highlight key advancements made in the field of AI in the identification of polyps during colonoscopy and explore the role of AI based systems in cost optimization during the universal implementation of CRC prevention programs in the context of mid-income countries like India."

Lifestyle is a core feature of the self-management support given to people with LTCs, yet it seems to fail to meet their needs. From a larger study exploring the experiences of this group, this paper reports on the role of food and mealtimes, and the effect of the nutritional advice on the lives of people with several LTCs. METHODS The experiences of 16 people with several advanced LTCs were explored using multiple qualitative case studies. Over an 18-month period, contact with participants included monthly conversations, two longer, semi-structured interviews and one interview with their primary care clinicians. The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS There was profound social, psychological and cultural significance of food to the participants. These aspects of food were then described using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health. The approach to food and nutrition participants experienced in health care was closely associated with conventional weight management. They found this advice largely irrelevant and therefore ineffective. DISCUSSION The pressure people with several LTCs experience during clinical encounters has perverse effects on wellbeing and reinforces an overall sense of failure. This research challenges the assumption that all people have the will, agency and income to follow the advice they receive about nutrition and exercise. Considering people's needs using the Whare Tapa Wha model of health offers clinicians a framework to re-conceptualise the core features of self-management support and provide realistic, compassionate care that will optimise the quality of life for people with multiple LTCs."

Hand pollination was undertaken, developing fruits counted, thousand (seed) grain weights, and seed viability were examined. Cross pollination led to some fruit set in 36 of the 37 different combinations. Overall fruit set was virtually identical irrespective of the combination of parental plants. Mean germination rates were much higher in hybrid seeds, indicating a marked heterosis effect and the possible presence of an inbreeding depression in the source populations: In experimental hybridization the divergent taxa of Caiophora behave like isolated, inbred populations of a single species. Allopatry and different habitat preferences seem to be the key factors keeping the (interfertile) taxa of Caiophora apart in the apparent absence of both postmating isolating mechanisms and obvious isolating mechanisms in phenology and floral biology.

Although the commercially available equipment has already reached high technical levels, it does not play an important role in routine clinical applications. Due to this fact, the main arguments of the practitioners still address the practicability of the devices as well as the lack of meaningful software support for data assessment. The former concern has led to the integration of two KISTLER platforms beneath a treadmill belt in order to continuously capture 3D ground reaction force data. The latter one has prompted the development of an additional software kit, which statistically preprocesses the raw data set for further computations and which should prospectively allow a detailed analysis with artificial intelligence techniques. This new software becomes even more meaningful from the practitioner's point of view, because it may also be used as a stand alone unit for a preliminary assessment of gait patterns. The first part deals with the design of integrating two KISTLER platforms beneath the treadmill belt. A description of the analysis software follows, which removes noise, especially the influence of friction, from the raw data set. Thereby the 3D ground reaction force, which is originally caused by the patient while walking, is reconstructed. Preliminary results are presented.

In certain sports, injuries happen very often due to heavy training and sudden speedy actions, especially in athletics and football. Here arises a need to analyze the effect of physical training in sportsperson by collecting data from their daily training. With the help of artificial intelligence, a recurrent neural model is developed to analyze the effect of physical training and treatment concerning sports injury. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) can be a subsection of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that uses the neural nodes connected in a temporal sequence. The temporal sequence is one of the essential terms in this research, which denotes a data sequence of events in a given timeframe. The recurrent neural model is an intelligent machine learning method that comprises a neural schema replicating humans. This neural schema studies the data it collects from the athletes/players and processes it by analyzing previous injuries. Sports injuries have to be analyzed because, in some cases, it becomes more dangerous to the sportsperson that they may even lose their career due to disability. Sometimes it may cause a massive loss to the club or company that hired the sportsperson for the sport. The prediction process can give the player rest until he recovers, thus becoming the safest approach in sports. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the sportsperson's track data to keep an eye on his health. In this research, RNN model is compared with the existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) in concerning to the effect of physical training and treatment for sports. The results show that the proposed model has achieved 99% accuracy, which is higher than the existing algorithm."

            "abstract": "The apoptosis process could impose significantly by hyperglycemia. According to in silico language processing and high throughput raw data analysis, we recognized hub molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic hearts and suggested a new pharmaceutical approach for declining myocardial programed cell death. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into five groups: healthy rats as control, diabetic rats, diabetic combined resistance/endurance training, diabetic rats which consumed supplementation vitamins E and C, and the combined supplementation and training. Here, we calculated changes in gene expression based on artificial intelligence methods and evaluated gene expression in apoptotic influencing combined training and antioxidants vitamins consumption in heart injured models by streptozotocin via Real-Time PCR. Moreover, we assessed the binding affinity of the 3D structure of small molecules on macromolecule SIRT3 to a new compound pharmaceutical suggesting the decline in cell death program. The computational intelligence surveys revealed that the apoptosis process was a remarkable pathomechanism in the abnormality function of heart tissue in diabetic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that synchronizing antioxidant vitamin consumption and regular combined training could significantly decrease irreversible myocardial cell death in diabetic myocardiopathy. Hence, levels of antiapoptotic mRNA were modified in the combined training/vitamin consumption group compared with other classifications. We found that regular combined exercise and vitamin consumption could reverse the apoptosis process to enhance the survival of cardiac muscle cells in diabetes conditions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Machine learning and system biology indicated that the apoptosis process is a vital pathomechanism of hyperglycemia-induced heart failure. Sirt3/Fas/Bcl-2/Cycs and Bax, as a critical network of apoptosis, play an essential role in heart failure induced by hyperglycemia. Moreover, Type 2 diabetes and obesity increase the risk of heart failure by increasing high blood sugar levels. We calculated the binding power of the vitamins E and C on SIRT3 protein based on the drug software. In addition, this study assessed that regular combined training and vitamin consumption had an antiapoptotic effect. Also, our data might improve the hyperglycemia state."

            "abstract": "Current concepts of the factors determining sink strength and the subsequent regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in tomato fruit are based upon an understanding of the relative roles of sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase and invertase, derived from studies in mutants and transformed plants. These enzymes participate in at least four futile cycles that involve sugar transport between the cytosol, vacuole and apoplast. Key reactions are (1) the continuous rapid degradation of sucrose in the cytosol by sucrose synthase (SuSy), (2) sucrose re-synthesis via either SuSy or sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), (3) sucrose hydrolysis in the vacuole or apoplast by acid invertase, (4) subsequent transport of hexoses to the cytosol where they are once more converted into sucrose, and (5) rapid synthesis and breakdown of starch in the amyloplast. In this way futile cycles of sucrose/hexose interchange govern fruit sugar content and composition. The major function of the high and constant invertase activity in red tomato fruit is, therefore, to maintain high cellular hexose concentrations, the hydrolysis of sucrose in the vacuole and in the intercellular space allowing more efficient storage of sugar in these compartments. Vacuolar sugar storage may be important in sustaining fruit cell growth at times when less sucrose is available for the sink organs because of exhaustion of the carbohydrate pools in source leaves."

            "abstract": "There is growing evidence to suggest that epigenetic tags, especially DNA methylation, are critical regulators of fruit ripening. To examine whether this is the case in sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum) we conducted experiments at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and physiological levels. McrBC PCR, bisulfite sequencing, and real-time PCR demonstrated that DNA hypomethylation occurred in the upstream region of the transcription start site of some genes related to pepper ripening at the turning stage, which may be attributed to up-regulation of CaDML2-like and down-regulation of CaMET1-like1, CaMET1-like2, CaCMT2-like, and CaCMT4-like. Silencing of CaMET1-like1 by virus-induced gene silencing led to DNA hypomethylation, increased content of soluble solids, and accumulation of carotenoids in the fruit, which was accompanied by changes in expression of genes involved in capsanthin/capsorubin biosynthesis, cell wall degradation, and phytohormone metabolism and signaling. Endogenous ABA increased during fruit ripening, whereas endogenous IAA showed an opposite trend. No ethylene signal was detected during ripening. DNA hypomethylation repressed the expression of auxin and gibberellin biosynthesis genes as well as cytokinin degradation genes, but induced the expression of ABA biosynthesis genes. In mature-green pericarp, exogenous ABA induced expression of CaDML2-like but repressed that of CaCMT4-like. IAA treatment promoted the transcription of CaMET1-like1 and CaCMT3-like. Ethephon significantly up-regulated the expression of CaDML2-like. Treatment with GA3 and 6-BA showed indistinct effects on DNA methylation at the transcriptional level. On the basis of the results, a model is proposed that suggests a high likelihood of a role for DNA methylation in the regulation of ripening in the non-climacteric pepper fruit."

Heterocarpic systems accomplish bet-hedging through the production of two or more fruit types that vary in dormancy and dispersal ability. It is unknown whether heterocarpy also offsets predispersal mortality risks. To address this question, we investigated whether heterocarpy in Grindelia ciliata (Asteraceae) also offsets mortality risks posed by a seed predator Schinia mortua (Noctuidae) to increase plant fitness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted two manipulative experiments to quantify critical life history components of this plant-insect interaction. We measured predispersal achene mortality from herbivory, postdispersal achene mortality in the seed bank, and seedling emergence. These measurements were then used in deterministic models to evaluate evolutionary consequences of predispersal seed mortality in G. ciliata.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Dormant achene types were less vulnerable to herbivory but more susceptible to mortality in the seed bank due to delayed seed emergence. Nondormant achene types experienced high predispersal mortality but low seed bank mortality due to rapid germination. Our herbivore-dependent model improved fit between observed and expected proportions of dormant and nondormant G. ciliata achenes and showed that heterocarpy could evolve in the absence of postgermination mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study provides empirical support of how predispersal herbivory can be equally important to postdispersal seed mortality risks in the evolution and maintenance of a heterocarpic reproductive system and expands understanding of how bet-hedging theory can be used to understand this unique reproductive strategy."

            "abstract": "Fruits result from complex biological processes that begin soon after fertilization. Among these processes are cell division and expansion, accumulation of secondary metabolites, and an increase in carbohydrate biosynthesis. Later fruit ripening is accomplished by chlorophyll degradation and cell wall lysis. Fruit maturation is an essential step to optimize seed dispersal, and is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors and genetic regulators that are strongly influenced by phytohormones. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene are the major regulators of ripening and senescence in both dry and fleshy fruits, as demonstrated by numerous ripening-defective mutants, effects of exogenous hormone application, and transcriptome analyses. While ethylene is the best characterized player in the final step of a fruit's life, ABA also has a key regulatory role, promoting ethylene production and acting as a stress-related hormone in response to drought and pathogen attack. In this review, we focus on the role of ABA and ethylene in relation to the interconnected biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect ripening and senescence. We integrate and discuss the most recent data available regarding these biological processes, which are crucial for post-harvest fruit conservation and for food safety."

Methods: In this noncontrolled trial, nine participants with sedentary lifestyles were recruited from the outpatient rehabilitation department of a teaching hospital. All participants received twelve 30 min sessions of cycling ergometer exercises (5 min warm up, 20 min training phase, and 5 min cool down) with the ICTS three times per week. Training intensity was determined at 60−80% heart rate reserve using cardiopulmonary exercise (CPET) pretests. During training, pedaling resistance was automatically adjusted by the ICTS to keep the user’s heart rate at the predetermined intensity range. Workload-peak and peak oxygen uptake (VO2-peak) were measured during the pretests and post-tests. We recorded the percentage of time spent within the target heart rate range (%time) during the 20 min training phase for each training session as an indicator of adherence. The correlation between %time and gains in VO2-peak was assessed. Results: After 4 weeks of training on the ICTS, workload-peak and VO2-peak significantly improved by 13.6 ± 7.2 w (mean ± SD, p = 0.008) and 1.5 ± 1.1 mL/kg/min (p = 0.011), respectively. The 12-session average %time ranged from 10.6% to 93.1% among the participants, and five participants achieved an average %time >80%. A positive correlation between average %time and training efficacy was found (rs = 0.85, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Cardiopulmonary training with an ICTS is feasible, and the percentage of time spent within the target heart rate range seems to be a reasonable indicator for monitoring training-intensity adherence."

            "abstract": "This research work illustrates an approach to the design of controllers for self-assembling robots in which the self-assembly is initiated and regulated by perceptual cues that are brought forth by the physical robots through their dynamical interactions. More specifically, we present a homogeneous control system that can achieve assembly between two modules (two fully autonomous robots) of a mobile self-reconfigurable system without a priori introduced behavioral or morphological heterogeneities. The controllers are dynamic neural networks evolved in simulation that directly control all the actuators of the two robots. The neurocontrollers cause the dynamic specialization of the robots by allocating roles between them based solely on their interaction. We show that the best evolved controller proves to be successful when tested on a real hardware platform, the swarm-bot. The performance achieved is similar to the one achieved by existing modular or behavior-based approaches, also due to the effect of an emergent recovery mechanism that was neither explicitly rewarded by the fitness function, nor observed during the evolutionary simulation. Our results suggest that direct access to the orientations or intentions of the other agents is not a necessary condition for robot coordination: Our robots coordinate without direct or explicit communication, contrary to what is assumed by most research works in collective robotics. This work also contributes to strengthening the evidence that evolutionary robotics is a design methodology that can tackle real-world tasks demanding fine sensory-motor coordination."

Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an \"evidence-based\" practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research.

Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be \"moderate\" to \"large.\" Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies.

Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow."

Cuterebrid bot flies comprise one of the most-studied groups of insect parasites of mammals. Interest in their impact dates from at least 1857, when Cuterebra emasculator was so named because of the erroneous belief that its larvae castrate their hosts. This review addresses the effects of cuterebrid larvae on host biochemistry, physiology, behavior, and ecology. Despite high prevalence (peak values commonly range from 30% to 70%), at average intensities (one to three larvae per host) these parasites generally have little effect on the fitness or population dynamics of their typical hosts. This outcome likely reflects parasite/host coevolution favoring parasites that minimize harmful effects on hosts required for their survival and hosts that best tolerate perennial parasites they cannot avoid. In contrast, aggravated effects occur at higher intensities and with atypical hosts. Additional field studies involving experimental manipulation of infestation and spanning more than a few seasons are required to confirm these conclusions."

            "abstract": "The dormancy-associated MADS-box (DAM) genes PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 have been shown to play important roles in bud endodormancy; however, their molecular regulatory mechanism in peach is unclear. In this study, by use of yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated a TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR transcription factor, PpTCP20, in the peach cultivar 'Zhongyou 4' (Prunus persica var. nectarina). The protein was localized in the nucleus and was capable of forming a homodimer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PpTCP20 binds to a GCCCR element in the promoters of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6, and transient dual luciferase experiments showed that PpTCP20 inhibited the expression of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 as the period of the release of flower bud endodormancy approached. In addition, PpTCP20 interacted with PpABF2 to form heterodimers to regulate bud endodormancy, and the content of abscisic acid decreased with the release of endodormancy. PpTCP20 also inhibited expression of PpABF2 to regulate endodormancy. Taken together, our results suggest that PpTCP20 regulates peach flower bud endodormancy by negatively regulating the expression of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6, and by interacting with PpABF2, thus revealing a novel regulatory mechanism in a perennial deciduous tree."

            "abstract": "Secondary pollen presentation is the relocation and presentation of pollen in floral structures (termed pollen presenters) other than the anthers. These pollen presenters are often found close to the stigma and have been hypothesized to increase the accuracy of pollen transfer, although no experimental studies have been done. We examined the function of the pollen presenter and its efficiency in pollen dispersal, female fitness, and the degree of interference created by self-pollen in the shrublet Polygala vayredae, an insect-pollinated species with secondary pollen presentation. Herkogamy, a mechanism generally involved in the reduction of self-interference, was also evaluated. Significant pollen was lost (49% of total pollen) during the secondary relocation in the pollen presenter. However, pollen was exported from the pollen presenter, and subsequent pollen losses were similar to those in species with primary pollen presentation. Despite the presence of a self-incompatibility system, the numbers of developed pollen tubes as well as fruit and seed production were significantly reduced by the self-pollen interference created at the stigmatic papillae level. The extent of herkogamy correlated positively with female fitness. The secondary pollen presentation mechanism may in fact be an accurate system for pollen transport, but it may also have its costs. Further comparative studies involving species with primary and secondary pollen presentation are needed to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of secondary pollen presentation."

Technological tools are available to help people living with, or at risk of developing, T2D to manage their condition, and such tools provide a large repository of patient-generated health data (PGHD). Analytics can provide insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review is to investigate what can be learned about the health behaviors of those living with, or at risk of developing, T2D through analytics from PGHD.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework was conducted in which a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted by 2 reviewers. In all, 3 electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) were searched using keywords associated with diabetes, behaviors, and analytics. Several rounds of screening using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were conducted, after which studies were selected. Critical examination took place through a descriptive-analytical narrative method, and data extracted from the studies were classified into thematic categories. These categories reflect the findings of this study as per our objective.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although 70% (30/43) of the studies examined PGHD independently, 30% (13/43) combined PGHD with other data sources. Most of these studies used machine learning algorithms to perform their analysis. The themes identified through this review include predicting diabetes or obesity, deriving factors that contribute to diabetes or obesity, obtaining insights from social media or web-based forums, predicting glycemia, improving adherence and outcomes, analyzing sedentary behaviors, deriving behavior patterns, discovering clinical correlations from behaviors, and developing design principles.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The increased volume and availability of PGHD have the potential to derive analytical insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D.

We tested whether, in children with ADHD, (1) polygenic liability for sleep phenotypes is over- or under-transmitted from parents, (2) this liability is linked to comorbid sleep disturbances, and (3) ADHD genetic risk is associated with comorbid sleep disturbances. We derived polygenic scores (PGS) for insomnia, chronotype, sleep duration, and ADHD, in 758 children (5-18 years old) diagnosed with ADHD and their parents. We conducted polygenic transmission disequilibrium tests for each sleep PGS in complete parent-offspring ADHD trios (N = 328) and an independent replication sample of ADHD trios (N = 844). Next, we tested whether insomnia, sleep duration, and ADHD PGS were associated with co-occurring sleep phenotypes (hypersomnia, insomnia, restless sleep, poor sleep quality, and nightmares) in children with ADHD. Children's insomnia and chronotype PGS did not differ from mid-parent average PGS but long sleep duration PGS were significantly over-transmitted to children with ADHD. This was supported by a combined analysis using the replication sample. Insomnia, sleep duration, and ADHD PGS were not associated with comorbid sleep disturbances. There is weak evidence that children with ADHD over-inherit polygenic liability for longer sleep duration and do not differentially inherit polygenic liability for insomnia or chronotype. There was insufficient evidence that childhood sleep disturbances were driven by polygenic liability for ADHD or sleep traits, suggesting that sleep disturbances in ADHD may be aetiologically different to general population sleep phenotypes and do not index greater ADHD genetic risk burden."

Trachtenberg took over the executive directorship of the National Association of Private Psychiatric Hospitals some five months ago, he walked into a situation wherein several psychiatric specialty hospitals in Texas were under fire. \"There were a lot of questions,\" Trachtenberg says, \"and challenges to the credibility of psychiatric hospitals.\" He was referring to the Texas state investigation into abuses by personnel within psychiatric hospitals. Last year, the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Health and Human Services conducted an eight-month investigation into the conduct of the state's psychiatric hospitals after a newspaper article recounted the unconventional way in which a 14-year old boy was picked up and admitted to a psychiatric facility. After a number of public hearings, three private agencies overseeing Texas psychiatric hospitals adopted rules to prevent further problems in the areas of patient rights, fraudulent billing, patient recruitment and the admission and discharge process. The Senate Interim Committee, however, felt these rules needed to be codified into law and has drafted over 30 bills to be presented to the Texas legislature as omnibus legislation next January. Trachtenberg went to work to iron out methods to encourage better overseeing and state governance, as well as tackling the related issues of standards of care and managed care/utilization review. His background as Deputy Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration within HHS provided him with a broad spectrum of knowledge about the field of psychiatry and its problems, and his vast experience in federal government--over 32 years of running domestic programs--enable him to have a keen sense of what can get done, and how.

We aimed to verify the existing obesity paradox through binary logistic regression (BLR) and clarify the paradox via association rule mining (ARM). Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were assessed for their 3-month functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Predictors for poor outcome (mRS 3-6) were analyzed through BLR, and ARM was performed to find out which combination of risk factors was concurrently associated with good outcomes using maximal support, confidence, and lift values. Among 2580 patients with AIS, being obese (OR [odds ratio], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99) had beneficial effects on the outcome at 3 months in BLR analysis. In addition, the ARM algorithm showed obese patients with good outcomes were also associated with an age less than 55 years and mild stroke severity. While BLR analysis showed a beneficial effect of obesity on stroke outcome, in ARM analysis, obese patients had a relatively good combination of risk factor profiles compared to normal BMI patients. These results may partially explain the obesity paradox phenomenon in AIS patients."

            "abstract": "In contrast-enhanced computed tomography, total body weight adapted contrast injection protocols have proven successful in achieving a homogeneous enhancement of vascular structures and liver parenchyma. However, because solid organs have greater perfusion than adipose tissue, the lean body weight (fat-free mass) rather than the total body weight is theorised to cause even more homogeneous enhancement. We included 102 consecutive patients who underwent a multiphase abdominal computed tomography between March 2016 and October 2019. Patients received contrast media (300 mgI/mL) according to bodyweight categories. Using regions of interest, we measured the Hounsfield unit (HU) increase in liver attenuation from unenhanced to contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Furthermore, subjective image quality was graded using a four-point Likert scale. An artificial intelligence algorithm automatically segmented and determined the body compositions and calculated the percentages of lean body weight. The hepatic enhancements were adjusted for iodine dose and iodine dose per total body weight, as well as percentage lean body weight. The associations between enhancement and total body weight, body mass index, and lean body weight were analysed using linear regression. Patients had a median age of 68 years (IQR: 58-74), a total body weight of 81 kg (IQR: 73 - 90), a body mass index of 26 kg/m2 (SD: ±4.2), and a lean body weight percentage of 50% (IQR: 36 - 55). Mean liver enhancements in the portal venous phase were 61 ± 12 HU (≤ 70 kg), 53 ± 10 HU (70 - 90 kg), and 53 ± 7 HU (≥ 90 kg). The majority (93%) of scans were rated as good or excellent. Regression analysis showed significant correlations between liver enhancement corrected for injected total iodine and total body weight (r = 0.53; p < 0.001) and between liver enhancement corrected for lean body weight and the percentage of lean body weight (r = 0.73; p < 0.001). Most benefits from personalising iodine injection using %LBW additive to total body weight would be achieved in patients under 90 kg. Liver enhancement is more strongly associated with the percentage of lean body weight than with the total body weight or body mass index. The observed variation in liver enhancement might be reduced by a personalised injection based on the artificial-intelligence-determined percentage of lean body weight."

The authors summarize the main themes and issues that emerged at the conference. The authors draw from work by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to support the need for greater emphasis on quality improvement. To date, most of the work in this area has involved a systems-level approach, and physicians are often viewed as obstacles to improvement programs. By contrast, physicians may view population- or systems-based approaches to health care as interfering with the delivery of care to specific patients. The authors argue that physicians, individually and collectively, have a key role in quality improvement efforts, albeit a role that is yet fully defined. After reviewing successful examples involving physicians, the authors explore the major levers to achieve change-removing barriers, creating incentives, emphasizing collaboration, increasing education, and promulgating regulation-and summarize ten recurring themes, including both current and near-term opportunities, for physicians to exercise leadership in quality improvement and patient safety. Finally, they assert that even modest change can lead to substantial improvements, particularly if medical societies and the profession's standard-setting bodies work together."

Spectral bands sensitive to the pigment concentration have been identified, and linear models for non-destructive assessment of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols via chlorophyll fluorescence measurements are put forward. The adaptation of apple fruit to high light stress involves accumulation of these protective pigments, which absorb solar radiation in broad spectral ranges extending from UV to the green and, in anthocyanin-containing cultivars, to the red regions of the spectrum. In ripening apples the protective effect in the blue region could be attributed to extrathylakoid carotenoids. A simple model, which allows the simulation of chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra in the visible range and a quantitative evaluation of competitive absorption by anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols, is described. Evidence is presented to support the view that anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols play, in fruit with low-to-moderate pigment content, the role of internal traps (insofar as they compete with chlorophylls for the absorption of incident light in specific spectral bands), affecting thereby the shape of the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectrum."

Mean symptom scores were as follows: HFSS burden score: 2.4 (±2.1), and MLHFQ scores: physical score 20 (±12.4), emotional score 9.9 (±8.1), and total score 41.3 (±26.3). The highest mean PETS domain scores were exercise [51.3 (±24.7)], diet [40.3 (±22.7)], difficulty with healthcare services [39.9 (±21.3)], and physical and mental fatigue [36.0 (±25.7)]. Pairwise correlations were observed between HFSS scores and MLHFQ physical and emotional sub-scores with PETS workload and impact indices. Positive correlations were weak to moderate (0.326-0.487) between workload index and symptoms, and moderate to strong between impact index and symptoms (0.553-0.725). The P value was 0.006, adjusted by Bonferroni's correction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Symptoms are associated with BoT in CHF patients. Although symptom burden was low, CHF patients reported higher levels of burden around self-care activities of exercise, diet, healthcare interaction, as well as physical and mental fatigue due to engagement with self-care regimens. Observed higher levels of burden were in key self-care areas for CHF and suggest areas where service delivery and support of CHF patients may be improved to reduce BoT. Clinicians could individualize their consultations by focusing on troublesome symptoms, as well as alleviating illness workload, which may better enable patients to live well with CHF."

            "abstract": "Sleep apnea syndrome treatment relies primarily on continuous positive airway pressure, which requires a homecare follow-up. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a key symptom to be measured during follow-up, and there is a need for more easy-to-administer, ecological and engaging tools to assess it. Virtual agents have shown their effectiveness in performing clinical evaluation in a medical environment. A virtual agent assessing excessive daytime sleepiness via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale has been tested at home by 102 patients treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and their homecare providers. Acceptance and trustworthiness of the agent, as well as the influence of demographics and clinical characteristics of patients, were investigated. Results showed that both patients and homecare providers reported a positive attitude towards the virtual agent, which was found to be usable, satisfactory, credible and benevolent. Homecare providers reported that it was not a burden to their working routine. Positive regression coefficients were found between patients' and homecare providers' attitudes towards the virtual agent. We found no influence of patients' demographics and clinical characteristics on their acceptance of the virtual agent. This shows that virtual agents are well accepted by patients and homecare providers, independently of their demographics and clinical characteristics. Positive regression coefficients observed between patients' and homecare providers' perceptions of the agent indicate that the opinions of both influence acceptance of the virtual agent in a homecare context. Virtual agents are new innovative digital solutions to be considered in homecare follow-up of apneic patients treated by CPAP."

In this paper, we propose a sEMG-controlled 3D game that leverages a deep learning-based architecture for real-time gesture recognition. The 3D game experience developed in the study is focused on rehabilitation exercises, allowing individuals with certain disabilities to use low-cost sEMG sensors to control the game experience. For this purpose, we acquired a novel dataset of seven gestures using the Myo armband device, which we utilized to train the proposed deep learning model. The signals captured were used as an input of a Conv-GRU architecture to classify the gestures. Further, we ran a live system with the participation of different individuals and analyzed the neural network's classification for hand gestures. Finally, we also evaluated our system, testing it for 20 rounds with new participants and analyzed its results in a user study."

            "abstract": "In order to investigate the physiological role of ethylene in the initiation and subsequent progression of softening, pear fruit were treated with propylene, an analogue of ethylene or 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a gaseous inhibitor of ethylene action at the preclimacteric or ripening stages. The propylene treatment at the pre-ripe stage stimulated ethylene production and flesh softening while the 1-MCP treatment at the same stage markedly retarded the initiation of the ripening-related events. Moreover, 1-MCP treatment after the initiation of ripening markedly suppressed the subsequent flesh softening and ethylene production. These results clearly indicate that ethylene is not merely a by-product, but plays a crucial role in both the initiation and maintenance of regulating the softening process during ripening. The observations also suggest that ethylene in ripening is regulated entirely in an autocatalytic manner. The mRNA accumulation of pear polygalacturonases (PG) genes, PC-PG1 and PC-PG2, was in parallel with the pattern of fruit softening in both propylene and 1-MCP treatments. However, the expression pattern of pear endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanases (EGase) genes, PC-EG1 and PC-EG2, was not affected in both treatments. The results suggest that ethylene is required for PGs expression even in the late ripening stage, but not for EGases."

            "abstract": "Procrastination takes a considerable toll on people's lives, the economy and society at large. Procrastination is often a consequence of people's propensity to prioritize their immediate experiences over the long-term consequences of their actions. This suggests that aligning immediate rewards with long-term values could be a promising way to help people make more future-minded decisions and overcome procrastination. Here we develop an approach to decision support that leverages artificial intelligence and game elements to restructure challenging sequential decision problems in such a way that it becomes easier for people to take the right course of action. A series of four increasingly realistic experiments suggests that this approach can enable people to make better decisions faster, procrastinate less, complete their work on time and waste less time on unimportant tasks. These findings suggest that our method is a promising step towards developing cognitive prostheses that help people achieve their goals."

In this two-phase qualitative study, we conducted focus groups and usability testing to describe user ideations of desires and experiences with different AI sleep technologies and identify ways to improve the technologies. Results showed that focus group participants prioritized comfort, actionable feedback, and ease of use. Participants desired customized suggestions about their habitual sleeping environments and were interested in CSTs+AI that could integrate with tools and CSTs they already use. Usability study participants felt CSTs+AI provided an accurate picture of the quantity and quality of sleep. Participants identified room for improvement in usability, accuracy, and design of the technologies. We conclude that CSTs can be a valuable, affordable, and convenient tool for people who have issues or concerns with sleep and want more information.

Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI z scores (zBMI), diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes.\n## RESULTS\nAmong parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified: socially engaged (35/214, 16.3%), independently engaged (18/214, 8.4%) (socially and independently engaged parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app, respectively), fully engaged (26/214, 12.1%), partially engaged (32/214, 15%), and unengaged (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married parents were more likely to be fullyengaged than independently engaged (P=.02) or unengaged (P=.01) users. Socially engaged parents were older than fullyengaged (P=.02) and unengaged (P=.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes among children: fully engaged (32/214, 15%), partially engaged (61/214, 28.5%), dabblers (42/214, 19.6%), and unengaged (79/214, 36.9%) users. Fully engaged children were younger than dabblers (P=.04) and unengaged (P=.003) children. Dabblers lived in higher-income households than fully and partiallyengaged children (P=.03 and P=.047, respectively). Fully engaged children were more likely to have fully engaged (P<.001) and partiallyengaged (P<.001) parents than unengaged children. Compared with unengaged children, fully and partiallyengaged children had decreased total sugar (P=.006 and P=.004, respectively) and energy intake (P=.03 and P=.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use. Partially engaged children also had decreased sugary beverage intake compared with unengaged children (P=.03). Similarly, children with fully engaged parents had decreased zBMI, whereas children with unengaged parents had increased zBMI over time (P=.005). Finally, children with independently engaged parents had decreased caloric intake, whereas children with unengaged parents had increased caloric intake over time (P=.02).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFull parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions. Further research is needed to understand program design elements that can affect participants' engagement in supporting behavior change.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03651284; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03651284.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID)\nRR2-10.1186/s13063-020-4080-2.\n"

We tested the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to opportunistic detection of AF from single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) which are routinely recorded during in-laboratory polysomnographic sleep studies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using transfer learning, an existing ECG AI model was applied to 1839 single-lead ECG traces recorded during in-laboratory sleep studies without any training of the algorithm. Manual review of all traces was performed by two trained clinicians who were blinded to each other's review. Discrepancies between the two investigators were resolved by two cardiologists who were also unaware of each other's scoring.

            "abstract": "Obesity is a major global health challenge and a risk factor for the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several types of cancer. Attempts to manage and regulate obesity have led to the implementation of various dietary regulatory initiatives to provide information on the calorie contents of meals. Although knowledge of the calorie content is useful for meal planning, it is not sufficient as other factors, including health status (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and level of physical activity, are essential in the decision process for obesity management. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence- (AI-) based application that is driven by a genetic algorithm (GA) as a potential tool for tracking a user's energy balance and predicting possible calorie intake required to meet daily calorie needs for obesity management. The algorithm takes the users' input information on desired foods which are selected from a database and extracted records of users on cholesterol level, diabetes status, and level of physical activity, to predict possible meals required to meet the users need. The micro- and macronutrients of food content are used for the computation and prediction of the potential foods required to meet the daily calorie needs. The functionality and performance of the model were tested using a sample of 30 volunteers from the University of Ghana. Results revealed that the model was able to predict both glycemic and non-glycemic foods based on the condition of the user as well as the macro- and micronutrients requirements. Moreover, the system is able to adequately track the progress of the user's weight loss over time, daily nutritional needs, daily calorie intake, and predictions of meals that must be taken to avoid compromising their health. The proposed system can serve as a useful resource for individuals, dieticians, and other health management personnel for managing obesity, patients, and for training students in fields of dietetics and consumer science."

This study also critically value the concepts of PN that are built around the new genetic avenue from both the academic and a commercial perspective and their effectiveness in causing sustained changes in diet, lifestyle, and for improving health. Despite almost 20 years of research and commercial direct-to-consumer offerings, evidence for the success of gene-based dietary recommendations is still generally lacking.

A total of 19 female non-disabled college students (age 23.2 ± 0.8 years, BMI 20.4 ± 2.2) performed 30-s and 3-min DP performance tests using a sit-skiing ergometer. Isokinetic muscle strength of the shoulder and elbow extensor were measured at the angular velocity of 30°/s, 60°/s, and 120°/s with an ISOMED2000 isokinetic system. A medium correlation was found between DP output power and isokinetic upper limb muscle strength (shoulder strength at all speeds, r = 0.39-0.74, p ≤ 0.1). Multiple regression analyses which were employed to predict power production in the 30-s and 3-min tests showed that shoulder extension strength at 60°/s accounted for 34% of the variation in the 30-s test, and 40% of the variance in the 3-min test. Muscle strength and biomechanical analysis of DP process indicated that upper limb extensor muscle strength and muscle coordination were important factors for the power output generation in sit-skiing DP. These results may use to guide special physical fitness training for paralympic cross-country sit-skiing."

The objective of this study is to synthesize the types of HFpEF by examining their features and relating them to phenotypes with adverse prognosis. A systematic search was conducted using the search terms \"Diastolic Heart Failure\" OR \"heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\" OR \"heart failure with normal ejection fraction\" OR \"HFpEF\" AND \"machine learning\" OR \"artificial intelligence\" OR 'computational biology'. Ten studies were identified and they varied in their prevalence of ten clinical variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI) or obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or symptom severity (NYHA class or BNP). The clinical findings associated with the different phenotypes in > 85 % of studies were age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and worse symptoms severity; an adverse outcome was in 65 % to 85 % of studies identified diabetes mellitus and female sex and in less than 65 % of studies was body mass index or obesity, and coronary artery disease. COPD was a relevant factor in only 33 % of studies. Adverse clinical outcome - death or admission to hospital (for heart failure) defined phenogroups with the worst outcome. Combining the 4 studies that calculated the MAGGIC score showed a significant (p<0.05) linear relationship between MAGGIC score and outcome, using the one-year event rate. A new score based on strength of the evidence of the HFpEF studies analyzed here, using 9 variables (eliminating COPD), showed a significant (p<0.009) linear relationship with one-year event rate. Three studies examined biomarkers in detail and the ones most prominently related to outcome or consistently found in the studies were GDF15, FABP4, FGF23, sST2, renin and TNF. The dominant factors that identified phenotypes of HFpEF with adverse outcome were hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and worse symptoms severity. A new simplified score, based on clinical factors, was proposed to assess prognosis in HFpEF. Several biomarkers were consistently elevated in phenogroups with adverse outcomes and may indicate the underlying mechanism or pathophysiology specific for phenotypes with an adverse prognosis."

Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by exposure to COVID-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social networks, and \"fake news.\" In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health of social media users going forward."

All patients underwent electrocardiography-triggered CT of the aorta twice within 2 years for suspected progression of aortic disease, suspected dissection, and/or pre-operative evaluation. Progression of aortic enlargement was defined as an increase in diameter at the aortic sinus or the ascending aorta of at least 2 mm. Patients meeting this definition were assigned to the 'progressive aortic enlargement' group (proAE group) and patients with stable diameters to the 'stable aortic enlargement' group (staAE group). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Two possible body composition predictors of aortic enlargement-skeletal muscle density (SMD) and psoas muscle index (PMI)-were analysed further using multivariant logistic regression analysis.

Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a \"buddy\" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations."

Semi-structured interviews focussing on the lived experiences of five non-drinking students were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. We present four inter-related themes: 'Retaining authenticity by not drinking', 'Tainting the self by drinking alcohol', 'Feeling trapped by superimposition and self-exposition' and 'Doing what you want to do with your life'. Self-authenticity informed the decision not to drink, became relevant within conversations about non-drinking and underscored issues of choice and agency raised by alcohol consumption. Entrenched assumptions about alcohol's self-realising utility are challenged in our discussion, and future research recommendations are suggested."

This knowledge is crucial for a more general evolutionary and ecological understanding of specialized plant-pollinator systems. In the present study, variations in pollinator activity, assemblage composition and pollen limitation were explored in the oil-producing species Nierembergia linariifolia (Solanaceae).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pollen limitation in fruit and seed production was analysed by supplementary hand pollination in five wild populations. Pollinator activity and identity were recorded while carrying out supplementary pollination to assess the effect of pollinators on the degree of pollen limitation. In two populations, pollen limitation was discriminated into quantitative and qualitative components by comparing supplementation and hand cross-pollination in fruit set and seed set. The effect of flower number per plant on the number of flowers pollinated per visitor per visit to a plant was examined in one of these populations as a possible cause of low-quality pollination by increasing geitonogamy.\n    \n\n\n          Results and conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although pollen limitation was evident along time and space, differences in magnitude were detected among populations and years that were greatly explained by pollinator activity, which was significantly different across populations. Floral display size had a significant effect on the visitation rate per flower. Limitation by quality clearly affected one population presumably due to a high proportion of geitonogamous pollen. The great inter-population variation in plant-pollinator interaction (both in pollinator assemblages composition and pollinator activity) and fitness consequences, suggests that this system should be viewed as a mosaic of locally selective processes and locally specialized interactions."

This study aims to develop and validate a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for assessing Kinect-enabled home-based physical rehabilitation exercises, in order to support auto-coaching in a virtual gaming environment. A DTW-based algorithm was first applied to compute motion similarity between two time series from an individual user and a virtual coach. We chose eight bone vectors of the human skeleton and body orientation as the input features and proposed a simple but innovative method to further convert the DTW distance to a meaningful performance score in terms of the percentage (0-100%), without training data and experience of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated through a follow-up experiment with 21 subjects when playing a Tai Chi exergame. Results showed that the algorithm scores had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.86) with experts' ratings and the calibrated algorithm scores were comparable to the gold standard. These findings suggested that the DTW-based algorithm could be effectively used for automatic performance evaluation of an individual when performing home-based rehabilitation exercises."

The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their interacting partners, the cyclins, play a key role in the progression of the cell cycle. In this study the role of CDKA1, CDKB1, and CDKB2 in fruit development was characterized by fruit-specific overexpression and down-regulation. CDKA1 is expressed in the pericarp throughout development, but is strongly up-regulated in the outer pericarp cell layers at the end of the growth period, when CDKB gene expression has ceased. Overexpression of the CDKB genes at later stages of development and the down-regulation of CDKA1 result in a very similar fruit phenotype, showing a reduction in the number of cell layers in the pericarp and alterations in the desiccation of the fruits. Expression studies revealed that CDKA1 is down-regulated by the expression of CDKB1/2 in CDKB1 and CDKB2 overexpression mutants, suggesting opposite roles for these types of CDK proteins in tomato pericarp development."

Materials and Methods: Ten patients with stage II–IIIB cervix cancer (Ca.Cx) were retrospectively identified from the department database. Target volume (TV) and organ at risk (OAR) were delineated as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) cancer guidelines. Dose prescribed to planning target volume (PTV) was 50.4Gy in 28 fractions. Two plans (6MV FB IMRT and 6MV FFFB IMRT) were generated to achieve 95% of prescription dose to PTV and sparing OAR as per normal tissue guidelines. Numbers of beams and their orientations were the same for all plans. The homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), treatment monitor unit (MU), beam on time (BOT) and non-tumor integral dose (NTID) were chosen for comparison. Results: FFFB generated plans were clinically acceptable. There was a statistically significant difference among the FB IMRT and FFFB IMRT plans with respect to CI, HI, D50%, D2% in PTV coverage, bladder V50Gy, MU, mean NTID and non-tumor low dose volume. Conclusions: 6MV flattened and flattening filter free photon beams produce comparable plans by IMRT . FFF beams allow time efficient treatment delivery and may help reduce the risk of secondary malignances in carcinoma cervix cases."

Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10 months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nThe primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30 days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30 days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level.\n## RESULTS\nECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2 months (adjusted mean 4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P = .01), but this effect waned by 12 months (3,861 vs 3,383, P = .09). For participants with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2 months (P = .03) and 12 months (P = .02), while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point. Intervention participants were highly satisfied with the program.\n## CONCLUSION\nAn automated exercise promotion system deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among older adults over the short-term.

These assistive systems require quantitative methods to assess patients' quality of movement and provide feedback on their performance. However, state-of-the-art quantitative assessment approaches require expensive motion-capture devices, which might be a barrier to the development of low-cost systems.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this work, we develop a low-cost virtual coach (VC) that requires only a laptop with a webcam to monitor three upper extremity rehabilitation exercises and provide real-time visual and audio feedback on compensatory motion patterns exclusively from image 2D positional data analysis. To assess compensation patterns quantitatively, we propose a Rule-based (RB) and a Neural Network (NN) based approaches. Using the dataset of 15 post-stroke patients, we evaluated these methods with Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and Leave-One-Exercise-Out (LOEO) cross-validation and the [Formula: see text] score that measures the accuracy (geometric mean of precision and recall) of a model to assess compensation motions.

Segments of interictal sleep electroencephalography (EEG) were acquired before and after six months of KDTs. Analyses of FC were based on network-based statistics and graph theory, with a focus on different frequency bands. Seventeen responders and 14 non-responders were enrolled. After six months of KDTs, the responders exhibited a significant functional connectivity strength decrease compared with the non-responders; reductions in global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and nodal strength in the beta frequency band for a consecutive range of weighted proportional thresholds were observed in the responders. The alteration of betweenness centrality was significantly and positively correlated with seizure reduction rate in alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands in weighted adjacency matrices with densities of 90%. We conclude that KDTs tended to modify minor-to-moderate-intensity brain connections; the reduction of global connectivity and the increment of betweenness centrality after six months of KDTs were associated with better KD effectiveness."

Mean fitness (seed set) always decreased with the later initiation of flowering. The likelihood of a plant fruiting differed with flowering date in five of the six instances (population by year combinations). Though plants that initiated flowering later tended to have spent more time in the vegetative stage and tended to die later in the year than did earlier flowering plants, this was not sufficient to overcome the reproductive penalties of flowering late. Plants that initiated flowering later in the season spent less time in the adult phase and were smaller. The mean number of flowers, fruits, and seeds per flowering plant always decreased with later flowering. Fruit set was negatively correlated with flowering date in four of the six population by year combinations. Nonparametric fitness functions were used to summarize predicted fitness among different initial flowering dates for each population on a yearly basis. Predicted mean fitness always declined nonlinearly with later flowering; the earliest flowering plants always had the highest predicted fitness. These fitness functions describe directional selection for the early initiation of flowering."

Here, the considerable body of ancient Chinese literature is used to explore the domestication process that has occurred with the eggplant (Solanum melongena), an important vegetable in Old World.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Information about eggplant domestication in the ancient Chinese literature was retrieved using a variety of methods. The information obtained was then sorted by taxon, examined and taxonomic identifications verified.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      It was found that the earliest record of the eggplant documented in ancient Chinese literature was in a work from 59 bc. As far as is known, this is the earliest reliable and accurately dated record of eggplant in cultivation. The analysis reveals that the process of domestication of the eggplant in China involved three principal aspects of fruit quality: size, shape and taste. These traits were actively and gradually selected; fruit size changed from small to large, taste changed from not palatable to what was termed at the time sweetish, and that over time, a wider variety of fruit shapes was cultivated.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results indicate that, in addition to data gleaned from archaeology and genetics, evidence as to changes in key traits occurring during the process of plant domestication and selective forces responsible for these changes can be traced through the ancient literature in some civilizations."

            "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of significant anatomical and functional brain changes, and complex interactions occur between mental health risk factors. The Longitudinal Adolescent Brain Study commenced in 2018, to monitor environmental and psychosocial factors influencing mental health in 500 adolescents, for 5 years. Participants are recruited at age 12 from the community in Australia's Sunshine Coast region. In this baseline, cross-sectional study of N = 64 participants, we draw on the network perspective, conceptualising mental disorders as causal systems of interacting entities, to propose a Bayesian network (BN) model of lifestyle and psychosocial variables influencing chances of individuals being psychologically well or experiencing psychological distress. Sensitivity analysis of network priors revealed that psychological distress (Kessler-10) was most affected by eating behaviour. Unhealthy eating increased the chance of moderate psychological distress by 600%. Low social connectedness increased the chance of severe psychological disorder by 200%. Certainty for psychological wellness required 33% decrease in unhealthy eating behaviours, 11% decrease in low social connectedness, and 9% reduction in less physical activity. BN can augment clinician judgement in mental disorders as probabilistic decision support systems. The full potential of BN methodology in a complex systems approach to psychopathology has yet to be realised."

            "abstract": "While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including calories-counting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices-generating enormous dynamic analytical data-with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition."

Some regenerants, Type B plants, produced fruit similar to 'fasciated' fruit. Fruit of the autotetraploids induced from three female red-fleshed A. chinensis selections were also 50-60 % larger than fruit of their diploid progenitors.

Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is combined with intelligent robotics technology to acquire and analyze students' sports exercise behaviors. As a result, a new development model is formulated for college health education. First, it explores students' sports exercise and health education situation in Chinese higher institutions and uncovers the underlying problems. Then it puts forward the corresponding modification suggestions. Second, the AI algorithm and the Kinect sensor-mounted intelligent robot capture the human skeleton features to obtain smooth skeleton joint points data. At the same time, a visual perception human motion recognition (HMR) algorithm is established based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Afterward, the proposed HMM-based HMR algorithm is used to recognize students' sports exercise motions by analyzing human motion skeleton images. The experimental outcomes suggest that the maximum reconstruction error of the HMR algorithm is 10 mm, and the compression ratio is between 5 and 10; the HMR rate is more than 96%. Compared with similar algorithms, the proposed visual perception HMR algorithm depends less on the number of training samples. It can achieve a high recognition rate given only a relatively few samples. Therefore, the proposed (AI + intelligent robot)-enabled HMM-based HMR algorithm can effectively identify the behavior characteristics of students in sports exercise. This study can provide a reference for exploring college students' health education development path."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the longitudinal research reported in this Monograph was to examine language acquisition in the second year of life in the context of developments in cognition, affect, and social connectedness. The theoretical focus for the research is on the agency of the child and the importance of the child's intentionality for explaining development, rather than on language as an independent object. The model of development for the research is a Model of Intentionality with two components: the engagement in a world of persons and objects that motivates acquiring a language, and the effort that is required to express and articulate increasingly discrepant and elaborate intentional state representations. The fundamental assumption in the model is that the driving force for acquiring language is in the essential tension between engagement and effort for linguistic, emotional, and physical actions of interpretation and expression. Results of lag sequential analyses are reported to show how different behaviors--words, sentences, emotional expressions, conversational interactions, and constructing thematic relations between objects in play--converged, both in the stream of children's actions in everyday events, in real time, and in developmental time between the emergence of words at about 13 months and the transition to simple sentences at about 2 years of age. Patterns of deviation from baseline rates of the different behaviors show that child emotional expression, child speech, and mother speech clearly influence each other, and the mutual influences between them are different at times of either emergence or achievement in both language and object play. The three conclusions that follow from the results of the research are that (a) expression and interpretation are the acts of performance in which language is learned, which means that performance counts for explaining language acquisition; (b) language is not an independent object but is acquired by a child in relation to other kinds of behaviors and their development; and (c) acquiring language in coordination with other behaviors in acts of expression and interpretation takes work, so that acquiring language is not easy."

We detected complete deletion of PSY1 and a retrotransposon insertion in CCS. Despite the loss of PSY1 and CCS function, both MY and mutant F2 plants from a cross between MY and the 'MicroPep Red' (MR) accumulated basal levels of carotenoids, indicating that other PSY genes may complement the loss of PSY1. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that PSY2 was constitutively expressed in both MR and MY fruits, and a color complementation assay using Escherichia coli revealed that PSY2 was capable of biosynthesizing a carotenoid. Virus-induced gene silencing of PSY2 in MY resulted in white fruits.

Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) has separate male and female flowers, facilitating the study of the role of WOX1 in stamen and carpel development. Here, we identified a mango fruit (mf) mutant in cucumber, which displayed multiple defects in flower growth as well as male and female sterility. Map-based cloning showed that Mf encodes a WOX1-type transcriptional regulator (CsWOX1), and that the mf mutant encodes a truncated protein lacking the conserved WUS box. Further analysis showed that elevated expression of CsWOX1 was responsible for the mutant phenotype in cucumber and Arabidopsis. Comparative transcriptome profiling revealed certain key players and CsWOX1-associated networks that regulate reproductive development. CsWOX1 directly interacts with cucumber SPOROCYTELESS (CsSPL), and many genes in the CsSPL-mediated pathway were down-regulated in plants with the mutant allele at the Mf locus. In addition, auxin distribution was affected in both male and female flowers of the mutant. Taking together, these data suggest that CsWOX1 may regulate early reproductive organ development and be involved in sporogenesis via the CsSPL-mediated pathway and/or modulate auxin signaling in cucumber."

Therefore, a moderate aerobic exercise for 12-weeks was performed to evaluate the effects of physical activity scores on motor functions, oxidative stress, and intelligence quotients (IQ) in school children with intellectual disability. METHODS A total of 65 school children aged (12-18 Yrs) were randomly included in this study. Intellectual disability (ID),motor skills,physical fitness(VO2max), total energy expenditure (TEE), MDA, 8-OHdG, TAC, NO, and total oxidative stress(OS)were assessed using pre-validated WISC-IQ score test, BOT-2 test, PA questionnaire, and immunoassay techniques respectively. RESULTS WISC-IQ and BOT-2 set scores of intellectual and motor skills performance showed a significant correlation with physical activity status and the regulation of oxidative stress-free radicals in school children with mild and moderate ID following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. The intellectual and motor skills performance of the participants correlated positively with the increase in TAC activity and physical fitness scores and negatively with MDA, 8-OHdG, NO, and Total-OS, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis of the demographic, physical status and oxidative stress parameters explained around78.0 to 93.4 % of intellectual disability variation among schoolchildren.

However, in reality, these methods are often based on different basic training principles, resulting in the reduction in the generalization ability of artificial intelligence networks. This paper studies the complexity of sports training principles by using an artificial intelligence network model. Based on the improved model of dropout optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence sports training node prediction method based on the combination of dropout optimization algorithm and short-term memory neural network (LSTM), which avoids the establishment of complex sports training models. Based on artificial intelligence operation and maintenance records and sports training core capacity experimental data, the maximum node static estimation of artificial intelligence sports training is realized. The research shows that the node prediction model is established by using the method described in this paper. Through experimental comparison and analysis, the model has high prediction accuracy. Due to the state memory function of LSTM, it has advantages in the prediction of 2000 data on a long time scale. The mean absolute error percentage of the prediction results is less than 3.4%, and the maximum absolute error percentage is less than 5.2%. The artificial intelligence network model in this paper has good generalization ability. Compared with other models, the model proposed in this paper can get more accurate prediction results in sports training of different groups and effectively alleviate the problem of overfitting.

This paper tests the hypothesis that the green persistent sepals of the perennial herb, Helleborus foetidus, contribute to the plant's fitness by enhancing seed number and/or size. Post-floral contribution of the calyx to fruit and seed development was evaluated by manipulating sepal number and measuring the effect on follicle size, seed set, seeds per follicle, and mean seed mass. The allometric relationship between calyx size and follicle mass was examined for flower buds, open flowers, and immature fruits differing in follicle number. Calyx manipulation had no significant effect on follicle size, seed set, or number of seeds per follicle, but it did have a significant influence on the size of individual seeds. Calyx size and mean seed mass were positively, linearly related. The calyx mass/seed number ratio declined with increasing number of follicles per fruit. The persistent sepals of Helleborus do contribute resources to the development of seeds, although there is not evidence of post-floral allometric adjustment of the calyx mass/follicle number ratio that could compensate for variations in seed number per fruit."

With the mature development of artificial intelligence technology, it has great potential for application in the field of cultural education. Artificial intelligence technology has the advantages of ease of use, strong self-adaptation, and excellent generalization ability, and it is selected for data processing in this paper. Using artificial intelligence technology, the study of sports informatization to help rural sports development and rational utilization of resources can help rural sports education development, rural sports industry prosperity, rural sports talent revitalization, rural sports governance system improvement, and governance capacity enhancement. The artificial intelligence raindrop algorithm, which can automate the statistics of all relevant factors and derive results based on data fusion, was selected as the core algorithm of this paper. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent algorithm for allocating and improving the efficiency of rural sports teaching resources so as to improve the informatization level of the rural sports industry, promote industrial integration based on local needs, accelerate the \"online urban-rural integration\" in rural sports education, rural fitness guidance, and rural recreation and medical care, and rely on multiple entities. We will support the new model of sports informatization to empower rural sports teaching development by relying on the collaboration of multiple entities."

            "abstract": "Changes in carbohydrate metabolism during grape berry development play a central role in shaping the final composition of the fruit. The present work aimed to identify metabolic switches during grape development and to provide insights into the timing of developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Metabolites from central carbon metabolism were measured using high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays during the development of grape berries from either field-grown vines or fruiting cuttings grown in the greenhouse. Principal component analysis readily discriminated the various stages of berry development, with similar trajectories for field-grown and greenhouse samples. This showed that each stage of fruit development had a characteristic metabolic profile and provided compelling evidence that the fruit-bearing cuttings are a useful model system to investigate regulation of central carbon metabolism in grape berry. The metabolites measured showed tight coordination within their respective pathways, clustering into sugars and sugar-phosphate metabolism, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, there was a pronounced shift in metabolism around veraison, characterized by rapidly increasing sugar levels and decreasing organic acids. In contrast, glycolytic intermediates and sugar phosphates declined before veraison but remained fairly stable post-veraison. In summary, these detailed and comprehensive metabolite analyses revealed the timing of important switches in primary carbohydrate metabolism, which could be related to transcriptional and developmental changes within the berry to achieve an integrated understanding of grape berry development. The results are discussed in a meta-analysis comparing metabolic changes in climacteric versus non-climacteric fleshy fruits."

            "abstract": "The cuticle is composed of cutin and cuticular waxes, and it is the first protective barrier to abiotic and biotic stresses in fruit. In this study, we analysed the composition of and changes in cuticular waxes during fruit development in nectarine (Prunus persica L. Batsch) cultivars, in parallel with their conductance and their susceptibility to Monilinia laxa. The nectarine waxes were composed of triterpenoids, mostly ursolic and oleanolic acids, phytosterols, and very-long-chain aliphatics. In addition, we detected phenolic compounds that were esterified with sugars or with triterpenoids, which are newly described in cuticular waxes. We quantified 42 compounds and found that they changed markedly during fruit development, with an intense accumulation of triterpenoids during initial fruit growth followed by their decrease at the end of endocarp lignification and a final increase in very-long-chain alkanes and hydroxylated triterpenoids until maturity. The surface conductance and susceptibility to Monilinia decreased sharply at the beginning of endocarp lignification, suggesting that triterpenoid deposition could play a major role in regulating fruit permeability and susceptibility to brown rot. Our results provide new insights into the composition of cuticular waxes of nectarines and their changes during fruit development, opening new avenues of research to explore brown rot resistance factors in stone fruit."

The accumulation of these two acids in fruit cells is the result of several interlinked processes that take place in different compartments of the cell and appear to be under the control of many factors. This review combines analyses of transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data, and fruit process-based simulation models of the accumulation of citric and malic acids, to further our understanding of the physiological mechanisms likely to control the accumulation of these two acids during fruit development. The effects of agro-environmental factors, such as the source:sink ratio, water supply, mineral nutrition, and temperature, on citric and malic acid accumulation in fruit cells have been reported in several agronomic studies. This review sheds light on the interactions between these factors and the metabolism and storage of organic acids in the cell."

To help individuals concerned about their sleep, we developed a smartphone-based app called KANOPEE that allows users to interact with a virtual agent dedicated to autonomous screening and delivering digital behavioral interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Our objective was to assess the feasibility of this app, in terms of inclusion rate, follow-up rate, perceived trust and acceptance of the virtual agent, and effects of the intervention program, in the context of COVID-19 confinement in France.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The virtual agent is an artificial intelligence program using decision tree architecture and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. A total of 2069 users aged 18 years and above downloaded the free app during the study period (April 22 to May 5, 2020). These users first completed a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) conducted by the virtual agent. If the users were positive for insomnia complaints (ISI score >14), they were eligible to join the 2-stage intervention program: (1) complete an electronic sleep diary for 1 week and (2) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. We collected and analyzed the following measures: sociodemographic information, ISI scores and sleep/wake schedules, and acceptance and trust of the agent.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Approximately 76% (1574/2069) of the app users completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by 27.4% (431/1574) of the users who answered the acceptance and trust questionnaires on its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened users who reported sleep complaints (ISI score >14), 166 (21.5%) followed Step 1 of the intervention, and only 47 of those (28.3%) followed Step 2. Users who completed Step 1 found that their insomnia complaints (baseline mean ISI score 18.56, mean ISI score after Step 1 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep quality improved significantly after 1 week. Users who completed Step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measures (baseline mean ISI score 18.87, mean ISI score after Step 2 14.68; P<.001). Users that were most severely affected (ISI score >21) did not respond to either intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These preliminary results suggest that the KANOPEE app is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for individuals reporting moderately severe insomnia."

Fruit and seeds from legumes are also an important source of vegetables for a well-balanced diet. A trend in elevated temperature as a result of climate change increases the risk of a heat stress-induced reduction in legume crop yield. High temperatures during the crop reproductive development phase are particularly detrimental to fruit/seed production because the growth and development of the reproductive tissues are sensitive to small changes in temperature. Hormones are signalling molecules that play important roles in a plant's ability to integrate different environmental inputs and modify their developmental processes to optimize growth, survival, and reproduction. This review focuses on the hormonal regulation of reproductive development and heat stress-induced alteration of this regulation during (i) pollination, (ii) early fruit set, and (iii) seed development that affects fruit/seed yield in legume and other model crops. Further understanding of hormone-regulated reproductive growth under non-stress and heat-stress conditions can aid in trait selection and the development of gene modification strategies and cultural practices to improve heat tolerance in legume crops contributing to improved food security."

HD2 is a plant-specific histone deacetylase that is able to mediate transcriptional repression in many biological processes. To investigate the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms of longan fruit senescence, one histone deacetylase 2-like gene, DlHD2, and two ethylene-responsive factor-like genes, DlERF1 and DlERF2, were cloned and characterized from longan fruit. Expression of these genes was examined during fruit senescence under different storage conditions. The accumulation of DlHD2 reached a peak at 2 d and 30 d in the fruit stored at 25 °C (room temperature) and 4 °C (low temperature), respectively, or 6 h after the fruit was transferred from 4 °C to 25 °C, when fruit senescence was initiated. However, the DlERF1 transcript accumulated mostly at the later stage of fruit senescence, reaching a peak at 5 d and 35 d in the fruit stored at 25 °C and 4 °C, respectively, or 36 h after the fruit was transferred from low temperature to room temperature. Moreover, application of nitric oxide (NO) delayed fruit senescence, enhanced the expression of DlHD2, but suppressed the expression of DlERF1 and DlERF2. These results indicated a possible interaction between DlHD2 and DlERFs in regulating longan fruit senescence, and the direct interaction between DlHD2 and DlERF1 was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays.

However, current methods to record muscle forces including electromyography or marker-based measurements combined with a musculoskeletal model are time-consuming and restrict the athlete's natural movement due to equipment attachment. Therefore, the feasibility and validity of a more applicable method, requiring only a single standard camera for the recordings, combined with a deep-learning model and musculoskeletal model is evaluated in the present study during upper-body strength exercises performed by five athletes. Comparison of muscle forces obtained by the single camera driven model against those obtained from a state-of-the art marker-based driven musculoskeletal model revealed strong to excellent correlations and reasonable RMSD's of 0.4-2.1% of the maximum force (Fmax) for prime movers, and weak to strong correlations with RMSD's of 0.4-0.7% Fmax for stabilizing and secondary muscles. In conclusion, a single camera deep-learning driven model is a feasible method for muscle force analysis in a strength training environment, and first validity results show reasonable accuracies, especially for prime mover muscle forces.

This review aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall, findings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in specific metabolic pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies.

The goal of this review is to celebrate the extraordinary diversity of activity and of results, not as a prize-giving pageant, but in recognition of the field, the community that both serves and is sustained by it, and of its interdisciplinarity and its international dimension.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Beyond personal awareness of a range of work commensurate with the author's own research, it is clear that, even with a thorough literature search, a comprehensive review is impossible. Moreover, the field has grown and subdivided to an extent that makes it very hard for one individual to be familiar with every branch or with more than a few branches in any depth. A literature survey was conducted that focused on informatics-related terms in the general biomedical and healthcare literature, and specific concerns (\"artificial intelligence\", \"data models\", \"analytics\", etc.) in the biomedical informatics (BMI) literature. In addition to a selection from the results from these searches, suggestive references within them were also considered.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The substantive sections of the paper-Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and \"Big Data\" Analytics; Common Data Models, Data Quality, and Standards; Phenotyping and Cohort Discovery; Privacy: Deidentification, Distributed Computation, Blockchain; Causal Inference and Real-World Evidence-provide broad coverage of these active research areas, with, no doubt, a bias towards this reviewer's interests and preferences, landing on a number of papers that stood out in one way or another, or, alternatively, exemplified a particular line of work.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CRI is thriving, not only in the familiar major centers of research, but more widely, throughout the world. This is not to pretend that the distribution is uniform, but to highlight the potential for this domain to play a prominent role in supporting progress in medicine, healthcare, and wellbeing everywhere. We conclude with the observation that CRI and its practitioners would make apt stewards of the new medical knowledge that their methods will bring forward."

            "abstract": "A previous report was concerned with the evaluation of quality of life using a Health Promotion System for the Elderly. In the present report, we describe one part of that system: a subjective symptoms acquisition and reporting system. The main purpose of this system is to permit any physician or nurse to uniformly employ questionnaires to acquire accurate subjective symptoms. This system is applied in three steps. First, the subjective answers to 21 questions displayed on a personal computer are obtained. These answers correspond to the basic subjective symptoms. Second, if a basic subjective symptom is \"positive\", more detailed questions are automatically generated. Finally, clear sentences regarding subjective symptoms are generated and output as a \"finding report\". This information is helpful to physicians and nurses in their health-counseling work. An artificial intelligence (AI) program based on \"XpertRule\" produces detailed questions which are generated by an interactive questionnaire using branching logical rules."

            "abstract": "The tomato non-ripening (nor) mutant generates a truncated 186-amino-acid protein (NOR186) and has been demonstrated previously to be a gain-of-function mutant. Here, we provide more evidence to support this view and answer the open question of whether the NAC-NOR gene is important in fruit ripening. Overexpression of NAC-NOR in the nor mutant did not restore the full ripening phenotype. Further analysis showed that the truncated NOR186 protein is located in the nucleus and binds to but does not activate the promoters of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase2 (SlACS2), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase2 (SlGgpps2), and pectate lyase (SlPL), which are involved in ethylene biosynthesis, carotenoid accumulation, and fruit softening, respectively. The activation of the promoters by the wild-type NOR protein can be inhibited by the mutant NOR186 protein. On the other hand, ethylene synthesis, carotenoid accumulation, and fruit softening were significantly inhibited in CR-NOR (CRISPR/Cas9-edited NAC-NOR) fruit compared with the wild-type, but much less severely affected than in the nor mutant, while they were accelerated in OE-NOR (overexpressed NAC-NOR) fruit. These data further indicated that nor is a gain-of-function mutation and NAC-NOR plays a significant role in ripening of wild-type fruit."

However, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not receiving the same advantages of technology, which may be due to inadequate technological infrastructure and financial resources, lack of interest among policy makers and healthcare service providers, lack of skills and capacity among healthcare professionals in using technology based interventions, and resistance of the public to the use of technologies for healthcare or health promotion activities. Technology-based interventions offer considerable promise to develop entirely new models of healthcare both within and outside of formal systems of care and offer the opportunity to have a large public health impact. Such technology-based interventions could be used to address targeted global health problems in LMICs, including the chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - a growing health system burden in LMICs. Major preventable behavioral risk factors of chronic NCDs are increasing in LMICs, and innovative interventions are essential to address these risk factors. Computer-based or mobile-based virtual coaches or Relational Agents (RAs) are increasingly being explored for counseling patients to change their health behavior in high-income countries; however, the use of RAs in LMICs has not been studied. In this paper, we summarize the growing application of RA technology in behavior change interventions in high-income countries and describe the potential of its use in LMICs. Finally, we review the potential barriers and challenges in promoting RAs in LMICs."

We conducted a state-of-the-art review and literature synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature published since 2004. The review prioritized randomized trials and studies focused on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, but included other reports when they represented the best available evidence. The search emphasized reports on the potential benefits of mHealth interventions implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive voice response and short message service interventions can improve cardiovascular preventive care in developed countries by addressing risk factors including weight, smoking, and physical activity. Interactive voice response and short message service-based interventions for cardiovascular disease management also have shown benefits with respect to hypertension management, hospital readmissions, and diabetic glycemic control. Multimodal interventions including Web-based communication with clinicians and mHealth-enabled clinical monitoring with feedback also have shown benefits. The evidence regarding the potential benefits of interventions using smartphones and social media is still developing. Studies of mHealth interventions have been conducted in >30 low- and middle-income countries, and evidence to date suggests that programs are feasible and may improve medication adherence and disease outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that mHealth interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management. Next-generation mHealth programs developed worldwide should be based on evidence-based behavioral theories and incorporate advances in artificial intelligence for adapting systems automatically to patients' unique and changing needs."

Such pipeline comprises clinical center profiling, predictive model targeting, predictive model construction and model validation. After having dealt with missing data by means of random forest (RF) and having applied suitable strategies to handle class imbalance, we have used Logistic Regression with stepwise feature selection to predict the onset of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy, at different time scenarios, at 3, 5, and 7 years from the first visit at the Hospital Center for Diabetes (not from the diagnosis). Considered variables are gender, age, time from diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and smoking habit. Final models, tailored in accordance with the complications, provided an accuracy up to 0.838. Different variables were selected for each complication and time scenario, leading to specialized models easy to translate to the clinical practice."

Socioeconomic categories, called quintiles, were used to compare high and low socioeconomic status groups. Overweight was identified when BMI values fell above the 85th percentile, using age- and gender-specific cut-off points. The group was categorised into 4 BMI groups (never overweight, persistent overweight, overweight-to-normal and normal-to-overweight).

The history of its dispersal to the Occident from its centre of origin, the Indian subcontinent, has been incorrectly understood for some time, due to the confusion of cucumbers with vegetable melons. Iconographic and literary evidence has shown that cucumber was absent in Roman times, up to 500 CE, but present in Europe by late medieval times, 1300. The objective of the present investigation was to determine more accurately when the cucumber arrived in Europe and by what route.\n    \n\n\n          Findings and conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence for the movement of C. sativus westward is entirely lexicographical until the 10th century. Syriac, Persian and Byzantine Greek sources suggest the presence of cucumbers, to the east and north-east of the Mediterranean Sea (modern Iran, Iraq and Turkey), by the 6th or 7th century. Arabic medical writings suggest the presence of cucumbers in Spain as early as the mid-9th century and in Tunisia by the early 10th century. Descriptive evidence in Arabic establishes the presence of cucumbers in Andalusia by the second half of the 10th century. Latin translations from Arabic sources indicate the presence of cucumbers in southern Italy by the second half of the 11th century. These writings, together with lexicographical discrepancies in names of cucurbits in late medieval Latin writings, suggest that cucumber was introduced to Europe by two independent diffusions. One diffusion appears to have been overland from Persia into eastern and northern Europe and preceded the Islamic conquests. The other, subsequent diffusion into western and southern Europe, was probably by a mostly maritime route from Persia or the Indian subcontinent into Andalusia."

            "abstract": "Increasingly music has been shown to have both physical and mental health benefits including improvements in cardiovascular health, a link to reduction of cases of dementia in elderly populations, and improvements in markers of general mental well-being such as stress reduction. Here, we describe short case studies addressing general mental well-being (anxiety, stress-reduction) through AI-driven music generation. Engaging in active listening and music-making activities (especially for at risk age groups) can be particularly beneficial, and the practice of music therapy has been shown to be helpful in a range of use cases across a wide age range. However, access to music-making can be prohibitive in terms of access to expertize, materials, and cost. Furthermore the use of existing music for functional outcomes (such as targeted improvement in physical and mental health markers suggested above) can be hindered by issues of repetition and subsequent over-familiarity with existing material. In this paper, we describe machine learning approaches which create functional music informed by biophysiological measurement across two case studies, with target emotional states at opposing ends of a Cartesian affective space (a dimensional emotion space with points ranging from descriptors from relaxation, to fear). Galvanic skin response is used as a marker of psychological arousal and as an estimate of emotional state to be used as a control signal in the training of the machine learning algorithm. This algorithm creates a non-linear time series of musical features for sound synthesis \"on-the-fly\", using a perceptually informed musical feature similarity model. We find an interaction between familiarity and perceived emotional response. We also report on subsequent psychometric evaluation of the generated material, and consider how these - and similar techniques - might be useful for a range of functional music generation tasks, for example, in nonlinear sound-tracking such as that found in interactive media or video games."

Traditionally, evaluation of these conditions relied heavily upon body mass index \"BMI\" measurements, which are limited and open to inaccurate interpretation or omission of critical data. Advances in imaging allow better recognition of these conditions using accurate qualitative and quantitative data and correlation with any morphological changes in organs. Body composition evaluations include the assessment of the bone mineral density (BMD), visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, liver fat and iron overload and muscle fat (including the lean muscle ratio), with differential evaluation of specific muscle groups when required. Such measurements are important as a baseline and for monitoring the effect of therapies and various interventions.

This positively influences patient compliance and outcomes during early counselling, monitoring and modulation of therapy. This encourages patients suffering from obesity and eating disorders to better understand their often chronic but reversible condition.

However, information on the role of these beneficial compounds in the physiology of pepper fruit remains scarce. Recent studies have shown that antioxidants in ripe pepper fruit play a key role in responses to temperature changes, and the redox state at the time of harvest affects the nutritional value for human consumption. In this paper, the role of antioxidant metabolism of pepper fruit during ripening and in the response to low temperature is addressed, paying particular attention to ascorbate, NADPH and the superoxide dismutase enzymatic system. The participation of chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes in the ripening process is also investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Scope and results:\n        \n      \n      Important changes occur at a subcellular level during ripening of pepper fruit. Chloroplasts turn into chromoplasts, with drastic conversion of their metabolism, and the role of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle is essential. In mitochondria from red fruits, higher ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and Mn-SOD activities are involved in avoiding the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in these organelles during ripening. Peroxisomes, whose antioxidant capacity at fruit ripening is substantially affected, display an atypical metabolic pattern during this physiological stage. In spite of these differences observed in the antioxidative metabolism of mitochondria and peroxisomes, proteomic analysis of these organelles, carried out by 2-D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF and provided here for the first time, reveals no changes between the antioxidant metabolism from immature (green) and ripe (red) fruits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Taken together, the results show that investigation of molecular and enzymatic antioxidants from cell compartments, especially chloroplasts, mitochondria and peroxisomes, is a useful tool to study the physiology of pepper fruit, particularly in the context of expanding their shelf-life after harvest and in maintaining their nutritional value."

            "abstract": "At present, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play an irreplaceable role in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases and medical research. EEG signals need to be processed in order to reduce the adverse effects of irrelevant physiological process interference and measurement noise. Wavelet transform (WT) can provide a time-frequency representation of a dynamic process, and it has been widely utilized in salient feature analysis of EEG. In this paper, we investigate the problem of translation variability (TV) in discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which causes degradation of time-frequency localization. It will be verified through numerical simulations that TV is caused by downsampling operations in decomposition process of DWT. The presence of TV may cause severe distortions of features in wavelet subspaces. However, this phenomenon has not attracted much attention in the scientific community. Redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) is derived by eliminating the downsampling operation. RDWT enjoys the attractive merit of translation invariance. RDWT shares the same time-frequency pattern with that of DWT. The discrete delta impulse function is used to test the time-frequency response of DWT and RDWT in wavelet subspaces. The results show that DWT is very sensitive to the translation of delta impulse function, while RDWT keeps the decomposition results unchanged. This conclusion has also been verified again in decomposition of actual EEG signals. In conclusion, to avoid possible distortions of features caused by translation sensitivity in DWT, we recommend the use of RDWT with more stable performance in BCI research and clinical applications."

Oil plant genomes are highly diverse, and their genetic variation leads to a diversity in oil biosynthesis and accumulation along with agronomic traits. This review discusses plant oil biosynthetic pathways, current state of genome assembly, polyploidy and asymmetric evolution of genomes of oil plants and their wild relatives, and research progress of pan-genomics in oil plants. The availability of complete high-resolution genomes and pan-genomes has enabled the identification of structural variations in the genomes that are associated with the diversity of agronomic and environment fitness traits. These and future genomes also provide powerful tools to understand crop evolution and to harvest the rich natural variations to improve oil crops for enhanced productivity, oil quality, and adaptability to changing environments."

Our main objective was to verify whether such an approach could be successfully applied to the discovery of mathematical equations that explain experimental data gathered during the observation of a given dynamic system. Moreover, we wanted to compare it with an approach based on artificial intelligence that uses symbolic regression to find such formulae automatically. To achieve this, we designed and implemented an Internet game in which players attempt to design a spaceship representing an equation that models the observed system. The game was designed while considering that it should be easy to use for people without strong mathematical backgrounds. Moreover, we tried to make use of the collective intelligence observed in crowdsourced systems by enabling many players to collaborate on a single solution. The idea was tested on several hundred players playing almost 10,000 games and conducting a user opinion survey. The results prove that the proposed solution has very high potential. The function generated during weeklong tests was almost as precise as the analytical solution of the model of the system and, up to a certain complexity level of the formulae, it explained data better than the solution generated automatically by Eureqa, the leading software application for the implementation of symbolic regression. Moreover, we observed benefits of using crowdsourcing; the chain of consecutive solutions that led to the best solution was obtained by the continuous collaboration of several players."

Each time a child visits the kiosk, the pet (a mid-sized dog) automatically detects its owner based on the data from a child's Fitbit, assists the child in setting daily PA goals and provides tailored feedback on the child's PA progress. The pet alerts parents in real-time by sending text messages and relaying the parents' response to the child, so that parents and children can remain connected about the child's PA progress even when they are physically apart.

Measurement of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) requires the diagnosis of the stage of diabetic nephropathy and the prognosis of renal function. We aimed to analyze the impact of lifestyle modification on UAE in patients with stage 2 and 3 type 2 diabetic nephropathy who received comprehensive medical care, using a generalized additive model (GAM), an explanatory machine learning model. In this retrospective observational study, we used changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels; body mass index (BMI); and daily salt intake as factors contributing to changes in UAE. In total, 269 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were enrolled (stage 2, 217 patients; stage 3, 52 patients). The rankings that contributed to changes in UAE over 6 months by permutation importance were the changes in daily salt intake, HbA1c, SBP, DBP, and BMI. GAM, which predicts the change in UAE, showed that with increase in the changes in salt intake, SBP, and HbA1c, the delta UAE tended to increase. Salt intake was the most contributory factor for the changes in UAE, and daily salt intake was the best lifestyle factor to explain the changes in UAE. Strict control of salt intake may have beneficial effects on improving UAE in patients with stage 2 and 3 diabetic nephropathy."

The period commenced at the seed stage with one theoretical cell undergoing intensive cell division, and ended when the cell number became nearly constant. The model takes into consideration the proliferative activity of the fruit cell population which, a few days before flower anthesis, begins to decrease progressively after each mitotic cycle. Model parameters, namely the time at which proliferative activity diminishes, its rate of decrease and the length of the cell cycle, were estimated by fitting the model to observed cell population dynamics in tomato fruits growing in three different positions on the truss. It is hypothesized that the molecular mechanism responsible for the cessation of mitosis in growing fruits is associated with shortening of telomeric ends of nuclear DNA, as suggested previously for other growing cell populations."

Genetic predictors were derived from published summary results from the largest genome-wide association studies on BMI (n ∼ 350,000) and height (n ∼ 250,000) to date. We derived methylation predictors by estimating probe-trait effects in discovery samples and tested them in external samples. Methylation profiles associated with BMI in older individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBCs, n = 1,366) explained 4.9% of the variation in BMI in Dutch adults from the LifeLines DEEP study (n = 750) but did not account for any BMI variation in adolescents from the Brisbane Systems Genetic Study (BSGS, n = 403). Methylation profiles based on the Dutch sample explained 4.9% and 3.6% of the variation in BMI in the LBCs and BSGS, respectively. Methylation profiles predicted BMI independently of genetic profiles in an additive manner: 7%, 8%, and 14% of variance of BMI in the LBCs were explained by the methylation predictor, the genetic predictor, and a model containing both, respectively. The corresponding percentages for LifeLines DEEP were 5%, 9%, and 13%, respectively, suggesting that the methylation profiles represent environmental effects. The differential effects of the BMI methylation profiles by age support previous observations of age modulation of genetic contributions. In contrast, methylation profiles accounted for almost no variation in height, consistent with a mainly genetic contribution to inter-individual variation. The BMI results suggest that combining genetic and epigenetic information might have greater utility for complex-trait prediction."

With Japanese pears (Pyrus pyrifolia), later maturing cultivars usually have larger fruits than earlier maturing cultivars. It is considered that the supply of photosynthate during fruit development is a critical determinant of size. To assess the interaction of assimilate supply and early/late maturity of cultivars and its effect on final fruit size, the pattern of carbon assimilate partitioning from spur leaves (source) to fruit and other organs (sinks) during fruit growth was investigated using three genotypes differing in maturation date.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Partitioning of photosynthate from spur leaves during fruit growth was investigated by exposure of spurs to (13)CO(2) and measurement of the change in (13)C abundance in dry matter with time.

Enhancing flavonoid biosynthesis in chosen crops may provide new raw materials that have the potential to be used in foods designed for specific benefits to human health. Using genetic modification, it was possible to generate several tomato lines with significantly altered flavonoid content and to probe the role and importance of several key enzymatic steps in the tomato flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Most notably an up to 78-fold increase in total fruit flavonols was achieved through ectopic expression of a single biosynthetic enzyme, chalcone isomerase. In addition, chalcone synthase and flavonol synthase transgenes were found to act synergistically to up-regulate flavonol biosynthesis significantly in tomato flesh tissues."

The first is that we cannot eliminate the possibility that people will avoid areas being observed and go to other areas. The second is that for people visiting downtown areas, we cannot know where they reside. These issues can be resolved if we quantify the degree of stay-home using the number of people leaving residential areas.

Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports.

The AGREE II is the revised tool for PG development, reporting, and evaluation, comprised of 23 items, two global rating scores, and a new User's Manual. In this study, we sought to develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two internet interventions designed to accelerate the capacity of stakeholders to use the AGREE II.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were randomized to one of three training conditions. 'Tutorial'--participants proceeded through the online tutorial with a virtual coach and reviewed a PDF copy of the AGREE II. 'Tutorial + Practice Exercise'--in addition to the Tutorial, participants also appraised a 'practice' PG. For the practice PG appraisal, participants received feedback on how their scores compared to expert norms and formative feedback if scores fell outside the predefined range. 'AGREE II User's Manual PDF (control condition)'--participants reviewed a PDF copy of the AGREE II only. All participants evaluated a test PG using the AGREE II. Outcomes of interest were learners' performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, mental effort, time-on-task, and perceptions of AGREE II.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No differences emerged between training conditions on any of the outcome measures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We believe these results can be explained by better than anticipated performance of the AGREE II PDF materials (control condition) or the participants' level of health methodology and PG experience rather than the failure of the online training interventions.

The goal of this study was to evaluate Keenoa™ based on user feedback and compare it to a conventional pen and paper method. One hundred and two participants were recruited and randomly assigned to record their diets using this application for 3 nonconsecutive days. Following this, participants were invited to complete an online \"exit\" survey. Seventy-two subjects responded, with 50 completing an open-ended question asking for general feedback about the app. Data were reviewed and 3 main themes emerged: strengths, challenges, and future recommendations. Strengths associated with the app consisted of picture recognition software, the additional commentary feature, and the overall pleasant data collection process. Challenges that were identified included inconsistencies with the barcode scanning features, the limited food database, time to enter food details, and software issues. Future recommendations included using a larger food database, pairing dietary intake with physical activity monitoring, and having accessible nutritional data. Despite these limitations, participants preferred using mobile apps to record diet compared with traditional written food diaries."

With the rapid development and popularization of science and technology, it becomes a reality for researchers to obtain large-scale human motion data sets in real time with higher efficiency. However, at present, the analysis of gait stability of moving joints is still based on image recognition technology, which is ten times less accurate and inefficient. In this paper, Vicon 3D motion capture system, dynamometer, and surface electromyography system were used to obtain the parameters of the lower limbs of the subjects. Using Anywhere modeling and simulation system, simulation experiments were carried out, and the reaction force data of lower limb joints under two environments were obtained. The gait characteristics of human gait were analyzed from the angle of internal and external adjustment mechanism. Combining one-way ANOVA and incremental occupancy rate, the adjustment process of gait stability is described comprehensively. The findings of this study can provide a theoretical basis for the research of lower limb con-assistive devices and can guide the design and development of bipedal anthropomorphic robots."

In this work, we studied the pollination biology and the breeding system of Harrisia portoricensis, an island columnar cactus, to test for the presence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression. For H. portoricensis, which bears flowers with typical outcrossing morphology, the results from 322 h of direct observations and videotaping showed that visits to flowers by animals were uncommon. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that H. portoricensis has a partially self-compatible breeding system that it is not autogamous and thus requires an external mechanism for the movement of pollen to set fruit. We detected differences in seed size, seed mass, germination success, and multiplicative fitness estimates between self- and cross-pollination treatments. We found that progeny resulting from natural and self-pollination treatments showed signs of inbreeding depression compared with progeny resulting from cross-pollination; however, the magnitude of the inbreeding depression was less than 50%. Our combined results suggest that for this species an endogamous breeding system should be favored by natural selection."

The possibility of precisely studying gait modulation using standardized protocols of gait analysis closely resembling everyday life scenarios is still an unmet need. Methods: We have developed a fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where subjects have to adjust their walking pattern to avoid collision with a virtual agent (VA) crossing their gait trajectory. We collected kinematic data of 12 healthy young subjects walking in real world (RW) and in the VR environment, both with (VR/A+) and without (VR/A-) the VA perturbation. The VR environment closely resembled the RW scenario of the gait laboratory. To ensure standardization of the obstacle presentation the starting time speed and trajectory of the VA were defined using the kinematics of the participant as detected online during each walking trial. Results: We did not observe kinematic differences between walking in RW and VR/A-, suggesting that our VR environment per se might not induce significant changes in the locomotor pattern. When facing the VA all subjects consistently reduced stride length and velocity while increasing stride duration. Trunk inclination and mediolateral trajectory deviation also facilitated avoidance of the obstacle. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that our VR/A+ paradigm effectively induced a timely gait modulation in a standardized immersive and realistic scenario. This protocol could be a powerful research tool to study gait modulation and its derangements in relation to aging and clinical conditions."

To evaluate the duration of persistent efficacy against nasal bots (Oestrus ovis), a natural exposure study was conducted in Spain during the summer of 2011. One hundred and twenty nasal bot-free, Rasa Aragonesa sheep were randomly allocated to eight groups of 15 animals each. On Day 0, four groups were treated at the recommended dose rate of 1 mg moxidectin/kg bodyweight. Four groups remained untreated as negative controls. All animals were held in nasal bot-proof housing except for exposure to natural challenge when one group of treated sheep and one of group of control animals were transferred to a local pasture at either 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, or 60-80 days after treatment. Following challenge, sheep were scored for clinical signs of bot infestation, necropsied and the heads sectioned for larval recovery. Nasal bot larvae were retrieved from 7 to 11 control sheep following each exposure period indicating that adult bots were active throughout the study. In the first challenge up to 20 days after treatment, when sheep were slaughtered immediately after exposure, the majority of larvae were first instar (L1) and only 3 of the 15 control sheep were infested with second instars (L2). There was 100% efficacy against L2 and 38.1% reduction in the number of live L1 in the treated sheep but mean counts were not significantly different between treatment and control groups (P ≥ 0.05). For the subsequent exposure periods 20-80 days after treatment (necropsies 7-9 days after challenge), 6-10 sheep were infested with L1 and 9-11 control sheep were infested with L2 and third instars (L3). There was negligible efficacy against L1, but treatment with moxidectin resulted in 100% control of L2 and L3. These results are consistent with the biology of nasal bots and control with a systemic agent, as the slower growing L1 have limited feeding and are therefore less susceptible to systemic parasiticides. The study demonstrated that the persistent efficacy of this long-acting injectable formulation of moxidectin protects against the development of active O. ovis infestations for at least 80 days after treatment."

Particular attention has been attached to the sensors applied between the fingers, and this makes sensing and grasping capabilities improved. To create an accurate grasping system, a grasping algorithm and the force control model are proposed for any bending state based on Cosserat theory. The boundary detection is included in the grasping algorithm, detecting the shape edge by some certain point calculation. The created grasping system guarantees mechanical compliance by evaluating and adjusting the finger status including force, angle, and direction. Multi-group tests have been done on grasping several objects of different sizes and materials in daily life. The relationship between force, bending, and surface material is also analyzed and compared under different conditions. The numerical comparisons related to the measurement error are analyzed based on their standard deviations. Experimental results indicate that this flexible manipulator with proposed system and strategy has better grasping ability for fragile fruits with its good flexibility and dexterity."

            "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviors increase individual health risks and are a socioeconomic burden. Harnessing social influence is perceived as fundamental for interventions to influence health-related behaviors. However, the mechanisms through which social influence occurs are poorly understood. Online social networks provide the opportunity to understand these mechanisms as they digitally archive communication between members. In this paper, we present a methodology for content-based social network analysis, combining qualitative coding, automated text analysis, and formal network analysis such that network structure is determined by the content of messages exchanged between members. We apply this approach to characterize the communication between members of QuitNet, an online social network for smoking cessation. Results indicate that the method identifies meaningful theme-based social sub-networks. Modeling social network data using this method can provide us with theme-specific insights such as the identities of opinion leaders and sub-community clusters. Implications for design of targeted social interventions are discussed."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In Palestine, the ongoing Israeli occupation shapes and endangers all spaces that are used by children in their everyday lives. In this study, Palestinian children were considered active agents in their lives, both affecting and being affected by the world around them. Our research aimed to explore the role of resources, competencies, and attitudes of spatial agency in the lives of children in the occupied Palestinian territory. Specifically, we investigated how children use domestic and social spaces to actively maintain positive function and wellbeing despite an environmental backdrop of military violence.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A convenience sample of 29 children aged 7-13 years (mean 9·66, SD 1·63) attending the primary school in Dheisheh refugee camp, West Bank, was selected. 17% (5 of 29) were boys and 83% (24) were girls. All children were asked to draw and describe a map of safe and unsafe places in the camp. Ten children were asked to continue the conversation outdoors using a \"walk-along\" technique, showing familiar places and narrating their experiences. Data were collected in April, 2018. All of the children's narratives were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated by a local bilingual researcher. Thematic content analysis was applied. Children who have been diagnosed with a physical or psychological disease were excluded from the sample. The study was approved by the ethical board of the University of Milano-Bicocca. Written informed consent was obtained from children and their families, who were informed of the scope of the research.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Five themes emerged: using the mosque and the school to access spiritual and educational resources for subjective wellbeing; internal spaces as a safe place for growth and development (including domestic spaces to experience a sense of protection and security); community spaces to have fun and play an active part in the social and political life of the camp; enjoying the outdoor spaces of the camp despite environmental dangers and the violence of the occupation. Some children perceived risks and lack of safety in their lives. Children's narratives made plain the ways in which their ability to mobilise functioning resources (such as playing and socialising) were constrained by military and community violence, and environmental degradation. Overall, social and external places as spaces to restore a sense of normality and happiness were valorised more by boys than by girls, and girls were more active in internal spaces than in external spaces.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Spatial agency is a key factor that potentiates wellbeing in children.

Approximately 3500 infants die from SIDS and sleep-related reasons on a yearly basis. Unintentional sleep-related deaths and bed sharing, a known risk factor for SIDS, are on the rise. Furthermore, ethnic disparities exist among those most affected by SIDS. Despite public health campaigns, infant mortality persists. Given the popularity of social media, understanding social media conversations around SIDS and safe sleep may assist the medical and public health communities with information needed to spread, reinforce, or counteract false information regarding SIDS and safe sleep.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of our study was to investigate the social media conversation around SIDS and safe sleep to understand the possible influences and guide health promotion efforts and public health research as well as enable health professionals to engage in directed communication regarding this topic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used textual analytics to identify topics and extract meanings contained in unstructured textual data. Twitter messages were captured during September, October, and November in 2017. Tweets and retweets were collected using NUVI software in conjunction with Twitter's search API using the keywords: \"sids,\" \"infant death syndrome,\" \"sudden infant death syndrome,\" and \"safe sleep.\" This returned a total of 41,358 messages, which were analyzed using text mining and social media monitoring software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Multiple themes were identified, including recommendations for safe sleep to prevent SIDS, safe sleep devices, the potential causes of SIDS, and how breastfeeding reduces SIDS. Compared with September and November, more personal and specific stories of infant loss were demonstrated in October (Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month). The top influencers were news organizations, universities, and health-related organizations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We identified valuable topics discussed and shared on Twitter regarding SIDS and safe sleep. The study results highlight the contradicting information a subset of the population is exposed to regarding SIDS and the continued controversy over vaccines. In addition, this analysis emphasizes the lack of public health organizations' presence on Twitter compared with the influence of universities and news media organizations. The results also demonstrate the prevalence of safe sleep products that are embedded in safe sleep messaging. These findings can assist providers in speaking about relevant topics when engaging in conversations about the prevention of SIDS and the promotion of safe sleep. Furthermore, public health agencies and advocates should utilize social media and Twitter to better communicate accurate health information as well as continue to combat the spread of false information."

Early risk stratification for the need of ECMO therapy upon admission to the hospital using artificial intelligence (AI)-based computed tomography (CT) assessment and clinical scores is beneficial for patient assessment and resource management; (2) Methods: Retrospective single-center study with 95 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the participating ICUs. Patients requiring ECMO therapy (n = 14) during ICU stay versus patients without ECMO treatment (n = 81) were evaluated for discriminative clinical prediction parameters and AI-based CT imaging features and their diagnostic potential to predict ECMO therapy. Reported patient data include clinical scores, AI-based CT findings and patient outcomes; (3) Results: Patients subsequently allocated to ECMO therapy had significantly higher sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores (p < 0.001) and significantly lower oxygenation indices on admission (p = 0.009) than patients with standard ICU therapy. The median time from hospital admission to ECMO placement was 1.4 days (IQR 0.2-4.0). The percentage of lung involvement on AI-based CT assessment on admission to the hospital was significantly higher in ECMO patients (p < 0.001). In binary logistic regression analyses for ECMO prediction including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), SOFA score on admission, lactate on admission and percentage of lung involvement on admission CTs, only SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.62) and lung involvement (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) were significantly associated with subsequent ECMO allocation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73-0.94) for lung involvement on admission CT and 0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.91) for SOFA scores on ICU admission. A combined parameter of SOFA on ICU admission and lung involvement on admission CT yielded an AUC of 0.91 (0.84-0.97) with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.84 for ECMO prediction; (4) Conclusions: AI-based assessment of lung involvement on CT scans on admission to the hospital and SOFA scoring, especially if combined, can be used as risk stratification tools for subsequent requirement for ECMO therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease to improve resource management in ICU settings."

In order to better optimize the network structure and reduce the total number of main training parameters in the convolutional layer, a convolutional network entity model based on shared resources of main parameters is clearly proposed. We analyzed the CNN multi-position wearable sensor human activity recognition used in basketball training. According to the entity model of the main parameters of shared resources, the effectiveness of the entity model is verified from both the total number of sensors and the accuracy of single-class recognition. In addition to maintaining the actual effect of recognition, the main training parameters are also reduced. The simulation results verify the actual effect of the SVM algorithm and motion simulation of the convolutional network entity model. On this basis, scientific research physical exercise methods are selected to reasonably ensure the smooth progress of appropriate physical exercise at a certain level, improve the quality of training and the actual effect."

            "abstract": "With an ageing population and a discourse of active ageing guiding welfare policies, initiatives to engage older people in health promoting activities have been established. One growing phenomenon is Senior Summer Camps, arranged all over Sweden in beautiful natural environments close to water. Their main purpose is to enable older people to participate in outdoor activities in an institutionalized setting. Although many professionals consider acts of infantilization as highly inappropriate, research has shown that still this is frequently done in institutional settings targeting older people. This paper wish to contribute to this field of research. The objective is to study how the camp leaders handle the dilemma of on the one hand, wanting to push senior campers into participating in challenging activities, and on the other, needing to pull them away, to reduce risk and ensure their safety, as well as how senior campers experience alternately being pushed into and pulled away from activities. What strategies are used by the camp leaders to push the campers to challenge themselves without taking unnecessary risks, and what consequences do these strategies have for the campers? The study was conducted in the form of ethnographic observations at two different camps. During one week at each camp we stayed with the participants, alternately being a silent observer and listener in the background, and an active participant in conversations and activities. Narratives, direct quotes, descriptions and reflections were written down in a field diary that forms the empirical basis for the analysis. Various modes of pushing and pulling were identified and defined as cheering, tricking, compelling, monitoring and restricting. These different modes of pushing and pulling were analyzed as manifestations of force, exerted by the camp leaders within a certain age-based force dynamic that resulted in different responses among the campers, especially in terms of how they \"did age\" in relation to notions on autonomy and vulnerability. It is shown that manifestations of force involve the risk of putting the campers in a position of vulnerability, regardless of whether or not they are actually vulnerable. The main argument in this paper is that initiatives that in an institutionalized context aim to promote a prolonged health and well-being, targeting \"older people\" in a general sense, run the risk of getting the exact opposite result, namely instead learned vulnerability is implicitly promoted by removing or downplaying the agency and autonomy of the campers."

            "abstract": "We conducted a functional analysis of seed dispersal and its plasticity in response to density in Arabidopsis thaliana by growing morphologically diverse ecotypes under high and low density and measuring seed dispersion patterns under controlled conditions. Maternal plant architectural traits such as height and branching, and fruit traits such as dehiscence and silique length influenced various measures of seed dispersion patterns, including the average dispersal distance, kurtosis of the seed dispersion pattern, and post-dispersal seed density. The density at which plants grew determined which traits influenced dispersal. A change in density would therefore change which maternal characters would be subjected to natural selection through selection on dispersal. Density-mediated maternal effects on dispersal contributed to a negative correlation between parents and offspring for sibling density after dispersal, which could impede the response to selection on post-dispersal sibling density. Plant traits that influenced dispersal also influenced maternal fitness- sometimes opposing selection on dispersal and sometimes augmenting it-and the direction of the relationship sometimes depended on density. These density-dependent relationships between plant traits, dispersal, and maternal fitness can increase or reduce evolutionary constraints on dispersal, depending on the trait and depending on post-dispersal density itself."

We show that cooperation can not only be stabilized, but even promoted, when the bots intervene in the partner selections made by the humans, re-shaping social connections locally within a larger group. Cooperation rates increased from 60.4% at baseline to 79.4% at the end. This network-intervention strategy outperformed other strategies, such as adding bots playing tit-for-tat. We also confirm that even a single bot can foster cooperation in human groups by using a mixed strategy designed to support the development of cooperative clusters.

The model was applied to peach fruit, and its parameters were estimated from the data of a 2-year field experiment. The predictions of the model were in agreement with experimental data. Simulations were made to analyse the responses to variations of temperature and fruit growth. Increasing fruit growth before stone hardening stimulated citrate production, while increasing fruit growth after stone hardening reduced it. Delaying the date at which the maximum growth rate was reached enhanced citrate production during most of the period.

Some philosophers and cognitive scientists argue for vectorial representations of concepts, where the meaning of a word is represented as its position in a high-dimensional neural state space. At the intersection of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, a class of very successful distributional word vector models has developed that can account for classic EEG findings of language, that is, the ease versus difficulty of integrating a word with its sentence context. However, models of semantics have to account not only for context-based word processing, but should also describe how word meaning is represented. Here, we investigate whether distributional vector representations of word meaning can model brain activity induced by words presented without context. Using EEG activity (event-related brain potentials) collected while participants in two experiments (English and German) read isolated words, we encoded and decoded word vectors taken from the family of prediction-based Word2vec algorithms. We found that, first, the position of a word in vector space allows the prediction of the pattern of corresponding neural activity over time, in particular during a time window of 300 to 500 ms after word onset. Second, distributional models perform better than a human-created taxonomic baseline model (WordNet), and this holds for several distinct vector-based models. Third, multiple latent semantic dimensions of word meaning can be decoded from brain activity. Combined, these results suggest that empiricist, prediction-based vectorial representations of meaning are a viable candidate for the representational architecture of human semantic knowledge."

Overall, patients with treated clubfoot had average gross motor BOT-2 scores compared with age-matched peers. Patients in the PT group scored higher on Running Speed/Agility (P=0.019), Body Coordination percentile rank (P=0.038), and Strength and Agility percentile rank (P=0.007) than patients treated by the Ponseti technique.

            "abstract": "The first step to exercise is preceded by the required assumption of the upright body position, which itself involves physical activity. The gravitational displacement of blood from the chest to the lower parts of the body elicits a fall in central blood volume (CBV), which corresponds to the fraction of thoracic blood volume directly available to the left ventricle. The reduction in CBV and stroke volume (SV) in response to postural stress, post-exercise, or to blood loss results in reduced left ventricular filling, which may manifest as orthostatic intolerance. When termination of exercise removes the leg muscle pump function, CBV is no longer maintained. The resulting imbalance between a reduced cardiac output (CO) and a still enhanced peripheral vascular conductance may provoke post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Instruments that quantify CBV are not readily available and to express which magnitude of the CBV in a healthy subject should remains difficult. In the physiological laboratory, the CBV can be modified by making use of postural stressors, such as lower body \"negative\" or sub-atmospheric pressure (LBNP) or passive head-up tilt (HUT), while quantifying relevant biomedical parameters of blood flow and oxygenation. Several approaches, such as wearable sensors and advanced machine-learning techniques, have been followed in an attempt to improve methodologies for better prediction of outcomes and to guide treatment in civil patients and on the battlefield. In the recent decade, efforts have been made to develop algorithms and apply artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of hemodynamic monitoring. Advances in quantifying and monitoring CBV during environmental stress from exercise to hemorrhage and understanding the analogy between postural stress and central hypovolemia during anesthesia offer great relevance for healthy subjects and clinical populations."

However, little is known about the association between FMR and dementia risk. We aimed to prospectively investigate the sex-specific associations between total and regional FMR and incident dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 491 420 participants (223 581 men and 267 839 women; mean age 56.7 ± 8.2 and 56.3 ± 8.0 years old, respectively) free of dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank were included. Fat mass and muscle mass were measured using a bioelectrical impedance assessment device. Cox regression analyses were used to examine the associations of total and regional FMR with incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). The shape of the associations of the continuous scale of FMR and incident dementia were examined using restricted cubic spline analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During a median 8.65 years of follow-up, we documented 2 225 incident all-cause dementia cases, including 836 AD and 468 VD cases. There was an L-shaped association between whole body FMR and all-cause dementia risk in both sexes after adjusting body mass index (BMI) and other covariates (P for non-linear <0.001 in men and women), where all-cause dementia risk decreased steeply with increasing FMR and levelled off at around the medians (0.35 in men, 0.61 in women) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.96; P = 0.019) and 0.60 (0.47, 0.77; <0.001) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in men and women, respectively.

Specifically, the inverse associations of whole body FMR on all-cause dementia risk were significant only among participants over the age of 60 (P for trend <0.001). Multivariable adjusted Cox models showed inverse associations of whole body FMR with AD in men only (P for trend = 0.003), whereas no statistically significant decrease was detected in VD among men and women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our analyses provide strong evidence for L-shaped associations of total and regional FMR with the development of dementia among participants aged 60 years or older independent of overall obesity."

Assessing DT ability in real-life activities using standardized protocols remains difficult. Virtual reality (VR) may represent an interesting alternative enabling the exposure to different scenarios simulating community walking. To better understand dual-task abilities in everyday life activities, the aims of this study were (1) to assess locomotor and cognitive dual-task cost (DTC) during representative daily living activities, using VR, in healthy adults; and 2) to explore the influence of the nature and complexity of locomotor and cognitive tasks on DTC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen healthy young adults (24.9 ± 2.7 years old, 8 women) were recruited to walk in a virtual 100 m shopping mall corridor, while remembering a 5-item list (DT condition), using an omnidirectional platform and a VR headset. Two levels of difficulty were proposed for the locomotor task (with vs. without virtual agent avoidance) and for the cognitive task (with vs. without items modification). These tasks were also performed in single task (ST) condition. Locomotor and cognitive DTC were measured by comparing performances in ST and DT conditions. Locomotor performance was characterized using walking speed, walking fluidity, and minimal distance between the participant and the virtual agent during avoidance. Cognitive performance was assessed with the number of items correctly recalled. Presence of DTC were determined with one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton.

To gain further insight into the role of AOX in tomato fruit ripening, transgenic tomato plants 35S-AOX1a and 35S-AOX-RNAi were generated. Tomato plants with reduced LeAOX levels exhibited retarded ripening; reduced carotenoids, respiration, and ethylene production; and the down-regulation of ripening-associated genes. Moreover, no apparent respiratory climacteric occurred in the AOX-reduced tomato fruit, indicating that AOX might play an important role in climacteric respiration. In contrast, the fruit that overexpressed LeAOX1a accumulated more lycopene, though they displayed a similar pattern of ripening to wild-type fruit. Ethylene application promoted fruit ripening and anticipated ethylene production and respiration, including the alternative pathway respiration. Interestingly, the transgenic plants with reduced LeAOX levels failed to ripen after 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatment, while such inhibition was notably less effective in 35S-AOX1a fruit. These findings indicate that AOX is involved in respiratory climacteric and ethylene-mediated fruit ripening of tomato."

Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated applications system in the near future will be inevitable.

Periodontal examination was carried out by trained dentists for participants aged ≥30 y. The extent of periodontitis was represented by the proportion of sites with clinical attachment loss (CAL)≥ 3 mm, split into 4 equal quartiles. A range of systemic diseases reported during the survey were also extracted. Hypergraph network analysis with eigenvector centralities was applied to identify systemic multimorbidity clusters and single-disease influence in the overall population and when stratified by CAL quartile. Individual factors that could affect the systemic multimorbidity clusters were also explored by CAL quartile. In the study population, the top 3 prevalent diseases were hypertension (63.9%), arthritis (47.6%), and obesity (45.9%). A total of 106 unique systemic multimorbidity clusters were identified across the study population. Hypertension was the most centralized disease in the overall population (centrality [C]: 0.50), followed closely by arthritis (C: 0.45) and obesity (C: 0.42). Diabetes had higher centrality in the highest CAL quartile (C: 0.31) than the lowest (C: 0.26). \"Hypertension, obesity\" was the largest weighted multimorbidity cluster across CAL quartiles. This study has revealed a range of common systemic multimorbidity clusters in people with periodontitis. People with periodontitis are more likely to present with hypertension and obesity together, and diabetes is more influential to multimorbidity clusters in people with severe periodontitis. Factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, and smoking status may also influence the pattern of multimorbidity clusters."

            "abstract": "Digital therapeutics, treatments delivered remotely and enabled by modern technology, facilitate the provision of personalized, evidence-based, interdisciplinary interventions to manage the complexities associated with Parkinson's disease. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for digital therapeutics has arguably never been greater. However, despite new advances in technology and a heightened interest due to the pandemic, digital therapeutics remain underdeveloped and underutilized. In this paper, we briefly review practical applications and emerging advances in digital therapeutic platforms that target motor and non-motor signs and healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthful diet and optimal sleep hygiene habits. Future applications which could transform personalized self-management and patient care are presented. Opportunities, drawbacks and barriers to access are discussed."

            "abstract": "Apple (Malus×domestica Borkh) is among the main sources of phenolic compounds in the human diet. The genetic basis of the quantitative variations of these potentially beneficial phenolic compounds was investigated. A segregating F₁ population was used to map metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). Untargeted metabolic profiling of peel and flesh tissues of ripe fruits was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), resulting in the detection of 418 metabolites in peel and 254 in flesh. In mQTL mapping using MetaNetwork, 669 significant mQTLs were detected: 488 in the peel and 181 in the flesh. Four linkage groups (LGs), LG1, LG8, LG13, and LG16, were found to contain mQTL hotspots, mainly regulating metabolites that belong to the phenylpropanoid pathway. The genetics of annotated metabolites was studied in more detail using MapQTL®. A number of quercetin conjugates had mQTLs on LG1 or LG13. The most important mQTL hotspot with the largest number of metabolites was detected on LG16: mQTLs for 33 peel-related and 17 flesh-related phenolic compounds. Structural genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway were located, using the apple genome sequence. The structural gene leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR1) was in the mQTL hotspot on LG16, as were seven transcription factor genes. The authors believe that this is the first time that a QTL analysis was performed on such a high number of metabolites in an outbreeding plant species."

            "abstract": "The evolution of male-sterile individuals in hermaphroditic species represents the first step in the evolution of sex specialization. For male-sterile individuals to persist they must have some fitness advantage that compensates for their loss of the male function. Female fecundity also depends on environmental factors as those determining the likelihood of pollination and fertilization. Here we assessed the effects of both male sterility and reproductive synchrony (an environmentally affected trait) on the magnitude of female compensation of Erythroxylum havanense, a distylous shrub with morph-biased male sterility. In vitro measurements of pollen germination showed that thrums were more male sterile than pins. The compensatory advantage of thrums changed by a factor of five depending on flowering synchrony. Flowering in synchrony with the population increased fruit production in both morphs. However, because pins that flowered out of synchrony produced almost no fruits, the reproductive compensation of thrums was higher in these circumstances. Because the magnitude of compensation is frequently considered as a key factor in the evolution of sex specialization, the environmentally induced variation in the magnitude of the reproductive compensation of thrum plants may have profound effects on the evolutionary dynamics of the reproductive system of E. havanense."

            "abstract": "One of the main characteristics of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening is a massive accumulation of carotenoids (mainly lycopene), which may contribute to the nutrient quality of tomato fruit and its role in chemoprevention. Previous studies have shown that ethylene (ET) plays a central role in promoting fruit ripening. In this study, the role of jasmonic acid (JA) in controlling lycopene accumulation in tomato fruits was analysed by measuring fruit lycopene content and the expression levels of lycopene biosynthetic genes in JA-deficient mutants (spr2 and def1) and a 35S::prosystemin transgenic line (35S::prosys) with increased JA levels and constitutive JA signalling. The lycopene content was significantly decreased in the fruits of spr2 and def1, but was enhanced in 35S::prosys fruits. Simultaneously, the expression of lycopene biosynthetic genes followed a similar trend. Lycopene synthesis in methyl jasmonate (MeJA) vapour-treated fruits showed an inverted U-shaped dose response, which significantly enhanced the fruit lycopene content and restored lycopene accumulation in spr2 and def1 at a concentration of 0.5 µM. The results indicated that JA plays a positive role in lycopene biosynthesis. In addition, the role of ET in JA-induced lycopene accumulation was also examined. Ethylene production in tomato fruits was depressed in spr2 and def1 while it increased in 35S::prosys. However, the exogenous application of MeJA to Never ripe (Nr), the ET-insensitive mutant, significantly promoted lycopene accumulation, as well as the expression of lycopene biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, it is proposed that JA might function independently of ethylene to promote lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits."

Decreasing patients' exposure can reduce the radiation dose and hence the related risks, but it would inevitably induce higher quantum noise. Supervised deep learning techniques have been used to train deep neural networks for denoising low-dose CT (LDCT) images, but the success of such strategies requires massive sets of pixel-level paired LDCT and normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which are rarely available in real clinical practice. Our purpose is to mitigate the data scarcity problem for deep learning-based LDCT denoising.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To solve this problem, we devised a shift-invariant property-based neural network that uses only the LDCT images to characterize both the inherent pixel correlations and the noise distribution, shaping into our probabilistic self-learning (PSL) framework. The AAPM Low-dose CT Challenge dataset was used to train the network. Both simulated datasets and real dataset were employed to test the denoising performance as well as the model generalizability. The performance was compared to a conventional method (total variation (TV)-based), a popular self-learning method (noise2void (N2V)), and a well-known unsupervised learning method (CycleGAN) by using both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative metrics including peak signal-noise-ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR). The standard deviations (STD) of selected flat regions were also calculated for comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The PSL method can improve the averaged PSNR/SSIM values from 27.61/0.5939 (LDCT) to 30.50/0.6797. By contrast, the averaged PSNR/SSIM values were 31.49/0.7284 (TV), 29.43/0.6699 (N2V), and 29.79/0.6992 (CycleGAN). The averaged STDs of selected flat regions were calculated to be 132.3 HU (LDCT), 25.77 HU (TV), 19.95 HU (N2V), 75.06 HU (CycleGAN), 60.62 HU (PSL) and 57.28 HU (NDCT). As for the low-contrast lesion detectability quantification, the CNR were calculated to be 0.202 (LDCT), 0.356 (TV), 0.372 (N2V), 0.383 (CycleGAN), 0.399 (PSL), and 0.359 (NDCT). By visual inspection, we observed that the proposed PSL method can deliver a noise-suppressed and detail-preserved image, while the TV-based method would lead to the blocky artifact, the N2V method would produce over-smoothed structures and CT value biased effect, and the CycleGAN method would generate slightly noisy results with inaccurate CT values. We also verified the generalizability of the PSL method, which exhibited superior denoising performance among various testing datasets with different data distribution shifts.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A deep learning-based convolutional neural network can be trained without paired datasets.

Seed and fruit lipid contents were not correlated. Fatty acid composition of mesocarp oil was highly variable within tribes. By contrast, within-tribe diversity for seed lipid traits was low, whereas between-tribe variability was high. Consequently, multivariate analyses of seed lipid traits produced groupings of species belonging to the same tribe. Medium-chain fatty acids predominated in seeds of most palm species, but they were also accumulated in the mesocarp in some cases. Seed unsaturated fatty acid content correlated with temperature at the coldest latitude of natural occurrence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Several previously uncharacterized palms were identified as potential new sources of vegetable oils for comestible or non-food use. Seed lipid traits reflect genetic drift that occurred during the radiation of the family and therefore are highly relevant to palm chemotaxonomy. Our data also suggest that seed unsaturated fatty acids may provide an adaptive advantage in the coldest environments colonized by palms by maintaining storage lipids in liquid form for efficient mobilization during germination."

Models utilizing contemporary digital technologies could significantly improve reach and fidelity as complementary alternatives to traditional center-based programs.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study is to compare the effects and costs of the innovative Smartphone Cardiac Rehabilitation, Assisted self-Management (SCRAM) intervention with usual care CR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this investigator-, assessor-, and statistician-blinded parallel 2-arm randomized controlled trial, 220 adults (18+ years) with coronary heart disease are being recruited from 3 hospitals in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia. Participants are randomized (1:1) to receive advice to engage with usual care CR or the SCRAM intervention. SCRAM is a 24-week dual-phase intervention that includes 12 weeks of real-time remote exercise supervision and coaching from exercise physiologists, which is followed by 12 weeks of data-driven nonreal-time remote coaching via telephone. Both intervention phases include evidence- and theory-based multifactorial behavior change support delivered via smartphone push notifications. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks include maximal aerobic exercise capacity (primary outcome at 24 weeks), modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, secondary prevention self-management behaviors, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Economic and process evaluations will determine cost-effectiveness and participant perceptions of the treatment arms, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The trial was funded in November 2017 and received ethical approval in June 2018.

Our trial will provide unique and valuable information about effects of SCRAM on outcomes associated with cardiac and all-cause mortality, as well as acceptability and cost-effectiveness. These findings will be important to inform health care providers about the potential for innovative program delivery models, such as SCRAM, to be implemented at scale, as a complement to existing CR programs.

            "abstract": "Motorized functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling has been demonstrated to have numerous health benefits for individuals suffering from neurological disorders. FES-cycling is usually designed to track the desired trajectories in real time. However, there are input delays between the exertion of the stimulation and the corresponding muscle contraction that potentially destabilize the system and undermine training efforts. Meanwhile, muscle fatigue gives rise to a time-varying input delay and decreased force. Moreover, switching between FES and motor control can be chattering and destabilizing owing to the high frequency. This article constructs Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals to analyze the stability and robustness of the nonlinear cycling system with time-varying input delay. A new average dwell time condition is then provided to ensure the input-to-state stability of the considered systems. Finally, numerical simulations are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the developed controller."

The overriding purpose of this paper is to propose two algorithms (probabilistic and non-probabilistic) that iteratively track stress states to compute a wellness index in terms of the stress levels. This paper adopts the physiological view-point that high stress is accompanied with large deviations in biometrics such as body temperature, heart rate, etc., and the proposed algorithms iteratively track these fluctuations to compute a personalized wellness index that is correlated to the engagement levels of the tasks performed by the user. In essence, this paper presents a quantitative relationship between temperature, occupational stress, and wellness during different tasks. The simplicity of the statistical inference algorithms make them favorable candidates for implementation on mobile platforms such as smart phones in the future, thereby providing users an inexpensive application for self-wellness monitoring for a healthier lifestyle."

This study investigated the potential of a semi-automated surveillance system to reduce CCTV operator workload in both detection and tracking activities. A further focus of interest was the degree of user reliance on the automated system. A simulated prototype was developed which mimicked an automated system that provided different levels of system confidence information. Dependent variable measures were taken for secondary task performance, reliance and subjective workload. When the automatic component of a semi-automatic CCTV surveillance system provided reliable system confidence information to operators, workload significantly decreased and spare mental capacity significantly increased. Providing feedback about system confidence and accuracy appears to be one important way of making the status of the automated component of the surveillance system more 'visible' to users and hence more effective to use."

All aspects of pollen performance significantly increased with the number of pollen grains on a stigma or pollen tubes in a style, but was not influenced by the diversity of pollen donors. Plants tended to mature single-ovulate fruits that came from flowers where pollen load size and diversity were greatest and aborted those where these were lowest. No plants from seeds resulting from pollinations with a single pollen grain survived, but other fitness measures were mostly determined by maternal plant.

            "abstract": "The recent advancement of motion recognition using Microsoft Kinect stimulates many new ideas in motion capture and virtual reality applications. Utilizing a pattern recognition algorithm, Kinect can determine the positions of different body parts from the user. However, due to the use of a single-depth camera, recognition accuracy drops significantly when the parts are occluded. This hugely limits the usability of applications that involve interaction with external objects, such as sport training or exercising systems. The problem becomes more critical when Kinect incorrectly perceives body parts. This is because applications have limited information about the recognition correctness, and using those parts to synthesize body postures would result in serious visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct valid movement from incomplete and noisy postures captured by Kinect. We first design a set of measurements that objectively evaluates the degree of reliability on each tracked body part. By incorporating the reliability estimation into a motion database query during run time, we obtain a set of similar postures that are kinematically valid. These postures are used to construct a latent space, which is known as the natural posture space in our system, with local principle component analysis. We finally apply frame-based optimization in the space to synthesize a new posture that closely resembles the true user posture while satisfying kinematic constraints. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the quality of the recognized posture under severely occluded environments, such as a person exercising with a basketball or moving in a small room."

            "abstract": "Background: In the UK, 4.7 million people are currently living with diabetes. This is projected to increase to 5 million by 2025. The direct and indirect costs of T1DM and T2DM are rising, and direct costs already account for approximately 10% of the National Health Service (NHS) budget. Objective: The aim of this review is to assess the economic models used in the context of NICE's Technology Appraisals (TA) Programme of T1DM and T2DM treatments, as well as to examine their compliance with the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) guidelines on computer modelling. Methods: A review of the economic models used in NICE's TA programme of T1DM and T2DM treatments was undertaken. Relevant TAs were identified through searching the NICE website for published appraisals completed up to April 2021. The review also examined the associated Evidence Review Group (ERG) reports and Final Appraisal Documents (FAD), which are publicly accessible. ERG reports were scrutinised to identify major issues pertaining to the economic modelling. The FAD documents were then examined to assess how these issues reflected on NICE recommendations. Results: Overall, 10 TAs pertaining to treatments of T1DM and T2DM were identified. Two TAs were excluded as they did not use economic models. Seven of the 8 included TAs related to a novel class of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), gliflozins, and one to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices. There is a lack of recent, robust data informing risk equations to enable the derivation of transition probabilities. Despite uncertainty surrounding its clinical relevance, bodyweight/BMI is a key driver in many T2DM-models. HbA1c's reliability as a predictor of hard outcomes is uncertain, chiefly for macrovascular complications. The external validity of T1DM is even less clear. There is an inevitable trade-off between the sophistication of models' design, their transparency and practicality. Conclusion: Economic models are essential tools to support decision-making in relation to market access and ascertain diabetes technologies' cost effectiveness. However, key structural and methodological issues exist. Models' shortcomings should be acknowledged and contextualised within the framework of technology appraisals. Diabetes medications and other technologies should also be subject to regular and consistent re-appraisal to inform disinvestment decisions. Artificial intelligence could potentially enhance models' transparency and practicality."

Almost all healthcare providers suggested that the responsibility for providing preconception care consultations lies within primary care (general practitioners (n = 239; 95.6%) and midwives (n = 236; 94.4%)). Professionals other than midwives found it significantly more difficult to start a conversation about a wish to conceive compared to midwives (26.8% versus 20.2%, p-value = 0.006) and felt less competent to provide preconceptional information (32.3% versus 15.1%, p-value = <0.001). Innovative facilitators were mentioned to improve reaching the target population with preconceptional information, i.e. the use of social media and local ambassadors.\n    \n\n\n          Key conclusion:\n        \n      \n      While the responsibility for providing preconception care consultations is best suited with primary care, many other healthcare providers involved may act as referrers towards preconception care. Still, approximately 1 in 7 midwives (strongly) disagree with the statement that it is part of their job to provide preconceptional information to couples with a wish to conceive.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      There is a need for integrating preconception care in many curricula and postgraduate courses, especially for non-midwives, to improve the delivery of preconception care. Insights in the suggested barriers and facilitators can improve the implementation of (local) preconception care programs."

            "abstract": "Medical diagnosis is often hampered by the quality of the images. This happens in a wide range of image modalities. Image noise reduction is a crucial step, however difficult to be accomplished. Bayesian algorithms have been commonly used with success, namely with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model. In fact, the noise corrupting some of the most used medical imaging modalities is not additive neither Gaussian but multiplicative described by Poisson or Rayleigh distributions. This paper proposes a unified framework with automatic hyper parameters estimation. The proposed framework deals with AWGN but also with both Poisson and Rayleigh distributions. The algorithm proposed herein, is based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion with the edge preserving prior based on the total variation (TV), which avoids the distortion of relevant anatomical details. The denoising technique is performed via single parametric iterative scheme parameterized for each noise model considered. Tests with real data from several medical imaging modalities testify the performance of the algorithm."

            "abstract": "Personalized Medicine (PM) has shifted the traditional top-down approach to medicine based on the identification of single etiological factors to explain diseases, which was not suitable for explaining complex conditions. The concept of PM assumes several interpretations in the literature, with particular regards to Genetic and Genomic Medicine. Despite the fact that some disease-modifying genes affect disease expression and progression, many complex conditions cannot be understood through only this lens, especially when other lifestyle factors can play a crucial role (such as the environment, emotions, nutrition, etc.). Personalizing clinical phenotyping becomes a challenge when different pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the same manifestation. Brain disorders, cardiovascular and gastroenterological diseases can be paradigmatic examples. Experiences on the field of Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli in Rome (a research hospital recognized by the Italian Ministry of Health as national leader in \"Personalized Medicine\" and \"Innovative Biomedical Technologies\") could help understanding which techniques and tools are the most performing to develop potential clinical phenotypes personalization. The connection between practical experiences and scientific literature highlights how this potential can be reached towards Systems Medicine using Artificial Intelligence tools."

            "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that dandelion clones (Taraxacum officinale Weber, sensu lato; Asteraceae) differ in their floral stage timing characteristics under a constant set of environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, plants representing nine different dandelion clones (identified by DNA fingerprinting) were grown in groups of five (N = 45) in a growth chamber for a period of 8 mo, with chamber settings similar to environmental conditions at peak dandelion flowering time for their population sites. Five flowering phenology parameters were monitored daily for a total of 301 buds developing during this time: (1) time to bud; (2) time to full opening and inflorescence maturation (i.e., first anthesis); (3) time to re-closure of an inflorescence; (4) time to fruit (full re-opening of the inflorescence); and (5) total flowering time. Scape length at the appearance of a fully expanded infructescence was also measured for each individual. Significant differences in mean time to inflorescence, mean time to re-closure, mean time to fruit, and mean total flowering time were revealed among some dandelion clones (Kruskal-Wallis, P ≤ 0.0005). No differences in mean number of inflorescence buds per plant (P = 0.2217), mean time to bud (P = 0.2396), or mean scape length (P = 0.3688) were detected among the nine clones. These results suggest that differences in floral stage timing may in part involve varying genotypic environmental response characteristics and that these differences may have potential fitness effects. Further research is needed to determine if such clonal differences are observed under a broader range of uniform environmental conditions."

This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading.

            "abstract": "U.S. veterans are at risk for insomnia, which often co-occurs with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use. Much of the research on veterans and these three constructs is cross-sectional and focused on unidirectional pathways. Recent theoretical and empirical evidence suggests a dynamic interplay between insomnia, PTSD, and alcohol use, yet few longitudinal studies exist. A clearer understanding of these pathways is needed to help inform integrated treatments. Using a sample of 1,230 post-9/11 veterans assessed over four time points across 12 months, we used a latent difference score modeling approach to examine proportional and dynamic change between insomnia, PTSD, and alcohol. Results revealed a complex interplay between all three constructs. Higher prior levels of both PTSD and alcohol use were associated with greater subsequent changes in insomnia symptoms (i.e., worse sleep). Moreover, although veterans drank less frequently as their insomnia symptoms worsened over time, greater changes in insomnia symptoms (i.e., worse symptoms) was a mechanism linking PTSD and more frequent drinking. As the research on interventions addressing insomnia, PTSD, and alcohol is limited, there are opportunities for researchers and clinicians to develop programs that effectively target all three in integrated treatments."

Chatbots equipped with natural language processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors and smartphones. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical activity.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to investigate the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of a machine learning-based physical activity chatbot.\n## METHODS\nA quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring, sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement, and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants, the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, sent general motivational messages, and checked participants' activity history (ie, the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical activity.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 116 participants, 95 (81.9%) were female, 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship, 101 (87.1%) were White, and 82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113, 82.3%). Most of the participants scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113, 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113, 87.6%) as at least \"OK.\" About one-third (40/113, 35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future, and 53.1% (60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. On average, 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. At follow-up, participants recorded more steps (increase of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase of 154.2 min/week; 3.58 times higher at follow-up; 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe machine learning-based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants' physical activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However, the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of intervention.\n"

            "abstract": "Recently, there has been considerable growth in the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare applications; however, they suffer from a lack of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Leveraging recent technologies, such as machine learning (ML), edge computing, and blockchain, can provide suitable and strong security solutions for preserving the privacy of medical data. In this paper, FIDChain IDS is proposed using lightweight artificial neural networks (ANN) in a federated learning (FL) way to ensure healthcare data privacy preservation with the advances of blockchain technology that provides a distributed ledger for aggregating the local weights and then broadcasting the updated global weights after averaging, which prevents poisoning attacks and provides full transparency and immutability over the distributed system with negligible overhead. Applying the detection model at the edge protects the cloud if an attack happens, as it blocks the data from its gateway with smaller detection time and lesser computing and processing capacity as FL deals with smaller sets of data. The ANN and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were evaluated using the BoT-IoT dataset. The results show that ANN models have higher accuracy and better performance with the heterogeneity of data in IoT devices, such as intensive care unit (ICU) in healthcare systems. Testing the FIDChain with different datasets (CSE-CIC-IDS2018, Bot Net IoT, and KDD Cup 99) reveals that the BoT-IoT dataset has the most stable and accurate results for testing IoT applications, such as those used in healthcare systems."

            "abstract": "Flavonoid compounds play important roles in the modern diet, and pear fruits are an excellent dietary source of these metabolites. However, information on the regulatory network of flavonoid biosynthesis in pear fruits is rare. In this work, 18 putative flavonoid-related MYB transcription factors (TFs) were screened by phylogenetic analysis and four of them were correlated with flavonoid biosynthesis patterns in pear fruits. Among these MYB-like genes, the specific functions of two novel MYB TFs, designated as PbMYB10b and PbMYB9, were further verified by both overexpression and RNAi transient assays. PbMYB10b, a PAP-type MYB TF with atypical motifs in its conserved region, regulated the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pathways by inducing the expression of PbDFR, but its function could be complemented by other MYB TFs. PbMYB9, a TT2-type MYB, not only acted as the specific activator of the proanthocyanidin pathway by activating the PbANR promoter, but also induced the synthesis of anthocyanins and flavonols by binding the PbUFGT1 promoter in pear fruits. The MYBCORE-like element has been identified in both the PbUFGT1 promoter and ANR promoters in most species, but it was not found in UFGT promoters isolated from other species. This finding was also supported by a yeast one-hybrid assay and thus enhanced the likelihood of the interaction between PbMYB9 and the PbUFGT1 promoter."

            "abstract": "(1) Background: Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide and cognitive behavioral therapy is the front-line treatment. Digital health technologies have a role to play in screening and delivering interventions remotely and without the need for human intervention. The KANOPEE app, which provides a screening and behavioral intervention for insomnia symptoms through an interaction with a virtual agent, showed encouraging results in previous studies during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, but has not yet been evaluated in a controlled study. This study aims at comparing the benefits of KANOPEE, a smartphone application dealing with insomnia complaints, with another application proposing an electronic sleep diary named “My Sleep Diary”. The acceptance and potential benefits of these digital solutions are tested in real-life settings (i.e., without soliciting human medical resources) and in the general population. (2) Methods: Subjects were included if they downloaded one of the apps between December 2020 and October 2021, and were of legal age. Both apps were available on downloading platforms in France. Primary outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and secondary outcomes were total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and wake time after sleep onset (WASO). (3) Results: A total of 535 users completed the intervention with KANOPEE and 489 users completed My Sleep Diary, both for 17 days. KANOPEE users improved their ISI score significantly more than sleep diary users (interaction Time*Group: F(2,2002) = 17.3, p < 0.001). Similar results were found for nocturnal sleep parameters (TST) (KANOPEE users gained 48 min of sleep after intervention, while My Sleep Diary users gained only 16 min of sleep), and particularly in the population with moderate to severe initial sleep complaints (F(4,1980) = 8.9, p < 0.001). Other sleep markers (SE and WASO) were significantly improved in the KANOPEE users compared to the sleep diary ones (p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: KANOPEE provides significantly greater benefits than an electronic sleep diary regarding reduction of insomnia complaints and estimated nocturnal sleep characteristics in a self-selected sample of the general population. Population with the most severe initial ISI score (≥15) benefited the most from the KANOPEE App compared to filling up a simple sleep diary."

A review of bat/plant dispersal interactions revealed that 15 species of Cecropia are consumed by 32 species of bats. In French Guiana, bats were captured in primary and secondary forests, yielding 936 fecal samples with diaspores, among which 162 contained fruits of C. obtusa, C. palmata, and C. sciadophylla. A comparative morphological and anatomical study of fruits and seeds taken directly from herbarium specimens, bat feces, and an experimental soil seed bank was made. Contrary to previous reports, the dispersal unit of Cecropia is the fruit not the seed. Bats consume the infructescence, digest pulp derived from the enlarged, fleshy perianth, and defecate the fruits. The mucilaginous pericarp of Cecropia is described. The external mucilage production of Cecropia may facilitate endozoochory. The exocarp and part of the mesocarp may be lost after passage through the digestive tract of bats, but fruits buried for a year in the soil seed bank remain structurally unchanged. Fruit characters were found to be useful for identifying species of bat-dispersed Cecropia. Bat dispersal is not necessary for seed germination but it increases seed survival and subsequent germination. Fruit structure plays a significant role in seed longevity."

            "abstract": "Neuroimage phenotyping for psychiatric and neurological disorders is performed using voxelwise analyses also known as voxel based analyses or morphometry (VBM). A typical voxelwise analysis treats measurements at each voxel (e.g., fractional anisotropy, gray matter probability) as outcome measures to study the effects of possible explanatory variables (e.g., age, group) in a linear regression setting. Furthermore, each voxel is treated independently until the stage of correction for multiple comparisons. Recently, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA), such as classification, have arisen as an alternative to VBM. The main advantage of MVPA over VBM is that the former employ multivariate methods which can account for interactions among voxels in identifying significant patterns. They also provide ways for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis at individual subject level. However, compared to VBM, the results of MVPA are often more difficult to interpret and prone to arbitrary conclusions. In this paper, first we use penalized likelihood modeling to provide a unified framework for understanding both VBM and MVPA. We then utilize statistical learning theory to provide practical methods for interpreting the results of MVPA beyond commonly used performance metrics, such as leave-one-out-cross validation accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, we demonstrate that there are challenges in MVPA when trying to obtain image phenotyping information in the form of statistical parametric maps (SPMs), which are commonly obtained from VBM, and provide a bootstrap strategy as a potential solution for generating SPMs using MVPA. This technique also allows us to maximize the use of available training data. We illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed framework using two different neuroimaging studies that pose different levels of challenge for classification using MVPA."

However, little is known about how weight is discussed in non-weight-specific settings where the primary purpose of the interaction concerns clinical matters apparently unrelated to weight. This study explores how mental health clinicians initiate discussions about a patient's possible weight problem in the non-weight-specific setting of a UK NHS Gender Identity Clinic (GIC), where weight is topicalized during discussions about the risks of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A conversation analytic study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 194 recordings of routine clinician-patient consultations were collected from the GIC. Weight talk was initiated by four clinicians in 43 consultations. Twenty-one instances contained reference to a possible weight problem. Transcripts were analysed using conversation analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians used three communication practices to initiate discussion of a possible weight problem with patients: (1) announcing that patients are overweight; (2) asking patients whether they are overweight; and (3) deducing that patients are overweight or obese via a body mass index (BMI) calculation. Announcing that patients are overweight is the least aligning practice that denies patient's agency and grammatically constrains them to agree with a negative label. Asking patients whether they are overweight treats them as having limited agency and generates comparatively aligning, but occasionally resistant, responses. Jointly deducing that patients are overweight or obese via a BMI calculation is the most aligning practice, which deflects responsibility for labelling the patient onto an objective instrument.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Small differences in the wording of turns that initiate discussions about a possible weight problem can have significant consequences for interactional alignment. Clinicians from different specialities may benefit from considering the interactional consequences of different practices for initiating discussions about weight during the kinds of real-life discussions considered here. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? There is a correlation between clinical communication about weight and patient weight loss. Clinicians from all specialties are encouraged to discuss diet and exercise with patients, but communication about weight remains problematic. Health psychologists have identified an urgent need for communication training to raise sensitive topics like weight without damaging the doctor-patient relationship. What does this study add? Clinicians in a non-weight-specific setting use three communication practices to introduce the possibility that a patient's weight may be a problem. These practices have varying consequences for the interaction and doctor-patient relationship. Conversation analytic findings may be useful in training clinicians how to initiate discussions about weight with patients."

            "abstract": "After psychological trauma, why do some only some parts of the traumatic event return as intrusive memories while others do not? Intrusive memories are key to cognitive behavioural treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, and an aetiological understanding is warranted. We present here analyses using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and a machine learning classifier to investigate whether peri-traumatic brain activation was able to predict later intrusive memories (i.e. before they had happened). To provide a methodological basis for understanding the context of the current results, we first show how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an experimental analogue of trauma (a trauma film) via a prospective event-related design was able to capture an individual's later intrusive memories. Results showed widespread increases in brain activation at encoding when viewing a scene in the scanner that would later return as an intrusive memory in the real world. These fMRI results were replicated in a second study. While traditional mass univariate regression analysis highlighted an association between brain processing and symptomatology, this is not the same as prediction. Using MVPA and a machine learning classifier, it was possible to predict later intrusive memories across participants with 68% accuracy, and within a participant with 97% accuracy; i.e. the classifier could identify out of multiple scenes those that would later return as an intrusive memory. We also report here brain networks key in intrusive memory prediction. MVPA opens the possibility of decoding brain activity to reconstruct idiosyncratic cognitive events with relevance to understanding and predicting mental health symptoms."

            "abstract": "Covid-19, what a strange, unpredictable mutated virus. It has baffled many scientists, as no firm rule has yet been reached to predict the effect that the virus can inflict on people if they are infected with it. Recently, many researches have been introduced for diagnosing Covid-19; however, none of them pay attention to predict the effect of the virus on the person's body if the infection occurs but before the infection really takes place. Predicting the extent to which people will be affected if they are infected with the virus allows for some drastic precautions to be taken for those who will suffer from serious complications, while allowing some freedom for those who expect not to be affected badly. This paper introduces Covid-19 Prudential Expectation Strategy (CPES) as a new strategy for predicting the behavior of the person's body if he has been infected with Covid-19. The CPES composes of three phases called Outlier Rejection Phase (ORP), Feature Selection Phase (FSP), and Classification Phase (CP). For enhancing the classification accuracy in CP, CPES employs two proposed techniques for outlier rejection in ORP and feature selection in FSP, which are called Hybrid Outlier Rejection (HOR) method and Improved Binary Genetic Algorithm (IBGA) method respectively. In ORP, HOR rejects outliers in the training data using a hybrid method that combines standard division and Binary Gray Wolf Optimization (BGWO) method. On the other hand, in FSP, IBGA as a hybrid method selects the most useful features for the prediction process. IBGA includes Fisher Score (FScore) as a filter method to quickly select the features and BGA as a wrapper method to accurately select the features based on the average accuracy value from several classification models as a fitness function to guarantee the efficiency of the selected subset of features with any classifier. In CP, CPES has the ability to classify people based on their bodies' reaction to Covid-19 infection, which is built upon a proposed Statistical Naïve Bayes (SNB) classifier after performing the previous two phases. CPES has been compared against recent related strategies in terms of accuracy, error, recall, precision, and run-time using Covid-19 dataset [1]. This dataset contains routine blood tests collected from people before and after their infection with covid-19 through a Web-based form created by us. CPES outperforms the competing methods in experimental results because it provides the best results with values of 0.87, 0.13, 0.84, and 0.79 for accuracy, error, precision, and recall."

            "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in plant development through regulation of gene expression by mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Despite the fact that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the model system for studying fleshy fruit development and ripening, only a few experimentally proven miRNA targets are known, and the role of miRNA action in these processes remains largely unknown. Here, by using parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) for global identification of miRNA targets and comparing four different stages of tomato fruit development, a total of 119 target genes of miRNAs were identified. Of these, 106 appeared to be new targets. A large part of the identified targets (56) coded for transcription factors. Auxin response factors, as well as two known ripening regulators, colorless non-ripening (CNR) and APETALA2a (SlAP2a), with developmentally regulated degradation patterns were identified. The levels of the intact messenger of both CNR and AP2a are actively modulated during ripening, by miR156/157 and miR172, respectively. Additionally, two TAS3-mRNA loci were identified as targets of miR390. Other targets such as Argonaute 1 (AGO1), shown to be involved in miRNA biogenesis in other plant species, were identified, which suggests a feedback loop regulation of this process. In this study, it is shown that miRNA-guided cleavage of mRNAs is likely to play an important role in tomato fruit development and ripening."

The development of true, mobile device-driven health applications has been hindered by the lack of tools available in the past and the sheer lack of mobile devices on the market. This has now changed, however, with the availability of pocket personal computer handsets.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      This article describes a solution in the form of an intelligent neural network running on mobile devices, allowing people with diabetes access to it regardless of their location. Utilizing an easy to learn and use multipanel user interface, people with diabetes can run the software in real time via an easy to use graphical user interface. The neural network consists of four neurons. The first is glucose. If the user's current glucose level is within the target range, the glucose weight is then multiplied by zero. If the glucose level is high, then there will be a positive value multiplied to the weight, resulting in a positive amount of insulin to be injected. If the user's glucose level is low, then the weights will be multiplied by a negative value, resulting in a decrease in the overall insulin dose.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A minifeasibility trial was carried out at a local hospital under a consultant endocrinologist in Belfast.

The workshop's plenary lectures were on: i) viral pandemics and epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean; ii) the impact of obesity on the outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents; and iii) COVID-19 and artificial intelligence. Despite the scarcity of evidence from fossils and remnants, viruses have been recognised as significant causes of several epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean. Paediatric obesity, a modifiable critical health risk factor, has been shown to impact on the development, progression and severity of viral infections. Thus, the prevention of paediatric obesity should be included in formulating public health policies and decision-making strategies against emerging global viral threats. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence has been used to facilitate the identification, monitoring and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it will play a fundamental role in the surveillance of epidemic-prone infectious diseases, in the repurposing of older therapies and in the design of novel therapeutic agents against viral infections. The collaboration between different medical specialties and other diverse scientific fields, including archaeology, history, epidemiology, nutritional technologies, mathematics, computer technology, engineering, medical law and ethics is essential for the successful management of paediatric viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic has underscored this need, which should be further encouraged in modern medical education."

The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and thishas been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective."

            "abstract": "Light signaling has long been reported to influence fruit biology, although the regulatory impact of fruit-localized photoreceptors on fruit development and metabolism remains unclear. Studies performed in phytochrome (PHY)-deficient tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutants suggest that SlPHYA, SlPHYB2, and to a lesser extent SlPHYB1 influence fruit development and ripening. By employing fruit-specific RNAi-mediated silencing of SlPHY genes, we demonstrated that fruit-localized SlPHYA and SlPHYB2 play contrasting roles in regulating plastid biogenesis and maturation in tomato. Our data revealed that fruit-localized SlPHYA, rather than SlPHYB1 or SlPHYB2, positively influences tomato plastid differentiation and division machinery via changes in both light and cytokinin signaling-related gene expression. Fruit-localized SlPHYA and SlPHYB2 were also shown to modulate sugar metabolism in early developing fruits via overlapping, yet distinct, mechanisms involving the co-ordinated transcriptional regulation of genes related to sink strength and starch biosynthesis. Fruit-specific SlPHY silencing also drastically altered the transcriptional profile of genes encoding light-repressor proteins and carotenoid-biosynthesis regulators, leading to reduced carotenoid biosynthesis during fruit ripening. Together, our data reveal the existence of an intricate PHY-hormonal interplay during fruit development and ripening, and provide conclusive evidence on the regulation of tomato quality by fruit-localized phytochromes."

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks."

Due to the cost and difficulty associated with flavor phenotyping, breeding programs have long been challenged in selecting for this complex trait. To address this issue, we leveraged targeted metabolomics of diverse tomato and blueberry accessions and their corresponding consumer panel ratings to create statistical and machine learning models that can predict sensory perceptions of fruit flavor. Using these models, a breeding program can assess flavor ratings for a large number of genotypes, previously limited by the low throughput of consumer sensory panels. The ability to predict consumer ratings of liking, sweet, sour, umami, and flavor intensity was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracies of 18 different models were assessed. The prediction accuracies were high for most attributes and ranged from 0.87 for sourness intensity in blueberry using XGBoost to 0.46 for overall liking in tomato using linear regression. Further, the best-performing models were used to infer the flavor compounds (sugars, acids, and volatiles) that contribute most to each flavor attribute. We found that the variance decomposition of overall liking score estimates that 42% and 56% of the variance was explained by volatile organic compounds in tomato and blueberry, respectively. We expect that these models will enable an earlier incorporation of flavor as breeding targets and encourage selection and release of more flavorful fruit varieties."

Currently, it is unclear whether the AI-assisted markerless method can be applied to individuals with lower limb dysfunction, such as those using an ankle foot orthosis or a crutch. However, as many patients with lower limb paralysis and foot orthosis users lose metatarsophalangeal (MP) joint flexion during the stance phase, it is necessary to estimate the accuracy of foot recognition under fixed MP joint motion. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles during treadmill walking were determined using OpenPose (a markerless method) and the conventional passive marker motion capture method; the results from both methods were compared. We also examined whether an ankle foot orthosis and a crutch could influence the recognition ability of OpenPose. The hip and knee joint data obtained by the passive marker method (MAC3D), OpenPose, and manual video analysis using Kinovea software showed significant correlation. Compared with the ankle joint data obtained by OpenPose and Kinovea, which were strongly correlated, those obtained by MAC3D presented a weaker correlation. OpenPose can be an adequate substitute for conventional passive marker motion capture for both normal gait and abnormal gait with an orthosis or a crutch. Furthermore, OpenPose is applicable to patients with impaired MP joint motion.

Difference in mean change in HbA1c, body mass index, total insulin doses, fasting blood glucose (FPG) and prandial blood glucose (PPG) were assessed after 3-6-months of follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcomes were assessed in 111 patients. Lixisenatide added to basal insulin, reduced HbA1c and body weight significantly in all three groups of patients (p < 0.001 for all), with the most prominent reduction in the basal bolus group of patients which had the highest baseline HbA1c compared to premix and BOT treatment groups. Regarding a difference in total insulin dose the reduction was statistically significant in the basal bolus (p = 0.006) and premix group (p < 0.001). FPG and PPG were also significantly reduced over time in all three groups (p < 0.001 for all). A composite outcome (reduction of HbA1c below 7% (53 mmol/mol) with any weight loss) was achieved in 27% of total patients included in the study, reduction of HbA1c below 7% was observed in 30% of patients, while 90% of patients experienced weight reduction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These results indicate that lixisenatide add on basal insulin treatment (BIT) can improve glycemic control in a population with long-standing type 2 diabetes and previously uncontrolled on other insulin therapy."

In that condition, species are expected to be reproductively isolated through a pre-mating mechanical barrier. Here, the relative contribution of pre- vs. post-mating barriers to gene flow among two Ophrys species that share a common pollinator and can occur in sympatry is studied.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A natural hybrid zone on Sardinia between O. iricolor and O. incubacea, sharing Andrena morio as pollinator, was investigated by analysing floral traits involved in pollinator attraction as odour extracts both for non-active and active compounds and for labellum morphology. The genetic architecture of the hybrid zone was also estimated with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, and pollination fitness and seed set of both parental species and their hybrids in the sympatric zone were estimated by controlled crosses.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Although hybrids were intermediate between parental species in labellum morphology and non-active odour compounds, both parental species and hybrids produced a similar odour bouquet for active compounds. However, hybrids produced significantly lower fruit and seed set than parental species, and the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone suggests that they were mostly first-generation hybrids.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The two parental species hybridize in sympatry as a consequence of pollinator overlap and weak mechanical isolation, but post-zygotic barriers reduce hybrid frequency and fitness, and prevent extensive introgression.

Artificial intelligence tools and integrative data analysis revealed superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, gap junction protein α, myosin heavy chains, and zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 are engaged in oxidative stress and in cardiomyopathy. Network analysis indicated that MAPK3 might be the highest distribution property and cut point in this network, which could be a potential candidate for preventing and treating oxidative stress in heart tissue. Among antioxidant agents, grape seed extract (GSE) is an effective substance that altered antioxidant status in heart tissue. Considering drug discovery methods, we illustrated that GSE might target the MAPK3 protein with sufficient binding affinity. Moreover, we found that low- and moderate-intensity training might prevent the depletion of antioxidants after MI. GSE consumption altered the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase after 14 weeks. Therefore, the interaction of low- and moderate-intensity training and GSE had a synergistic effect on the antioxidant status and relative expression of the Mapk3. Moreover, the interaction of high-intensity training and GSE had a compensatory mechanism that could scavenge reactive oxygen species and improve endogenous antioxidants and modulate the Mapk3 level in MI rats. Consequently, we displayed positive influence and synergic effects of simultaneous GSE prescription and regular physical activity for 14 weeks to prevent acute and chronic heart ischemia cardioprotective phenomenon. Furthermore, the capacitation oxidative stress and relative expression of the Mapk3 was significantly increased by GSE and regular exercise."

Despite methodological developments and novel application domains, there has been little effort to compile benchmark results that researchers can reference and compare against. This study takes a significant step in this direction. We employed three classes of state-of-the-art MVPA algorithms and common types of structural measurements from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to predict an array of clinically relevant variables (diagnosis of Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; age, cerebrospinal fluid derived amyloid-β levels and mini-mental state exam score). We analyzed data from over 2,800 subjects, compiled from six publicly available datasets. The employed data and computational tools are freely distributed ( https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/mripredict), making this the largest, most comprehensive, reproducible benchmark image-based prediction experiment to date in structural neuroimaging. Finally, we make several observations regarding the factors that influence prediction performance and point to future research directions. Unsurprisingly, our results suggest that the biological footprint (effect size) has a dramatic influence on prediction performance. Though the choice of image measurement and MVPA algorithm can impact the result, there was no universally optimal selection. Intriguingly, the choice of algorithm seemed to be less critical than the choice of measurement type. Finally, our results showed that cross-validation estimates of performance, while generally optimistic, correlate well with generalization accuracy on a new dataset."

Early detection is key to ensuring good outcomes but a lack of minimally invasive screening tools is a significant barrier. Most endometrial cancers are obesity-driven and develop in the context of severe metabolomic dysfunction. Blood-derived metabolites may therefore provide clinically relevant biomarkers for endometrial cancer detection. In this study, we analysed plasma samples of women with body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m2 and endometrioid endometrial cancer (cases, n = 67) or histologically normal endometrium (controls, n = 69), using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. Eighty percent of the samples were randomly selected to serve as a training set and the remaining 20% were used to qualify test performance. Robust predictive models (AUC > 0.9) for endometrial cancer detection based on artificial intelligence algorithms were developed and validated. Phospholipids were of significance as biomarkers of endometrial cancer, with sphingolipids (sphingomyelins) discriminatory in post-menopausal women. An algorithm combining the top ten performing metabolites showed 92.6% prediction accuracy (AUC of 0.95) for endometrial cancer detection. These results suggest that a simple blood test could enable the early detection of endometrial cancer and provide the basis for a minimally invasive screening tool for women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2."

The findings contribute to our general understanding of pollination ecology at high latitudes and provide important information for the commercialization of cloudberry. Female flowers were smaller than males but provided more nectar, although this resource was low in both sexes. Insects from 43 families visited cloudberry flowers, yet four families (Apidae, Halictidae, Muscidae, Syrphidae) represented ca. 87% of all visitors observed. Introduction experiments revealed that apids and muscids are significantly poorer pollinators (based on fruit production) than halictids and syrphids, but when fruit mass or seed set was considered, there were no significant differences between families. Pollinator importance, a product of flower visitation frequency and seed set effectiveness, revealed that the dipterans were of paramount importance to the pollination of cloudberry. Furthermore, they are limited to cloudberry because their lapping mouthparts exclude them from accessing the nutritional rewards of competing Ericaceae flowers. While the total number of pollinator families observed suggest a generalist pollination system, if one considers the dominant pollinators (flies) as a functional group, then this insect-flower relationship could be considered a specialized one."

In this paper, we propose a noble method of building continuous occupancy maps and reconstructing surfaces in a single framework for both navigation and visualization. Particularly, we apply a Bayesian nonparametric approach, Gaussian process classification, to occupancy mapping. However, it suffers from high-computational complexity of O(n(3))+O(n(2)m), where n and m are the numbers of training and test data, respectively, limiting its use for large-scale mapping with huge training data, which is common with high-resolution RGB-D sensors. Therefore, we partition both training and test data with a coarse-to-fine clustering method and apply Gaussian processes to each local clusters. In addition, we consider Gaussian processes as implicit functions, and thus extract iso-surfaces from the scalar fields, continuous occupancy maps, using marching cubes. By doing that, we are able to build two types of map representations within a single framework of Gaussian processes. Experimental results with 2-D simulated data show that the accuracy of our approximated method is comparable to previous work, while the computational time is dramatically reduced. We also demonstrate our method with 3-D real data to show its feasibility in large-scale environments."

Hence, we estimated the binding affinity of chemical and bioactive molecules on the cut point hub gene by pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking. Moreover, ST increased IL-6, Cat, Aif-1, and Caspase-9. 100 mg/kg TT has a more favorable effect than 50 mg/kg T. Also, RT with TT had interactive effects on reducing IL-6, Cat, Aif-1, and Caspase-9.

HealthMpowerment (HMP) is an online, mobile phone optimized intervention that aimed to reduce condomless anal intercourse and foster community among young Black GBMSM (age 18-30). Applying a resilience framework, we analyzed 322 conversations contributed by 48 HMP participants (22/48 living with HIV) on the intervention website. These conversations provided a unique opportunity to observe and analyze dynamic, interpersonal resilience processes shared in response to stigma, discrimination, and life challenges experienced by young Black GBMSM. We utilized an existing framework with four resilience processes and identified new subthemes that were displayed in these online interactions: (1) Exchanging social support occurred through sharing emotional and informational support. (2) Engaging in health-promoting cognitive processes appeared as reframing, self-acceptance, endorsing a positive outlook, and agency and taking responsibility for outcomes. (3) Enacting healthy behavioral practices clustered into modeling sex-positive norms, reducing the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, and living well with HIV.

Future online interventions could advance strengths-based approaches within HIV prevention and care by intentionally building on Black GBMSM's existing resilience processes.

The role played by a C-type MADS-box gene [SHATTERPROOF-like (FaSHP)] in the ripening of strawberries has been studied by transiently modifying gene expression through either over-expression or RNA-interference-mediated down-regulation. The altered expression of the FaSHP gene caused a change in the time taken by the over-expressing and the down- regulated fruits to attain the pink stage, which was slightly shorter and much longer, respectively, compared to controls. In parallel with the modified ripening times, the metabolome components and the expression of ripening-related genes also appeared different in the transiently modified fruits. Differences in the response time of the analysed genes suggest that FaSHP can control the expression of ripening genes either directly or indirectly through other transcription factor-encoding genes. Because fleshy strawberries are false fruits these results indicate that C-type MADS-box genes like SHATTERPROOF may act as modulators of ripening in fleshy fruit-like structures independently of their anatomical origin.

In the present study, the abundance of PEPCK was determined in the flesh of blueberries, raspberries, red currants, and strawberries at different stages of their development. In addition, changes in the amounts of citrate, malate, soluble sugars, isocitrate lyase, NADP-malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase in the flesh were determined. PEPCK was not detected in strawberry flesh, in which there was no dissimilation of malate or citrate. In the flesh of the other fruits, the abundance of PEPCK increased during ripening to an amount that was similar to that in grapes and tomatoes. In the flesh of blueberries and red currants, PEPCK was most abundant when there was dissimilation of malate. In the flesh of raspberries, PEPCK was most abundant when there was dissimilation of malate and citrate. These results are consistent with PEPCK playing a role in the dissimilation of citrate and/or malate in the flesh of these fruits during ripening. However, PEPCK was also present in the flesh of blueberries, raspberries, and red currants when there was no dissimilation of malate or citrate, and this raises the possibility that PEPCK might have additional functions.

Leaf area expansion rate, gas exchange (A(max), g(s), c(i)), and biomass at final harvest were measured for each species and hybrid class in all three environmental treatments. Fitness (based on total biomass) of the four genotypic classes differed significantly with environment. All genotypic classes performed most poorly in the dry treatment. The fitness ranking of genotypic class also changed across environments (significant genotypic class by treatment interaction) with hybrid genotype fitness shifting relative to parental genotypes. Integrating over all treatments, backcrosses to I. fulva showed the lowest fitness, whereas backcrosses to I. brevicaulis outperformed I. fulva. The differences in fitness were apparently achieved by a combination of differences in photosynthesis and allocation. In this system, hybrids are not necessarily less fit than their parents, and the relationship between hybrid and parental fitness is influenced by environmental conditions, lending support to the Hybrid Novelty model of hybrid zone evolution."

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of human body orientation can significantly enhance the analysis of human behavior, which is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. However, existing orientation estimation methods cannot handle the various body poses and appearances. In this paper, we propose an innovative RGB-D-based orientation estimation method to address these challenges. By utilizing the RGB-D information, which can be real time acquired by RGB-D sensors, our method is robust to cluttered environment, illumination change and partial occlusions. Specifically, efficient static and motion cue extraction methods are proposed based on the RGB-D superpixels to reduce the noise of depth data. Since it is hard to discriminate all the 360 (°) orientation using static cues or motion cues independently, we propose to utilize a dynamic Bayesian network system (DBNS) to effectively employ the complementary nature of both static and motion cues. In order to verify our proposed method, we build a RGB-D-based human body orientation dataset that covers a wide diversity of poses and appearances. Our intensive experimental evaluations on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."

            "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a prominent application in mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT) that aims to detect human activities based on multimodal sensor signals generated as a result of diverse body movements. Human physical activities are typically composed of simple actions (such as \"arm up\", \"arm down\", \"arm curl\", etc.), referred to as semantic features. Such abstract semantic features, in contrast to high-level activities (\"walking\", \"sitting\", etc.) and low-level signals (raw sensor readings), can be developed manually to assist activity recognition. Although effective, this manual approach relies heavily on human domain expertise and is not scalable. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a machine learning method, SemNet, based on deep belief networks. SemNet automatically constructs semantic features representative of the axial bodily movements. Experimental results show that SemNet outperforms baseline approaches and is capable of learning features that highly correlate with manually defined semantic attributes. Furthermore, our experiments using a different model, namely deep convolutional LSTM, on household activities illustrate the broader applicability of semantic attribute interpretation to diverse deep neural network approaches. These empirical results not only demonstrate that such a deep learning technique is semantically meaningful and superior to its handcrafted counterpart, but also provides a better understanding of the deep learning methods that are used for Human Activity Recognition."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The rapid increase of the aging population is pushing many national governments to reshape retirement legislation in order to extend older adults' working life. Once retired, older adults can be invaluable resources for the community as family carers, as volunteers, or by returning to work. Healthy aging is one of the main conditions for being able to work longer and being active after retirement. The latter, indeed, represents a very sensitive life transition, which can entail psychological and social difficulties. Interventions for promoting older workers' health and well-being and supporting the transition to retirement are on the top of the policy agenda of most European countries. Recently, computer-based and digital health interventions have been seen as promising means to reach this purpose.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic literature review aimed to explore studies on digital health coaching programs for older workers that followed a user-centered design approach and evaluated their effectiveness in providing older adults with guidance for adopting a healthy lifestyle and being active in the community.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The search identified 1931 papers, and 2 relevant articles were selected by applying specific eligibility criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      To our knowledge, only few digital health coaching programs have targeted the population of older workers to date; there is an insufficient number of studies on the efficacy of such programs. The results show the difficulties of assessing the efficacy of digital coaching itself and with respect to older employees. The 2 studies suggest that digital health programs for workplaces can improve various aspects of older employees' well-being; however, they considered health mainly from a physical perspective and neglected contextual, social, psychological, and cultural factors that can influence older workers' health and general well-being. Future digital health coaching programs should adopt the healthy aging paradigm as a multidimensional lens for interpreting the impact of eHealth technology on aging and retirement. The literature around this issue remains at an embryonic state, and this gap needs to be filled by further investigations that apply a user-centered approach for designing the technology, test innovative research methodologies, and adopt new technical solutions for high-quality interaction design.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Further digital health coaching programs aimed at supporting healthy and active living for older workers and retirees are necessary. The user-centered design approach is recommended in order to fully address the users' health needs and the technological requirements throughout development. Moreover, the healthy aging perspective allows inclusion of physical, social, and psychological factors influencing the transition from work to retirement, as well as the experiences and interactions of individuals with the technology."

Given the high occurrence of the trait, that it may sometimes be maladaptive is an intriguing possibility and deserves exploration. This paper tests the hypothesis that the fitness value of corolla persistence after anthesis depends on ecological context, specifically the abundance of fruit predators and pollinators.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was conducted on Narcissus longispathus, a species in which corolla marcescence is apparently maladaptive because withered corollas provide a shelter for fruit-predatory lepidopteran larvae. By experimentally manipulating corolla persistence, presence of fruit predators, and pollination, I tested whether variation in ecological scenario led to concomitant variation in the sign and magnitude of the effects of corolla marcescence on fecundity.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Persistent corollas were detrimental to fecundity when plants were exposed to larvae, but not when larvae were excluded. Pollination and herbivory had nonadditive effects on the fecundity consequences of corolla marcescence, the strongest detrimental effects of corolla persistence occurring for the \"exposed to larvae + supplementary pollination\" treatment combination.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The hypothesis that ecological context is a major determinant of the fitness value of corolla marcescence was supported. In N. longispathus, corolla marcescence will be a maladaptive trait in situations in which pollinators and fruit predators are simultaneously abundant, but will be a neutral character in the absence of fruit predators, irrespective of pollinator service."

Yet because intra- and interspecific competition can be caused by different mechanisms, their effect on the ecology and evolution of plants may differ. To determine the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition for pollination, I manipulated the presence of heterospecifics and density of conspecifics using Ipomopsis aggregata as the focal species. All plots contained I. aggregata and Castilleja linariaefolia, but C. linariaefolia inflorescences were removed from half of the plots to create the heterospecifics-absent treatment. Within each plot, all I. aggregata inflorescences were removed from a 5-m radius around a focal plant to create a low conspecific density experimental unit, and a group of 12 I. aggregata plants/1 m(2) was designated as a high conspecific density unit. Conspecific pollen deposition was reduced when C. linariaefolia was present but was not influenced by I. aggregata density. Although seed set per fruit was reduced by 17% when C. linariaefolia was present, it was not significantly influenced by either treatment. Interspecific competition for pollination is stronger than intraspecific competition in the I. aggregata-C. linariaefolia system, but neither process appears to influence plant fitness."

We then tested this technique using an off-the-shelf RTS game, EA Games Generals. Norman defined mental models as, \"an internal representation of a target system that provides predictive and explanatory power to the operator.\" In the case of RTS games, the operator is the player and the target system is expressed by the relationships within the game. We studied five novice participants in laboratory-controlled conditions playing a RTS game. They played Command and Conquer Generals for 2 h per day over the course of 5 days. A mental model analysis was generated using player dissimilarity-ratings of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) agents analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) statistical methods. We hypothesized that novices would begin with an impoverished model based on the visible physical characteristics of the game system. As they gained experience and insight, their mental models would shift and accommodate the functional characteristics of the AI agents. We found that all five of the novice participants began with the predicted physical-based mental model. However, while their models did qualitatively shift with experience, they did not necessarily change to the predicted functional-based model. This research presents an opportunity for the design of games that are guided by shifts in a player's mental model as opposed to the typical progression through successive performance levels."

The aim of this study was to explore whether ML algorithms are more accurate than traditional statistical models in predicting vegetable and fruit (VF) consumption. A large array of features (2,452 features from 525 variables) encompassing individual and environmental information related to dietary habits and food choices in a sample of 1,147 French-speaking adult men and women was used for the purpose of this study. Adequate VF consumption, which was defined as 5 servings/d or more, was measured by averaging data from three web-based 24 h recalls and used as the outcome to predict. Nine classification ML algorithms were compared to two traditional statistical predictive models, logistic regression and penalized regression (Lasso). The performance of the predictive ML algorithms was tested after the implementation of adjustments, including normalizing the data, as well as in a series of sensitivity analyses such as using VF consumption obtained from a web-based food frequency questionnaire (wFFQ) and applying a feature selection algorithm in an attempt to reduce overfitting. Logistic regression and Lasso predicted adequate VF consumption with an accuracy of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.70) and 0.64 (95%CI: 0.60-0.68) respectively. Among the ML algorithms tested, the most accurate algorithms to predict adequate VF consumption were the support vector machine (SVM) with either a radial basis kernel or a sigmoid kernel, both with an accuracy of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.59-0.71). The least accurate ML algorithm was the SVM with a linear kernel with an accuracy of 0.55 (95%CI: 0.49-0.61). Using dietary intake data from the wFFQ and applying a feature selection algorithm had little to no impact on the performance of the algorithms. In summary, ML algorithms and traditional statistical models predicted adequate VF consumption with similar accuracies among adults. These results suggest that additional research is needed to explore further the true potential of ML in predicting dietary behaviours that are determined by complex interactions among several individual, social and environmental factors."

The most frequent complications of these are the development of diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accurate tools are needed to classify the cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the MetS population. In recent years, numerous biomarkers of bone metabolism have been associated with CVR. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) in a cohort of patients with MetS and to analyse its association with MetS parameters and CVR as well as with T2D prevalence. A longitudinal study was conducted in which a MetS population was followed for one year. Weight change, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), ucOC levels, MetS parameters and CVR were analysed and CVR was calculated using different scores. Our results showed a decrease of CVR associated with a better adherence to the MetDiet resulting in higher HDL-C and ucOC levels though the improvement of MetS risk factors. This bone protein appeared as a potential biomarker to classify CVR in the MetS population, especially for MetS patients without prevalent T2D.

By contrast, phenotypic plasticity has been thought to be most important during the initial stages of population establishment and in asexual species. We evaluated the roles of adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity in the invasive success of two closely related species of invasive monkeyflowers (Mimulus) in the UK that have contrasting reproductive strategies: M. guttatus combines sexual (seeds) and asexual (clonal growth) reproduction while M. × robertsii is entirely asexual.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We compared the clonality (number of stolons), floral and vegetative phenotype, and phenotypic plasticity of native (M. guttatus) and invasive (M. guttatus and M. × robertsii) populations grown in controlled environment chambers under the environmental conditions at each latitudinal extreme of the UK.

In the experiment, participants ([Formula: see text]) played a hypothetical dictator game with an avatar that expressed its emotions by changing the shapes of its eyes, eyebrows and mouth and by changing the frequency of eye blinking. The results showed that the emotions expressed by changes in the shape of the facial parts contributed to eliciting a higher donation amount, consistent with previous studies. However, we could not find an additive effect of the emotional expression shown by eye blinking.

Network formation is modeled as a strategic-form game, where agents represent nodes that form and sever unidirectional links with other nodes and derive utilities from these links. Furthermore, agents can form links only with a limited set of neighbors. Agents trade off the benefit from links, which is determined by a distance-dependent reward function, and the cost of maintaining links. When each agent acts independently, trying to maximize its own utility function, we can characterize “stable” networks through the notion of Nash equilibrium. In fact, the introduced reward and cost functions lead to Nash equilibria (networks), which exhibit several desirable properties such as connectivity, bounded-hop diameter, and efficiency (i.e., minimum number of links). Since Nash networks may not necessarily be efficient, we also explore the possibility of “shaping” the set of Nash networks through the introduction of state-based utility functions. Such utility functions may represent dynamic phenomena such as establishment costs (either positive or negative). Finally, we show how Nash networks can be the outcome of a distributed learning process. In particular, we extend previous learning processes to so-called “state-based” weakly acyclic games, and we show that the proposed network formation games belong to this class of games."

Several machine learning and artificial neural networks analyze using an autoimmune discovery transcriptomic panel of 755 genes to predict and model ulcerative colitis versus healthy donors. The dataset GSE38713 of 43 cases from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona was selected, and 16 models were used, including C5, logistic regression, Bayesian network, discriminant analysis, KNN algorithm, LSVM, random trees, SVM, Tree-AS, XGBoost linear, XGBoost tree, CHAID, Quest, C&R tree, random forest, and neural network. Conventional analysis, including volcano plot and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), were also performed. As a result, ulcerative colitis was successfully predicted with several machine learning techniques and artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron), with an overall accuracy of 95-100%, and relevant pathogenic genes were highlighted. One of them, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, PDCD1LG1, B7-H1) was validated in a series from the Tokai University Hospital by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, artificial intelligence analysis of transcriptomic data of ulcerative colitis is a feasible analytical strategy."

            "abstract": "Ethylene has long been regarded as the main regulator of ripening in climacteric fruits. The characterization of a few tomato mutants, unable to produce climacteric ethylene and to ripen their fruits even following treatments with exogenous ethylene, has shown that other factors also play an important role in the control of climacteric fruit ripening. In climacteric peach and tomato fruits it has been shown that, concomitant with ethylene production, increases in the amount of auxin can also be measured. In this work a genomic approach has been used in order to understand if such an auxin increase is functional to an independent role played by the hormone during ripening of the climacteric peach fruits. Besides the already known indirect activity on ripening due to its up-regulation of climacteric ethylene synthesis, it has been possible to show that auxin plays a role of its own during ripening of peaches. In fact, the hormone has shown the ability to regulate the expression of a number of different genes. Moreover, many genes involved in biosynthesis and transport and, in particular, the signalling (receptors, Auxin Response Factors and Aux/IAA) of auxin had increased expression in the mesocarp during ripening, thus strengthening the idea that this hormone is actively involved in the ripening of peaches. This study has also demonstrated the existence of an important cross-talk between auxin and ethylene, with genes in the auxin domain regulated by ethylene and genes in the ethylene domain regulated by auxin."

            "abstract": "The hydrophobic cuticular membrane of land plants performs a number of important roles during fruit development, including protection from a range of abiotic and biotic stresses. The components of the fleshy fruit cuticle are synthesized and secreted from the epidermal cells. While the biosynthetic and transport pathways of the cuticle have been thoroughly investigated for a number of decades, the regulatory mechanisms allowing fine tuning of cuticle deposition are only now beginning to be elucidated. Transcription factors belonging to the APETALA2, homeodomain-leucine zipper IV, and MYB families have been shown to be important regulators of both cuticle biosynthesis and epidermal cell differentiation, highlighting the connection between these processes. The involvement of MADS-box transcription factors demonstrates the link between fruit ripening and cuticle deposition. Epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also play a role in the control of cuticle biosynthesis, in addition to phytohormones, such as abscisic acid, that have been shown to stimulate cuticle deposition. These various levels of genetic regulation allow the plant constantly to maintain and adjust the cuticle in response to environmental and developmental cues."

            "abstract": "In general, the environment limits the fitness of individual animals, and environmental limitation leads to selection for \"optimal\", intermediate values for all traits that matter, whether imposed by natural or artificial selection. We compared the reproduction of laboratory mice in a normal and a hot, humid environment to test this claim. Thirty males and 150 females from a non-inbred line adapted to normal conditions were mated twice (the second time after rerandomisation) to produce the experimental animals. Individual experimental mice from each litter were allocated from weaning (3 weeks) either to the normal or hot environment. At 9 to 12 weeks of age these mice were paired, 1 male with 1 female, until the female had a chance to have 2 litters. 354 pairs in the normal and 362 pairs in the hot environment were mated. All living progeny were weaned at 3 weeks. Average values of reproductive traits, phenotypic correlations between traits, and heritability estimates for many traits were found in each environment. Negative correlations (trade-offs) between litter number and weight of individual progeny in both environments demonstrated clearly that fitness was limited even in the normal laboratory situation. All quantitative measures of reproduction were lower in the hot room showing that it was more stressful. Yet size of individual young and their survival was not reduced. This may be an adaptive mechanism restricted to housemice. Lower heritability estimates in first than in second parities for quantitative measures of litter size show that while the mouse is still growing she has fewer resources available for reproduction, making her more susceptible to environmental stress. This challenges accepted wisdom that animal breeders should select their animals when they are young. They are least likely to respond then. We believe that natural selection causes animals always to push their fitness (reproduction and survival of the progeny) against a limit set by their particular environment. Each environment selects animals that optimally allocate environmental resources there. Problems arise when inappropriate genetic settings cause phenotypes to misallocate metabolic resources. In relatively difficult environments productive animals, including successful transgenics, allocate insufficient resources to fitness. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Begrenzung der Fitneß durch die Umwelt: Reproduktion von Labormäusen in günstigen und schwierigen (\"tropischen\") Bedingungen Im Normalfall soll die Umwelt der Fitneß eine obere Grenze setzen. Diese Begrenzung führt zu Selektion auf mittlere \"Optimalwerte\" bei alien wichtigen Merkmalen. Wir untersuchten die Fortpflanzung von Labormäusen in entweder normaler oder heißer Umwelt. Aus einer an erstere angepaßten, nichtingezüchteten Linie wurden 30 Männchen mit 150 Weibchen zweimal verpaart (beim zweiten Mal neu randomisiert) um die Versuchstiere zu erzeugen. Individuen aus jedem Wurf wurden zufallsmäßig an die zwei Umwelten verteilt, worin sie ab 3 Wochen aufgezogen wurden. Im Alter zwischen 9 und 12 Wochen wurden sie zufallsmäßig 1:1 verpaart bis die Paare Zeit für zwei Würfe gehabt hatten. An 354 und 362 Paaren im normalen und heißen Zimmer wurden Daten ihrer Reproduktion erhoben. Alle lebendgeborenen Jungen wurden bis 3 Wochen alt verfolgt. In beiden Umwelten wurden Durchschnittswerte der einzelnen Merkmale, phänotypische Korrelationen wichtiger Merkmale, und Heritabilitätswerte der Merkmale errechnet. Starke negative Korrelationen zwischen Anzahl der Jungen im Wurf und Gewicht der einzelnen Jungen im Wurf, in beiden Umwelten, zeigen daß Fitneß auch in normalen Laborverhältnissen begrenzt war. Alle quantitativen Maße der Würfe waren beträchtlich niedriger im heißen Raum, was zeigt, daß diese Umwelt mehr Streß bot. Jedoch die Größe und Überlebensrate der einzelnen Jungen im heißen Raum wurden nicht beeinträchtigt. Diese adaptive Anpassung an schwierige Bedingungen könnte einmalig bei Mus musculus sein. Niedere Heritabilitäten von quantitativen Maßen der Wurfgröße im ersten gegenüber dem zweiten Wurf zeigen, daß noch selbst wachsende Weibchen nur wenig Ressourcen für Fortpflanzung einsetzen können und deshalb mehr von Umweltdruck abhängen. Paradoxerweise versuchen Tierzüchter meistens so Jung wie möglich Tiere zu selektieren, die solcher Selektion auf Reproduktion am wenigsten folgen können. Diese Situation sollte erneut durchdacht werden. Uns scheint, daß Tiere, weil natürliche Selektion andauernd fortwirkt, jederzeit ihre Fitneß bis an eine obere Grenze, von der Umwelt gesetzt, schieben. Jede Umwelt selektiert Tiere, die ihre metabolischen Ressourcen darin optimal einsetzen. Probleme entstehen, wenn genetische Information Phänotype erzeugt, die Ressourcen fehl einsetzen. In relativ schwieriger Umwelt haben Leistungstiere, und auch erfolgreiche transgenische Tiere, ungenügend Ressourcen übrig für Fortpflanzung."

For instance, some people anthropomorphize and fall in love with a virtual partner in a romantic video game. Although previous psychological research has examined anthropomorphized agents, it has neglected virtual romantic relationships. This study aims to examine the desire to play underlying playing romantic video games (RVGs). In Study 1, 43 Japanese participants completed a survey about their desire to play RVGs and their current romantic relationship status. The research revealed that a human-like voice and the use of touch were perceived as important factors in anthropomorphized relationships. In Study 2, an independent sample of 281 Japanese participants replicated the results of Study 1 regarding the importance of voice and touch in RVGs. Moreover, we found that a desire to develop social skills and alleviate negative emotions independently desire to play RVG use. As an important first step, these findings reveal several factors which might contribute to developing a romantic relationship with a virtual agent."

As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research."

Strawberry produces both inflorescences and stolons (also called runners), which are lateral stems growing at the soil surface and producing new clone plants. In this study, the flowering and runnering behaviour of two cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch., 2n = 8× = 56) genotypes, a seasonal flowering genotype CF1116 and a perpetual flowering genotype Capitola, were studied along the growing season. The genetic bases of the perpetual flowering and runnering traits were investigated further using a pseudo full-sibling F1 population issued from a cross between these two genotypes. The results showed that a single major quantitative trait locus (QTL) named FaPFRU controlled both traits in the cultivated octoploid strawberry. This locus was not orthologous to the loci affecting perpetual flowering (SFL) and runnering (R) in Fragaria vesca, therefore suggesting different genetic control of perpetual flowering and runnering in the diploid and octoploid Fragaria spp. Furthermore, the FaPFRU QTL displayed opposite effects on flowering (positive effect) and on runnering (negative effect), indicating that both traits share common physiological control. These results suggest that this locus plays a major role in strawberry plant fitness by controlling the balance between sexual and asexual plant reproduction."

The effects of hand pollination on fruit set, seed number and seedling fitness differed among years. Pollen tube growth and reproductive success did not differ between self- and cross-pollinations. Accordingly, a high self-compatibility index for the fruit set (SCI = 1.00) and the seed number (SCI = 0.98) and a low inbreeding depression at all developmental stages (cumulative delta = 0.126) suggest a high selfing ability.

These countries also face some of the earliest and most significant impacts of climate change. Several pathways between climate change and DR-NCDs have been described in the literature; however, the scope is broad and lacks context specificity. This paper uses a case study of one Pacific Island country, Vanuatu, to investigate links between climate change and DR-NCDs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An ethnographic qualitative research approach was used to share the lived experiences of community participants and to explore and contrast these with the perspectives of key informants at the national level.

However, there was a lack of understanding of the links between climate change and DR-NCDs both at the community and national levels. Structural factors, such as social determinants and climate change, constrained individual and community agency in making optimal food and health choices and promoted the nutrition transition in Vanuatu. Despite the critical role of social determinants and climate change in driving DR-NCD risk, the responsibility for prevention and treatment was considered to rest mainly with the individual. A systems approach is advocated to grasp the complexity and interrelatedness of the causes of DR-NCD risk.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The interaction of structural determinants creates food and health environments that amplify the risk, burden, and consequences of DR-NCDs. It is recommended that the DR-NCD narrative in Vanuatu be re-framed with an emphasis on the range of structural determinants of DR-NCD risk.

These findings reinforce the ASD screening with an average accuracy of 77%, while the accuracy improves further (>80%) with respect to angry and happy emotion stimuli."

            "title": "First Report of Fusarium Wilt Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. passiflorae on Passion Fruit in North America.",
            "abstract": "Passiflora edulis Sims f. edulis, known as purple passion fruit, is a woody, perennial vine that is grown for its attractive two-part flower and its purple, edible fruit (4). In November 2009, passion fruit vines were collected during a regulatory nursery inspection in Santa Barbara County and submitted to the California Department of Food and Agriculture Plant Pest Diagnostics Laboratory. Nearly 100% of the plants inspected, all of which were approximately 1.25 m tall, appeared stunted, defoliated, and severely wilted. Dark brown vascular discoloration was present in the roots and lower stems of the plants. A pinkish violet Fusarium oxysporum colony containing chlamydospores, multiseptate macroconidia, and microconidia formed on monophialidic conidiophores was consistently isolated from roots and stems onto half-strength acidified potato dextrose agar (aPDA). All further experiments were done with an isolate obtained from a single conidium. A portion of the translation elongation factor gene (TEF-1α) was amplified and sequenced with primers ef1 and ef2 from our isolate (GenBank No. JF332039) (3). BLAST analysis of the 615-bp amplicon with the FUSARIUM-ID database showed 99% similarity with a F. oxysporum passion fruit isolate from Australia (NRRL 38273) (3). To confirm pathogenicity, washed roots of four-leaf stage seedlings approximately 10 cm tall were submerged in a conidial spore suspension (106 spores/ml) for 15 min. The conidial suspension was prepared by flooding 10-day-old cultures grown on aPDA medium with sterile distilled water. Seven seedlings were inoculated and planted in 10-cm2 pots and kept in a 25°C growth chamber with a 12-h photoperiod. Seven seedlings were mock inoculated with sterile water. After 3 weeks, four of the seven inoculated plants had leaves with yellow veins and discolored roots and had partially defoliated. Two of the four symptomatic plants also had brown stem cankers. F. oxysporum grew from the isolated roots and stems of all the inoculated plants. F. oxysporum did not grow from root and stem pieces from the water-dipped plants and the plants remained asymptomatic. Inoculations were repeated on plants approximately 15 cm tall with F. oxysporum growing from roots and stem pieces of all inoculated plants. Symptoms of yellow veins and root necrosis were not observed until 4 weeks after inoculation. Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. passiflorae is a significant disease of P. edulis f. edulis in Australia. The disease has also been reported in South Africa, Malaysia, Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela; but it is unclear as to whether the symptoms were caused by Fusarium wilt or Haematonectria canker (1). Banana poka (P. mollissima), P. ligularis, and P. foetida are also susceptible hosts (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. passiflorae on passion fruit in North America. Passion fruit is not commercially produced for consumption in California so the economic importance of this disease appears to be limited to nursery production and ornamental landscapes. The grower of the California nursery stated that the infected passion fruit plants had been propagated on site from seed. The source of inoculum at this nursery remains unknown. References: (1) I. H.

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      Xylem flows into most fruits decline as the fruit develop, with important effects on mineral and carbohydrate accumulation. It has been hypothesized that an increase in xylem hydraulic resistance (RT) contributes to this process. This study examined changes in RT that occur during development of the berry of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), identified the region within the fruit where changes were occurring, and tested whether a decrease in irradiance during fruit development caused an increase in RT, potentially contributing to decreased mineral accumulation in shaded fruit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      RT was measured using pressure chamber and flow meter methods, the two methods were compared, and the flow meter was also used to partition RT between the pedicel, receptacle and proximal and distal portions of the berry. Dye was used as a tracer for xylem function. Artificial shading was used to test the effect of light on RT, dye entry and mineral accumulation.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      RT decreased during the early phase of rapid fruit growth, but increased again as the fruit transitioned to a final period of slower growth. The most significant changes in resistance occurred in the receptacle, which initially contributed 20 % to RT, increasing to 90 % later in development. Dye also ceased moving beyond the receptacle from 70 d after anthesis. The two methods for measuring RT agreed in terms of the direction and timing of developmental changes in RT, but pressure chamber measurements were consistently higher than flow meter estimates of RT, prompting questions regarding which method is most appropriate for measuring fruit RT. Shading had no effect on berry growth but increased RT and decreased dye movement and calcium concentration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Increased RT in the receptacle zone coincides with slowing fresh weight growth, reduced transpiration and rapid starch accumulation by the fruit. Developmental changes in RT may be connected to changes in phloem functioning and the maintenance of water potential gradients between the stem and the fruit. The effect of shade on RT extends earlier reports that shading can affect fruit vascular differentiation, xylem flows and mineral accumulation independently of effects on transpiration."

For decision-making research that requires human data, high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to facilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible standard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain high levels of performance. Therefore, measuring eye movements can provide a rich source of information about the strategies that humans use to solve decision-making tasks. Here, we provide a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play Atari video games. The dataset consists of 117 hours of gameplay data from a diverse set of 20 games, with 8 million action demonstrations and 328 million gaze samples. We introduce a novel form of gameplay, in which the human plays in a semi-frame-by-frame manner. This leads to near-optimal game decisions and game scores that are comparable or better than known human records. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset through two simple applications: predicting human gaze and imitating human demonstrated actions. The quality of the data leads to promising results in both tasks. Moreover, using a learned human gaze model to inform imitation learning leads to an 115% increase in game performance. We interpret these results as highlighting the importance of incorporating human visual attention in models of decision making and demonstrating the value of the current dataset to the research community. We hope that the scale and quality of this dataset can provide more opportunities to researchers in the areas of visual attention, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning."

The research was conducted by analyzing survey data (N = 705) collected from individuals who had voluntarily participated in an open online course about artificial intelligence and its societal impact. The survey included an explorative Motives for Autonomous Learning (MAL) inventory. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that the MAL inventory consisted of six dimensions out of which four were consistent with factors that earlier research has associated with motives to engage with video games. Of the identified factors, the dimension that most clearly described autonomous and playful predispositions was found to be a main precedent for both experienced gamefulness of the learning experience and positive learning outcomes.

Here we characterize a caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase-like enzyme, designated CrOMT1. The expression pattern of CrOMT1 was highly correlated with the concentration of the three major PMFs in two different citrus fruit tissues during fruit maturation. Exposure of fruit to UV-B radiation sharply increased the level of CrOMT1 transcripts and also led to the accumulation of three PMFs. The potential role of CrOMT1 was studied by testing the catalytic activity of recombinant CrOMT1 with numerous possible substrates in vitro. The enzyme could most efficiently methylate flavones with neighboring hydroxy moieties, with high catalytic efficiencies found with 6-OH- and 8-OH-containing compounds, preferences that correspond precisely with the essential methylation sites involved in the synthesis of the three naturally occurring PMFs in Citrus reticulata. This indicates that CrOMT1 is capable of in vitro methylation reactions required to synthesize PMFs in vivo. Furthermore, transient overexpression of CrOMT1 increased levels of the three major PMFs in fruit, indicating that CrOMT1 is likely to play an essential role in the biosynthesis of PMFs in citrus."

Body composition was evaluated using body mass index corrected for age and sex (BMI-z), body fat (BF), and waist circumference. The data was analyzed using Spearman correlations and chi-squared tests. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between groups for running and agility, strength, and aerobic capacity. No significant differences were found between p-DCD and TD groups in terms of body mass (36.1 kg vs. 33.3 kg), waist circumference (62.2 cm vs. 59.8 cm), BMI-z (19.7 vs. 17.6), and fat percentage (20.2 vs. 18.1%). Overweight and obesity prevalence was 15% in those with low socio-economic status (SES) and 27% in high SES.

On two isogenic lines (CF12-C and CF14-L), differing by fruit weight and sugar content quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified previously, basal and tip fruits were characterized at anthesis and at maturity through their growth, dry matter and sugar content, number and size of cells and nuclei DNA content. The influence of competition was assessed by removing either basal or tip ovaries at anthesis. On an intact inflorescence, CF12-C fruits grew less than CF14-L fruits, with 1.67 fewer cell layers and similar cell size, suggesting that genes controlling cell division may be responsible for this fruit size variation. Truss thinning masked the QTL effect on fruit size, mainly by reducing the difference in cell number between the two lines and by promoting cell expansion in tip fruits, so that fruit growth was similar at both positions and for both lines. Thus, in these lines, cell number exerts a control on final fruit size only when there is competition among fruits. Different responses of basal and tip fruits after flower removal suggested that this treatment induced changes in hormonal relationships within the truss. No fixed relationship between DNA endoreduplication and cell size was found, as while cell size and dry matter and sugar contents differed with tomato lines, fruit position and truss size, endoreduplication patterns were the same. CF12-C fruits had a higher dry matter (+0.3% of fresh weight) and carbohydrates (+8% of dry matter) content than CF14-L fruits.

Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles."

            "abstract": "(1) To investigate whether interventional cone-beam computed tomography (cbCT) could benefit from AI denoising, particularly with respect to patient body mass index (BMI); (2) From 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2022, 100 patients with liver-directed interventions and peri-procedural cbCT were included. The unenhanced mask run and the contrast-enhanced fill run of the cbCT were reconstructed using weighted filtered back projection. Additionally, each dataset was post-processed using a novel denoising software solution. Place-consistent regions of interest measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per dataset. Corrected mixed-effects analysis with BMI subgroup analyses compared objective image quality. Multiple linear regression measured the contribution of “Radiation Dose”, “Body-Mass-Index”, and “Mode” to SNR. Two radiologists independently rated diagnostic confidence. Inter-rater agreement was measured using Spearman correlation (r); (3) SNR was significantly higher in the denoised datasets than in the regular datasets (p < 0.001). Furthermore, BMI subgroup analysis showed significant SNR deteriorations in the regular datasets for higher patient BMI (p < 0.001), but stable results for denoising (p > 0.999). In regression, only denoising contributed positively towards SNR (0.6191; 95%CI 0.6096 to 0.6286; p < 0.001). The denoised datasets received overall significantly higher diagnostic confidence grades (p = 0.010), with good inter-rater agreement (r ≥ 0.795, p < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, diagnostic confidence deteriorated significantly for higher patient BMI (p < 0.001) in the regular datasets but was stable in the denoised datasets (p ≥ 0.103).; (4) AI denoising can significantly enhance image quality in interventional cone-beam CT and effectively mitigate diagnostic confidence deterioration for rising patient BMI."

Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'."

            "abstract": "In information system construction, online data migration is a very important link. At present, in different fields, people provide protection for online data migration through the way of project management to ensure the speed and efficiency of online migration. However, some problems may occur in the process of online data migration. In the development of contemporary sports, competitive sports, as the high-end stage of sports development, are constantly pursued by ordinary sports enthusiasts. Therefore, in the national fitness activities, how to combine the national fitness and competitive sports data to provide a more professional storage platform is a focus of research but also a problem to be solved in the process of online data migration. Because the data mining ID3 algorithm only supports querying and retrieving RowKey indexes, it does not support non-RowKey column indexing. Therefore, if you want to query non-RowKey indexes, the data mining ID3 algorithm will search the form in the overall scan, but the performance of this method is low. In order to improve the query speed of non-RowKey columns, this paper designs a secondary index function based on HBase. The sports competition action system can retrieve data from the secondary index of the query state, to avoid scanning the whole world and improve the search speed. In this paper, ID3 algorithm is used to combine national fitness and competitive sports data, which provides a guarantee for the migration of competitive sports data in the national fitness system."

Most of these ramets are non-floral. The main objectives of this study were to determine: (a) if plant growth was source limited in cloudberry; (b) if the non-floral ramets translocated carbon (C) to the fruit; and (c) if there was competition between fruit, leaves and rhizomes for C during fruit development.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Floral and non-floral ramet activities were monitored during the period of flower and fruit development using three approaches: gas exchange measurements, (14)CO(2) labelling and dry mass accumulation in the different organs. Source and sink activity were manipulated by eliminating leaves or flowers or by reducing rhizome length.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Photosynthetic rates were lower in floral than in deflowered ramets. Autoradiographs and (14)C labelling data clearly indicated that fruit is a very strong sink for the floral ramet, whereas non-floral ramets translocated C toward the rhizome but not toward floral ramets. Nevertheless, rhizomes received some C from the floral ramet throughout the fruiting period. Ramets with shorter rhizomes produced smaller leaves and smaller fruits, and defoliated ramets produced very small fruits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Plant growth appears to be source-limited in cloudberry since a reduction in sink strength did not induce a reduction in photosynthetic activity. Non-floral ramets did not participate directly to fruit development. Developing leaves appear to compete with the developing fruit but the intensity of this competition could vary with the specific timing of the two organs. The rhizome appears to act both as a source but also potentially as a sink during fruit development. Further studies are needed to characterize better the complex role played by the rhizome in fruit C nutrition."

            "abstract": "Mannan transglycosylases are cell wall enzymes able to transfer part of the mannan polysaccharide backbone to mannan-derived oligosaccharides (Schröder et al. in Planta 219:590-600, 2004). Mannan transglycosylase activity was purified to near homogeneity from ripe tomato fruit. N-terminal sequencing showed that the dominant band seen on SDS-PAGE was identical to LeMAN4a, a hydrolytic endo-beta-mannanase found in ripe tomato fruit (Bewley et al. in J Exp Bot 51:529-538, 2000). Recombinant LeMAN4a protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited both mannan hydrolase and mannan transglycosylase activity. Western analysis of ripe tomato fruit tissue using an antibody raised against tomato seed endo-beta-mannanase revealed four isoforms present after 2D-gel electrophoresis in the pH range 6-11. On separation by preparative liquid isoelectric focussing, these native isoforms exhibited different preferences for transglycosylation and hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that endo-beta-mannanase has two activities: it can either hydrolyse mannan polysaccharides, or in the presence of mannan-derived oligosaccharides, carry out a transglycosylation reaction. We therefore propose that endo-beta-mannanase should be renamed mannan transglycosylase/hydrolase, in accordance with the nomenclature established for xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase. The role of endo-acting mannanases in modifying the structure of plant cell walls during cell expansion, seed germination and fruit ripening may need to be reinterpreted in light of their potential action as transglycosylating or hydrolysing enzymes."

Traditional external treatment of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belongs to a type of non-drug therapy, the treatment of insomnia has a long history, but the methods of non-drug treatment of TCM are diverse, and the efficacy is also different.

Meta-regression analysis revealed that publication year, patient age, sample size, and intervention characteristics were not specific factors affecting the combined results. Discussion. TCM non-drug therapy (acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and auricular point pressing beans) can significantly improve the PSQI score of patients after treatment and improve the degree of anxiety and depression of patients, with significant effect, which is worthy of clinical promotion."

            "abstract": "Premise of the study:\n        \n      \n      Vestigialization of traits that no longer enhance fitness is a common theme in evolution. Plants often use colorful, scented flowers to attract pollinators that mediate outcross pollination. After an evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization, where cross-pollination is no longer necessary, attractive traits may be reduced, especially because these traits may also attract herbivores. Selection may be particularly strong in moth-pollinated lineages where pollinators are also herbivores.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used field surveys and common garden glasshouse experiments to test this hypothesis by quantifying components of flower size and display and floral volatiles in outcrossing vs. selfing populations of the moth-pollinated Pacific coastal dune endemic Abronia umbellata.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Floral face diameter and flower tube length were 43% and 54% smaller in selfing than outcrossing populations, and selfers displayed 15% fewer flowers per umbel. Selfers emitted 99% less total floral volatiles per flower per hour than outcrossers; a much stronger reduction. The chemical composition of volatiles also differed between outcrossers and selfers. Similar differences were observed in a common glasshouse environment, suggesting genetic differentiation in these floral attractive traits among populations. Contrary to expectations, there were no differences in leaf or flower herbivory between selfing and outcrossing populations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Floral fragrance is much more dramatically reduced in selfing compared to outcrossing populations than other floral attractive traits, but probably not due to selection exerted by moth herbivory.

            "abstract": "Healthy sleep is an essential physiological process for every individual to live a healthy life. Many sleep disorders both destroy the quality and decrease the duration of sleep. Thus, a convenient and accurate detection or classification method is important for screening and identifying sleep disorders. In this study, we proposed an AI-enabled algorithm for the automatic classification of sleep disorders based on a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). An AI-enabled algorithm-named a sleep disorder network (SDN)-was designed for automatic classification of four major sleep disorders, namely insomnia (INS), periodic leg movement (PLM), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and nocturnal frontal-lobe epilepsy (NFE). The SDN was constructed using deep convolutional neural networks that can extract and analyze the complex and cyclic rhythm of sleep disorders that affect ECG patterns. The SDN consists of five layers, a 1D convolutional layer, and is optimized via dropout and batch normalization. The single-lead ECG signal was extracted from the 35 subjects with the control (CNT) and the four sleep disorder groups (seven subjects of each group) in the CAP Sleep Database. The ECG signal was pre-processed, segmented at 30 s intervals, and divided into the training, validation, and test sets consisting of 74,135, 18,534, and 23,168 segments, respectively. The constructed SDN was trained and evaluated using the CAP Sleep Database, which contains not only data on sleep disorders, but also data of the control group. The proposed SDN algorithm for the automatic classification of sleep disorders based on a single-lead ECG showed very high performances. We achieved F1 scores of 99.0%, 97.0%, 97.0%, 95.0%, and 98.0% for the CNT, INS, PLM, RBD, and NFE groups, respectively. We proposed an AI-enabled method for the automatic classification of sleep disorders based on a single-lead ECG signal. In addition, it represents the possibility of the sleep disorder classification using ECG only. The SDN can be a useful tool or an alternative screening method based on single-lead ECGs for sleep monitoring and screening."

Five international teams, consisting of scientists, professionals, and students with different backgrounds in horticulture and AI, participated in a greenhouse growing experiment. Each team had a 96 m2 modern greenhouse compartment to grow a cucumber crop remotely during a 4-month-period. Each compartment was equipped with standard actuators (heating, ventilation, screening, lighting, fogging, CO2 supply, water and nutrient supply). Control setpoints were remotely determined by teams using their own AI algorithms. Actuators were operated by a process computer. Different sensors continuously collected measurements. Setpoints and measurements were exchanged via a digital interface. Achievements in AI-controlled compartments were compared with a manually operated reference. Detailed results on cucumber yield, resource use, and net profit obtained by teams are explained in this paper. We can conclude that in general AI performed well in controlling a greenhouse.

In the climacteric tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit, ethylene plays a key role in fruit ripening and softening. We characterized two related proteins with contrasting impact on ethylene production, ACC oxidase 1 (SlACO1) and SlE8. We found SlACO1 and SlE8 to be highly expressed during fruit ripening. To identify loss-of-function alleles, we analysed the tomato genetic diversity but we did not find any natural mutations impairing the function of these proteins. We also found the two loci evolving under purifying selection. To engineer hypomorphic alleles, we used TILLING (target-induced local lesions in genomes) to screen a tomato ethylmethane sulfonate-mutagenized population. We found 13 mutants that we phenotyped for ethylene production, shelf-life, firmness, conductivity, and soluble solid content in tomato fruits. The data demonstrated that slaco1-1 and slaco1-2 alleles could be used to improve fruit shelf-life, and that sle8-1 and sle8-2 alleles could be used to accelerate ripening. This study highlights further the importance of SlACO1 and SlE8 in ethylene production in tomato fruit and how they might be used for post-harvest fruit preservation or speeding up fruit maturation."

Seeds of Atriplex tatarica do not germinate immediately after shedding, but may remain in a dormant but viable state indefinitely. We investigated whether there were genetic and fitness differences between plants derived from seeds of the different fruit types germinated in different temperatures and salinities. Seeds that germinated in optimal and suboptimal conditions differed significantly in their genetic composition due, in part, to their source population. Seeds that germinated in the suboptimal conditions produced more homozygous plants. Plants that were primarily heterozygous were generated from nondormant fruit types as well as from fruits that germinated in the optimal conditions. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the degree of heterozygosity and plant fitness measured as the mass of the stem and reproductive structures. In conclusion, the genetic variation of natural populations may be at least partly due to the ability of particular seed genotypes to germinate in the specific environmental conditions of a particular locality. In some circumstances, the process of differential germination may select not only for genetic variability but also for higher fitness if heterozygosity-fitness correlations are present."

Their identification is crucial, and it would represent a fundamental step towards better management of this urgent public health issue. This aim could be accomplished by exploiting the potential of machine learning (ML) technology. In a single-centre study (n = 2567), we used an ML analysis to cluster patients with metabolically healthy (MHO) or metabolically unhealthy (MUO) obesity, based on several clinical and biochemical variables. The first model provided by ML was able to predict the presence/absence of MHO with an accuracy of 66.67% and 72.15%, respectively, and included the following parameters: HOMA-IR, upper body fat/lower body fat, glycosylated haemoglobin, red blood cells, age, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, white blood cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and gamma-glutamyl transferase. For each of these parameters, ML provided threshold values identifying either MUO or MHO. A second model including IGF-1 zSDS, a surrogate marker of IGF-1 normalized by age and sex, was even more accurate with a 71.84% and 72.3% precision, respectively. Our results demonstrated high IGF-1 levels in MHO patients, thus highlighting a possible role of IGF-1 as a novel metabolic health parameter to effectively predict the development of MUO using ML technology."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Improving adherence to antidiabetic medication is crucial, resulting in improved health outcomes, cost reduction, and minimization of waste. A lack of underlying theory in existing interventions may explain the limited success in sustaining behavior change. This paper describes the development of a theory and evidence-based complex intervention to improve adherence to oral antidiabetics in older people via a software prototype with an anthropomorphic virtual assistant. Methods: The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) was used to develop a theoretical understanding of the change process, corresponding to the first phase of the Medical Research Council Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. At the BCW core is a model of human behavior (COM-B), which posits that human behavior (B) results from the interaction between capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M). Literature-derived medication adherence determinants were mapped onto COM-B components. Then, intervention functions (IFs) were selected employing the APEASE criteria. Finally, standardized behavior change techniques (BCTs) were chosen based on their suitability and their effectiveness on medication adherence trials. The prototype was developed for android devices; its core was implemented in Unity3D, using a female 3D virtual assistant, named Vitória. Results: Two COM-B components were identified as main targets for behavior change-psychological capability and reflective motivation; these were linked with four IFs-education, persuasion, enablement, and environmental restructuring. Eleven BCTs were, in turn, linked with the IFs. An example of a BCT is \"problem solving\"; it requires users to pinpoint factors influencing non-adherence and subsequently offers strategies to achieve the desired behavior. BCTs were operationalized into the dialogues with Vitória and into supplementary software features. Vitória communicates with users verbally and non-verbally, expressing emotions. Input options consist of buttons or recording values, such as medication taken. Conclusion: The present approach enabled us to derive the most appropriate BCTs for our intervention. The use of an explicit bundle of BCTs, often overlooked in interventions promoting medication adherence, is expected to maximize effectiveness and facilitates replication. The first prototype is being refined with users and health professionals' contributions. Future work includes subjecting the prototype to usability tests and a feasibility trial."

The ideal sensor would analyze unknown samples in minutes, have programmable operation for unattended sample analysis, and be capable of multiple agent analysis for a number of agents. The goal of this project was to further the development of the bidiffractive grating biosensor (BDG) created through collaboration between Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), Hoffman LaRoche (HLR), and the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). This manuscript details the development, optimization, and evaluation of this device as a potential field deployable biosensor. Well-characterized immunochemical reagents developed by the Biological Defense Research Department (BDRD) at NMRI were employed to develop assays in the BDG. These results were compared to those obtained with antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Four separate antigens were evaluated: Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), ricin (RIC), Francisella tularensis (FT), and Clostridium botulinum toxin (BOT)."

In recent years, with the progress of immunosuppressive and supportive treatment, the therapeutic effect of MG in the acute stage is satisfactory, and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced. However, there is still no consensus on how to conduct long-term management of stable MG, such as guiding patients to identify relapses, practice exercise, return to work and school, etc. In the international consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis published by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) in 2020, for the first time, \"the role of physical training/exercise in MG\" was identified as the topic of discussion. Finally, due to a lack of high-quality evidence on physical training/exercise in patients with MG, the topic was excluded after the literature review. Therefore, this paper reviewed the current status of MG rehabilitation research and the difficulties faced by stable MG patients in self-management. It is suggested that we should take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) and leverage it to develop the data-driven decision support platforms for MG management which can be used for adverse event monitoring, disease education, chronic management, and a wide variety of data collection and analysis."

            "abstract": "Why do we seek out and enjoy uncertain success in playing games? Game designers and researchers suggest that games whose challenges match player skills afford engaging experiences of achievement, competence, or effectance-of doing well. Yet, current models struggle to explain why such balanced challenges best afford these experiences and do not straightforwardly account for the appeal of high- and low-challenge game genres like Idle and Soulslike games. In this article, we show that Predictive Processing (PP) provides a coherent formal cognitive framework which can explain the fun in tackling game challenges with uncertain success as the dynamic process of reducing uncertainty surprisingly efficiently. In gameplay as elsewhere, people enjoy doing better than expected, which can track learning progress. In different forms, balanced, Idle, and Soulslike games alike afford regular accelerations of uncertainty reduction. We argue that this model also aligns with a popular practitioner model, Raph Koster's Theory of Fun for Game Design, and can unify currently differentially modelled gameplay motives around competence and curiosity."

            "abstract": "In terms of public health, obesity and overweight have become major concerns worldwide. Nevertheless, regarding body composition, it is important to have a more precise understanding of the fat-to-muscle ratio. Hence, this study aimed to adopt bioelectrical impedance measurements to test body fat percentage (BF%) and to determine the associations between health-related physical fitness and both body fat (BF) distribution and BF obesity risk in Taiwanese adults. We conducted a cross-sectional study and reviewed data derived from Taiwan’s Scientific Physical Fitness Survey. From the database, responses from 17,970 participants aged 23−64 years were collected in this study. Each participant completed a series of health-related physical fitness measurements, including cardiorespiratory fitness (3 min of a progressive knee-up and step (3MPKS) test), muscular fitness (hand-grip strength), and flexibility (sit-and-reach test). The BF% of each participant was assessed using the bioelectrical impedance analysis method. BF% was negatively associated with low performance on the 3MPKS (β = 11.314, p < 0.0001 for men; β = 12.308, p < 0.0001 for women), hand-grip strength (β = 2.071, p < 0.0001 for men; β = 0.859, p < 0.0001 for women), and sit-and-reach (β = 0.337, p = 0.008 for women) tests but was positively associated with sit-and-reach (β = −0.394, p = 0.004 for men). A risk of BF obesity for low performance of 3MPKS (odds ratio (OR) = 26.554, p < 0.0001 for men; OR = 25.808, p < 0.0001 for women), hand-grip strength (OR = 1.682, p < 0.0001 for men; OR = 1.234, p < 0.0001 for women), and sit-and-reach (OR = 1.142, p = 0.007 for women) tests was observed.

            "abstract": "Throughout tomato domestication, a large increase in fruit size was associated with a loss of dry matter and sugar contents. This study aims to dissect the contributions of genetic variation and the physiological processes underlying the relationships between fruit growth and the accumulation of dry matter and sugars. Fruit quality traits and physiological parameters were measured on 20 introgression lines derived from the introgression of Solanum chmielewskii into S. lycopersicum, under high (HL, unpruned trusses) and low (LL, trusses pruned to one fruit) fruit load conditions. Inter- and intra-genotypic correlations among traits were estimated and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for size, composition, and physiological traits were mapped. LL increased almost all traits, but the response of sugar content was genotype-dependent, involving either dilution effects or differences in carbon allocation to sugars. Genotype x fruit load interactions were significant for most traits and only 30% of the QTL were stable under both fruit loads. Many QTL for fresh weight and cell or seed numbers co-localized. Eleven clusters of QTL for fresh weight and dry matter or sugar content were detected, eight with opposite allele effects and three with negative effects. Two genotypic antagonistic relationships, between fresh weight and dry matter content and between cell number and cell size, were significant only under HL; the second could be interpreted as a competition for carbohydrates among cells. The role of cuticular conductance, fruit transpiration or cracking in the relationship between fruit fresh weight and composition was also emphasized at the genetic and physiological levels."

Calorie restriction, regular exercise, and several weight reducing drugs, including probiotic and prebiotic use, are increasing in the market as potential anti-obesity treatments all over the world. Despite these efforts, obesity is increasing and is at epidemic levels. We propose here that there should be a multicomponent individual specific treatment approach for treating this multifactorial pathogenesis, incorporating psychological assessment as a first step that may help to reduce the prevalence of this alarming epidemic. We also believe that focusing on psychological screening may not be enough to control this epidemic without government and community cooperation and intervention. Additionally, we suggest that it is imperative to take advantage of the developments in web-based counseling and artificial intelligence expansion in combination with available anti-obesity treatments to make treatments feasible, accessible, and cost-effective for populations of all ages.

This led to an in-creased use of social media platforms to make people feel more connected, but also to maintain physical activity while self-isolating. Concerns about physical appearance and the desire to keep or reach a muscular and toned ideal body, might have further reinforced the engagement in fitness-related social media activities, like sharing progresses in training achievements or following more fitness contents on popular profiles. To better understand the underlying relation among these factors, the present study investigates 729 responses to the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and their association to social media usage and compares the results cross-culturally in five countries (Spain, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Japan, and Hungary). Findings highlight significant differences between males and females, espe-cially in regard to the time spent online (U = 477.5, p = 0.036). Greater levels of appearance anxiety were associated with the exposure to fitness-related contents on social media. These results strongly confirm the previously highlighted association between fitspiration media and body image anxiety predominantly in females. Clinical implications and future considerations in terms of prevention and treatment in a situation of global emergency are also discussed."

Stress often hinders positive health outcomes in youth with obesity. Digital health interventions, with fewer on-site visits, promise health care access in remote regions; however, evidence for their effectiveness is scarce.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This randomized controlled not blinded trial (1:1) was conducted in a childhood obesity center in Switzerland. Forty-one youth aged 10-18 years with body mass index (BMI) > P.90 with risk factors or co-morbidities or BMI > P.97 were recruited. During 5.5 months, the PathMate2 group (PM) received daily conversational agent counselling via mobile app, combined with standardized counselling (4 on-site visits). Controls (CON) participated in a BCI (7 on-site visits). We compared the outcomes of both groups after 5.5 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. Primary outcome was reduction in BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score: BMI adjusted for age and sex). Secondary outcomes were changes in body fat and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), waist-to-height ratio, physical capacities (modified Dordel-Koch-Test), blood pressure and pulse. Additionally, we hypothesized that less stressed children would lose more weight. Thus, children performed biofeedback relaxation exercises while stress parameters (plasma cortisol, stress questionnaires) were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At intervention start median BMI-SDS of all patients (18 PM, 13 CON) was 2.61 (obesity > + 2SD). BMI-SDS decreased significantly in CON at T1, but not at T2, and did not decrease in PM during the study. Muscle mass, strength and agility improved significantly in both groups at T2; only PM reduced significantly their body fat at T1 and T2. Average daily PM app usage rate was 71.5%. Cortisol serum levels decreased significantly after biofeedback but with no association between stress parameters and BMI-SDS. No side effects were observed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Equally to BCI, PathMate2 intervention resulted in significant and lasting improvements of physical capacities and body composition, but not in sustained BMI-SDS decrease. This youth-appealing mobile health intervention provides an interesting approach for youth with obesity who have limited access to health care. Biofeedback reduces acute stress and could be an innovative adjunct to usual care."

We investigated the effects of parental communications about health and health behaviours on children's health and wellbeing, and explored what strategies can encourage parents to communicate about health. We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of research published between January 2008 and April 2020 from five databases. Of 14,007 articles identified, 16 met inclusion criteria focusing on five topics: diet and weight (n = 5), body image (n = 2), sexual health (n = 7), physical activity (n = 1) and bullying (n = 1). Positive child outcomes were associated with positive general parent-child communication characterised by warmth, openness and allowing children choice. Conversely, hostility, negative and inconsistent messaging were associated with poorer outcomes. Interventions to increase parent-child communication could be classified as providing single directive messages, media campaigns or intensive support. Single messages increased communication frequency; media campaigns and intensive interventions showed mixed outcomes. No differences in outcomes were found according to child's gender or socio-economic status. Generally, parents were less confident in initiating, rather than continuing, conversations and were more likely to initiate conversations when they felt they had good topic knowledge. While the relatively small, diverse sample limits the strength of these findings, this review provides provisional support for approaches to promote positive parent-child communication about health that are associated with better child health and wellbeing."

The carotenoid profiles, carotenogenic gene expression and proteome profiles of green-fruited Solanum habrochaites (SH), orange-fruited S. galapagense, and red-fruited S. pimpinellifolium were compared with cultivated tomato [S. lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig (SL)] to decipher the molecular basis of coloration diversity. Green-fruited SH, though it showed normal expression of chromoplast-specific phytoene synthase1 and lycopene β-cyclase genes akin to orange/red-fruited species, failed to accumulate lycopene and β-carotene. The SH phytoene synthase1 cDNA encoded an enzymatically active protein, whereas the lycopene β-cyclase cDNA was barely active. Consistent with its green-fruited nature, SH's fruits retained chloroplast structure and PSII activity, and had impaired chlorophyll degradation with high pheophorbide a levels. Comparison of the fruit proteomes with SL revealed retention of the proteome complement related to photosynthesis in SH. Targeted peptide monitoring revealed a low abundance of key carotenogenic and sequestration proteins in SH compared with tomato. The green-fruitedness of SH appears to stem from blocks at several critical steps regulating fruit-specific carotenogenesis namely the absence of chloroplast to chromoplast transformation, block in carotenoid biosynthesis, and a dearth of carotenoid sequestering proteins."

Weight was measured in round 1 and at each 5-year interval follow-up (round 2, 3 and 4). Weight change was defined as the absolute weight change between two consecutive measurements. The number of MetS components (assessed in round 2, 3 and 4) was based on the presence of the following components of the MetS: central obesity, raised blood pressure, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated glucose. Associations of weight change and the number of components of the MetS were analyzed with Generalized Estimating Equations for Poisson regression, stratified for 10-year age groups. For each age group, 1 kg weight gain was positively associated with the number of components of the MetS, independent of sex and measurement round. The association was stronger in 30-39 years (adjusted rate ratio: 1.044; 95%CI: 1.040-1.049) and smaller in older age groups. Compared to stable weight (>-2.5 kg and < 2.5 kg), weight loss (< or = -2.5 kg) and weight gain (> or =2.5 kg) was associated with a lower and higher rate ratio respectively, for the number of components of the MetS.

A machine-learning algorithm of random walks on graphs (operating within the supercomputing DreamLab platform) was used to simulate drug actions on human interactome networks to obtain genome-wide activity profiles of 1962 approved drugs (199 of which were classified as \"anti-cancer\" with their primary indications). A supervised approach was employed to predict cancer-beating molecules using these 'learned' interactome activity profiles.

This in turn was used to construct a 'food map' with anti-cancer potential of each ingredient defined by the number of cancer-beating molecules found therein.

Furthermore, physiological characteristics extracted from single-lead electrocardiogram, thoracic and abdominal respiration signal and tri-axial acceleration signal were studied to optimize the model. There were 29 healthy volunteers recruited for the study to collect data while stationary (lying, sitting, standing), walking, Bruce treadmill test and recuperating with SensEcho and the gas analyzer (Metalyzer 3B). The results show that the VO2 values estimated by the proposed model are in good agreement with the true values measured by the gas analyzer (R2 = 0.94 ± 0.03, n = 72,235), and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 1.83 ± 0.59 ml/kg/min. Compared with the estimation method using a separate heart rate as input, our method reduced MAE by 54.70%. At the same time, other factors affecting the performance of the model were studied, including the influence of different input signals, gender and movement intensity, which provided more enlightenment for the estimation of VO2. The results show that the proposed model based on cardio-pulmonary physiological signals as inputs can effectively improve the accuracy of instantaneous VO2 estimation in various scenarios of activities and was robust between different motion modes and state.

Unlike chimpanzees and bonobos, who are known to hunt smaller monkeys and eat them immediately, human foragers often cooperate to kill large animals and transport them to a safe location to be shared. While it is known that meat became an important part of the hominin diet around 2.6-2 Mya, whether intense cooperation and food sharing developed in conjunction with the regular intake of meat remains unresolved. A widespread assumption is that early hominins acquired animal protein through klepto-parasitism at felid kills. This should be testable by detecting felid-specific bone modifications and tooth marks on carcasses consumed by hominins. Here, deep learning (DL) computer vision was used to identify agency through the analysis of tooth pits and scores on bones recovered from the Early Pleistocene site of DS (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). We present the first objective evidence of primary access to meat by hominins 1.8 Mya by showing that the most common securely detectable bone-modifying fissipeds at the site were hyenas. The absence of felid modifications in most of the carcasses analyzed indicates that hominins were the primary consumers of most animals accumulated at the site, with hyenas intervening at the post-depositional stage. This underscores the role of hominins as a prominent part of the early Pleistocene African carnivore guild. It also stresses the major (and potentially regular) role that meat played in the diet that configured the emergence of early Homo."

The database includes the food description; median, minimum, and maximum values for the specific carotenoids in each food; the number of acceptable values and their references; and a confidence code, which is an indicator of the reliability of a specific carotenoid value for a food. The carotenoid database can be used to estimate the intake of specific carotenoids in order to examine the association between dietary carotenoids and disease incidence."

            "abstract": "Entertainment software developers face significant challenges in designing games with broad appeal. One of the challenges concerns creating nonplayer (computer-controlled) characters that can adapt their behavior in light of the current and prospective situation, possibly emulating human behaviors. This adaptation should be inherently novel, unrepeatable, yet within the bounds of realism. Evolutionary algorithms provide a suitable method for generating such behaviors. This paper provides background on the entertainment software industry, and details a prior and current effort to create a platform for evolving nonplayer characters with genetic and behavioral traits within a World War I combat flight simulator."

            "abstract": "Due to limited remote triage monitoring capabilities, combat medics cannot currently distinguish bleeding soldiers from those engaged in combat unless they have physical access to them. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-level physiological signals can be used to develop a machine-learning algorithm for tracking changes in central blood volume that will subsequently distinguish central hypovolemia from physical activity. Twenty-four subjects underwent central hypovolemia via lower body negative pressure (LBNP), and a supine-cycle exercise protocol. Exercise workloads were determined by matching heart rate responses from each LBNP level. Heart rate and stroke volume (SV) were measured via Finometer. ECG, heat flux, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and two-axis acceleration were obtained from an armband (SenseWear Pro2) and used to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict changes in SV as an index of central blood volume under both conditions. The algorithm SV was retrospectively compared against Finometer SV. A model was developed to determine whether unknown data points could be correctly classified into these two conditions using leave-one-out cross-validation. Algorithm vs. Finometer SV values were strongly correlated for LBNP in individual subjects (mean r = 0.92; range 0.75-0.98), but only moderately correlated for exercise (mean r = 0.50; range -0.23-0.87). From the first level of LBNP/exercise, the machine-learning algorithm was able to distinguish between LBNP and exercise with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all ≥90%). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm developed from low-level physiological signals could reliably distinguish central hypovolemia from exercise, indicating that this device could provide battlefield remote triage capabilities."

            "abstract": "Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills reflecting both-the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling."

Patients from the observational TOP registry were grouped based on those who had achieved (responders) and those who had not achieved (non-responders) their HBA1c target and/or FBG ≤110 mg/dL 12 months after IGlar-100 initiation. Independent predictors of treatment response were identified by regression analysis. Data for 2444 patients were analysed (responders, n = 1610; non-responders, n = 834). Although the IGlar-100 dose increase over 12 months was larger for non-responders (+12.83 vs +9.46 U/d; P < 0.0001), the corresponding decrease in HbA1c was smaller (-0.88% vs -1.57%). Independent predictors of response included lower BMI (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00), lower FBG (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98) and HbA1c values at baseline (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18-0.31), a less ambitious HbA1c target (OR, 5.07; 95% CI, 3.37-7.63) and bedtime administration of IGlar-100 (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14).

With the progress of biosensing technologies and artificial intelligence, it is feasible to apply wearable devices to continuously record teenagers' physiological signals and make analyses based on modern advanced methods. To solve the challenge that traditional methods of monitoring teenagers' physical fitness lack accurate computational models and in-depth data analyses, we propose a novel evaluation model for predicting the physical fitness of teenagers. First, we collected 1024 teenagers' PPGs under the guidance of the proposed three-stage running paradigm. Next, we applied the median filter and wavelet transform to denoise the original signals and obtain HR and SpO2. Then, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient method to finalize the feature set, based on the extracted nine physical features. Finally, we built a 1D-CNN with LSTM model to classify teenagers' physical fitness condition into four levels: excellent, good, medium, and poor, with an accuracy of 98.27% for boys' physical fitness prediction, and 99.26% for girls' physical fitness prediction. The experimental results provide evidence supporting the feasibility of predicting teenagers' physical fitness levels by their running PPG recordings."

Through urban design and planning, non-pharmaceutical interventions can be enabled, impelling behaviour change and facilitating the construction of lower risk buildings and public spaces. Computational tools, including computer simulation, statistical models, and artificial intelligence, have been used to support responses to the current pandemic as well as to the spread of previous infectious diseases. Our multidisciplinary research group systematically reviewed state-of-the-art literature to propose a toolkit that employs computational modelling for various interventions and urban design processes. We selected 109 out of 8,737 studies retrieved from databases and analysed them based on the pathogen type, transmission mode and phase, design intervention and process, as well as modelling methodology (method, goal, motivation, focus, and indication to urban design). We also explored the relationship between infectious disease and urban design, as well as computational modelling support, including specific models and parameters. The proposed toolkit will help designers, planners, and computer modellers to select relevant approaches for evaluating design decisions depending on the target disease, geographic context, design stages, and spatial and temporal scales. The findings herein can be regarded as stand-alone tools, particularly for fighting against COVID-19, or be incorporated into broader frameworks to help cities become more resilient to future disasters."

Studies of social media and diabetes have focused mostly on patients, or public agencies addressing it, but have not looked broadly at all of the participants or the diversity of content they contribute. We study Twitter conversations about diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million tweets collected over 8 months and the interactions between their authors. We address three questions. (1) What themes arise in these tweets? (2) Who are the most influential users? (3) Which type of users contribute to which themes? We answer these questions using a mixed-methods approach, integrating techniques from anthropology, network science and information retrieval such as thematic coding, temporal network analysis and community and topic detection. Diabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic groups: health information, news, social interaction and commercial. At the same time, humorous messages and references to popular culture appear consistently, more than any other type of tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal 'hub' and 'authority' scores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid over time, top authorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers, advocacy groups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without specific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest communities as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have implications for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use social media as an engagement tool and to inform policy design."

            "abstract": "A recent report from the European Sleep Research Society's task force \"Beyond AHI\" discussed an issue that has been a long-term subject of debate - what are the best metrics for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) diagnosis and treatment outcome assessments? In a similar way, sleep bruxism (SB) metrics have also been a recurrent issue for >30 years and there is still uncertainty in dentistry regarding their optimisation and clinical relevance. SB can occur alone or with comorbidities such as OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, insomnia, headache, orofacial pain, periodic limb movement, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder, and sleep epilepsy. Classically, the diagnosis of SB is based on the patient's dental and medical history and clinical manifestations; electromyography is used in research and for complex cases. The emergence of new technologies, such as sensors and artificial intelligence, has opened new opportunities. The main objective of the present review is to stimulate the creation of a collaborative taskforce on SB metrics. Several examples are available in sleep medicine. The development of more homogenised metrics could improve the accuracy and refinement of SB assessment, while moving forward toward a personalised approach. It is time to develop SB metrics that are relevant to clinical outcomes and benefit patients who suffer from one or more possible negative consequences of SB."

This systematic review aimed to identify studies that used ML algorithms to assess food intake in different populations. A literature search was conducted using five electronic databases, and 36 studies met all criteria and were included. According to the results, there has been a growing interest in the use of ML algorithms in the area of nutrition in recent years. Also, supervised learning algorithms were the most used, and the most widely used method of nutritional assessment was the food frequency questionnaire. We observed a trend in using the data analysis programs, such as R and WEKA. The use of ML in nutrition is recent and challenging. Therefore, it is encouraged that more studies are carried out relating these themes for the development of food reeducation programs and public policies."

The annual survivorship rate (about 65%) is the lowest measured for any species of Asclepias. Survivorship was strongly size-dependent but showed no clear relationship with previous history of fruit production. Non-flowering plants were significantly smaller than flowering plants and showed very strong (r > 0.87) correlations between root dry weight and stem or leaf dry weight. Flowering plants were similar to nonflowering plants in root: shoot ratio (approximately 1:1) but differed in that root dry weight was not strongly correlated with stem or leaf dry weight. Components of inflorescence size were strongly correlated within a given level of comparison (e.g., stems per plant with flowers per plant) but less strongly correlated between levels (e.g., stems per plant with flowers per stem). Number of fruits per plant and percentage fruit-set were positively correlated with every component of inflorescence size. Although overall fruit-set was low (about 2%), fruits that were initiated had a high probability of surviving to maturity. There was no evidence of an early period of high fruit abortion: a relatively constant proportion of fruits aborted between each age class."

In this study, we examined the relationship between mental health and addictive behaviors, such as excessive exercise and the use of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) across 12 sport disciplines. Materials and methods: A large cross-sectional sample of the adult population (N = 2,295) was surveyed. The mean age was 33.09 (SD = 11.40). The number of male participants was 668 (30.0%). The use of IPEDs was assessed in conjunction with psychometric measures such as the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI). The participants were grouped into activity group (AG) and non-activity group (NAG) according to the presence or absence of their exercise habits. The results were compared between these groups, as well as across sport disciplines, while taking into account the relationship between different psychological measures and IPEDs consumption. Results: The frequency of IPEDs use was higher among AG (34.6%) than NAG (14.6%), although AG participants reported less history of addictions (7.1%) than NAG (11.8%). The logistic regression analysis revealed that scores equal to or above cutoff points, in both the EAI and AAI, predicted the IPEDs use. Regarding the differences across the various sport disciplines, those who were involved in practicing Weight Lifting and Cross Fit were found to be more at risk of excessive exercising and more inclined to use a wide range of IPEDs. Conclusions: Although exercise could help to increase well-being and prevent addictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, our results show that those in the AG are particularly vulnerable to excessive IPEDs use. Sport disciplines associated with higher EAI and AAI scores have also shown a higher tendency to excessive IPEDs use. Furthermore, the factor of having above the cutoff scores in EAI or AAI in each sport could indicate larger IPEDs consumption regardless of the discipline. In light of the current findings, it is necessary to better define the \"non-excessive\" levels of exercise in various sport disciplines and an adequate intake of IPEDs to ensure the safety and well-being of people during a pandemic."

            "abstract": "Since the mid 1960s, researchers in computer science have famously referred to chess as the 'drosophila' of artificial intelligence (AI). What they seem to mean by this is that chess, like the common fruit fly, is an accessible, familiar, and relatively simple experimental technology that nonetheless can be used productively to produce valid knowledge about other, more complex systems. But for historians of science and technology, the analogy between chess and drosophila assumes a larger significance. As Robert Kohler has ably described, the decision to adopt drosophila as the organism of choice for genetics research had far-reaching implications for the development of 20th century biology. In a similar manner, the decision to focus on chess as the measure of both human and computer intelligence had important and unintended consequences for AL research. This paper explores the emergence of chess as an experimental technology, its significance in the developing research practices of the AI community, and the unique ways in which the decision to focus on chess shaped the program of AI research in the decade of the 1970s. More broadly, it attempts to open up the virtual black box of computer software--and of computer games in particular--to the scrutiny of historical and sociological analysis."

More recently, a wide variety of functions and physiologic variables, such as heart rate, hours of sleep, number of steps walked and movement, have been available through wristbands or watches. New data, hydration, geolocation, and barometric pressure, among others, will be incorporated in the future. All these parameters, when analyzed, can be helpful for patients and doctors' decision support. Similar new scenarios have appeared in most medical fields, in such a way that in recent years, there has been an increased interest in the development and application of the methods of artificial intelligence (AI) to decision support and knowledge acquisition. Multidisciplinary research teams integrated by computer engineers and doctors are more and more frequent, mirroring the need of cooperation in this new topic. AI, as a science, can be defined as the ability to make computers do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. Increasingly, diabetes-related journals have been incorporating publications focused on AI tools applied to diabetes. In summary, diabetes management scenarios have suffered a deep transformation that forces diabetologists to incorporate skills from new areas. This recently needed knowledge includes AI tools, which have become part of the diabetes health care.

However, for various reasons, including lack of ability to sufficiently monitor and influence behavior change, adherence to these health orders and recommendations has been suboptimal. Starting April 29, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home orders issued by various state governors, we conducted an intervention that sent online website and mobile application advertisements to people's mobile phones to encourage them to adhere to stay-at-home orders. Adherence to stay-at-home orders was monitored using individual-level cell phone mobility data, from April 29, 2020 through May 10, 2020. Mobile devices across 5 regions in the United States were randomly-assigned to either receive advertisements from our research team advising them to stay at home to stay safe (intervention group) or standard advertisements from other advertisers (control group). Compared to control group devices that received only standard corporate advertisements (i.e., did not receive public health advertisements to stay at home), the (intervention group) devices that received public health advertisements to stay at home demonstrated objectively-measured increased adherence to stay at home (i.e., smaller radius of gyration, average travel distance, and larger stay-at-home ratios). Results suggest that 1) it is feasible to use mobility data to assess efficacy of an online advertising intervention, and 2) online advertisements are a potentially effective method for increasing adherence to government/public health stay-at-home orders."

This paper presents the possibility of using oximetric, heart rate (HR), accelerometric, and global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) to analyse signals recorded during uphill and downhill walking without and with a face mask to find its influence on physiological functions during selected walking patterns. The experimental dataset includes 86 signal segments acquired under different conditions. The proposed methodology is based on signal analysis in both the time and frequency domains. The results indicate that face mask use has a minimal effect on blood oxygen concentration and heart rate, with the average mean changes of these parameters being less than 2%. The support vector machine, a Bayesian method, the k -nearest neighbour method, and a two-layer neural network showed very good separation abilities and successfully classified different walking patterns only in the case when the effect of face mask wearing was not included in the classification process. Our methodology suggests that artificial intelligence and machine learning tools are efficient methods for the assessment of motion patterns in different motion conditions and that face masks have a negligible effect for short-duration experiments."

Current 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography prototype software is limited to exploration of the mitral and aortic valves exclusively. Thus, newer analytical software is required for dynamic geometric analysis of the TV morphology for remodeling. This article presents a preliminary experience with novel artificial intelligence-based semiautomated software for TV analysis. The software offers high correlation to surgical inspection by its ability to analyze morphology and dynamics of the valve throughout the cardiac cycle. In addition, it allows higher reproducibility of data analysis and reduces interobserver variability with minimal need for manual intervention. Integration of interactivity through preprocedural placement of specific devices of different sizes and shapes in the mitral and aortic positions facilitates prognostic evaluation of surgical and interventional procedures."

We compared pollinators in a population of Asclepias incarnata (Apocynaceae) for several components of pollinator effectiveness over two flowering seasons to evaluate their importance to plant reproduction. Insects of the order Hymenoptera predominate in A. incarnata pollination, but there appears to be no specialization for pollination within this order. Pollinators varied significantly in nearly every component of effectiveness that we measured, including pollen load, removal and deposition of pollen, pollination efficiency (deposition/removal), flower-handling time, and potential for geitonogamy (fractional pollen deposition). The visitation rate of pollinators also varied significantly between years and through time within years. Pollination success and percentage fruit-set of unmanipulated plants in the population also varied significantly between years, and pollination success varied among sample times within years. Most components of effectiveness were weakly correlated, suggesting that the contributions of visitor species toward pollination varied among effectiveness components. Mean flower-handling time, however, was strongly correlated with several components, including pollen removal and deposition, pollination efficiency, and fractional pollen deposition. These findings highlight the significance of pollination variability for plant reproduction and suggest that time-dependent foraging behaviors may play an important role in determining pollinator effectiveness."

Traditional monitoring techniques for mites are time-consuming, difficult, subjective, and result in a time lag. In this study, the method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm extreme learning machine for estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD) under leaf mite infestation in jujube was proposed. Initially, image data and SPAD values for jujube orchards under four severities of leaf mite infestation were collected for analysis. Six vegetation indices and SPAD value were chosen for correlation analysis to establish the estimation model for SPAD and the vegetation indices. To address the influence of colinearity between spectral bands, the feature band with the highest correlation coefficient was retrieved first using the successive projection algorithm. In the modeling process, the PSO correlation coefficient was initialized with the convergent optimal approximation of the fitness function value; the root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted and measured values was derived as an indicator of PSO goodness-of-fit to solve the problems of ELM model weights, threshold randomness, and uncertainty of network parameters; and finally, an iterative update method was used to determine the particle fitness value to optimize the minimum error or iteration number. The results reflected that significant differences were observed in the spectral reflectance of the jujube canopy corresponding with the severity of leaf mite infestation, and the infestation severity was negatively correlated with the SPAD value of jujube leaves. The selected vegetation indices NDVI, RVI, PhRI, and MCARI were positively correlated with SPAD, whereas TCARI and GI were negatively correlated with SPAD. The accuracy of the optimized PSO-ELM model (R 2 = 0.856, RMSE = 0.796) was superior to that of the ELM model alone (R 2 = 0.748, RMSE = 1.689). The PSO-ELM model for remote sensing estimation of relative leaf chlorophyll content of jujube shows high fault tolerance and improved data-processing efficiency. The results provide a reference for the utility of UAV remote sensing for monitoring leaf mite infestation of jujube."

The only study to date that investigated the activity of FPC neurons in monkeys performing a cognitive task suggested that these cells were involved in the monitoring of self-generated actions. We recorded the activity of neurons in the FPCs of two rhesus monkeys while they performed a social variant of a nonmatch-to-goal task that required monitoring the actions of a human or computer agent. We discovered that the role of FPC neurons extends beyond self-generated actions to include monitoring others' actions. Their monitoring activity was very specific. First, neurons in the FPC encoded the spatial position of the target but not its object features. Second, a dedicated representation of the human agent actions was tied to the time of target acquisition, while it was reduced or absent in the successive epochs of the trial. Finally, this other-specific neural substrate did not emerge during the interaction with a virtual agent such as the computer.

            "abstract": "NAC transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of expressional reprogramming during plant development, stress responses, and leaf senescence. NAC TFs also play important roles in fruit ripening. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), one of the best characterized NACs involved in fruit ripening is NON-RIPENING (NOR), and the non-ripening (nor) mutation has been widely used to extend fruit shelf life in elite varieties. Here, we show that NOR additionally controls leaf senescence. Expression of NOR increases with leaf age, and developmental as well as dark-induced senescence are delayed in the nor mutant, while overexpression of NOR promotes leaf senescence. Genes associated with chlorophyll degradation as well as senescence-associated genes (SAGs) show reduced and elevated expression, respectively, in nor mutants and NOR overexpressors. Overexpression of NOR also stimulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. In tomato, NOR supports senescence by directly and positively regulating the expression of several senescence-associated genes including, besides others, SlSAG15 and SlSAG113, SlSGR1, and SlYLS4. Finally, we find that another senescence control NAC TF, namely SlNAP2, acts upstream of NOR to regulate its expression. Our data support a model whereby NAC TFs have often been recruited by higher plants for both the control of leaf senescence and fruit ripening."

            "abstract": "Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in model plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. However, the presence of lncRNAs and how they function in fleshy fruit ripening are still largely unknown because fleshy fruit ripening is not present in the above model plants. Tomato is the model system for fruit ripening studies due to its dramatic ripening process. To investigate further the role of lncRNAs in fruit ripening, it is necessary and urgent to discover and identify novel lncRNAs and understand the function of lncRNAs in tomato fruit ripening. Here it is reported that 3679 lncRNAs were discovered from wild-type tomato and ripening mutant fruit. The lncRNAs are transcribed from all tomato chromosomes, 85.1% of which came from intergenic regions. Tomato lncRNAs are shorter and have fewer exons than protein-coding genes, a situation reminiscent of lncRNAs from other model plants. It was also observed that 490 lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated in ripening mutant fruits, and 187 lncRNAs were down-regulated, indicating that lncRNAs could be involved in the regulation of fruit ripening. In line with this, silencing of two novel tomato intergenic lncRNAs, lncRNA1459 and lncRNA1840, resulted in an obvious delay of ripening of wild-type fruit. Overall, the results indicated that lncRNAs might be essential regulators of tomato fruit ripening, which sheds new light on the regulation of fruit ripening."

We previously characterized differences between the two cultivars. Here, we identified key sugar metabolic pathways. Pearson coefficient correlations of metabolomics and transcriptomic data and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data allowed the identification of 11 key sugar metabolism-associated genes: sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase, cytosolic invertase, vacuolar invertase, invertase inhibitor, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, galactokinase, trehalase, galactinol synthase, and raffinose synthase. These pathways were further assessed and validated through the biochemical characterization of the gene products and with metabolite analysis. Our results demonstrated the reprogramming of sugar metabolism in both leaves and fruits in the non-climacteric plum, which displayed a shift towards increased sorbitol synthesis. Climacteric and non-climacteric fruits showed differences in their UDP-galactose metabolism towards the production of galactose and raffinose, respectively. The higher content of galactinol, myo-inositol, raffinose, and trehalose in the non-climacteric fruits could improve the ability of the fruits to cope with the oxidative processes associated with fruit ripening. Overall, our results support a relationship between sugar metabolism, ethylene, and ripening behavior."

Occupational therapy can help patients relieve symptoms and restore social function, reduce disease recurrence, and improve the reemployment rate and the overall health level of patients. In order to deeply excavate the inner connection between the mental health status and physical exercise status of college students, the physical exercise behavior of college students during home isolation is studied. First, the \"physical exercise behavior questionnaire\" and \"symptom self-assessment scale\" were used to investigate the physical exercise behavior and mental health status of college students. Second, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, independent sample t-test, and variance analysis were carried out on the survey results using mathematical statistics methods and big data technology. The survey results show high reliability, and the Cronbach's α coefficients were all greater than 0.9. There was a positive correlation between physical exercise methods and mental health in general, and the difference in the degree of exercise is significantly different from the mental health of students (p < 0.05). With the increase of exercise intensity, the score of \"symptom self-assessment scale\" first decreased and then increased, and the exercise intensity of medium and high intensity showed the best psychological state. And the correlation dimension of depression was the highest. This indicated that the students who liked family physical exercise were less likely to suffer from depression. In addition, depression was the most relevant dimension with self demand physical exercise, and interpersonal sensitivity was the most relevant dimension with social expansion physical exercise. The conclusion shows that the more active the students participate in family physical exercise, the healthier their mental state is. Occupational therapy has obvious curative effect on depression, which can improve patients' negative symptoms, their living ability, and social function. Meanwhile, analyzing data through big data technology reduces human workload and improves data processing efficiency and accuracy. The scheme proposed here provides some ideas for the application of big data technology in occupational therapy."

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems consisting of treatment algorithms calibrated through large datasets of patient specific information may offer a solution. Such a system can predict BG level changes resulting from regimen disturbances and recommend regimen changes for compensation. A software prototype based on neural network, fuzzy logic, and expert system concepts was developed and evaluated to determine feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific prediction model. BG data are the primary driver for adapting existing functions to patient specific prediction algorithms. Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) between actual and predicted BG values from inputs of daily insulin, food, and exercise information for an T1DM test subject was 10.5% using a calibrated model. The prototype is limited by the requirement for a rigid testing schedule, human error and situational circumstances such as alcohol consumption, illness, infection, stress, and significant hormonal imbalances. No significant conclusions regarding model validity can be drawn due to limited evaluation process and subject sample size, although the prototype has demonstrated viability as a learning tool for diabetes patients.

For instance, game agents may need to gather resources, attack opponents, and defend against attacks. Learning algorithms can thus benefit from having separate policies for these tasks, and from knowing when each one is appropriate. How well this approach works depends on how tightly coupled the tasks are. Three cases are identified: Isolated tasks have distinct semantics and do not interact, interleaved tasks have distinct semantics but do interact, and blended tasks have regions where semantics from multiple tasks overlap. Learning across multiple tasks is studied in this article with Modular Multiobjective NEAT, a neuroevolution framework applied to three variants of the challenging Ms. Pac-Man video game. In the standard blended version of the game, a surprising, highly effective machine-discovered task division surpasses human-specified divisions, achieving the best scores to date in this game. In isolated and interleaved versions of the game, human-specified task divisions are also successful, though the best scores are surprisingly still achieved by machine discovery. Modular neuroevolution is thus shown to be capable of finding useful, unexpected task divisions better than those apparent to a human designer."

In recent years, there have been major advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating ethylene synthesis and action. Screening for mutants of the triple response phenotype of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings, together with map-based cloning and candidate gene characterization of natural mutants from other plant species, has led to the identification of many new genes for ethylene biosynthesis, signal transduction, and response pathways. The simple chemical nature of ethylene contrasts with its regulatory complexity. This is illustrated by the multiplicity of genes encoding the key ethylene biosynthesis enzymes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and ACC oxidase, multiple ethylene receptors and signal transduction components, and the complexity of regulatory steps involving signalling relays and control of mRNA and protein synthesis and turnover. In addition, there are extensive interactions with other hormones.

As such, the aim of this qualitative study is 1) to explore the expectations of obese children and their parents in relation to lifestyle interventions; 2) to identify barriers to making lifestyle changes that parents and children face within their social context (within the family, at school and amongst friends and peers) as well as the things that facilitate these changes and 3) to identify the needs of obese children and their parents in the context of a lifestyle intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted. Interviewees were participants in a lifestyle intervention program in the Netherlands.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighteen children (mean age 10 years) and 24 parents were interviewed. The respondents expected to lose weight by being physically active or by eating healthily. Parents struggled with adopting and adhering to new rules and the absence of support of family members. Children struggled with inconsistent parenting and a lack of support from their parents. Bullying experienced at school impeded the children in their ability to make the necessary changes. Support from peers, on the other hand, stimulated their progress. Parents identified the need for the general practitioner to discuss overweight in a non-offensive way and to show an interest in the process of weight loss.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Participants in a lifestyle behavior intervention program benefit from parental support and help from their (extended) family, peers and friends.

            "abstract": "Maturity degree and quality evaluation are important for strawberry harvest, trade, and consumption. Deep learning has been an efficient artificial intelligence tool for food and agro-products. Hyperspectral imaging coupled with deep learning was applied to determine the maturity degree and soluble solids content (SSC) of strawberries with four maturity degrees. Hyperspectral image of each strawberry was obtained and preprocessed, and the spectra were extracted from the images. One-dimension residual neural network (1D ResNet) and three-dimension (3D) ResNet were built using 1D spectra and 3D hyperspectral image as inputs for maturity degree evaluation. Good performances were obtained for maturity identification, with the classification accuracy over 84% for both 1D ResNet and 3D ResNet. The corresponding saliency maps showed that the pigments related wavelengths and image regions contributed more to the maturity identification. For SSC determination, 1D ResNet model was also built, with the determination of coefficient (R 2) over 0.55 of the training, validation, and testing sets. The saliency maps of 1D ResNet for the SSC determination were also explored. The overall results showed that deep learning could be used to identify strawberry maturity degree and determine SSC. More efforts were needed to explore the use of 3D deep learning methods for the SSC determination. The close results of 1D ResNet and 3D ResNet for classification indicated that more samples might be used to improve the performances of 3D ResNet. The results in this study would help to develop 1D and 3D deep learning models for fruit quality inspection and other researches using hyperspectral imaging, providing efficient analysis approaches of fruit quality inspection using hyperspectral imaging."

            "abstract": "The genetic background of transplants used to create or augment wild populations may affect the long-term success of restored populations. If seed sources are from differently adapted populations, then the relative performance of progeny from crosses among populations may decrease with an increase in genetic differences of parents and in the differences of parental environments to the transplant location. We evaluated the potential for such outbreeding depression by hybridizing individuals from six different populations of Lotus scoparius var. scoparius and L. s. var. brevialatus. We used allozyme data to calculate genetic distances between source populations, and compiled climatic data and measured soil traits to estimate environmental distances between source populations. We found significant outbreeding depression following controlled crosses. In the greenhouse, the success of crosses (seeds/flower × seedlings/seed) decreased with increasing genetic distance between populations revealing genetically based outbreeding depression unrelated to local adaptation. After outplanting to one native site (in situ common garden), field cumulative fitness of progeny (survival × fruit production) decreased significantly with mean environmental distance of the parental populations to the transplant site, but not with genetic distance between the crossed populations. This result is consistent with a disruption of local adaptation. At the second, ecologically contrasting common garden, where low survival reduced statistical power, field cumulative fitness (survival × progeny height) did not decrease significantly with either environmental distance or genetic distance. Overall, intervariety crosses were 40 and 50% as fit (seeds/flower × seedlings/seed × survival × fruits at the first garden or × height at the second) as intravariety crosses. These results suggest that the cumulative outbreeding depression was caused by a combination of genetically based ecological differences among populations and other genomic coadaptation. We conclude that mixing genetically differentiated seed sources of Lotus scoparius may significantly lower the fitness of augmented or restored populations. Genetic and environmental similarities of source populations relative to the transplant site should be considered when choosing source materials, a practice recommended by recent seed transfer policies. Geographic separation was not a good surrogate for either of these measures."

            "abstract": "Sleep disorder has been portrayed as merely a common dissatisfaction with sleep quality and quantity. However, sleep disorder is actually a medical condition characterized by inconsistent sleep patterns that interfere with emotional dynamics, cognitive functioning, and even physical performance. This is consistent with sleep abnormalities being more common in patients with autonomic dysfunction than in the general population. The autonomic nervous system coordinates various visceral functions ranging from respiration to neuroendocrine secretion in order to maintain homeostasis of the body. Because the cell population and efferent signals involved in autonomic regulation are spatially adjacent to those that regulate the sleep-wake system, sleep architecture and autonomic coordination exert effects on each other, suggesting the presence of a bidirectional relationship in addition to shared pathology. The primary goal of this review is to highlight the bidirectional and shared relationship between sleep and autonomic regulation. It also introduces the effects of autonomic dysfunction on insomnia, breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, parasomnias, and movement disorders. This information will assist clinicians in determining how neuromodulation can have the greatest therapeutic effects in patients with sleep disorders."

            "abstract": "Carotenoids in citrus contribute to the quality of the fruit, but the mechanism of its transcriptional regulation is fairly unknown. Here, we characterized a citrus FRUITFULL sub-clade MADS gene, CsMADS5, that was ripening-inducible and acted as a nucleus-localized trans-activator. Transient overexpression of CsMADS5 in citrus induced fruit coloration and enhanced carotenoid concentrations. The expression of carotenogenic genes including phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), and lycopene β-cyclase 1 (LCYb1) was increased in the peels of fruits overexpressing CsMADS5. Similar results were observed from stable overexpression of CsMADS5 in tomato fruits and citrus calli, even though the effect of CsMADS5 on carotenoid metabolism in transgenic citrus calli was limited. Further biochemical analyses demonstrated that CsMADS5 activated the transcription of PSY, PDS, and LCYb1 by directly binding to their promoters. We concluded that CsMADS5 positively regulates carotenoid biosynthesis in fruits by directly activating the transcription of carotenogenic genes. Moreover, CsMADS5 physically interacted with a positive regulator CsMADS6, indicating that CsMADS5 may form an enhancer complex with CsMADS6 to synergistically promote carotenoid accumulation. These findings expand our understanding of the complex transcriptional regulatory hierarchy of carotenoid biosynthesis during fruit ripening."

Recently, as interest in digital therapeutics has increased, the field of sleep engineering demands a technology that helps people obtain quality sleep that goes beyond the level of monitoring. In particular, interest in sleep aids for people with or without insomnia but who cannot fall asleep easily at night is increasing. In this review, we discuss experiments that have tested the sleep-inducing effects of various auditory stimuli currently used for sleep-inducing purposes. The auditory stimulations were divided into (1) colored noises such as white noise and pink noise, (2) autonomous sensory meridian response sounds such as natural sounds such as rain and firewood burning, sounds of whispers, or rubbing various objects with a brush, and (3) classical music or a preferred type of music. For now, the current clinical method of receiving drugs or cognitive behavioral therapy to induce sleep is expected to dominate.

This dataset includes different types of foods from 170 countries around the world as well as obesity, undernutrition, death, and COVID-19 data as percentages of the total population.

Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players."

            "abstract": "The radial disposition of air in the flesh of fruit of Malus domestica Borkh., cv 'Braeburn' was investigated using a gravimetric technique based on Archimedes' principle. Intercellular air volume was measured by weighing a small tissue sample under water before and after vacuum infiltration to remove the air. In a separate procedure, the volume of the same sample was measured by recording the buoyant upthrust experienced by it when fully immersed in water. The method underestimates tissue air volume due to a slight invasion of the intercellular air spaces around the edges of the sample when it is immersed in water. To correct for this error, an adjustment factor was made based upon an analysis of a series of measurements of air volume in samples of different dimensions. In 'Braeburn' there is a gradient of declining air content from just beneath the skin to the centre of the fruit with a sharp discontinuity at the core line. Cell shape and cell packing were observed in the surface layers of freshly excised and stained flesh samples using a dissecting microscope coupled to a video camera and a PC running proprietary software. Tissue organization changed with distance below the skin. It is speculated that reduced internal gas movement, due to the tightly packed tissue of 'Braeburn' and to the potential diffusion barrier at the core line between the cortex and the pith, may increase susceptibility of the flesh to disorders associated with tissue browning and breakdown."

Usually, conversation is the dominant pastime in a bar, but this may take place during other activities, like watching TV or playing games. These activities may inhibit drinking because of the physical difficulties of drinking and being active at the same time. Findings of an observational study on drinking in young adults (N=238) in a bar lab will be discussed. In the present study, we followed the ad-lib drinking of peer groups (7-9 persons) during 1-h periods. The results suggest that (1) selection of activities is not related to initial drinking level or personality characteristics; (2) active pastime is related to slower drinking than passive pastime (in males); (3) male problem drinkers appear to compensate for the \"lost\" amount of drinking after an active phase; and (4) involvement in active pastime is not related to total alcohol consumption.

RPMC, attitude, intention, and anticipated regret regarding RPMC were measured three times: before the two-week messaging intervention (baseline), immediately after the intervention (post intervention) and two months thereafter (follow up). RPMC was also measured through food diaries, completed for two weeks after the intervention. Compared to the control condition, participants exposed to emotional messages reduced RPMC at follow up, while this was not the case for participants exposed to informational messages.

However, evidence for leptin dysregulation in major depressive disorder (MDD) is conflicting. Inconclusive findings may be attributable to heterogeneity of MDD, aggregating biologically different subtypes. We examined the relationship of leptin with MDD, its common subtypes (typical and atypical), and clinical features.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The sample consisted of participants (aged 18 to 65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with current (n = 1062) or remitted (n = 711) MDD and healthy control subjects (n = 497).

This association was stronger for increasing adiposity levels (leptin by body mass index interaction, p < .02), strengthening the hypothesis of the involvement of leptin resistance. No association with leptin was found for overall MDD or the typical subtype. Among currently depressed patients, higher leptin was associated with key symptoms identifying the atypical subtype, such as hyperphagia, increased weight, and leaden paralysis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Leptin dysregulation (resistance) may represent an underlying mechanism connecting obesity and MDD with atypical features.

            "abstract": "The initial increases in force production with resistance training are thought to be primarily underpinned by neural adaptations. This notion is firmly supported by evidence displaying motor unit adaptations following resistance training; however, the precise locus of neural adaptation remains elusive. The purpose of this review is to clarify and critically discuss the literature concerning the site(s) of putative neural adaptations to short-term resistance training. The proliferation of studies employing non-invasive stimulation techniques to investigate evoked responses have yielded variable results, but generally support the notion that resistance training alters intracortical inhibition. Nevertheless, methodological inconsistencies and the limitations of techniques, e.g. limited relation to behavioural outcomes and the inability to measure volitional muscle activity, preclude firm conclusions. Much of the literature has focused on the corticospinal tract; however, preliminary research in non-human primates suggests reticulospinal tract is a potential substrate for neural adaptations to resistance training, though human data is lacking due to methodological constraints. Recent advances in technology have provided substantial evidence of adaptations within a large motor unit population following resistance training. However, their activity represents the transformation of afferent and efferent inputs, making it challenging to establish the source of adaptation. Whilst much has been learned about the nature of neural adaptations to resistance training, the puzzle remains to be solved. Additional analyses of motoneuron firing during different training regimes or coupling with other methodologies (e.g., electroencephalography) may facilitate the estimation of the site(s) of neural adaptations to resistance training in the future."

These differences underlie variable levels of investment in protection, subtle modifications to symmetry, herkogamic effects and independent androecium and gynoecium variation, producing a wide spectrum of floral display and contributing to fluctuations in fitness. During Eugenia's bud development, the hypanthium (as defined here) is completely covered by stamen primordia, unusual in other Myrtaceae. This is the likely plesiomorphic state for Myrteae and may have represented a key evolutionary novelty in the tribe.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Floral evolution in Eugenia depends on heterochronic patterns rather than changes in complexity to promote flexibility in floral strategies. The successful early establishment of Myrteae, previously mainly linked to the key innovation of fleshy fruit, may also have benefitted from changes in flower structure."

Personalized coaching may increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it is challenging to deliver personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m2. The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an average of 3618.2 steps/day; the net gain in this arm was significantly greater [net difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483-5655), P value <0.001] compared to control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11-4310), P value 0.049] compared to SmartText. In conclusion, AI-based voice-assisted coaching shows promise as a practical method of delivering scalable, individualized coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer survivors. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings in a broader population of cancer survivors and to investigate the effects of these interventions in the general population.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03212079, July 11, 2017, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03212079 ."

Fruit-set in these types of plants depends largely on the balance between source (assimilate supply) and sink strength (assimilate demand) within the plant. This study aims to evaluate the ability of functional-structural plant models to simulate different fruit-set patterns among Capsicum cultivars through source-sink relationships.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A greenhouse experiment of six Capsicum cultivars characterized with different fruit weight and fruit-set was conducted. Fruit-set patterns and potential fruit sink strength were determined through measurement. Source and sink strength of other organs were determined via the GREENLAB model, with a description of plant organ weight and dimensions according to plant topological structure established from the measured data as inputs. Parameter optimization was determined using a generalized least squares method for the entire growth cycle.\n    \n\n\n          Key results and conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Fruit sink strength differed among cultivars. Vegetative sink strength was generally lower for large-fruited cultivars than for small-fruited ones. The larger the size of the fruit, the larger variation there was in fruit-set and fruit yield. Large-fruited cultivars need a higher source-sink ratio for fruit-set, which means higher demand for assimilates. Temporal heterogeneity of fruit-set affected both number and yield of fruit. The simulation study showed that reducing heterogeneity of fruit-set was obtained by different approaches: for example, increasing source strength; decreasing vegetative sink strength, source-sink ratio for fruit-set and flower appearance rate; and harvesting individual fruits earlier before full ripeness. Simulation results showed that, when we increased source strength or decreased vegetative sink strength, fruit-set and fruit weight increased. However, no significant differences were found between large-fruited and small-fruited groups of cultivars regarding the effects of source and vegetative sink strength on fruit-set and fruit weight. When the source-sink ratio at fruit-set decreased, the number of fruit retained on the plant increased competition for assimilates with vegetative organs. Therefore, total plant and vegetative dry weights decreased, especially for large-fruited cultivars. Optimization study showed that temporal heterogeneity of fruit-set and ripening was predicted to be reduced when fruits were harvested earlier. Furthermore, there was a 20 % increase in the number of extra fruit set."

The reliability of the gold standard methodology (i.e. expert visual inspection) feeds into the debate and several authors call for more objective automatic methods to be used in the clinical practice. In this study, we present a framework based on a collaborative approach, where a web-application was used to crowd-source a large number (1245) of CPET data of individuals with different aerobic fitness. The resulting database was used to train and test an artificial intelligence (i.e. a convolutional neural network) algorithm. This automatic classifier is currently implemented in another web-application and was used to detect the ventilatory thresholds in the available CPET. A total of 206 CPET were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimations against the expert opinions. The neural network was able to detect the ventilatory thresholds with an average mean absolute error of 178 (198) mlO2/min (11.1%, r = 0.97) and 144 (149) mlO2/min (6.1%, r = 0.99), for VT1 and VT2 respectively. The performance of the neural network in detecting VT1 deteriorated in case of individuals with poor aerobic fitness. Our results suggest the potential for a collective intelligence system to outperform isolated experts in ventilatory thresholds detection. However, the inclusion of a larger number of VT1 examples certified by a community of experts will be likely needed before the abilities of this collective intelligence can be translated into the clinical use of CPET."

            "abstract": "Most consumers are aware that climate change is a growing problem and admit that action is needed. However, research shows that consumers' behavior often does not conform to their value and orientations. This value-behavior gap is due to contextual factors such as price, product design, and social norms as well as individual factors such as personal and hedonic values, environmental beliefs, and the workload capacity an individual can handle. Because of this conflict of interest, consumers have a hard time identifying the true drivers of their behavior, as they are either unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge the processes at play. Therefore, consumer neuroscience methods might provide a valuable tool to uncover the implicit measurements of pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Several studies have already defined neurophysiological differences between green and non-green individuals; however, a behavior change intervention must be developed to motivate PEB among consumers. Motivating behavior with reward or punishment will most likely get users engaged in climate change action via brain structures related to the reward system, such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and (pre)frontal cortex, where the reward information and subsequent affective responses are encoded. The intensity of the reward experience can be increased when the consumer is consciously considering the action to achieve it. This makes goal-directed behavior the potential aim of behavior change interventions. This article provides an extensive review of the neuroscientific evidence for consumer attitude, behavior, and decision-making processes in the light of sustainability incentives for behavior change interventions. Based on this review, we aim to unite the current theories and provide future research directions to exploit the power of affective conditioning and neuroscience methods for promoting PEB engagement."

The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists of minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses a discrete weighted p-Dirichlet energy and an approximation one. This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted p-Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree p of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter. It works with equal ease on regular 2-D and 3-D images, manifolds or any data.

            "abstract": "A key problem in spoken language identification (LID) is to design effective representations which are specific to language information. For example, in recent years, representations based on both phonotactic and acoustic features have proven their effectiveness for LID. Although advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements, LID performance is still lacking, especially for short duration speech utterances. With the hypothesis that language information is weak and represented only latently in speech, and is largely dependent on the statistical properties of the speech content, existing representations may be insufficient. Furthermore they may be susceptible to the variations caused by different speakers, specific content of the speech segments, and background noise. To address this, we propose using Deep Bottleneck Features (DBF) for spoken LID, motivated by the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in speech recognition. We show that DBFs can form a low-dimensional compact representation of the original inputs with a powerful descriptive and discriminative capability. To evaluate the effectiveness of this, we design two acoustic models, termed DBF-TV and parallel DBF-TV (PDBF-TV), using a DBF based i-vector representation for each speech utterance. Results on NIST language recognition evaluation 2009 (LRE09) show significant improvements over state-of-the-art systems. By fusing the output of phonotactic and acoustic approaches, we achieve an EER of 1.08%, 1.89% and 7.01% for 30 s, 10 s and 3 s test utterances respectively. Furthermore, various DBF configurations have been extensively evaluated, and an optimal system proposed."

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      Natural variation in fruit and seed set may be explained by factors that affect the composition of pollen grains on stigmas. Self-incompatible species require compatible outcross pollen grains to produce seeds. The siring success of outcross pollen grains, however, can be hindered if self (or other incompatible) pollen grains co-occur on stigmas. This study identifies factors that determine fruit set in Phlox hirsuta, a self-sterile endangered species that is prone to self-pollination, and its associated fitness costs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Multiple linear regressions were used to identify factors that explain variation in percentage fruit set within three of the five known populations of this endangered species. Florivorous beetle density, petal colour, floral display size, local conspecific density and pre-dispersal seed predation were quantified and their effects on the ability of flowers to produce fruits were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      In all three populations, percentage fruit set decreased as florivorous beetle density increased and as floral display size increased. The effect of floral display size on fruit set, however, often depended on the density of nearby conspecific plants. High local conspecific densities offset - even reversed - the negative effects of floral display size on percentage fruit set. Seed predation by mammals decreased fruit set in one population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results indicate that seed production in P. hirsuta can be maximized by selectively augmenting populations in areas containing isolated large plants, by reducing the population sizes of florivorous beetles and by excluding mammals that consume unripe fruits."

This volume is organized thematically into six topical domains that parallel the major subspecialty areas of contemporary clinical sleep neurology practice, as well as novel directions and opportunities. The issue begins with an overview of the central disorders of hypersomnolence, including narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and other hypersomnia disorders, and the related use of the entire broad range of stimulant and wake-promoting pharmacotherapies. Next, the range of behavioral therapies, application of light and light restriction and melatonin therapies, and hypnotic pharmacotherapies useful in insomnia and circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders are reviewed, followed by an overview of treatment options for sleep-related breathing disorders including positive airway pressure and the novel approach of hypoglossal neurostimulation for obstructive sleep apnea. The parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders, including NREM disorders of arousal, REM parasomnias (nightmares and isolated sleep paralysis and idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome are then discussed, and the applications of sleep neurotherapeutics in sleep and neurological disease are reviewed, including neurodevelopmental, epileptic, autoimmune encephalopathies, and neurodegenerative diseases. Last, the novel directions and opportunities in sleep neurology offered by cannabinoid therapies and machine learning/artificial intelligence methodology conclude this comprehensive survey of contemporary sleep neurology. We hope that you find this volume to be a useful and inspirational support tool for the work that matters most, your care of all our sleep neurology patients in the clinics."

            "abstract": "One-seventh of the world's adult population, or approximately one billion people, are estimated to have OSA. Over the past four decades, obesity, the main risk factor for OSA, has risen in striking proportion worldwide. In the past 5 years, the WHO estimates global obesity to affect almost two billion adults. A second major risk factor for OSA is advanced age. As the prevalence of the ageing population and obesity increases, the vulnerability towards having OSA increases. In addition to these traditional OSA risk factors, studies of the global population reveal select contributing features and phenotypes, including extreme phenotypes and symptom clusters that deserve further examination. Untreated OSA is associated with significant comorbidities and mortality. These represent a tremendous threat to the individual and global health. Beyond the personal toll, the economic costs of OSA are far-reaching, affecting the individual, family and society directly and indirectly, in terms of productivity and public safety. A better understanding of the pathophysiology, individual and ethnic similarities and differences is needed to better facilitate management of this chronic disease. In some countries, measures of the OSA disease burden are sparse. As the global burden of OSA and its associated comorbidities are projected to further increase, the infrastructure to diagnose and manage OSA will need to adapt. The use of novel approaches (electronic health records and artificial intelligence) to stratify risk, diagnose and affect treatment are necessary. Together, a unified multi-disciplinary, multi-organizational, global approach will be needed to manage this disease."

            "abstract": "In the last decade, rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L., Sapindaceae) and pulasan (N. mutabile Blume) have been cultivated in Honduras to produce exotic fruits for export to North America (2). Recently, a disease was observed that produces dark brown to black fissured cankers from 1 to 3 cm long and 1 to 4 cm wide. The infected bark tissue becomes swollen with the middle region 3 to 8 mm thick. Symptoms appear when the trees are approximately 3 years old. As the trees mature, the cankers increase in size and weaken the branches, often resulting in breakage with the weight of the fruit causing substantial plant damage and fruit loss. In August 2010, fissured branch samples of rambutan and pulasan were collected from 6- to 8-year-old trees from the Humid Tropical Demonstrative Agroforestry Center in Honduras, Atlantida, La Masica (15°33'47.4″N, 87°05'2.5″W, elevation 106 m). A fungus associated with the cankers was identified as Dolabra nepheliae. It produces black, stipitate, elongate ascomata, 312 to 482 × 250 to 281 μm with broadly cylindric, bitunicate asci, 120 to 138 × 11.2 to 15.0 μm, and filiform, hyaline ascospores, 128 to 135 × 2.8 to 3.2 μm. Fungi from rambutan and pulasan were isolated on cornmeal agar plus 0.5% dextrose and antibiotics. On potato dextrose agar, the ascospores produced slow-growing colonies, 5 mm per week. In culture, isolates from both hosts produced pycnidia with elongated, slightly to strongly curved or S-shaped, hyaline conidia, 22.8 to 46.4 × 2.8 to 3.7 μm. This fungus was first reported on rambutan and pulasan from Malaysia (1,4), and later reported on rambutan and litchi in Hawaii and Puerto Rico (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of D. nepheliae on pulasan and rambutan from Honduras. Specimens have been deposited at the U.S. National Fungus Collections (BPI 882442 on N. lappaceum and BPI 882443 on N. mutabile). Cultures were deposited at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) as CBS 131490 on N. lappaceum and CBS 131491 on N. mutabile. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 intergenic spacers were deposited in GenBank (Accession No. JQ004281 on N. lappaceum and Accession No. JQ004280 on N. mutabile). A BLAST search and pairwise comparison using the GenBank web server were used to compare ITS sequence data and recovered the following results: (i) CBS 131490 on N. lappaceum is 99% (538 of 544) identical to D. nepheliae CBS 123297 on Litchi chinensis from Puerto Rico; and (ii) CBS 131491 on N. mutabile is 99% (527 of 533) identical to the same strain of D. nepheliae. On the basis of the ITS sequence data, the isolates from Honduras were confirmed as the same species, D. nepheliae from Puerto Rico.

Clinical staff must be mindful of numerous physiological symptoms that identify the optimum hydration specific to the person, event and environment. Hence, it becomes extremely critical to monitor the hydration levels in a human body to avoid potential complications and fatalities. Hydration tracking solutions available in the literature are either inefficient and invasive or require clinical trials. An efficient hydration monitoring system is very required, which can regularly track the hydration level, non-invasively. To this aim, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) enabled hydration tracking system, which can accurately estimate the hydration level in human skin using galvanic skin response (GSR) of human body. For this study, data is collected, in three different hydration states, namely hydrated, mild dehydration (8 hours of dehydration) and extreme mild dehydration (16 hours of dehydration), and three different body postures, such as sitting, standing and walking. Eight different ML algorithms and four different DL algorithms are trained on the collected GSR data. Their accuracies are compared and a hybrid (ML+DL) model is proposed to increase the estimation accuracy. It can be reported that hybrid Bi-LSTM algorithm can achieve an accuracy of 97.83%."

However, research on the determinants of bodyweight exercise performance in the context of behavior modeling in fitness apps is scarce. To bridge this gap, we conducted an empirical study among 659 participants resident in North America using social cognitive theory as a framework to uncover the determinants of the performance of bodyweight exercise behavior. To contextualize our study, we modeled, in a hypothetical context, two popular bodyweight exercise behaviors - push ups and squats - featured in most fitness apps on the market using a virtual coach (aka behavior model). Our social cognitive model shows that users' perceived self-efficacy (βT = 0.23, p < 0.001) and perceived social support (βT = 0.23, p < 0.001) are the strongest determinants of bodyweight exercise behavior, followed by outcome expectation (βT = 0.11, p < 0.05). However, users' perceived self-regulation (βT = -0.07, p = n.s.) turns out to be a non-determinant of bodyweight exercise behavior. Comparatively, our model shows that perceived self-efficacy has a stronger direct effect on exercise behavior for men (β = 0.31, p < 0.001) than for women (β = 0.10, p = n.s.). In contrast, perceived social support has a stronger direct effect on exercise behavior for women (β = 0.15, p < 0.05) than for men (β = -0.01, p = n.s.).

Many of the challenges with respect to integrity previously facing competitive sport have been accentuated further during the pandemic. Threats to the integrity of sporting competition include traditional doping, issues of technological fairness, and integration of transgender and intersex athletes in elite sport. The enforced lull in competitive sport provides an unprecedented opportunity for stakeholders in sport to focus on unresolved integrity issues and develop and implement long-lasting solutions. There needs to be a concerted effort to focus on the many technological innovations accelerated by and perfected during COVID-19 that have enabled us to work from home, such as teaching students on-line, applications for medical advice, prescriptions and referrals, and treating patients in hospitals/care homes via video links and use these developments and innovations to enhance sport integrity and anti-doping procedures.

Of the four to five ovules in the flower, generally one and occasionally two or three develop to maturity. It has been proposed that the seed abortion is a consequence of intense sibling competition for maternal resources and that this competition occurs as an inverse function of the genetic relatedness among the developing seeds. Accordingly, developing seeds compete intensely when they are genetically less related but tend to develop together when genetically more related. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the genetic similarity among the pairs of seeds developing within a pod with that among (a) random pairs from the pool of all seeds, (b) random pairs from single-seeded pods, and (c) random pairs from two-seeded pods, using both randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isozymes in five trees. We found that the pairs of seeds developing within a pod are genetically more similar than any random pairs of seeds in a tree. Thus the formation of two-seeded pods appear to be associated with increased genetic relatedness among the developing seeds. We discuss the results in the context of possible fitness advantages and then discuss the possible mechanisms that promote tolerance among related seeds."

It is well-established that resistance exercise and Yi Jin Jing improve the skeletal muscle mass of older adults with sarcopenia. Accordingly, we designed an exercise program incorporating resistance exercise and Yi Jin Jing to increase skeletal muscle mass and reverse sarcopenia in older adults. Additionally, machine learning simulations were used to predict the sarcopenia status after the intervention. Method: This randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of sarcopenia in older adults. For 24 weeks, 90 older adults with sarcopenia were divided into intervention groups, including the Yi Jin Jing and resistance training group (YR, n = 30), the resistance training group (RT, n = 30), and the control group (CG, n = 30). Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen were used to quantify the skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3 SMA). Participants’ age, body mass, stature, and BMI characteristics were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the chi-squared test for categorical data. This study explored the improvement effect of three interventions on participants’ L3 SMA, skeletal muscle density at the third lumbar vertebra (L3 SMD), skeletal muscle interstitial fat area at the third lumbar vertebra region of interest (L3 SMFA), skeletal muscle interstitial fat density at the third lumbar vertebra (L3 SMFD), relative skeletal muscle mass index (RSMI), muscle fat infiltration (MFI), and handgrip strength. Experimental data were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Eleven machine learning models were trained and tested 100 times to assess the model’s performance in predicting whether sarcopenia could be reversed following the intervention. Results: There was a significant interaction in L3 SMA (p < 0.05), RSMI (p < 0.05), MFI (p < 0.05), and handgrip strength (p < 0.05). After the intervention, participants in the YR and RT groups showed significant improvements in L3 SMA, RSMI, and handgrip strength. Post hoc tests showed that the YR group (p < 0.05) yielded significantly better L3 SMA and RSMI than the RT group (p < 0.05) and CG group (p < 0.05) after the intervention. Compared with other models, the stacking model exhibits the best performance in terms of accuracy (85.7%) and F1 (75.3%). Conclusion: One hybrid exercise program with Yi Jin Jing and resistance exercise training can improve skeletal muscle area among older adults with sarcopenia.

Overweight and obesity are one of the main lifestyle illnesses that leads to further health concerns and contributes to numerous chronic diseases, including cancers, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization also predicted that 30% of death in the world will be initiated with lifestyle diseases in 2030 and can be stopped through the suitable identification and addressing of associated risk factors and behavioral involvement policies. Thus, detecting and diagnosing obesity as early as possible is crucial. Therefore, the machine learning approach is a promising solution to early predictions of obesity and the risk of overweight because it can offer quick, immediate, and accurate identification of risk factors and condition likelihoods. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine obesity research and machine learning techniques for the prevention and treatment of obesity from 2010 to 2020. Accordingly, 93 papers are identified from the review articles as primary studies from an initial pool of over 700 papers addressing obesity.

            "abstract": "The factors that determine Serum Thyrotropin (TSH) levels have been examined through different methods, using different covariates. However, the use of machine learning methods has so far not been studied in population databases like NHANES (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey) to predict TSH. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of different machine learning methods like Linear regression, Random forest, Support vector machine, multilayer perceptron and stacking regression to predict TSH and classify individuals with normal, low and high TSH levels. We considered Free T4, Anti-TPO antibodies, T3, Body Mass Index (BMI), Age and Ethnicity as the predictor variables. A total of 9818 subjects were included in this comparative analysis. We used coefficient of determination (r2) value to compare the results for predicting the TSH and show that the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Stacking Regression perform equally well in predicting TSH and achieve the highest r2 value = 0.13, with mean absolute error of 0.78. Moreover, we found that Anti-TPO is the most important feature in predicting TSH followed by Age, BMI, T3 and Free-T4 for the regression analysis. While classifying TSH into normal, high or low levels, our comparative analysis also shows that Random forest performs the best in the classification study, performed with individuals with normal, high and low levels of TSH. We found the following Areas Under Curve (AUC); for low TSH, AUC = 0.61, normal TSH, AUC = 0.61 and elevated TSH AUC = 0.69. Additionally, we found that Anti-TPO was the most important feature in classifying TSH. In this study, we suggest that artificial intelligence and machine learning methods might offer an insight into the complex hypothalamic-pituitary -thyroid axis and may be an invaluable tool that guides us in making appropriate therapeutic decisions (thyroid hormone dosing) for the individual patient."

            "abstract": "The maintenance of uric acid levels is crucial for the human body. In this study, the feasibility of using portable ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry to measure the uric acid of spot urine without the need to add reagents has been demonstrated for the first time. UV spectral analysis has been used to inspect the uric acid concentration in urine. It is found that the absorption spectrum of urine has a high correlation with the concentration of uric acid at a wavelength of around 290-300 nm. Uric acid levels measured with a spectral analyzer compared to uric acid concentrations measured with a traditional biochemical analysis showed good agreement. The portable prototype is label-free and capable of displaying the inspection result of each measurement within 10 s. In the long run, this device can assist people in checking uric acid levels of spot urine with higher frequency and can adjust diet or medication in real time for more efficient health management."

            "abstract": "Commercially available intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) inverse treatment planning systems (ITPS) typically include a smoothing function which allows the user to vary the complexity of delivered beam fluence patterns. This study evaluated the behavior of three ITPSs when varying smoothing parameters. We evaluated four cases treated with IMRT in our clinic: sinonasal carcinoma (SNC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), base of tongue carcinoma (BOT), and prostate carcinoma (PST). Varian Eclipse v6.5, BrainLAB BrainScan v5.31, and Nomos Corvus v6.2 ITPSs were studied for the SNC, GBM, and PST sites. Only Eclipse and Corvus were studied for BOT due to field size constraints of the BrainLAB MM3 collimator. For each ITPS, plans were first optimized using vendor- recommended default \"smoothing\" values. Treatment plans were then reoptimized, exploring various smoothing values. Key metrics recorded included a delivery complexity (DC) metric and the Ian Paddick Conformality Index (IPCI). Results varied widely by vendor with regard to the impact of smoothing on complexity and conformality. Plans run on the Corvus ITPS showed the logically anticipated increase in DC as smoothing was decreased, along with associated improved organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Both Eclipse and BrainScan experienced an expected trend for increased DC as smoothing was decreased. However, this increase did not typically result in appreciably improved OAR sparing. For Eclipse and Corvus, and to a much lesser extent BrainScan, increases in smoothing decreased DC but eventually caused unacceptable losses in plan quality. Depending on the ITPS, potential benefits from optimizing fluence smoothing levels can be significant, allowing for increases in either efficiency or conformality. Because of variability in smoothing function behavior by ITPS, it is important that users familiarize themselves with the effects of varying smoothing parameters for their respective ITPS. Based on experience gained here, we provide recommended workflows for each ITPS to best exploit the fluence-smoothing features of the system."

Paola correctly asked scripted questions and responded to participants during the check-ins 97% and 96% of the time, respectively, but correctly responded to spontaneous exchanges only 21% of the time. Participants completed 63% of weekly check-ins and conducted a total of 3648 exchanges. Mean dietary adherence was 91% and was lowest for discretionary foods, grains, red meat, and vegetables. Participants met their step goal 59% of the time. Participants enjoyed the program and found Paola useful during check-ins but not for spontaneous exchanges. More in-depth knowledge, personalized advice and spontaneity were identified as important improvements. Virtual health assistants should ensure an adequate knowledge base and ability to recognize intents and entities, include personality and spontaneity, and provide ongoing technical troubleshooting of the virtual assistant to ensure the assistant remains effective."

Our method reconstructs deforming surface geometry and temporal varying texture of humans through estimation of human poses and camera poses for every time step of the RGBZ video. Skeletal configurations and camera poses are found by solving a joint energy minimization problem, which optimizes the alignment of RGBZ data from all cameras, as well as the alignment of human shape templates to the Kinect data. The energy function is based on a combination of geometric correspondence finding, implicit scene segmentation, and correspondence finding using image features. Finally, texture recovery is achieved through jointly optimization on spatio-temporal RGB data using matrix completion. As opposed to previous methods, our algorithm succeeds on free-viewpoint video of human actors under general uncontrolled indoor scenes with potentially dynamic background, and it succeeds even if the cameras are moving."

Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers' attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A mixed-method design was employed for this study.

They were randomly divided into the control group (routine care) and the experiment group (comfort care) with 59 cases in each. The DWI under the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) noise reduction algorithm was used for examinations. The noise reduction effect of the algorithm under different Gaussian noises, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps under different b values, was compared and analyzed. The indicators of vomiting, psychological state, quality of life, serum tumor marker levels, and nursing satisfaction were also compared between the two groups of patients after chemotherapy. Compared to the photon mapping (PM) algorithm and the total variation (TV) norm minimization algorithm, the WNNM algorithm had the most ideal noise reduction effect with clearer images, which was conducive to identification. When the b value was 800 s/mm2, the ADC chart had the best sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values of 0.95, 0.89, and 0.87, respectively. After chemotherapy, 45.76% of patients in the experiment group had vomiting in degree 0 and 40.68% had that in degree I, which suggested that the incidence of vomiting was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). All of the psychological state, quality of life, serum tumor marker levels, and nursing satisfaction of patients in the experiment group were significantly better than those in the control group (P < 0.05). It showed that comfort care could alleviate the vomiting response effectively of patients with lung cancer after chemotherapy and had significant effects in improving the quality of life, the psychological state, and curative effect of patients. WNNM algorithm had the better noise reduction effect in DWI image processing. This work provided a certain reference for the nursing intervention plan after chemotherapy of early lung cancer."

Females produced more flower buds and seeds than hermaphrodites in one of the two study populations. The other female traits measured (pistil biomass, seed number per fruit, individual seed mass) did not differ between the gender morphs. The relative seed fitness of hermaphrodites differed between the study populations, with hermaphrodites gaining less of their fitness through female function in the population with a high frequency of females. However, the amount and size of pollen produced by hermaphrodites did not differ between populations. The number of flower buds was positively correlated with seed production in females, whereas in hermaphrodites a positive correlation between number of buds and seed production was found in only one of the two study populations. These results suggest that fitness gain through female function is labile in hermaphrodites of this species, and is probably affected by environmental factors such as the sex ratio of the population."

For phase 1, families who were attending a community-based weight management project were invited to participate, whereas phase 2 recruited families not currently receiving any additional intervention. Families were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (received a smart speaker for use in the family home) or the control group. The IPAP intervention aimed to promote positive health behaviors in the family setting through utilization of the functions of a smart speaker and its linked intelligent personal assistant. Data were collected on recruitment, retention, outcome measures, intervention acceptability, device interactions, and usage.\n## RESULTS\nIn total, 26 families with at least one child aged 5 to 12 years were recruited, with 23 families retained at follow-up. Across phase 1 of the intervention, families interacted with the intelligent personal assistant a total of 65 times. Although device interactions across phase 2 of the intervention were much higher (312 times), only 10.9% (34/312) of interactions were coded as relevant (related to diet, physical activity or well-being). Focus groups highlighted that the families found the devices acceptable and easy to use and felt that the prompts or reminders were useful in prompting healthier behaviors. Some further intervention refinements in relation to the timing of prompts and integrating feedback alongside the devices were suggested by families.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUsing intelligent personal assistants to deliver health-related messages and information within the home is feasible, with high levels of engagement reported by participating families.

The detection of sarcopenia and conduction of simple body composition measurements, such as the phase angle (PhA) deriving from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), can help to early identify, monitor, prevent and treat malnutrition. The present review aims to clarify the relationship between PhA and sarcopenia with the pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic aspects of lung cancer. PhA and sarcopenia are connected to lung cancer prognosis through various mechanisms including inflammation and oxidative stress, although more research is needed to identify the critical thresholds for increased mortality risk. Moreover, emphasis is given on the role of dietary interventions (oral nutritional supplementation, and dietary counseling) to manage sarcopenia and related variables in patients with lung cancer. Oral nutritional supplements and/or those containing n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a positive effect on physical strength measures and muscle mass if administered at the beginning of chemotherapy. Data on sole dietary counseling or multimodal interventions are less promising so far.

However, the mechanisms and regulation of CK activity have not been well investigated. This study analysed CK concentrations and expression of genes involved in CK metabolism in developing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ovaries. The concentrations of CK ribosides and isopentenyladenine and the transcript levels of the CK biosynthetic genes SlIPT3, SlIPT4, SlLOG6, and SlLOG8 were high at anthesis and decreased immediately afterward. In contrast, trans-zeatin concentration and the transcript levels of the CK biosynthetic genes SlIPT1, SlIPT2, SlCYP735A1, SlCYP735A2, and SlLOG2 increased after anthesis. The expression of type-A response regulator genes was high in tomato ovaries from pre-anthesis to early post-anthesis stages. These results suggest that the CK signal transduction pathway is active in the cell division phase of fruit development. This study also investigated the effect of CK application on fruit set and development. Application of a synthetic CK, N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU), to unpollinated tomato ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit development. The CPPU-induced parthenocarpic fruits were smaller than pollinated fruits, because of reduction of pericarp cell size rather than reduced cell number. Thus, CPPU-induced parthenocarpy was attributable to the promotion of cell division, not cell expansion. Overall, the results provide evidence that CKs are involved in cell division during development of tomato fruit."

Panel data methods will be used to track user progress over time in subsequent analyses. The Elena+ intervention is open-source under the Apache 2 license (MobileCoach software) and the Creative Commons 4.0 license CC BY-NC-SA (intervention logic and content), allowing future collaborations; such as cultural adaptions, integration of new sensor-related features or the development of new topics. Discussion: Digital health applications offer a low-cost and scalable route to meet challenges to public health. As Elena+ was developed by an international and interdisciplinary team in a short time frame to meet the COVID-19 pandemic, empirical data are required to discern how effective such solutions can be in meeting real world, emergent health crises. Additionally, clustering Elena+ users based on characteristics and usage behaviors could help public health practitioners understand how population-level digital health interventions can reach at-risk and sub-populations."

            "abstract": "Disordered eating is prevalent among college student populations, and Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is being explored as a new type of eating disorder. There is currently no standardized ON diagnostic tool, and the majority of ON research has been conducted among European populations. The present study explored the Bratman Orthorexia Test (BOT) for ON diagnosis, and its relationship to validated tools for assessing disordered eating, body dysmorphic, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies among college students attending a western university. A convenience sample of 448 college students with a mean age of 22 years was recruited to complete an online survey that included the BOT, Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Revised (OCI-R) and demographics. Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and multiple linear regressions were used for analyses. The average BOT score was 4.71, near the \"health fanatic\" range, with Hispanic/Latino subjects and overweight/obese students having significantly higher median BOT scores. Gender, age, and college major were not significantly associated with BOT score. Significant positive correlations were observed between total BOT and EAT-26 scores (r = .47, p < 0.01), BOT and BDDQ scores (r = .25, p < 0.01), and BOT and OCI-R scores (r = .19, p < 0.01). ON tendencies may exist among college students and Hispanic/Latino and overweight/obese students may be at increased risk. Further research is needed to determine ON risk factors among diverse student populations in order to inform prevention and treatment approaches on college campuses."

The recent development and release of a fixed-ratio combination of slow-release insulin degludec and the GLP-1RA liraglutide (IDegLira) represents an improvement to this therapy. We have conducted a real-world evidence study in Italian patients with T2DM to evaluate whether the encouraging clinical trial results obtained with IDegLira, which became available in Italy in January 2018, can be confirmed in Italian clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study in patients with T2DM treated with IDegLira from January to December 2018. Prior to the initiation of IDegLira therapy, patients were treated with BI with or without one or more concomitant oral antidiabetic drugs (BOT group) or according to the basal bolus protocol (BI and rapid-acting insulin treatment; BB group).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 244 patients were included in the present study, of whom 186 were in the BOT group and 58 in the BB group. Following the switch to IDegLira therapy, glycemic control improved in both groups, with significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin after 6 and 12 months of treatment in the BOT group and after 6 months of treatment in the BB group. No gain in body weight and body mass index and reductions in fasting plasma glucose and number of concomitant diabetic medications (in BOT patients) were observed.

            "abstract": "The vast majority of dietary and eating behavior assessment methods are based on self-reports. They are burdensome and also prone to measurement errors. Recent technological innovations allow for the development of more accurate and precise dietary and eating behavior assessment tools that require less effort for both the user and the researcher. Therefore, a new sensor-based device to assess food intake and eating behavior was developed. The device is a regular dining tray equipped with a video camera and three separate built-in weighing stations. The weighing stations measure the weight of the bowl, plate, and drinking cup continuously over the course of a meal. The video camera positioned to the face records eating behavior characteristics (chews, bites), which are analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI)-based automatic facial expression software. The tray weight and the video data are transported at real-time to a personal computer (PC) using a wireless receiver. The outcomes of interest, such as the amount eaten, eating rate and bite size, can be calculated by subtracting the data of these measures at the timepoints of interest. The information obtained by the current version of the tray can be used for research purposes, an upgraded version of the device would also facilitate the provision of more personalized advice on dietary intake and eating behavior. Contrary to the conventional dietary assessment methods, this dietary assessment device measures food intake directly within a meal and is not dependent on memory or the portion size estimation. Ultimately, this device is therefore suited for daily main meal food intake and eating behavior measures. In the future, this technology based dietary assessment method can be linked to health applications or smart watches to obtain a complete overview of exercise, energy intake, and eating behavior."

It is a means through which patients clarify their treatment wishes. ACP is a patient-centered, dynamic process involving patients, their families, and caregivers. It is designed to 1) clarify goals of care, 2) increase patient agency over their care and treatments, and 3) help prepare for death. ACP is an active process; the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) illness trajectory creates health circumstances that necessitate that caregivers assess and nurture patient readiness for ACP discussions. Effective ACP enhances patient engagement and quality of life resulting in better quality of care.\n    \n\n\n          Main body:\n        \n      \n      Despite these benefits, ACP is not consistently completed. Clinical, technical, and social barriers result in key challenges to quality care. First, ACP requires caregivers to have end-of-life conversations that they lack the training to perform and often find difficult. Second, electronic health record (EHR) tools do not enable the efficient exchange of requisite psychosocial information such as treatment burden, patient preferences, health beliefs, priorities, and understanding of prognosis. This results in a lack of information available to enable patients and their families to understand the impact of illness and treatment options. Third, culture plays a vital role in end-of-life conversations. Social barriers include circumstances when a patient's cultural beliefs or value system conflicts with the caregiver's beliefs. Caregivers describe this disconnect as a key barrier to ACP. Consistent ACP is integral to quality patient-centered care and social workers' training and clinical roles uniquely position them to support ACP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this debate, we detail the known barriers to completing ACP for ESRD patients, and we describe its benefits. We detail how social workers, in particular, can support health outcomes by promoting the health information exchange that occurs during these sensitive conversations with patients, their family, and care team members. We aim to inform clinical social workers of this opportunity to enhance quality care by engaging in ACP. We describe research to help further elucidate barriers, and how researchers and caregivers can design and deliver interventions that support ACP to address this persistent challenge to quality end-of-life care."

However, the typical diagnosis examinations (in-laboratory polysomnography (lab-PSG) and other alternatives methods may therefore have limited differentiation capacities. Hence, this study established novel models to assist in the classification of ID and low- and high-ArTH OSA. Participants reporting insomnia as their chief complaint were enrolled. Their sleep parameters and body profile were accessed from the lab-PSG database. Based on the definition of low-ArTH OSA and ID, patients were divided into three groups, namely, the ID, low- and high-ArTH OSA groups. Various machine learning approaches, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, random forest (RF), and support vector machine, were trained using two types of features (Oximetry model, trained with oximetry parameters only; Combined model, trained with oximetry and anthropometric parameters). In the training stage, RF presented the highest cross-validation accuracy in both models compared with the other approaches. In the testing stage, the RF accuracy was 77.53% and 80.06% for the oximetry and combined models, respectively. The established models can be used to differentiate ID, low- and high-ArTH OSA in the population of Taiwan and those with similar craniofacial features."

We assembled individual participant data from 200,358 people (aged 1-100 years, 55% female) from 36 studies from the Netherlands, 471,759 people (40-69 years, 55.5% female) from the United Kingdom and 409,617 people (≥18 years, 55.8% female) from the United States. One in four people slept less than age-specific recommendations, but only 5.8% slept outside of the 'acceptable' sleep duration.

In adults (≥18 years), poor sleep quality (13.3%) and insomnia symptoms (9.6-19.4%) were more prevalent than short sleep duration (6.5% with TST < 6 h). Insomnia symptoms were most frequent in people spending ≥9 h in bed, whereas poor sleep quality was more frequent in those spending <6 h in bed. TST was similar across countries, but insomnia symptoms were 1.5-2.9 times higher in the United States. Women (≥41 years) reported sleeping shorter times or slightly less efficiently than men, whereas with actigraphy they were estimated to sleep longer and more efficiently than man. This study provides age- and sex-specific population reference charts for sleep duration and efficiency which can help guide personalized advice on sleep length and preventive practices."

We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection and subsequently affects disease transmission by changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a central role in epidemic prevention, (b) a reasonable fraction of overreacting nodes are needed in epidemic prevention (c) the basic reproduction number R_{0} has different effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection, and (d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure that people become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to protect themselves and the whole population."

However, despite the continuous rehabilitation game design and its applications, the existing cognitive exercise games fall short of user interaction and personalized elements with regard to difficult levels, which leads to users leaving early and losing interests during the gameplay. In this regard, the purpose of the study was to design and develop the serious game inclusive of playful elements for user motivation, the web-based mobile application system for easy accessibility, and Artificial Intelligence- (AI-) based difficulty level adjustment system for prevention from earlier leaving out in the middle of the play so that the elderly users can feel entertaining and immersed into the cognitive game voluntarily. This study was designed as an eight-week pilot experiment with thirty-seven participants in their 60s to 80s for the game's usability assessment purpose. Results of the study showed that the AI-based cognitive exercise game was acceptable, interesting, and motivating for the elderly people and the test results before and after the eight-week training suggest a relationship between longer the training on the game and lower cognitive assessment scores including geriatric quality of life scale, geriatric depression scale, and Korean version of mini-mental state examination (MMSE). These correlations demonstrate the potential value of serious games in clinical assessment of cognitive status for the elderly users with varying cognitive ability. Based on these results, the elderly-centered serious game with playful element can be potentially used in clinical settings, allowing the cognitive training to be more enjoyable and more medically effective. Given these promising results, a more focused study can extend to the game system or additional game tools or features to be explored that solely target the elderly by applying AI and advanced visualization devices."

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit spine formation in cucumber. Here, we report functional characterization of the cucumber CsMYB6 gene, which encodes a MIXTA-like MYB transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating fruit trichome development. Spatial-temporal expression analyses revealed high-level expression of CsMYB6 in the epidermis of cucumber ovaries during fruit spine initiation, which was similar to the expression of CsTRY, a homolog of the Arabidopsis TRY gene that also plays a key role in trichome development. Overexpression of CsMYB6 and CsTRY in cucumber and Arabidopsis revealed that CsMYB6 and CsTRY act as negative regulators of trichome initiation in both species, and that CsMYB6 acted upstream of CsTRY in this process. CsMYB6 was found to bind to the three MYB binding sites inside the promoter region of CsTRY, and protein-protein interaction assays suggested that CsTRY also directly interacted with CsMYB6 protein. The results also revealed conserved and divergent roles of CsMYB6 and its Arabidopsis homolog AtMYB106 in trichome development.

In addition, there are interactions between joint structure, muscle function, and the central nervous system. In the integration with other intelligent control methods and optimization algorithms, such as fuzzy control/expert verification and genetic algorithm, it provides nonparametric object models, optimization parameters, reasoning models, and fault diagnosis. The central nervous system is the main research object of neuromuscular control. Martial arts often cause injuries or affect the progress of martial arts because of some irregular movements. Chinese traditional martial arts is another name for \"martial arts\" in the late Qing Dynasty in China. It is mainly reflected in the individual's application and attainments in martial arts traditional teaching methods and personal cultivation. Therefore, this paper proposes an analysis of the influence of sports biomechanics on martial arts sports and comprehensive neuromuscular control in the context of artificial intelligence. In this paper, the specific research of Wushu sports is carried out mainly in two aspects: sports biomechanics and neuromuscular control. It uses a variety of algorithms, successively using particle swarm algorithm, neural network structure, fitness function, and so on. This paper compares and analyzes their accuracy and then selects the optimal algorithm. It then conducts experimental research on the martial arts movements of professional martial arts Sanda players. The final experimental conclusion shows that, regarding lower limb selective response time and the middle left lower limb prereaction time (L-PMT) of the elite athlete group and the ordinary athlete group, the average movement value of the elite group of 2.336 is significantly greater than that of the ordinary group of 1.938.

Fitness benefits conferred by fungi expressing mutualistic lifestyles include biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, growth enhancement, and increased reproductive success. Analysis of plant-endophyte associations in high stress habitats revealed that at least some fungal endophytes confer habitat-specific stress tolerance to host plants. Without the habitat-adapted fungal endophytes, the plants are unable to survive in their native habitats.

The Asr1 gene showed the strongest fruit-specific expression and differential expression profiles during fruit development, which were expressed from a low copy gene. The promoter region of the Asr1 gene contained several putative functional cis-elements, which may be involved in the response to plant hormones and environmental stresses. These results suggest that Asr1 may play an important role in the regulation of melon fruit ripening."

            "abstract": "A model of kiwifruit berry development is presented, building on the model of Fishman and Génard used for peach fruit. That model has been extended to incorporate a number of important features of kiwifruit growth. First, the kiwifruit berry is attached to the stem through a pedicel/receptacle complex which contributes significantly to the hydraulic resistance between the stem and the fruit, and this resistance changes considerably during the season. Second, much of the carbohydrate in kiwifruit berries is stored as starch until the fruit matures late in the season, when the starch hydrolyses to soluble sugars. This starch storage has a major effect on the osmotic potential of the fruit, so an existing model of kiwifruit starch dynamics was included in the model. Using previously published approaches, we also included elasticity and extended the modelling period to cover both the cell division and cell expansion phases of growth. The resulting model showed close simulation of field observations of fresh weight, dry matter, starch, and soluble solids in kiwifruit. Comparison with continuous measurements of fruit diameter confirmed that elasticity was needed to adequately simulate observed diurnal variation in fruit size. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the model is particularly sensitive to variation in inputs relating to water (stem water potential and the humidity of the air), and to parameters controlling cell expansion (cell wall extensibility). Some limitations in the model structure were identified, suggesting that a revised model including current apoplastic/symplastic concepts needs to be developed."

Whilst great advances have been made in understanding molecular genetic aspects of fruit development, our knowledge concerning the metabolic shifts underpinning this process remains largely confined to primary metabolism. Conversely, the majority of the metabolites considered to have health benefits are secondary or specialized metabolites. Prior to assessing the role (if any) of these metabolites in tomato fruit development, considerable effort will be required in order to better describe the complement of secondary metabolites in the tomato and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in their synthesis and degradation. Advances in tomato secondary metabolism will be reviewed here focusing on the use of metabolomics strategies and, where applicable, the enabling of these strategies by their coupling to information resident in the tomato genome sequence."

Germination was monitored for 40 d under different temperature regimes. Endosperm digestion and resistance, with endo-beta-mannanase activity and required force to puncture the endosperm cap as respective markers, were measured during germination in water and in abscisic acid.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Fruits of S. lycocarpum contain dormant seeds before natural dispersion. The best germination condition found was a 12-h alternating light/dark and high/low (20/30 degrees C) temperature cycle, which seemed to target properties of the endosperm cap. The endosperm cap contains 7-8 layers of elongated polygonal cells and is predestined to facilitate radicle protrusion. The force required to puncture the endosperm cap decreased in two stages during germination and showed a significant negative correlation with endo-beta-mannanase activity. As a result of the thick endosperm cap, the puncture force was significantly higher in S. lycocarpum than in tomato and coffee. Endo-beta-mannanase activity was detected in the endosperm cap prior to radicle protrusion. Abscisic acid inhibited germination, increase of embryo weight during imbibition, the second stage of weakening of the endosperm cap and of endo-beta-mannanase activity in the endosperm cap.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The germination mechanism of S. lycocarpum bears resemblance to that of tomato and coffee seeds.

            "abstract": "Epidemics caused by microbial organisms are part of the natural phenomena of increasing biological complexity. The heterogeneity and constant variability of hosts, in terms of age, immunological status, family structure, lifestyle, work activities, social and leisure habits, daily division of time and other demographic characteristics make it extremely difficult to predict the evolution of epidemics. Such prediction is, however, critical for implementing intervention measures in due time and with appropriate intensity. General conclusions should be precluded, given that local parameters dominate the flow of local epidemics. Membrane computing models allows us to reproduce the objects (viruses and hosts) and their interactions (stochastic but also with defined probabilities) with an unprecedented level of detail. Our LOIMOS model helps reproduce the demographics and social aspects of a hypothetical town of 10 320 inhabitants in an average European country where COVID-19 is imported from the outside. The above-mentioned characteristics of hosts and their lifestyle are minutely considered. For the data in the Hospital and the ICU we took advantage of the observations at the Nursery Intensive Care Unit of the Consortium University General Hospital, Valencia, Spain (included as author). The dynamics of the epidemics are reproduced and include the effects on viral transmission of innate and acquired immunity at various ages. The model predicts the consequences of delaying the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (between 15 and 45 days after the first reported cases) and the effect of those interventions on infection and mortality rates (reducing transmission by 20, 50 and 80%) in immunological response groups. The lockdown for the elderly population as a single intervention appears to be effective. This modeling exercise exemplifies the application of membrane computing for designing appropriate multilateral interventions in epidemic situations."

An attempt was made to use plantar pressure information through fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors mounted on an in-sole, in tandem with a brain-computer interface (BCI) device to predict brain signals corresponding to sitting, standing and walking postures of a person. Posture classification was attained with an accuracy range between 87-93% from FBG and BCI signals using machine learning models such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and naïve Bayes (NB). These models were used to identify electrodes responding to sitting, standing and walking activities of four users from a 16 channel BCI device. Six electrode positions based on the 10-20 system for electroencephalography (EEG) were identified as the most sensitive to plantar activities and found to be consistent with clinical investigations of the sensorimotor cortex during foot movement. A prediction of brain EEG corresponding to given FBG data with lowest mean square error (MSE) values (0.065-0.109) was made with the selection of a long-short term memory (LSTM) machine learning model when compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models."

Birth care brings to the fore fascinating philosophical questions: is a woman in labour a subject with full rights in practice as well as in theory? Can a labouring woman exercise her autonomy in a situation of maximum vulnerability but also maximum lucidity and awareness, as characterises the work of giving birth? What is the relationship between agency, capacity, and pain during and between contractions? Birth care proposes key questions relating to knowledge, freedom, and what it means to be a human being. Nonetheless, giving birth continues to be a blind spot in contemporary prevailing philosophy. My approach to a philosophy of birth aligns with one of the aims of contemporary philosophy; I explore the relationship between knowledge and emancipatory action in the relatively unchartered waters of birth and delivery, to create an epistemology that is sensitive to feminism and embodiment. What I propose to achieve through a philosophy of birth is a new logos for genos -a radically new meditation on origin and birth. How we understand our origin and the practices that bring us into being reveals our humanity. The lived experiences of women and their situated knowledge challenge widely-held assumptions about rationality, about what it is to be a birthing woman and what it is to have agency and capacity in the delivery suite. A philosophy of birth enables us to navigate the stormy waters of contemporary obstetric practice towards a new and radical logos for genos -an embodied genealogy which not only redresses imbalances of gender, but also addresses life and happiness."

This is seen especially in professional soccer, with a marked negative impact on team performance and considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies provide some preliminary understanding of which factors are mostly associated with injury risk, but scientific systematic evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. Some factors raise the risk of a sport injury, but there are also elements that predispose athletes to sports injuries. The biological mechanisms involved in non-contact musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are poorly understood. Genetic risk factors may be associated with susceptibility to injuries, and may exert marked influence on recovery times. Athletes are complex systems, and depend on internal and external factors to attain and maintain stability of their health and their performance. Organisms, participants or traits within a dynamic system adapt and change when factors within that system change. Scientists routinely predict risk in a variety of dynamic systems, including weather, political forecasting and projecting traffic fatalities and the last years have started the use of predictive models in the human health industry. We propose that the use of artificial intelligence may well help in assessing risk and help to predict the occurrence of sport injuries."

Machine learning (ML) is an area of artificial intelligence that has the potential to improve modelling of nonlinear associations and confounding which are found in nutritional data. These opportunities notwithstanding, the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology must be approached cautiously to safeguard the scientific quality of the results and provide accurate interpretations. Given the complex scenario around ML, judicious application of such tools is necessary to offer nutritional epidemiology a novel analytical resource for dietary measurement and assessment and a tool to model the complexity of dietary intake and its relation to health. This work describes the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology and provides guidelines to avoid common pitfalls encountered in applying predictive statistical models to nutritional data.

Aqueous pores arise by hydration of permanent dipoles and ionic functional groups. They can be localized using ionic fluorescent dyes, silver nitrate, and mercuric chloride. Aqueous pores preferentially occur in cuticular ledges, at the base of trichomes, and in cuticles over anticlinal walls. Average pore radii ranged from 0.45 to 1.18 nm. Penetration of ions was a first order process as the fraction of the salt remaining on the cuticle surface decreased exponentially with time. Permeability of cuticles to ions depended on humidity and was highest at 100% humidity. Wetting agents increased rate constants by factors of up to 12, which indicates that the pore openings are surrounded by waxes. The pores in cuticular ledges of Helxine soleirolii allowed passage of berberine sulphate, which has a molecular weight of 769 g mol(-1). Increasing the molecular weight of solutes from 100 to 500 g mol(-1) decreased the rate constants of penetration by factors of 7 (Vicia faba) and 13 (Populus canescens), respectively. Half-times of penetration of inorganic salts and organic ions across Populus cuticles and Vicia leaf surfaces varied between 1 and 12 h.

The showy hermaphroditic flowers offer pollen and nectar that attract many visitors including bees, butterflies, hawk moths, and bats.

Cross-pollinations were performed within and among parental species and hybrids in a greenhouse using plants transplanted from the field. Pitcairnia staminea and hybrids are self-compatible and could be spontaneously self-pollinated, whereas P. albiflos, though self-compatible, needs pollinators' services for self-pollination. Facultative agamospermy was found in the parental species. Prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers between these taxa were weak. Reciprocal hand-pollinations between parental species and with hybrids yielded high fruit sets with viable seeds. Evaluations of fruit set, seed set, seed germination, and pollen viability were undertaken to compare the fitness of the hybrids relative to their parents. The hybrids showed equivalent fitness, except for lower pollen viability. Some conservation implications are noted."

            "abstract": "Most existing human activity classification systems require a large training dataset to construct statistical models for each activity of interest. This may be impractical in many cases. In this paper, we proposed a semi-supervised HMM based activity monitoring system, that adapts the HMM for a specific subject from a general model in order to alleviate the requirement of a large training data set. In addition, using two triaxial accelerometers, our system not only identifies simple events such as sitting, standing and walking, but also recognizes the behavior or a more complex activity by temporally linking the events together. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed system."

            "abstract": "Peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) was chosen as a model to shed light on the physiological role of jasmonates (JAs) during fruit ripening. To this aim, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MJ, 0.40 mM) and propyl dihydrojasmonate (PDJ, 0.22 mM), applied in planta at different fruit developmental stages, on the time-course of ethylene production and fruit quality traits were evaluated. MJ-induced changes in fruit transcriptome at harvest and the expression profiling of relevant JA-responsive genes were analysed in control and JA-treated fruit. Exogenously applied JAs affected the onset of ripening depending upon the fruit developmental stage, with PDJ being more active than MJ. Both compounds enhanced the transcription of allene oxide synthase (PpAOS1), the first specific enzyme in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid, and altered the pattern of jasmonic acid accumulation. Microarray transcriptome profiling showed that MJ down-regulated some ripening-related genes, such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (PpACO1) and polygalacturonase (PG), and the transcriptional modulator IAA7. MJ also altered the expression of cell wall-related genes, namely pectate lyase (PL) and expansins (EXPs), and up-regulated several stress-related genes, including some of those involved in JA biosynthesis. Time-course expression profiles of PpACO1, PL, PG, PpExp1, and the transcription factor LIM confirmed the array results. Thus, in peach fruit, exogenous JAs led to a ripening delay due to an interference with ripening- and stress/defence-related genes, as reflected in the transcriptome of treated fruit at harvest."

            "abstract": "The surface area of a mature green cucumber (Cucumis sativa L.) fruit is comparable with that of a functional leaf, but the characteristics of fruit photosynthesis and its contribution to growth are poorly understood. Here, the photosynthetic properties of two genotypes of cucumber (dark green and light green fruits) were studied using a combination of electron microscopy, immunogold enzyme localization, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, isotope tracer, and fruit darkening techniques. Chlorophyll content of the exocarp is similar to that of leaves, but there are no distinctive palisade and spongy tissues. The efficiency of PSII is similar to that in leaves, but with lower non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is found mainly in the exocarp, while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is primarily localized to vascular bundles and placenta tissue. Rubisco and PEPC expression at both transcriptional and translational levels increases concurrently during fruit growth. The contribution of fruit photosynthesis in exocarp to its own C accumulation is 9.4%, while ~88% of respiratory CO2 in fruit was captured and re-fixed. Photosynthesis by cucumber fruits, through direct fixation of atmospheric CO2 and recapture of respired CO2, as verified by 14CO2 uptake and gas exchange, makes an important contribution to fruit growth."

This phenomenon has been a source of concern for schools and the government, and it is necessary to take corresponding measures to change it. The general motor function level of Chinese college students is explored first based on artificial intelligence and the human-computer interaction technology. The Physical Activity Questionnaire for College Students is compiled by referring to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and 561 students from colleges in Tianjin province are assessed based on the functional movement screen (FMS). Spearman correlation and multivariate regression analysis (MRA) are used to analyze the correlation between the motor function and physical activity status. In terms of lunch break frequency, the proportion of students having one to two lunch breaks in a week is the highest (54.15%); in terms of the frequency of doing moderate physical exercise, the proportion of students doing moderate physical exercise for 1-2 days in a week is the highest (50.61%); in terms of the frequency of doing heavy physical exercise, the proportion of students doing heavy exercise for 1-2 days in a week is the highest (47.26%); in terms of the sedentary time, the proportion of students with sedentary time more than 5 h in a day is the highest (40.61%); in terms of eye use time, the proportion of students with 8-10 h eye use time in a day is the highest (43.61%).

The hurdle step (21.03%), straight knee lift (22.52%), and body rotation stability (18.31%) have a relatively low proportion among the three-point items. There is a positive correlation between motor function score with the time of moderate exercise and the time of heavy exercise (P < 0.05). College students generally have insufficient rest time, long eye use time, and long sitting time, leading to a low level of motor function, manifested by an asymmetry between both sides of the body and poor trunk stability. It is recommended to add hurdling steps, straight knee lifts, and body rotation stability tests to college physical education courses."

One option for reinvigorating these populations is the introduction of genetic material from other sites, but in some cases fitness may be reduced as a result of outbreeding depression. Here the pollination biology of the rare shrub Grevillea repens is studied across its natural range and reproductive responses following cross-pollination among populations are examined to determine factors that may be limiting sexual reproduction and the potential for genetic rescue.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pollen manipulation treatments (self-, autogamous self-, cross- and open pollination) were applied to flowers to examine the breeding system and fruit and seed production in five populations of G. repens.

Gender specialization is expected among distylous species when floral morphs differ in reproductive output. However, spatio-temporal variability in female reproductive output between morphs needs to be investigated to fully understand patterns of sexual expression and gender specialization in distylous plants. Between-year variation in flower and fruit production of hummingbird-pollinated Palicourea padifolia (Rubiaceae) was examined, focusing on functional gender expression of long- and short-styled morphs and comparing their reproductive performance in five consecutive years (1998-2002).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between-year variation in inflorescence, floral bud and fruit production was monitored and quantified.

Although fruit production was similar between morphs, their functional gender shifted across years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The gender expression inconsistency across years is surprising because a number of floral characters and attributes that contribute to differently attracting and rewarding effective pollinators in P. padifolia suggest gender specialization. The evidence that morphs of distylous species might specialize in functional gender mostly comes from differences among populations in seed production and non-equilibrium morph ratios based on 1-year field population surveys. The results suggest that more sampling through time is needed to detect gender specialization among distylous species with a perennial habit."

            "abstract": "This chapter contains clinical studies and reviews of the state-of-the-art regarding how information technology can help improve outcomes for patients with diabetes through enhanced education and support. With the increasing sophistication of diabetes treatment protocols and diabetes-related devices this new modality offers a remarkable opportunity for clinicians and patients. For the first time, with online tools clinicians are in a position to have a major impact on diabetes outcomes by providing robust and affordable just-in-time support to large numbers of patients who want to improve their diabetes outcomes through enhanced self-management of the complex behaviours so essential for good outcomes. Patients with diabetes often need a complex set of services and support ranging from glucose monitoring, insulin and other medication management, psychotherapy and social support, to physical activity promotion, nutrition counselling and more. Integrating these supports into a patient's therapeutic regimen presents challenges that need to be addressed through a variety of strategies. Patient self-management of diabetes enabled by information technology is becoming an important factor in the way providers deliver healthcare. Approaches using information technology to support clinical services are being dramatically altered by the confluence of several trends. * Patients want an active role in managing their own health and a collaborative relationship with their healthcare providers. * Widespread, low-cost internet access is erasing existing geographic, economic and demographic barriers to obtaining health information online, and with advanced Web 2.0 technologies high levels of interactivity can engage the patient. * Clinicians and researchers now have a deeper understanding of how people learn and respond online, and that knowledge can be crafted into solutions that produce effective, long-term behaviour change. Technology enabled approaches that show great promise to improve outcomes use new models of service provision in which technology enabled self-management support (SMS) provides patients with * just-in-time delivery of tailored messages and experience that speak to each person based on their unique characteristics, their performance on key behaviours and their needs at that moment in time; * ways to easily and accurately keep track of their performance and use that knowledge to plan and implement new approaches to reaching their goals; * ways to link directly to family and friends for critical support, and to link to their many providers to help integrate medical care with everyday life. Online tools can extend health practices and provide this support through cost-effective programmes that help clinicians guide their patients to better manage their diabetes. The best internet self-management education and support programmes are rich in pertinent content, provide engaging interactive elements, and offer a tailored, personalised learning experience. They contain self-assessment tools and ways for the individual to monitor performance and changes in biological measurements such as blood sugar, insulin dosage, physical activity, weight, blood pressure and mood. The patient can access their information, input their data, and receive support 24 h a day - at a time and place most convenient for them, and not limited to clinicians' office hours. Web-based learning and support technology benefits both clinician and patient; patients learn to overcome barriers and to self-document activities and interactions, permitting clinician review and feedback at any time. In addition to automating much of the educational content, this time shifting element is one of the keys to making the process efficient and low cost. The ability to perform an automated review of the patient's activities and performance also provides the clinician with a valuable tool that increases both effectiveness and efficiency. As with online intervention, a 'virtual coach' can provide individualised guidance and support based on readily available analyses of each patient's characteristics and performance. In addition, the clinician can communicate frequently and efficiently, offering personalised email support to each patient without requiring in-person meetings, as well as monitor 'virtual support groups' where patients interact with others online via informational chat rooms and blogs. By incorporating web-based patient self-management and support into traditional treatment methods, one clinician can effectively support many patients - one patient at a time."

            "abstract": "This paper presents two models of budbreak on canes of 'Hayward' kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). A conventional 'chill unit' (CU) type model is compared with an alternative 'loss of potential' (LOP) approach, which assumes that the number of buds developing in spring depends on climate and node position-dependent bud-to-bud interactions that vary in duration and intensity. Both models describe how temperature, and application of a dormancy-breaking chemical, determine the overall amount of budbreak for whole canes. However, the LOP model does so by describing patterns of budbreak along canes. To do this, the cumulative influence of distal neighbours is assumed to cause a progressive fall in the capacity for bud development over the autumn-winter period, an influence that gets stronger as temperature rises. The LOP model also assumes that the rate of decline varies along the cane, as a function of some inherent bud property. These two factors mean that buds towards the base of the cane break less often under the suppressive influence of distal neighbours, while low temperature ('chilling') increases budbreak by diminishing the intensity of suppression relative to bud development rate. Under this scenario, dormancy-breaking chemicals (such as hydrogen cyanamide, HC) enhance budbreak by diminishing the duration of suppression. Models were calibrated using daily temperature series and budbreak proportion data from a multi-year regional survey, and were then tested against independent data sets. Both models were run from a fixed start date until the time budbreak was almost complete, or until a standard date. The fitted models described 87 % of variation in amount of budbreak due to site, year, HC and node position effects in the original data set. Results suggest that the correlation between chilling and the amount of budbreak can be interpreted as a population-based phenomenon based on interaction among buds."

The method combines the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) algorithm and the total-variation (TV) regularization scheme. The basic idea presented in this paper is the use of two appropriate dictionaries, one for the representation of textures and the other for the natural scene parts assumed to be piecewise smooth. Both dictionaries are chosen such that they lead to sparse representations over one type of image-content (either texture or piecewise smooth). The use of the BPDN with the two amalgamed dictionaries leads to the desired separation, along with noise removal as a by-product. As the need to choose proper dictionaries is generally hard, a TV regularization is employed to better direct the separation process and reduce ringing artifacts. We present a highly efficient numerical scheme to solve the combined optimization problem posed by our model and to show several experimental results that validate the algorithm's performance."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      We developed the Determinants of Lifestyle Behavior Questionnaire (DLBQ) to measure determinants of lifestyle behavioral change according to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in adults at high risk of diabetes type 2 (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The aim of the current study was to test the validity of the DLBQ.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From February to September 2008, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the region West-Friesland (The Netherlands) among 622 adults, aged 30-50 years at high risk of T2DM or CVD participating in a lifestyle intervention trial.

            "abstract": "We experimentally investigated how pollinator- and herbivore-induced changes influence the performance of the long-lived herb Primula veris. Eight treatments that corresponded to natural factors normally affecting this species were designed to enhance or reduce reproductive success and resource availability (flower removal, supplementary pollination, defoliation). During the experimental season and in the following year we quantified responses in terms of survival, growth, and seed production of reproductive plants. Matrix population models were used to calculate population growth rate using the demographic parameters recorded in permanent plots and respective treatment groups. Seed production was not limited by pollen availability, and we found no evidence of a cost of reproduction. Leaf removal had either no effect or a negative effect on future performance, depending on the timing of removal. Defoliation early in the season reduced current seed production and future growth, whereas removal during fruit development affected performance in the following year. Demographic models suggest that leaf damage has a smaller negative impact than flower removal on overall performance in this population. Our results suggest that the source-sink paths vary over the season and that the timing of herbivory may influence the extent to which effects are carried over to subsequent reproductive seasons."

            "abstract": "Rehabilitation programs play an important role in improving the quality of life of patients with balance disorders. Such programs are usually executed in a home environment, due to lack of resources. This procedure usually results in poorly performed exercises or even complete drop outs from the programs, as the patients lack guidance and motivation. This paper introduces a novel system for managing balance disorders in a home environment using a virtual coach for guidance, instruction, and inducement. The proposed system comprises sensing devices, augmented reality technology, and intelligent inference agents, which capture, recognize, and evaluate a patient's performance during the execution of exercises. More specifically, this work presents a home-based motion capture and assessment module, which utilizes a sensory platform to recognize an exercise performed by a patient and assess it. The sensory platform comprises IMU sensors (Mbientlab MMR© 9axis), pressure insoles (Moticon©), and a depth RGB camera (Intel D415©). This module is designed to deliver messages both during the performance of the exercise, delivering personalized notifications and alerts to the patient, and after the end of the exercise, scoring the overall performance of the patient. A set of proof of concept validation studies has been deployed, aiming to assess the accuracy of the different components for the sub-modules of the motion capture and assessment module. More specifically, Euler angle calculation algorithm in 2D (R 2 = 0.99) and in 3D (R 2 = 0.82 in yaw plane and R 2 = 0.91 for the pitch plane), as well as head turns speed (R 2 = 0.96), showed good correlation between the calculated and ground truth values provided by experts' annotations. The posture assessment algorithm resulted to accuracy = 0.83, while the gait metrics were validated against two well-established gait analysis systems (R 2 = 0.78 for double support, R 2 = 0.71 for single support, R 2 = 0.80 for step time, R 2 = 0.75 for stride time (WinTrack©), R 2 = 0.82 for cadence, and R 2 = 0.79 for stride time (RehaGait©). Validation results provided evidence that the proposed system can accurately capture and assess a physiotherapy exercise within the balance disorders context, thus providing a robust basis for the virtual coaching ecosystem and thereby improve a patient's commitment to rehabilitation programs while enhancing the quality of the performed exercises. In summary, virtual coaching can improve the quality of the home-based rehabilitation programs as long as it is combined with accurate motion capture and assessment modules, which provides to the virtual coach the capacity to tailor the interaction with the patient and deliver personalized experience."

            "abstract": "Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not \"real food\". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects. The complexity and the predicted immense size of these tasks calls for open innovation mentality and a new mindset promoting multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships between academia and industry."

            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      Chiropterophillous and ornithophillous characteristics can form part of a single reproductive strategy in plants that have flowers with diurnal and nocturnal anthesis. This broader pollination strategy can ensure seed set when pollinators are scarce or unpredictable. This appears to be true of hummingbirds, which presumably pollinate Marginatocereus marginatus, a columnar cactus with red nocturnal and diurnal flowers growing as part of dense bat-pollinated columnar cacti forests in arid regions of central Mexico. The aim of this study was to study the floral biology of M. marginatus, and evaluate the effectiveness of nocturnal vs. diurnal pollinators and the contribution of each pollinator group to overall plant fitness.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Individual flower buds were marked and followed to evaluate flower phenology and anthesis time. Flowers and nectar production were measured. An exclusion experiment was conducted to measure the relative contribution of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators to seed set.\n    \n\n\n          Key results:\n        \n      \n      Marginatocereus marginatus has red hermaphroditic flowers with nocturnal and diurnal anthesis. The plant cannot produce seeds by selfing and was pollinated during the day by hummingbirds and during the night by bats, demonstrating that both pollinator groups were important for plant reproduction. Strong pollen limitation was found in the absence of one of the pollinator guilds.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Marginatocereus marginatus has an open pollination system in which both diurnal and nocturnal pollinators are needed to set seeds. This represents a fail-safe pollination system that can ensure both pollination, in a situation of low abundance of one of the pollinator groups (hummingbirds), and high competition for nocturnal pollinators with other columnar cacti that bloom synchronously with M. marginatus in the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico."

            "abstract": "Fruit ripening represents a process that changes flavor and appearance and also a process that dramatically increases fruit softening. Fruit softening and textural variations mainly result from disruptions to the cell walls of the fruit throughout ripening, but the exact mechanisms and specific modifications of the cell wall remain unclear. Plant-specific GRAS proteins play a critical role in development and growth. To date, few GRAS genes have been functionally categorized in tomato. The expression of a novel GRAS gene described in this study and designated as SlFSR (fruit shelf-life regulator) specifically increased during fruit ripening, but was significantly decreased in the tomato mutant rin (ripening inhibitor). RNAi repression of SlFSR resulted in reduced expression of multiple cell wall modification-related genes, decreased the activities of PG (polygalacturonase), TBG (tomato β-galactosidase), CEL (cellulase), and XYL (β-D-xylosidase), and significantly prolonged fruit shelf-life. Furthermore, overexpression of SlFSR in mutant rin gave rise to up-regulated expression of multiple cell wall modification-related genes, such as PG, TBG4, CEL2, XYL1, PL, PE, MAN1, EXP1, and XTH5, and significantly shortened the fruit shelf-life. These findings reveal some of the genetic mechanisms underlying fruit cell wall metabolism and suggest that the SlFSR gene is another potential biotechnological target for the control of tomato fruit shelf-life."

            "abstract": "The relation among the various causal factors of obesity is not well understood, and there remains a lack of viable data to advance integrated, systems models of its etiology. The collection of big data has begun to allow the exploration of causal associations between behavior, built environment, and obesity-relevant health outcomes. Here, the traditional epidemiologic and emerging big data approaches used in obesity research are compared, describing the research questions, needs, and outcomes of 3 broad research domains: eating behavior, social food environments, and the built environment. Taking tangible steps at the intersection of these domains, the recent European Union project \"BigO: Big data against childhood obesity\" used a mobile health tool to link objective measurements of health, physical activity, and the built environment. BigO provided learning on the limitations of big data, such as privacy concerns, study sampling, and the balancing of epidemiologic domain expertise with the required technical expertise. Adopting big data approaches will facilitate the exploitation of data concerning obesity-relevant behaviors of a greater variety, which are also processed at speed, facilitated by mobile-based data collection and monitoring systems, citizen science, and artificial intelligence. These approaches will allow the field to expand from causal inference to more complex, systems-level predictive models, stimulating ambitious and effective policy interventions."

            "abstract": "The colour of papaya fruit flesh is determined largely by the presence of carotenoid pigments. Red-fleshed papaya fruit contain lycopene, whilst this pigment is absent from yellow-fleshed fruit. The conversion of lycopene (red) to beta-carotene (yellow) is catalysed by lycopene beta-cyclase. This present study describes the cloning and functional characterization of two different genes encoding lycopene beta-cyclases (lcy-beta1 and lcy-beta2) from red (Tainung) and yellow (Hybrid 1B) papaya cultivars. A mutation in the lcy-beta2 gene, which inactivates enzyme activity, controls lycopene production in fruit and is responsible for the difference in carotenoid production between red and yellow-fleshed papaya fruit. The expression level of both lcy-beta1 and lcy-beta2 genes is similar and low in leaves, but lcy-beta2 expression increases markedly in ripe fruit. Isolation of the lcy-beta2 gene from papaya, that is preferentially expressed in fruit and is correlated with fruit colour, will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for fruit colour in papaya and should create possibilities for metabolic engineering of carotenoid production in papaya fruit to alter both colour and nutritional properties."
