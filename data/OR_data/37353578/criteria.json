            "criteria": "The eligibility criteria were developed using the population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study type (PICOS)70 framework as follows: Population: any population; Intervention: Any intervention targeting physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet or sleep, that involved a chatbot. The following definition of chatbot was used: Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, employ dialog systems to enable natural language conversations with users using speech and/or text21. This included any type of text and/or voice/speech-based chatbot (with or without visual output, e.g., graphs) operating as standalone software or via a web browser or mobile application, and/or diverse platforms (e.g., Slack, Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, virtual/embodied agent, SMS). Studies were eligible irrespective of intervention modality (i.e., standalone software or web-browser), supervision or setting (i.e., used in a laboratory setting vs. at home vs. healthcare setting) or dose (frequency, intensity and duration). Comparator: Studies were eligible if they involved any comparison condition (e.g., usual care or an equal attention intervention), or no comparison (e.g., single group pre-post studies). Outcomes: Any outcome related to physical activity, diet or sleep. Study type: Any experimental study design.",
