Efforts to eradicate open defecation andimprove sanitationaccessare unlikely to achieve healthbeneﬁtsunless
interventions reduce microbial exposures. This study assessed human fecal contamination and pathogen ex-
posures in rural India, and the effect of increased sanitation coverage on contamination and exposure rates. In a
cross-sectional study of 60 villages of a cluster-randomized controlled sanitation trial in Odisha, India, human
and domestic animal fecal contamination was measured in community tubewells and ponds (n ¼ 301) and via
exposure pathways in homes (n¼ 354), using Bacteroidales microbial sourcetracking fecal markers validated in
India. Community water sources were further tested for diarrheal pathogens (rotavirus, adenovirus and Vibrio
cholerae by quantitative PCR; pathogenic Escherichia coli by multiplex PCR; Cryptosporidium and Giardia by
immunomagnetic separation and direct ﬂuorescent antibody microscopy). Exposure pathways in intervention
and control villages were compared and relationships with child diarrhea examined. Human fecal markers
were rarely detected in tubewells (2.4%, 95%CI: 0.3e4.5%) and ponds (5.6%, 95%CI: 0.8e10.3%), compared to
homes (35.4%, 95%CI: 30.4e40.4%). In tubewells, V. cholerae was the most frequently detected pathogen (19.8%,
95%CI: 14.4e25.2%), followed by Giardia (14.8%, 95%CI: 10.0e19.7%). In ponds, Giardia was most often detected
(74.5%, 95%CI: 65.7e83.3%), followed by pathogenic E. coli (48.1%, 95%CI: 34.8e61.5%) and rotavirus (44.4%, 95%
CI: 34.2e54.7%). At village-level, prevalence of fecal pathogen detection in community drinking water sources
was associated with elevated prevalence of child diarrhea within 6 weeks of testing (RR 2.13, 95%CI: 1.25e3.63)
while within homes, higher levels of human and animal fecal markerdetectionwere associated with increased
risks of subsequent child diarrhea (P ¼ 0.044 and 0.013, respectively). There was no evidence that the inter-
vention, which increased functional latrine coverage and use by 27 percentage points, reduced human fecal
contamination in any tested pathway, nor the prevalence of pathogens in water sources. In conclusion, the
study demonstrates that (1) improved sanitation alone may be insufﬁcient and further interventions needed in
the domestic domain to reduce widespread human and animal fecal contamination observed in homes, (2)
pathogens detected in tubewells indicate these sources are microbiologically unsafe for drinking and were
associated with child diarrhea, (3) domestic use of ponds heavily contaminated with multiple pathogens
presents an under-recognized health risk, and (4) a 27 percentage point increase in improved sanitation access
at village-level did not reduce detectable human fecal and pathogen contamination in this setting.

1. Introduction
Despite reductions in global child mortality, an estimated 6.6
million children under age ﬁve still died in 2012, of which 22% were
in India (UNICEF, 2013). Diarrheal diseases associated with poor
sanitation are a leading cause of child deaths in developing coun-
tries, accounting for an estimated 13% of the deaths in India (Liu
et al., 2012). While proper excreta disposal through good sanita-
tion is necessary to reduce this disease burden, the impact of a
speciﬁc sanitation intervention on health within a given setting is
not always guaranteed as demonstrated by two recent evaluations
of the Indian government's rural sanitation program (Clasen et al.,
2014; Patil et al., 2014). Lack of measurable health impact may
occur when the sanitation intervention does not adequately disrupt
fecal-oral pathogen transmission pathways and/or address critical
sources operating in the intervention setting. Pathways and sources
have generally been difﬁcult to assess using traditional fecal indi-
cator bacteria (FIB) of microbial exposure such as total coliforms,
thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli, and members of the
genus Enterococcus (the enterococci). FIB can originate from both
humans and animals, and have been found in environments where
fecal contamination is improbable, due to the presence of natu-
ralized FIB and the ability to grow outside their hosts (Ishii et al.,
2006; Leclerc et al., 2001; Power and Nagy, 1999). To move un-
derstanding forward, efforts using new research tools are needed to
shed light on gastro-intestinal pathogen transmission pathways,
pathogen sources, and the mechanisms by which different water,
sanitation and hygiene interventions interrupt key pathways in
diarrheal disease burden settings.
In this research, we apply advanced microbial source tracking
(MST) techniques to assess human-associated fecal exposure in the
public and domestic domains of 30 intervention and 30 control
villages of a large cluster-randomized controlled trial of impacts of
improved household sanitation on health in rural India (the Sani-
tation Trial) (Clasen et al., 2012), and examine the effect of
increased intervention latrine coverage on fecal exposure via
different pathways in the community. We employ a set of MST
host-associated fecal Bacteroidales assays recently validated to
distinguish and quantify human versus non-human livestock and
other domestic animal sources of fecal contamination in the study
area (Odagiri et al., 2015).
The primary objectives were to (1) measure prevalence of hu-
man and animal fecal contamination of community water sources,
and of household stored drinking water and mothers' and chil-
dren's hands; (2) assess the microbiological safety of community
water sources by measuring locally important child diarrhea-
causing pathogens; and (3) examine the effect of increased
latrine coverage in intervention villages on contamination and
pathogen exposure rates. In a secondary analysis, we explore as-
sociations between detected human and animal fecal contamina-
tion in homes and household child diarrhea, and between observed
pathogen contamination of village water sources and village-wide
child diarrhea prevalence to shed light on potential diarrheal
pathogen transmission pathways and sources operating in study
communities.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study setting
The study was carried out in Puri District in Odisha, India in a
subset of 30 intervention and 30 control villages of the Sanitation
Trial. The Sanitation Trial design, pour-ﬂush latrine construction
intervention, study setting and population characteristics have
been described elsewhere (Boisson et al., 2014; Clasen et al., 2012).
Brieﬂy, key characteristics of the study population include (1) low
sanitation coverage prior to the intervention (10% of households);
(2) high access to improved drinking water sources such as public
(deep groundwater) and private (shallow groundwater) tubewells
(82% of households); (3) daily usage of open ponds for non-
drinking purposes including anal cleansing after defecation, bath-
ing, brushing teeth and domestic hygiene activities (>50% of
households); and (4) livestock ownership (59% of households),
comprising cattle (most frequently owned), sheep, goat and buffalo.
The latrine promotion and construction program in intervention
villages was undertaken between January 2011 and January 2012,
yielding mean village-level coverage with functional latrines in the
intervention and control villages of the present study of 37.5% and
10.2%, respectively.
2.2. Village and household selection
Each Sanitation Trial intervention village (n ¼ 50) was uniquely
paired with one nearby control village (n ¼ 50), and 30 pairs
randomly selected into this study. Testing occurred in each village
of a pair on consecutive days to minimize spatial and temporal
confounding over the monsoon season study period. Twelve pairs
were sampled in 2012 from June 19th to July 26th; 18 pairs in 2013
from June 26th to August 22nd. In each village, households with a
child under 5 enrolled in the Sanitation Trial health surveillance
study were stratiﬁed based on drinking public or private tubewell
water, and three households in each stratum randomly selected for
testing. In total, 354 households were sampled.
2.3. Community water source selection
Two public tubewells (deep groundwater), two private tube-
wells (shallow groundwater) and two open ponds (surface water)
in each village were tested, unless fewer existed. Further details are
provided in Supplemental Material. Sources were each sampled
once, during or just after household sampling between 8 and 11
a.m. In total, 111 public and 98 private tubewells, and 94 open
ponds were sampled.
2.4. Sample collection
2.4.1. Community water sources
A 20-L sample was collected for molecular analysis as previously
described (Schriewer et al., 2015). For thermotolerant coliform
(TTC; also known as fecal coliform) measurement, an additional
100-mL sample was collected in a sterile 4-oz Whirl-Pak (NASCO
Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI). Samples were placed on ice, transported
to a laboratory in Bhubaneshwar, and processed within 8 h of
collection.
2.4.2. Household stored drinking water and hand rinses
Approximately 500 mL of stored drinking water (SDW) was
collected for molecular analysis and a further 100 mL separately
collected for TTC measurement using sterile 69-oz and 4-oz Whirl-
Paks, respectively. The collectable amount of SDW was limited by
the small volumes of stored drinking water and unwillingness of
households to give all of it for research purposes. Hand rinses (HR)
were obtained from the mother and youngest child following a
published protocol (Pickering et al., 2010). Because recent house-
hold activities can signiﬁcantly affect the level of hand fecal
contamination (Devamani et al., 2014; Pickering et al., 2011), we
standardized HR collection times, resulting in 76% and 75%,
respectively, of intervention and control villages’ HR samples
collected when mothers were preparing or eating foods.

2.5. Sample processing
2.5.1. Community water source samples
Each 20-L sample was ﬁltered on the day of collection using a
hollow ﬁber ultraﬁltration system according to a published protocol
(Bambic et al., 2011). For molecular analysis, 2.5 mL of the RNA/DNA
stabilizing agent RNALater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added to the
same amount of the ﬁltration retentate, mixed well, and stored
at 70 C for up to two months until transport back to the University
of California, Davis (UCD) for analysis. For protozoa analysis, 50 mL of
the ﬁltration retentate was separately kept at 4 C for up to one week.
For quality assurance, 10% of samples were assigned to ﬁeld blanks,
ﬁltration blanks and duplicates, and were similarly processed.
2.5.2. Household stored drinking water and hand rinse samples
Samples were ﬁltered with 47-mm, 0.45-mm Millipore HA ﬁlters
(Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for molecular analysis.
Filtered volumes varied depending on the sample type and
turbidity (details in Supplemental Material). Prior to molecular
ﬁltration of HR samples, an aliquot (up to 10 mL) was hygienically
removed for TTC testing. After ﬁltration, each membrane was
placed into a 5-mL cryogenic tube containing 0.5 mL of RNALater.
Tubes were stored at 70 C for up to two months until transport
back to UCD. Field blanks and lab ﬁltration blanks each made up 8%
of total samples.
2.6. Microbiological and physicochemical measurements
2.6.1. Thermotolerant coliforms
All samples were analyzed for TTC within 6 h of collection using
the
membrane
ﬁltration
method
(Eaton
et
al.,
2012).
See
Supplemental Material for testing details, detection limits, assigned
values for non-detect (ND) and too numerous to count (TNTC)
samples, and correlation with MST markers.
2.6.2. Molecular analyses
DNA and RNA extraction methods, and detection methods and
marker
targets
for
each
molecular
assay
are
described
in
Supplemental Material. Nucleic acid extracts from all sample types
were tested for total-, human- and animal-associated Bacteroidales
using the quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays BacUni, BacHum and Bac-
Cow, respectively, following developer's protocols (Kildare et al.,
2007). These assays were recently evaluated in Odisha, India, to be
the most suited for distinguishing human from non-human animal
(domestic and livestock) hosts in the study region (Odagiri et al.,
2015). Due to observed cross-reactivity of the human-associated
assay, BacHum, with dog feces (Odagiri et al., 2015), we tested all
BacHum-positive samples for dog-associated Bacteroidales using
BacCan (Kildare et al., 2007), also validated in India by Odagiri et al.,
to conﬁrm absence of dog fecal contamination. BacHum was also
reported by Odagiri to cross-react with chicken feces. However, only
7 out of 354 sampled households owned chickens, reducing the
likelihood of false-positives from chicken feces. Results are given in
gene copies (gc) per mL for water samples or per two hands for HRs.
Sample limitof detection (SLOD) values for each assayare reported in
Supplemental Material. Different SLOD for each sample can bias
presence/absence results. For fair comparison of detection rates,
therefore, we removed SLOD outlier samples (>3s þ the mean SLOD)
for each sample type prior to data analysis and any sample with a
concentration below the maximum SLOD of non-detected samples
was classiﬁed as below the presence/absence detection limit.
2.6.3. Pathogen analyses
Nucleic acid extracts from community water source samples
were analyzed for rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41 and Vibrio cholerae
possessing the ctxA gene via qPCR following original developers’
protocols (Blackstone et al., 2007; Jothikumar et al., 2009; Rajal
et al., 2007). SLODs for each assay are provided in Supplemental
Material. For protozoa, Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts
were further concentrated via immunomagnetic separation (IMS)
following ultraﬁltration, and enumerated using direct ﬂuorescent
antibody (DFA) microscopy as described elsewhere (Daniels et al.,
2015). Community water source samples collected in 2013 and
positive for TTC were analyzed for pathogenic Escherichia coli by
three multiplex conventional PCR assays according to Mattioli et al.
(2013). Seven virulent genes were detected: aggR (EAEC), eaeA
(EHEC/EPEC), stx1 (EHEC), stx2 (EHEC), ipaH (EIEC and Shigella spp.),
lt1 (ETEC) and st1b (ETEC). All pathogen assays were validated on
site against clinically positive stool samples or pathogen-positive
isolates obtained from local diarrhea patients in the study region
prior to use, and later, a subset of pathogen-positive water samples
were sequenced to conﬁrm qPCR target genes (see Supplemental
Material).
2.6.4. pH and turbidity
pH and turbidity of HR samples collected in 2012 and all sam-
ples collected in 2013 were measured using pH and turbidity me-
ters (135, SYSTRONICS, India). See Supplemental Material for
descriptive, correlation, and comparison statistics.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted in SPSS ver. 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant in all analyses.
2.7.1. Effect of increased latrine coverage on transmission routes
We tested whether intervention villages compared to controls
had less frequent detection of: (1) total and human fecal makers in
any tested transmission route, and (2) target pathogens in com-
munity water sources. To test each pathway (i.e. sample type),
except hands, we used Poisson regression (log-link) with general-
ized estimated equations (GEE), robust standard errors and
exchangeable correlation structure to account for village-level
clustering. Because fecal contamination on mothers' and chil-
dren's hands was strongly correlated (Schriewer et al., 2015), mixed
effects logistic regression with random intercepts for village and
household (accounting for clustering at each level) was used to
compare prevalence of hand contamination.
Concentration of total fecal markers was also compared be-
tween intervention and control villages. Non-detected samples
were assigned half their SLOD value. Due to a skewed distribution
with zero inﬂation, gene copy counts were collapsed into log10
categories (0e1 gc, 1e10 gc, 11e100 gc, etc. per mL or two hands)
and analyzed using ordered logistic regression with robust stan-
dard errors (to account for village-level clustering). Finally, we
examined village-level detection rates for fecal and pathogen
contamination for differences attributable to increased sanitation
coverage
using
negative
binomial
regression
(details
in
Supplemental Material).
2.7.2. Microbial contamination, exposure pathways and child
diarrhea
We examined whether households with human and animal
fecal contamination (indicated by MST markers) had increased risk
of under-5 child diarrhea, based on the 7-day period prevalence of
child diarrhea measured by the Sanitation Trial within 6 weeks of
testing. Speciﬁcally, we tested whether increasing levels of house-
hold human or animal fecal marker contamination were associated
with subsequent household child diarrhea in MST sampled
households, using logistic regression with GEE, robust standard
M. Odagiri et al. / Water Research 100 (2016) 232e244
234

errors, and exchangeable correlation structure. Three levels of
contamination were deﬁned: (1) all tested pathways (i.e. SDW,
mother's hands, child's hands) were negative for the target marker,
(2) some (but not all) were positive, and (3) all were positive.
We also examined whether the extent or type of detected
diarrhea pathogen contamination of a village's community drink-
ing water or bathing sources was associated with subsequent
village-level child diarrhea prevalence rates, based on the 7-day
period prevalence for all under-5 children in the village measured
by the Sanitation Trial within 6 weeks of testing. Speciﬁcally, we
tested whether more frequent detection of pathogens in ground-
water drinking and/or domestic pond sources was associated with
increased child diarrhea prevalence in the village following detec-
tion, using negative binomial regression with a log link function
and robust standard errors.
For these analyses, study villages with a Sanitation Trial diarrhea
surveillance visit (Clasen et al., 2014) occurring within 6 weeks
following the date of environmental sampling (n ¼ 37 of 60 vil-
lages) were included on the basis that the incubation period for
diarrheal pathogens in an exposed child is no longer than 6 weeks.
Therefore, only one diarrhea surveillance observation per MST
household in the household-level analysis, and per MST village in
the village-level analysis, was used. See Supplemental Material for
modeling details and descriptive statistics of dependent and in-
dependent variables.
3. Results
3.1. Human fecal contamination of community water sources,
stored drinking water and hands
Among community water sources, more than half of public
(50.0%, 95%CI: 40.7e59.3%) and private tubewells (63.3%, 95%CI:
53.7e72.8%), and all ponds (100%) were positive for total fecal
markers (BacUni) (Fig. 1). TTC were detected less often, in 28.6%
(95%CI: 19.9e37.2%) and 37.2% (95%CI: 27.5e47.0%) of public and
private tubewells, respectively, and 88.9% (95%CI: 82.4e95.4%) of
ponds. Human fecal contamination (BacHum) of community water
sources was rarely detected (2.8% [95%CI: 0.0e5.8%] of public and
2.1% [95%CI: 0.0e4.9%] of private tubewells, and 5.6% [95%CI:
0.8e10.3%] of ponds) (Fig. 1). Animal fecal markers (BacCow) were
frequently detected in ponds (63.0%, 95%CI: 53.2e72.9%), but less
frequently in tubewell drinking sources (6.3%, 95%CI: 3.0e9.7%).
In homes, total fecal contamination (BacUni) was detected in
52.9%
(95%CI:
47.6e58.1%)
of
SDW
and
on
69.9%
(95%CI:
66.5e73.4%) of hands; TTC was detected more frequently in SDW
(73.6%,
95%CI:
68.9e78.4%)
than
on
hands
(58.9%,
95%CI:
55.1e62.7%). Detection of human fecal markers was similar in SDW
(19.4%,
95%CI:
15.2e23.6%)
and
on
hands
(18.0%,
95%CI:
15.1e20.9%), while animal fecal markers were more frequently
detected in both sample types (32.7% [95%CI: 27.7e37.6%] of SDW
and 71.5% [95%CI: 68.1e74.9%] of hands) (Fig. 1). Considering SDW
or hands detected with fecal markers as evidence of contamination
in the home, more than 70% of households had detectable total and
animal fecal contamination, whereas 35% had detected human fecal
contamination. Fecal marker and TTC concentration results are
reported in Supplemental Material (Tables S2 and S3).
3.2. Seasonal variability of fecal contamination
The prevalence of fecal contamination of community water
sources did not differ between 2012 and 2013, except for TTC in
public tubewells and animal fecal markers (BacCow) in ponds, for
which detection rates were signiﬁcantly lower in 2013 (Table S2,
Supplemental
Material).
Unlike
community
water
sources,
household samples generally showed signiﬁcantly less contami-
nation in 2013 than in 2012 for each MST marker, except for human
fecal markers in SDW (Table S3, Supplemental Material).
To further explore apparent seasonal differences in domestic
domain fecal contamination, the temporal proportion of sampled
households with detected contamination during the 2012 and 2013
monsoon sampling seasons was plotted for each MST marker
(Fig. 2). Two interesting trends emerge. First, contamination rates
in 2012 and 2013 were similar for all three fecal markers during the
early part of the monsoon season (i.e. before July 28th), followed by
a notable drop after July 28th, when sampling occurred in 2013
only. Second, rates of homes contaminated with total and animal
fecal markers (Fig. 2a and c) were consistently at or near 100% both
years during the early part of the monsoon season, whereas rates of
homes contaminated with human fecal markers steadily declined
from 100% to 0% as the season progressed in both years. Unlike the
temporal patterns of fecal contamination in homes, rates of
contamination of local groundwater sources showed no clear trend
during the ﬁrst part of the monsoon season in either year (Fig. S1,
Supplemental Material). There is some evidence in the 2013 sam-
pling season of reduced contamination after July 28th. Thus, much
of the apparent difference in observed contamination between
2012 and 2013 seems to result from the longer 2013 sampling
season which extended into and throughout the much wetter
monsoon month of August.
3.3. Pathogen contamination of community water sources
A wide range of pathogens was detected in local groundwater
sources used for drinking (Fig. 3). Vibrio cholerae (ctxA gene) was
frequently detected in both public and private tubewells (12.8%,
95%CI: 6.6e19.1% and 27.6%, 95%CI: 18.7e36.4%, respectively).
Protozoan pathogens were also detected with relatively high fre-
quencies in these sources; 13.5% (95%CI: 7.2e19.9%) of public and
7.1% (95%CI: 2.0e12.2%) of private tubewells were positive for
Cryptosporidium, while Giardia was detected in 11.7% (95%CI:
5.7e17.7%) of public and 18.4% (95%CI: 10.7e26.0%) of private
tubewells. Among viral pathogens, rotavirus was most often
detected (8.3% [95%CI: 3.1e13.4%] in public and 8.2% [95%CI:
2.7e13.6%] in private tubewells). Adenovirus 40/41 and seven
pathogenic E. coli virulent genes were rarely detected in any
tubewells (Fig. 3).

Compared to protected groundwater sources, as might be ex-
pected, pathogens were detected with greater frequency and/or at
higher concentrations in community ponds, with one exception:
V. cholerae was never detected (Fig. 3). Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium,
Giardia and at least one of the seven pathogenic E. coli virulent
genes were detected in 44.9% (95%CI: 34.6e55.3%), 37.2% (95%CI:
27.5e57.0%), 74.5% (65.7e83.3%) and 48.1% (34.8e61.7%) of ponds,
respectively. Of the seven pathogenic E. coli virulent genes tested,
eaeA (EHEC/EPEC) was most frequently detected, followed by aggR
(EAEC) (detailed results in Table S6, Supplemental Material).
Adenovirus 40/41 was rarely detected in ponds (Fig. 3), similar to
groundwater sources, but at higher concentrations. Overall, 31.5%
(95%CI: 22.9e40.2%) of public and 39.8% (95%CI: 30.1e49.5%) of
private tubewells, and 89.4% (95%CI: 83.1e95.6%) of ponds were
positive for at least one of ﬁve pathogens measured (excluding
pathogenic E. coli). Pathogen concentrations are reported in Sup-
plemental Material (Table S5).
3.4. Seasonal variability of pathogen contamination
Detection of each tested pathogen in public tubewells was
signiﬁcantly lower in 2013 than in 2012 (Table S5, Supplemental
Material). Similarly, every pathogen was less frequently detected in
private tubewells in 2013, but only differences for V. cholerae and
Giardia were statistically signiﬁcant (Table S5, Supplemental Ma-
terial). Consistent evidence for reduced pathogen contamination
rates in 2013 in surface ponds was not found. While detection of
Cryptosporidium was signiﬁcantly lower in 2013, for Giardia, it was
also lower but the difference was not signiﬁcant, whereas for
rotavirus it was signiﬁcantly higher and remained essentially un-
changed for adenovirus and V. cholerae.
The proportion of a village's community water sources with at
least one detectable pathogen, excluding pathogenic E. coli, was
plotted to examine temporal patterns of exposure to pathogens via
community water sources during the two monsoon seasons (Fig. 4;
each day is one village). The percentage of a village's tested tube-
wells positive for any pathogen remained at or above 50%

cholerae and any of 7 tested pathogenic Escherichia coli virulence genes) and protozoan

throughout the sampling period of 2012, except in two villages,
whereas in 2013 it was consistently low, at or below 25%, except for
some sporadic increases later in the season (Fig. 4a). In contrast,
tested ponds showed no notable differences between years nor any
temporal trend with respect to pathogen contamination (Fig. 4b).
Regardless of time, most villages had ponds with at least one
detectable pathogen measured, and only seven villages had ‘safe’
ponds (i.e. none of ﬁve pathogens, excluding pathogenic E. coli,
detected).
3.5. Effect of increased latrine coverage on fecal contamination
There was no signiﬁcant reduction between intervention and
control villages in the prevalence of TTC, total, human or animal
fecal contamination (Fig. 5), nor in log10 concentrations of total
fecal markers (Table 1), for any public or domestic domain tested
transmission pathway (i.e. any sample type). There was, however,
suggestive evidence that intervention villages had more fecal
contamination in their water sources. More frequent detection of
fecal contamination as measured by both TTC and total Bacter-
oidales was found in drinking sources (i.e. public and private
tubewells combined) in intervention compared to control villages
(Relative Risk: 2.18, 95%CI: 1.13, 4.23, and 1.28, 95%CI: 0.97e1.68,
respectively) (Fig. 5). Drinking sources in intervention villages also
showed evidence of higher log10 levels of total Bacteroidales
markers (ordered logistic regression Odds Ratio: 1.77, 95%CI:
0.97e1.68) (Table 1). A weak trend was also found of more human
fecal contamination in ponds of intervention villages. However, the
small number of sampled ponds with human contamination (n ¼ 5)
created a wide conﬁdence interval (Relative Risk: 4.0, 95%CI:
0.47e34.5) (Fig. 5). There was also suggestive evidence that SDW in
intervention villages was more likely to contain animal fecal
markers (Relative Risk: 1.46, 95%CI: 0.90e2.37) (Fig. 5). No effect of
increased latrine coverage was observed on the village-level pro-
portion of tested households positive for total, human or animal
fecal markers either (Relative Risk: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.72e1.29; 1.06,
95%CI: 0.65e1.73; and 1.07, 95%CI: 0.88e1.29, respectively).
3.6. Effect of increased latrine coverage on pathogen contamination
We found no evidence for reduced prevalenceof entericpathogens
in protected groundwater drinking sources in intervention compared
to control villages (Fig. 6). The proportion of tubewells contaminated
with pathogens (excluding pathogenic E. coli) was similar (Relative
risk: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.47e1.50). However, several pathogens were
detected in surface water ponds at signiﬁcantly higher rates in inter-
vention than control villages. Cryptosporidium and pathogenic E. coli,
speciﬁcally aggR and eaeA genes (commonly found in EAEC and EHEC/
EPEC, respectively) were detected 2.00 (95%CI: 1.13e3.55), 4.31 (95%
CI: 1.02e18.27) and 5.92 (95%CI: 1.48e23.70) times more often,
respectively, in intervention than control village ponds.
3.7. Associations between fecal and pathogen contamination rates
and child diarrhea
Levels of human and of animal contamination in the home were
signiﬁcantly associated with occurrence of reported child diarrhea
within 6 weeks after household sampling (Table 2). Compared to
households with no detected contamination of exposure pathways
(all samples negative for the MST marker), households where all
three pathways (samples) had detected human markers or detected
animal markers showed 4.18 (95%CI: 1.30e13.46) and 4.54 (95%CI:
1.17e17.59) higher likelihood of having a child with reported diar-
rhea. We also found strong statistical evidence of a positive associ-
ation between the proportion of a community's drinking water
tubewells positive for any tested pathogen (excluding pathogenic
E. coli) and child diarrhea prevalence in the community following
exposure (Table 3). The proportion of ponds detected with any
pathogen was not associated with an increased prevalence of child
diarrhea (RR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.36e2.53). Further analysis of speciﬁc
pathogens detected in tubewell drinking sources at village-level
revealed that child diarrhea prevalence was 1.84 (95%CI: 1.19e2.85)
times higher when V. cholerae was detected and 1.48 times higher
(95%CI:0.89e2.44)when Giardiawas detected(Table3). Ontheother
hand, detection of rotavirus inponds was associated with lower child
diarrhea prevalence (RR 0.64, 95%CI: 0.41e1.02).
4. Discussion
4.1. Human fecal and pathogen contamination in study villages
4.1.1. Improved groundwater drinking sources
More than 50% of tubewells had detectable fecal contamination
measured by the total Bacteroidales fecal marker. We identiﬁed

rotavirus, adenovirus, V. cholerae, Cryptosporidium or Giardia) in each village. Pathogenic E. coli was excluded because it was not measured in both years. Black circles and empty
circles denote year of 2012 and 2013, respectively. Each circle is one village.

both humans (n ¼ 4 TWs) and domestic animals (n ¼ 13 TWs) as
host sources of observed contamination, but were unable to iden-
tify the primary source of fecal contamination in many cases due to
low levels of contamination. A recent systematic review docu-
mented
widespread
fecal
contamination
of
drinking
water
including improved water sources in developing countries, espe-
cially in rural areas (Bain et al., 2014). Our results support these
ﬁndings, and cast doubt on the assumption that improved water
sources are microbiologically safe in estimating the 2010 global
burden of disease (Lim et al., 2012).
Surprisingly, more than 30% of protected groundwater drinking
sources had at least one detectable diarrheal pathogen among the
ﬁve we tested consistently. Vibrio cholerae was detected most
frequently (19.8%) at very low concentrations (geometric mean of
positives 3 gc/mL), although no cholera outbreaks were reported in
the study communities during sampling in 2012 and 2013. Flood-

risks for adenovirus in public tubewells and ponds were not calculated due to the small number of detected sources (n ¼ 2 and n ¼ 3, respectively). Relative risks for pathogenic

was not detected in open ponds.

associated cholera outbreaks have been reported in some parts of
Odisha (Chhotray et al., 2002, Kumar et al., 2009; Pal et al., 2010). V.
cholerae is known to be present naturally in aquatic environments
associated with copepod species of zooplankton (Colwell, 1996). As
we never detected V. cholerae in freshwater ponds, and detection
rates were greater in shallow private tubewells than in deep public
tubewells, one plausible mechanism for V. cholerae contamination
of subsurface groundwater in the study area is the aquifer intrusion
of estuary or coastal water carrying plankton (Constantin de Magny
et al., 2008). Other pathogens, including rotavirus, Cryptosporidium
and Giardia, were detected in 8.2e14.8% of protected groundwater
sources, presenting signiﬁcant drinking water microbial risks in
these communities. Indeed, we found a signiﬁcantly increased
village prevalence of child diarrhea in the 6 weeks following sam-
pling for each additional tubewell detected with a tested diarrheal
pathogen. Pathogens in protected groundwater sources, commonly
used for drinking without disinfection in developing countries,
have been reported elsewhere. In rural Bangladesh, shallow tube-
wells were found to be contaminated with multiple pathogens
including pathogenic E. coli, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp. and rotavirus
(Ferguson et al., 2012). Viral contamination with rotavirus and
adenovirus was detected in 14% and 2% of wells, respectively, in
rural Benin, West Africa, where the presence of latrines within a
50 m radius appeared to be a risk factor (Verheyen et al., 2009).
We did not observe any notable temporal pattern in the pro-
portion of tubewells positive for total fecal markers, or any path-
ogens, during the monsoon season. In contrast, the annual
difference in pathogen detection rates was signiﬁcant, with much
less detection in 2013. Across Sanitation Trial villages, child diar-
rhea prevalence varied over time, and lower child diarrhea preva-
lence was observed during 2013 than during 2012 (Clasen et al.,
2014), consistent with the between-years difference in pathogen
contamination observed in improved groundwater sources. A re-
view of long-term child diarrhea prevalence data in Pakistan also
found large variability in prevalence rates from year to year, indi-
cating highly variable exposure to gastrointestinal pathogens be-
tween years (Luby et al., 2011). Dilution effects due to heavier
rainfall in 2013 might partially explain less frequent detection of
pathogens in 2013. Examining local station daily rainfall data in
June and July of 2012 and 2013 suggests that rainfall in 2013 was
marginally signiﬁcantly greater in one study block (Puri) (7.9 mm/
day in 2012 vs. 13.3 mm/day in 2013, Mann-Whitney U test,

p ¼ 0.07), but not in three other study blocks (Gop, Pipili and
Nimapara).
4.1.2. Domestic surface water sources
Despite continued open defecation across study areas, human
fecal markers were rarely detected in community ponds, likely due
to a relatively high concentration of human feces required for
marker detection (Odagiri et al., 2015; Schriewer et al., 2015). More
than half of ponds had detectable domestic/livestock animal fecal
contamination with patterns persisting during the initial monsoon
season in both years, indicating extensive animal fecal loading in
study communities. Despite infrequent detection of human fecal
markers, we frequently detected multiple diarrheal pathogens in
ponds, including Giardia, pathogenic E. coli virulent genes (espe-
cially, eaeA (EHEC/EPEC), and aggR (EAEC) genes), rotavirus, Cryp-
tosporidium
and
adenovirus
40/41
(in
order
of
frequency),
throughout our monsoon sampling period in both 2012 and 2013.
We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant correlation between detection of
human-associated fecal markers and detection of pathogens in
either improved groundwater drinking sources or domestic surface
water sources (data not shown) due to very few samples positive
for human fecal markers compared to the numbers of samples
positive for pathogens in this study. Poor correlation between
detection of human-associated Bacteroidales genetic markers and
pathogens can arise due to differences in environmental persis-
tence and survival, differences in assay performance, and presence
of pathogen strains or genotypes of non-human origin (i.e. zoonotic
pathogens) (Fremaux et al., 2009; Schriewer et al., 2010).
Recent research in nearby Bangladesh identiﬁed EAEC, EPEC and
rotavirus as among the most frequent probable contributors to
early childhood diarrhea and found that infants were exposed to
multiple pathogens as early as the ﬁrst month of life (Taniuchi et al.,
2013). The GEMS research on causes of child diarrhea identiﬁed
rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as the two most important etiolog-
ical agents in India (Kotloff et al., 2013). Tested ponds were public
and used for multiple purposes including daily bathing, swimming,
brushing teeth, washing utensils, laundry and anal cleansing after
defecation by a majority of the local population in our rural study
communities. Their use presents an under-studied and potentially
under-recognized microbial health risk through direct or indirect
ingestion of pathogenically contaminated pond water.
Of pathogens detected in open ponds, shiga-toxin producing
EHEC, Cryptosporidium and Giardia have been reported to include
zoonotic species (Baldursson and Karanis, 2011; Synge, 2000).
Study area livestock animals appear to have a high prevalence of
Cryptosporidium and Giardia (Daniels et al., 2015). Moreover, ac-
cording to genotyping results of some of our water samples, a
zoonotic type of Giardia was identiﬁed (Ibid). It is also important to
note that we identiﬁed both human and animal rotavirus in open
ponds based on sequencing results from qPCR amplicons of our
rotavirus positive pond samples (data not shown). Despite known
host-speciﬁc infection of rotavirus, re-assortment of animal rota-
virus with human strains could produce a novel strain posing hu-
man health risks (Afrad et al., 2013; Martella et al., 2010). Together
with high prevalence of domestic animal fecal contamination and
detection of possible zoonotic pathogens in open ponds, diarrhea
risks associated with daily domestic activities in ponds need further
investigation as improved household sanitation is unlikely to alter
exposures to zoonotic pathogens.
4.1.3. Home environment (stored drinking water and hands)
Widespread fecal contamination in households was observed.
Total, human and animal fecal markers were detected in 74.2%,
36.2% and 82.2% of households, indicating both human and animal
fecal contamination and exposure are occurring in households.
Human contamination detected on mothers' and children's hands
was highly correlated and each was signiﬁcantly correlated with
human contamination detected in SDW; similar correlations were
found between mothers' hands, children's hands, and SDW for
detected animal fecal contamination in this setting (Schriewer
et al., 2015).
The temporal proportion of households positive for each fecal
marker revealed that villages with ‘clean’ households (i.e. no
detection of any fecal markers in any household tested) were
clustered in time during the later rainy season in 2013 (after July
28th). Research in rural Ecuador found a negative association be-
tween rainfall and microbial contamination of household stored
water during the rainy season, measured by E. coli, possibly due to
reduced water source contamination, increased contaminant dilu-
tion, and/or higher turnover rate of household stored water (Levy
et al., 2009). If mothers' and children's contaminated hands play
a role in the deterioration of the microbiological quality of SDW
(Schriewer et al., 2015), fecal contamination of the home environ-
ment may have declined during the later rainy season in our study
setting through dilution, and/or through weather-induced changes
in mothers' daily routines and behaviors (e.g. switching from open
defecation to latrine use, due to inundation of open land and heavy
rainfall [P. Routray personal communication]) such that mother's
hand contamination was reduced. Research in Tanzania found that
touching environmental surfaces can quickly result in mothers'
hand fecal contamination (Pickering et al., 2011). Another Tanzania
study demonstrated that soil collected from various locations
within
a
household
including
food
preparation
areas
was
contaminated with total and human Bacteroidales as well as path-
ogens (Pickering et al., 2012). Hence, one possible cause of fecal
contamination on mothers' hands could be environmental surfaces
in the home including the soil, for which sufﬁcient continuous
rainfall may be needed before accumulated fecal contamination
from the preceding dry season months (January to June) is diluted
or washed out. Further investigation is needed to understand the
causes and dynamics of household fecal contamination over time,
including prior to and within the rainy season.
4.2. Effect of increased latrine coverage on exposure pathways
We found no evidence that the increase in functional latrine
coverage achieved by the intervention (þ27 points) reduced human
fecal contamination of community surface or groundwater water
sources, or of SDW or hands in the home. Consistent with ﬁnding no
reduction in human fecal contamination, there was also no positive
impact on prevalence of enteric pathogens in improved drinking
water sources. These results help explain the Sanitation Trial
ﬁnding that the intervention had no effect on diarrheal diseases
among children under ﬁve or among all ages (Clasen et al., 2014).
There are several possible explanations for the lack of impact on
human fecal contamination. First, the coverage difference between
intervention and control groups was relatively small (10% vs. 38%).
While 94% of households with a functional latrine were using it,
usage may have been inconsistent and infant and young child feces
were likely to be left in the open (Clasen et al., 2014; Jenkins et al.,
2014). Accumulated environmental contamination from years of
open defecation may take more time to disappear and our sampling
occurred between 6 and 20 months after the intervention ended.
However, a stratiﬁed analysis by year to explore whether lower
groundwater pathogen contamination rates observed in 2013
compared to 2012 could be attributed to the intervention failed to
ﬁnd supportive evidence (See Fig. S2, Supplemental Material).
Alternatively, if fecal loading from sources spread across a much
larger spatial scale is mainly responsible for the observed fecal and
pathogen contamination of exposure pathways in study villages,
M. Odagiri et al. / Water Research 100 (2016) 232e244
241

then within-village sanitation improvements alone would have
little impact.
Contrary to expected positive impacts of increased sanitation
access, we found suggestive evidence of an increase in both the
detection and concentration of total fecal markers and in the
detection of TTC in groundwater in intervention villages (Table 1,
Fig. 5a). When stratiﬁed by year, a nearly signiﬁcant increase in
detection of total fecal makers in groundwater drinking sources due
to the intervention was detected in 2013 but not in 2012 (see Fig. S3,
Supplemental Material), a pattern that is consistent with a rise in
sub-surface contamination with human feces from pour ﬂush soak
pits of newly installed latrines in intervention villages for which
human fecal loading would have ﬁrst started to accumulate in 2012.
Detailed spatial analyses of latrine pit locations, ages, and usage
relative to individual tubewells would be required to conﬁrm po-
tential negative impacts of leaching from household latrines on
fecal and pathogen contamination of groundwater in this setting.
Interestingly, we found signiﬁcantly greater prevalence of Cryp-
tosporidium and two pathogenic E. coli virulent genes, aggR (EAEC)
and eaeA (EHEC/EPEC), in ponds of intervention villages. Univariate
analyses indicate that the occurrence of an extreme daily rainfall
event (deﬁned as rainfall exceeding the 90th percentile of total daily
rainfall) within two days of sampling was signiﬁcantly associated
with increased odds of a pond being positive for Cryptosporidium and
aggR gene (data not shown). Despite our sampling strategy to
minimize the inﬂuence of spatial and temporal confounding by
paringeach interventionvillagewith a unique nearest controlvillage,
the proportion of sampled ponds located in a study block experi-
encing at least one extreme rainfall event in the two days prior to
sampling was signiﬁcantly higher in intervention than control vil-
lages (c2 p < 0.05). This partially explains the greater prevalence of
these pathogens in intervention villages (Young et al., 2015). Addi-
tionally, heterogeneity of pond sampling site factors such as presence
of animals at the time of sampling could be another contributing
reason. Further detailed investigations with longitudinal monitoring
would be necessary to better track temporal changes in the causes
and sources of pathogen contamination in ponds.
4.3. Associations between child diarrhea and human and animal
fecal contamination and pathogen detection
Our ﬁndings that the level of human and of animal fecal
contamination of exposure pathways in households showed sig-
niﬁcant associations with subsequent child diarrhea suggests that
exposure to not only human fecal but also animal fecal contami-
nation may increase the risk of child diarrhea in this setting. This is
consistent with our detecting potential zoonotic diarrhea patho-
gens widely in the study communities and high rates of local ani-
mal pathogen shedding in the study area from known zoonotic
hosts (Daniels et al., 2015). We found that when more of a village's
tubewell drinking sources were detected with a diarrheal path-
ogen, signiﬁcantly higher child diarrhea prevalence was observed
within 6 weeks after testing. Speciﬁcally, detection of V. cholerae in
drinking sources was associated with signiﬁcantly elevated preva-
lence of child diarrhea. However, the ingested V. cholerae in
contaminated drinking water may itself not have caused the
elevated diarrheal risks as it generally requires a large number of
cells (106 to 1011 cells) to infect a host successfully (Schmid-Hempel
and Frank, 2007), and the concentrations we found were consid-
erably lower (arithmetic mean concentration of positives: 104 gc
per L). Additionally, no cholera outbreak was reported during our
sampling periods. Instead, other unmeasured risks for child diar-
rhea may occur when V. cholerae is present in local groundwater in
this setting which due to our cross-sectional design we could not
identify. Interestingly, detection of rotavirus in ponds was nearly
signiﬁcantly associated with a reduced child diarrhea prevalence
rate in the village. A cohort study in India has shown that severity of
diarrhea was signiﬁcantly reduced between second and third in-
fections of rotavirus (Gladstone et al., 2011), supporting the hy-
pothesis that frequent exposures to natural rotavirus in ponds may
help protect against human rotavirus infection among children
under ﬁve.
4.4. Limitations
Every effort was made to include the best available assays for
microbial source tracking to minimize the detection of non-
intestinals, that is, environmental strains of Bacteroidales that do
not have a recent fecal origin. This was achieved by ﬁrst validating
assays for the location and habitat studied in our study (Odagiri
et al., 2015). Worldwide, there are only two reports of detection
of non-intestinals using the general BacUni assay. A study on alpine
soils in Austria found false positives for BacUni at concentrations
close to the detection limit and several orders of magnitude lower
than concentrations in feces (Vierheilig et al., 2012). Several general
fecal Bacteroidales markers, including BacUni, were tested in Dutch
groundwater and tap water (van der Wielen and Medema, 2010).
The authors reported that 9 out of 11 samples were positive for
BacUni but no data were presented, and hence it is impossible to
gauge whether concentrations were close to the detection limit. No
human- or ruminant-associated fecal MST assays for Bacteroidales
were positive in that study. We also searched available databases
for positive detection of non-fecal Bacteroidales sequences using
BacUni primers and probe. To this end plasmid sequences con-
taining the target regions plus intermittent sequences in the 16S
rRNA gene were aligned against the Nucleotide Collection (nt/nr)
database using the BLAST homepage (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov). Of the 100 top hits, 95 were for human feces, one was in an
anaerobic reactor treating wastewater, one was from a cow rectum
swab, one was from pig feces, one from the rhizosphere of soil, and
one from an air sample. Hence the assay is highly speciﬁc for fecal
material with only two environmental samples, one from the
rhizosphere and one from air, giving false positive results. The 100
sequences in the database had been submitted from the following
countries: China, France, India, Japan, and USA. Overall we conclude
that the BacUni assay is an excellent tool for the detection of fecally
derived Bacteroidales in India and other regions in the world that
have been studied by independent research groups.
The prevalence of human fecal contamination in household
samples is likely underestimated because of the lower BacHum
sensitivity on individual human fecal samples and amount of target
markers per unit mass of fecal material, compared to that for the
domestic/livestock animal fecal assay, BacCow (Odagiri et al., 2015).
According to Odagiri et al., human-associated BacHum fecal
markers were detected in 40% of individual human fecal samples,
but in 100% of sewage samples in India. Importantly, the mean
concentration (per wet gram) of BacHum markers in pure fresh
human fecal samples was two orders of magnitude lower than that
of BacCow markers in pure animal fecal samples (Odagiri et al.,
2015), indicating that signiﬁcantly more human feces than do-
mestic animal feces are necessary in a sample to detect human fecal
contamination in the environment in this setting. Different detec-
tion limits for each sample type also reduce ability to directly
compare
detection
rates
across
pathways,
requiring
careful
consideration of detection lower limits and detected concentra-
tions, due to different sample collection volumes, sample process-
ing, and sample matrix effects.
It should be noted that pathogen qPCR and IMS-DFA results do
not yield any information on infectivity or viability of cells. Path-
ogenic potential of bacteria was measured using qPCR and PCR. The

assays which detected pathogenicity genes were validated prior to
use against fresh diarrheal stool samples and positive isolates ob-
tained from clinically positive diarrhea patients in Odisha, India
(see Supplemental Material for details). Cultivation-based methods
were not employed because ﬁeld conditions and local laboratory
facilities for enumeration were not available. Hence confounding
may have affected some of the analyses presented here. For
example, association between child diarrhea and the preceding
level of human and animal fecal exposure in the home or pathogen
exposure in drinking water may have been inﬂuenced by these
villages having higher general exposure to feces and pathogens for
socio-economic reasons which we were unable to test. However,
biological plausibility lends support to the microbial exposure-to-
disease associations we found and are consistent with lack of any
health impact in the Sanitation Trail (Clasen et al., 2014). We did not
have sufﬁcient data to explore this more fully. In addition, other
microbial indicators could have been used that may have led to
stronger associations with illness. For example, additional beneﬁts
may have been gained from measuring Clostridium perfringens
spores which may better describe recent human fecal contamina-
tion in subtropical regions (Fujioka and Shizumura, 1985). Future
work should involve quantitative microbial risk assessment to
conﬁrm the validity of the secondary associations we found be-
tween village-level drinking water pathogen contamination and
child diarrhea prevalence.
5. Conclusions
 Extensive human and animal fecal contamination observed in
homes, which was associated with subsequent child diarrhea,
points to the need for interventions beyond improving house-
hold sanitation, to reduce domestic domain microbial contam-
ination and exposures.
 Observed widespread animal contamination in both the public
and domestic domains, together with detection of zoonotic
types of pathogens, point to a need for better animal excreta
management
to
reduce
potential
health
risks
in
rural
communities.
 Pathogen detection in protected groundwater sources poses a
signiﬁcant waterborne microbial health risk for rural tubewell
users in the region, while continued use for personal and do-
mestic hygiene of community ponds highly contaminated with
multiple pathogens presents an under-appreciated and un-
studied health risk.
 A 27 percentage point increase in improved sanitation access at
village level did not reduce detectable human fecal and path-
ogen contamination in this setting. Rather the possibility of
increased microbial contamination of local groundwater drink-
ing sources through sub-surface leaching from newly installed
pour-ﬂush latrine pits cannot be ignored and requires further
detailed investigations.
 The proportion of village groundwater drinking sources positive
for one or more of 5 diarrheal pathogens was associated with
elevated child diarrhea prevalence observed within 6 weeks
after detection. Speciﬁcally, detection of V. cholerae was signiﬁ-
cantly associated with an increased relative risk of child diarrhea
in the ensuing 6 weeks.
 Rotavirus prevalence in community ponds showed potential
protection against child diarrhea possibly though natural rota-
virus exposures on children.
