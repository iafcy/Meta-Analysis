Abstract 
 
Effectiveness of a combined sanitation and household-level piped water 
intervention on infrastructure coverage, availability and use, environmental fecal 
contamination, and child health in rural Odisha, India: a matched cohort study 
 
By Heather E. Reese 
 
Over half of the almost 1 billion people who practice open defecation live in India. While 
access to community water sources has improved in rural India, few households have on-
site piped water. Although a primary motivation for water, sanitation and hygiene 
improvements is associated improvements in health, there is mixed evidence of effective 
interventions, especially in India. 
 
We conducted a matched cohort study to evaluate a combined intervention, where 
household piped water connections were contingent on community-wide household toilet 
and bathing room construction, implemented in rural Odisha, India. Forty-five 
intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where the program was 
implemented, and matched to 45 control villages. We conducted surveys and 
observations, and collected stools and environmental samples (source water, drinking 
water, and rinses of children’s hands) between June 2015-October 2016 in households 
with a child under five (N=2398). Health surveillance included diarrhea, acute respiratory 
infection, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and anthropometry to assess undernutrition. 
Source water, drinking water, and children’s hands were assayed for fecal indicator 
bacteria, and select waterborne pathogens. 
 
Multilevel regression using generalized linear models was used to assess the effect of the 
intervention on WaSH coverage, availability and use; fecal environmental contamination; 
and child health. Compared to controls, intervention villages had substantially higher 
improved toilet coverage and use. Although the intervention was associated with higher 
access to piped water on the household premises, both study arms experienced 
intermittencies in water availability. Most source and drinking waters in both study arms 
were positive for E. coli, and there was no intervention effect on E. coli. in source water, 
drinking water, or on children’s hands. However, the intervention substantially reduced 
the prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in source water (aRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 
0.97). Similarly, there was no intervention effect on child diarrhea or respiratory 
infection. However, compared to the control, children in intervention villages had lower 
odds of helminthiasis (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.00) and improved HAZ (+0.17, 95% 
CI: 0.03-0.31). Future research should focus on the pathways through which these mixed 
effects on fecal environmental contamination and health outcomes occur.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
Poor sanitation and lack of access to a sufficient quantity and quality of water are 
pervasive problems throughout the developing world, contributing a large burden of 
morbidity and mortality. Unimproved sanitation and water supply are major risk factors 
for diarrheal diseases and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the second and first 
leading cause of under-five child mortality worldwide, as well as soil-transmitted 
helminth infections (STH), and undernutrition[1–3]. 
 
Although there have been substantial gains in access to sanitation globally, these gains 
have barely matched population growth in India; of the 2.3 billion people worldwide 
without access to an improved sanitation facility in 2015, 576 million live in India[4]. In 
India, those who lack access to improved sanitation facilities may not use any facilities at 
all. Indeed, the majority of people worldwide practicing open defecation live in India, and 
of these, the majority live in rural areas[5].   
 
Interventions to improve sanitation primarily focus on increasing coverage and 
occasionally on increasing use of latrines. Much of the motivation for increasing access 
to sanitation facilities in low-income settings is based on the premise that these facilities 
will keep human feces separate from human contact, including through contact with 
contaminated water. However, the association between household access to improved 
sanitation and a direct health impact is highly heterogeneous in low-income developing 
country contexts. Two recent randomized controlled trials of sanitation interventions in 

2 
 
rural India found no effect on diarrheal diseases[6,7]. A third study, which employed a 
matched cohort design similar to this study, also showed no health impact from a 
sanitation intervention[8]. However, in all of these studies, community-level sanitation 
coverage was low. 
 
Interventions to improve drinking water quality focus primarily on protection at either the 
water source or at the point-of-use within the household level. While source water 
protection can provide some reduction in health risk, there is the potential for 
recontamination of drinking water stored at the household level[9]. Thus, provision of 
high quality water within the household, through connection to a piped network system, 
will likely provide the greatest impact on health. Although there is evidence of 
heterogeneity in the effectiveness of water quality interventions, several meta-analyses 
have found the effectiveness of individual or combined water, sanitation and hygiene 
interventions decrease diarrheal disease prevalence by up to 34%[10–13]. However, there 
is limited evidence of the added benefit of combining water and sanitation interventions, 
though this may be due to poor uptake and inconsistent use[11–13].  
 
While the government of India has implemented programs to help develop improved 
community level water sources and improved household sanitation facilities, India still 
lags behind the rest of the world for open defecation. As of 2015, 85% of the population 
in rural India had access to improved sources of water[4]. However, only 14% had access 
to piped water at the household level[5]. Only 25% of the population in rural India has 
access to improved sanitation, dropping to only 14% in rural Odisha state as of 2011. 

3 
 
And over 53% of the world’s population practicing open defecation live in India[5]. 
Similar to the trend with access to improved sanitation, 21% of children’s feces are 
disposed safely in India, compared to only 7% in Odisha. The low coverage and use of 
sanitation facilities and safe disposal of children’s feces, paired with relatively high 
access to improved water sources, places India in a unique context. It is possible that low 
acceptance of improved sanitation is culturally based; recent evidence shows an 
association between household latrines, cultural views of ritual pollution, and changing 
perceptions of the lowest castes in India.[14]   
 
Over the past decades there has been global commitment to determine water and 
sanitation interventions with demonstrated effectiveness, not just efficacy[15]. Low 
compliance, both with coverage and use of sanitation facilities, was a primary concern in 
many previous sanitation interventions and likely contributed to low observed health 
impact. Gram Vikas follows a unique approach requiring compliance of the entire 
community; each household must construct their own toilet and bathing room prior to the 
completion of a piped water network for the village, with three connections to each 
household.  
 
There is evidence to suggest that the Gram Vikas approach may be more effective in 
reducing disease than other interventions that have been evaluated to date, especially 
within the unique sanitation context in India. First, the intervention requires every 
household in the entire village to participate and construct a toilet and bathing room; 
many other interventions recruit individual households and achieve village sanitation 

4 
 
coverage levels of approximately 35% to 65%, resulting in continued high levels of open 
defecation[6–8,16]. Second, Gram Vikas claims high levels of toilet use. Both sanitation 
coverage and use are necessary to reduce exposure to fecal pathogens. Finally, Gram 
Vikas combines the sanitation intervention with piped water supply at the household 
level, a measure that is both likely to increase use of pour-flush toilets, and improve the 
quantity and microbial quality of water used at the household level. This study will be the 
first to rigorously evaluate the effect of this combined household sanitation and piped 
water supply intervention in rural India.  
 
With the majority of people practicing open defecation worldwide living in India, there is 
the impetus to focus on determining effective and sustainable interventions for this 
context. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of the combined improved sanitation and 
piped water intervention implemented under Gram Vikas.

Chapter 2. Diarrheal diseases, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, acute 
respiratory infection, and undernutrition: burden of disease, etiology, 
and preventative measures 
 
Diarrheal diseases 
Worldwide, diarrheal diseases accounted for over 1.31 million deaths in 2015, including 
almost 500,000 deaths in children under five years[17]. In addition to the high mortality 
attributed to diarrheal diseases, they also contribute a large burden of morbidity, 
disproportionately affecting the youngest children. The majority of deaths due to 
diarrheal disease are in neonates and children under two years[18]. Although the child 
under five mortality rate due to diarrheal diseases has substantially decreased in the past 
decade by 33%, morbidity has been slower to decline and has improved faster in some 
geographic regions and populations than others[17]. Over 20% of child under five deaths 
due to diarrheal disease worldwide were in India. Although diarrheal disease prevalence 
in India has decreased over the last decade, the still relatively high prevalence and large 
growing population make diarrheal diseases one of the leading causes of child death. In 
addition, diarrheal diseases in children under five in India are estimated to contribute 
almost 9.5 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs)[17].  
 
Diarrheal diseases include any symptomatic diarrheal illness caused by intestinal 
infection by enteric bacteria, virus, protozoa, or other parasites. Infection alters the 
normal digestion and absorption processes to result in increased passage of watery feces 
and pathogen shedding. While the main etiologies of diarrheal diseases are diverse and 

7 
 
differ by population and context, transmission of enteric pathogens follows similar 
transmission pathways from person-to-person and through the environment. Each enteric 
pathogen differs in the ability to survive and replicate in the environment outside the 
human host, how easily transmissible it is, and in its infectiveness. Globally, the most 
common etiologies of moderate and severe diarrheal disease in children under five are 
infection or co-infection with rotavirus and Shigella spp.[17,19]. These pathogens are 
also the most common causes of diarrheal disease in India, causing an estimated 34-43% 
of diarrhea cases depending on child age[19]. While diarrhea itself contributes a large 
burden of morbidity through severe dehydration and damage to the intestinal wall, a 
single episode of diarrheal disease is generally self-limiting. However, diarrhea also 
increases susceptibility to other infections and conditions, with repeated bouts of 
diarrheal diseases resulting in long-term impacts on child health, including 
undernutrition[18].  
 
Soil-transmitted helminthiasis 
Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are gastrointestinal nematodes infecting an estimated 
1.5 billion people, almost a quarter of the world’s population. However, prevalence alone 
does not provide an accurate estimate of the effects of helminthiasis since morbidity is 
correlated with the intensity of the infection, often estimated as the eggs per gram (epg) 
of feces. According to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, over 3.3 million all age 
DALYs are attributable to soil-transmitted helminthiasis, with the majority due to 
infection with hookworms[20]. Although mortality due to helminth infection has 
decreased over the past decade, over 2.5 thousand deaths were attributed to helminth 

8 
 
infection in 2015[21]. STHs are endemic throughout the developing world. In India, an 
estimated 220 million children under 5 are at risk for helminthiasis and require 
preventative chemotherapy[22]. Morbidity due to helminthiasis can include diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and poor physical and neurocognitive development which can result in 
both protein-energy and micronutrient malnutrition, including iron and Vitamin A 
deficiencies[23]. 
 
The most common etiologic agents include the round worm Ascaris lumbricoides, the 
whipworm Tricuris thichiura, and the hookworms, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma 
duodenale[23]. Since STHs cannot replicate within the host, the life cycles are different 
than those for enteric bacteria and viruses, requiring favorable environmental conditions 
for infective forms to mature in the soil. Infection with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura is 
very similar, and occurs through ingestion of infective embryonated ova. Ova may be on 
any contaminated fomite, including unwashed and unpeeled fresh produce, in drinking 
water, or in soil that may be directly consumed by children through geophagy. Infection 
with hookworms is through dermal contact with the infective filariform larval stage, 
usually from walking on contaminated soil. Depending on the species, adult worms can 
survive in the intestine for over a year[24]. And reinfection is rapid, with the prevalence 
of infection with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura rising to baseline levels within 12 
months after chemotherapy[25]. There is evidence that co-infection with more than one 
helminth species is common, especially in individuals with a high intensity infection[23]. 

9 
 
Acute respiratory infection 
Worldwide, acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) accounted for over 2.7 million 
deaths in 2015, including over 700,000 deaths in children under five years[17]. Although 
the age-standardized mortality rate for ALRI fell by over 20 percentage points in the past 
decade, the total number of deaths has remained constant. ALRI is still the leading 
infectious cause of child under five deaths worldwide. The majority of deaths due to 
ALRI are in the youngest children, with over 80% of deaths occurring in neonates and 
children under two years[18]. The burden of morbidity and mortality due to ALRI is 
highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with the largest number of child under five 
deaths occurring in India[17]. In India, ALRI is responsible for over 140,000 child under 
five deaths, disproportionately affecting girls. In addition, respiratory infection in 
children under five in India is estimated to contribute almost 12.1 million DALYs[26].  
 
Lower respiratory infections may be caused by infection with one of several bacteria or 
viruses. Globally, the most common causes include Streptococcus pneumoniae and 
Haemophilus influenzae. In India, almost 60% of respiratory infections in children under 
five are due to pneumococcal pneumonia and 14% to infection with Haemophilus 
influenzae type b[27]. In community settings, transmission is usually through inhalation 
of aerosolized droplets, or through contact with contaminated hands or other fomites, or 
aspiration of bacteria from the upper airways[28]. The most common long-term effect of 
ALRI in an otherwise healthy individual is reduction in lung capacity. However, other 
common childhood infectious diseases such as measles increase susceptibility to lower 
respiratory infection.  
 

10 
 
Undernutrition 
Malnutrition due to deficiencies in diet include protein-energy malnutrition, i.e. stunting, 
wasting, and underweight, as well as micronutrient malnutrition due to deficiencies in 
vitamins and minerals. In 2015, almost 200,000 child under five deaths were attributed to 
nutritional deficiencies[21]. Stunting, defined as low height for age, is usually the result 
of persistent or recurrent undernutrition in the early stages of child development. 
Evidence suggests that the first 1000 days, from conception to two years old, is the 
critical window to ensure adequate growth and development[29,30]. However, there is 
evidence that children from low- and middle-income countries are born at a disadvantage, 
with length at birth below the international WHO growth standards[31]. After birth, 
height-for-age z scores drop rapidly during the first 24 months, with patterns of growth 
faltering seeming to differ between populations. In India, children are below even the 
average for low- and middle-income countries by their first month, and on average 
rapidly drop below -2.0 HAZ by 24 months[31]. Although worldwide prevalence of 
stunting has decreased in the past two decades, 23% of children under five are still 
stunted[29]. Stunting predominately affects children in low resource settings, with over 
61 million children under five in South Asia stunted. Stunting results in not only severe 
physical and neurocognitive development, but also has long-term negative effects on 
human, social and economic capital[32,33]. 
 
Wasting, defined as low weight for height, is an acute condition often due to a rapid 
decrease in diet quantity or quality, or in the child’s ability to adequately absorb dietary 
nutrients[34]. Worldwide, over 50 million children under five were wasted in 2015, with 

11 
 
more than two thirds of wasted children living in Asia[34,35]. Unlike with stunting, the 
prevalence of wasting has remained relatively stable over the past decade. Although 
wasting is treatable, moderate and severe wasting substantially increases the risk of death. 
Underweight, defined as low weight for age, is due to a combination of chronic and acute 
undernutrition, and provides a less specific indicator of the likely causes of undernutrition 
than stunting or wasting[36]. Worldwide, over 16% of children under five were 
underweight in 2015, with over 69 million underweight children living in Asia[29]. 
 
Preventative measures 
There is a cyclical relationship between undernutrition and infection—especially 
recurrent diarrheal diseases, ALRI, parasitic infection, and measles. Diarrheal diseases 
and respiratory infection lower immune response and increase susceptibility to other 
concurrent infections[37]. In addition, diarrheal disease co-morbidity with undernutrition 
increases risk of mortality[38]. Both enteric and respiratory infections as well as 
undernutrition are strongly linked to poverty. Poor sociodemographic conditions and lack 
of appropriate infrastructural barriers exacerbate these conditions, continuing the cycle.  
 
Preventative measures for diarrheal diseases, STHs, and ALRI, fall into three main 
categories: nutritional, vaccines, and environmental. Undernutrition is not only a cause of 
substantial neonatal and child morbidity and mortality, but also a leading risk factor for 
both diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections[17,26]. In addition, specific 
nutritional measures including breastfeeding and micronutrient supplementation have 
been shown to reduce to the incidence of diarrheal diseases and pneumonia[3]. The 

12 
 
Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that improvements in undernutrition in the past 
decade are responsible for a 10% reduction in DALYs due to diarrheal diseases and an 
almost 9% reduction in DALYs due to ALRI[17,26]. 
 
Vaccines are available for H. influenzae type b and pneumococcal infection, as well V. 
cholerae O1 and rotavirus. While pneumococcal conjugate and H. influenzae type b 
vaccination resulted in a reduction in severe pneumonia in developing countries, there is 
evidence that the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines is substantially lower in developing 
countries compared to developed[3,39].  In contrast, there are several issues with the 
cholera vaccine, including relatively low efficacy as well as effectiveness, and limited 
evidence of long-term effectiveness[40,41]. In the absence of environmental protections 
and other public health measures, vaccination is not sufficient for protection against 
endemic diarrheal diseases.  
 
Environmental measures include improved WaSH and reduced household air 
pollution[3]. Improvements in water and sanitation in the past decade are responsible for 
an over 13% decrease in DALYs for diarrheal diseases[17]. Similarly, transmission of 
ALRI could be substantially reduced through consistent hygiene practices[3,42]. The 
protections provided by improvements in WaSH are the focus of this dissertation and are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. In addition, there is strong evidence that reductions 
in air pollution exposure, usually due to improvements in cookstove and household 
lighting technologies, are associated with decreases in ALRI. Improvements in air 

13 
 
pollution exposure in the past decade are responsible for a 4% reduction in DALYs due 
to lower respiratory infection[26].

Chapter 3. Water, sanitation and hygiene interventions 
Enteric pathogens responsible for diarrheal diseases and soil-transmitted helminth 
infections, and contributing to undernutrition, are transmitted through multiple 
environmentally mediated pathways. Infrastructure and behavioral interventions can limit 
or eliminate transmission along specific pathways. Adequate sanitation, where both 
improved sanitation infrastructure ensures excreta are isolated from further human 
contact and there is a system to safely manage fecal sludge, provides a primary barrier to 
enteric pathogen transmission. Use of unimproved sanitation infrastructure or a poorly 
managed fecal waste system can add additional transmission pathways through 
environmental contamination. Sanitation should block transmission through all pathways 
to human fecal contamination aside from transmission via hand contamination. 
Consistent and adequate hygiene behaviors, including handwashing with soap and water 
at critical times after defecation and before food handling, provide both a primary barrier 
to enteric pathogen transmission via hand contamination and a secondary barrier via food 
or fomite contamination. Hand hygiene also provides protection against other infectious 
agents transmitted through fomites, such as those bacteria and viruses responsible for 
lower respiratory infections. Water interventions provide a secondary barrier to 
transmission though appropriate treatment, transportation, and if necessary, storage, of 
water used for all purposes. Since no single infrastructure or behavioral intervention will 
interrupt all enteric pathogen transmission pathways, some combination must be 
implemented to eliminate exposure to fecal contamination. 
 

15 
 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight the need to not only assess access 
to adequate sanitation and water infrastructure as did the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), but to more fully assess both coverage and quality of water, sanitation and 
hygiene services as well as disease attributable to poor water, sanitation and hygiene 
(WaSH) conditions. SDG 3 specifically calls for monitoring the fractions of diarrheal 
disease, intestinal nematode infections, and protein-energy undernutrition deaths 
attributable to poor WaSH conditions.  
 
Piped water on household premises 
Interventions that protect water at the point-of-use, including safe storage and treatment 
measures, are effective at reducing exposure to enteric pathogens and improving health; 
however, these interventions rely on consistent behaviors[10,43]. Several studies have 
shown that even a minimal lapse in water treatment or other protection measures which 
impact water quality results in substantial decreases in health improvements[44,45]. 
Therefore, interventions that minimize the potential for human error are likely to be the 
most effective.  
 
Networked water supply systems that distribute piped water from a centralized facility to 
households provide quality water and associated health benefits at the community level, 
without the reliance on consistent treatment or storage behaviors at each household. 
Piped water access at the household has two primary benefits: the water source is in close 
proximity to the household, and the water should be of high microbiological and 
chemical quality. Water sources located on the household premises have the potential to 

16 
 
reduce exposure to enteric pathogens by limiting the need for water collection and 
household storage, and thus the risk of post-collection contamination. In addition, there is 
evidence that water access close to the household increases the quantity of water used, 
and improves hygiene behaviors[46]. Water access on the household premises is also 
associated with lower prevalence of helminth infections and diarrheal diseases, and 
improved height-for-age[47–49]. Piped systems delivering high quality water, in 
particular, are associated with the greatest reductions in diarrheal diseases[43]. 
 
Although networked water systems can provide quality water through centralized 
treatment before distribution, water can become contaminated in the process of being 
distributed to households. Within the distribution system itself, breaks in the physical 
pipelines, hydraulic breaches including water pressure changes and water service 
intermittencies, and inadequate water quality and chlorine residual within the network are 
all potential risks allowing contamination to enter the system. A recent systematic review 
assessed whether deficiencies in water system distribution networks were associated with 
increased risk of gastrointestinal illness[50]. Ercumen et al. determined that distribution 
systems with any deficiencies increased risk of gastrointestinal illness compared to 
system with no deficiencies[50]. There was an increased risk associated with any 
individual system deficiency, including water service intermittency and inadequate 
chlorine residual. However, the majority of these studies assessed water distribution 
systems in developed countries; and the few studies in developing countries assessed 
urban systems. There is a dearth of evidence on piped water systems from both 

17 
 
developing and rural contexts, where the need for access to improved water sources is 
arguably the greatest. 
 
Previous international efforts to ensure all populations have access to clean drinking 
water focused on infrastructure, categorizing water sources as improved (piped, borehole, 
and protected well/spring) and unimproved (unprotected well/spring, and surface water). 
The top rung of the updated Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) drinking water ladder 
defines safely managed water as a water source located on the household premises, with 
no interruptions in service, and free from microbial and chemical contamination. 
Although the international target has shifted to providing water sources on household 
premises, there is limited evidence of the health effects of on-premise water, or even 
coverage of the top rung of the water ladder, piped water connections, in the most at-risk 
populations.  
 
Worldwide, over 71% of people used safely managed water sources in 2015, but this 
drops to only 58% in the central and southern Asia region[4]. In many developing 
countries, including India, there is not sufficient data available currently to estimate 
access to safely managed water sources. However, India was one of only a few countries 
that met the MDG of halving the proportion of the population without access to improved 
drinking water sources in both urban and rural areas. While access to improved drinking 
water sources in India was high in both urban (94%) and rural (93%) populations in 2015, 
access to piped water on the household premises is substantially lower in rural than urban 
populations (16% and 54%, respectively)[51].  

18 
 
Community-level sanitation 
There is strong biological plausibility for sanitation to provide health benefits through the 
elimination of fecal contamination of the environment. However, there is mixed evidence 
of the effectiveness of sanitation interventions on primary health outcomes. A recent 
meta-analysis by Freeman et al. shows mixed associations between sanitation coverage 
and diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and height-for-age[52]. Two recent 
randomized controlled trials of rural sanitation interventions implemented under the Total 
Sanitation Campaign in India showed no effect on prevalence of child diarrheal diseases, 
soil-transmitted helminthiasis, or select nutritional outcomes[6,7]. In both studies, this 
may be attributed in part to low use of improved toilets, even with increases in sanitation 
coverage. In both studies, community level improved sanitation coverage was on average 
below 63% of households, with at most 37% of households reporting that any household 
member used an improved toilet. In contrast, a randomized controlled trial of community-
led total sanitation (CLTS) in Mali, reported substantial decreases in open defecation 
(down to <10% for adults)[53]. This study also had no effect on child diarrhea, but 
reported improvements in child height-for-age. 
 
Several studies have found associations between community level sanitation and 
reductions in diverse health outcomes including diarrheal diseases, STH, Giardia 
duodenalis infections, and stunting[54–56]. A systematic review found similar evidence 
that community sanitation offers similar magnitude reductions on diarrheal disease 
prevalence as household level sanitation[57]. However, the overall quality of evidence 
was poor. While the importance of improving community coverage is widely accepted, 

19 
 
there is limited evidence of effective interventions which focus on the community as a 
whole instead of individual households. Community-led total sanitation emerged as an 
early approach focused on community mobilization and commitment to end the practice 
of open defecation. While it was initially developed in Bangladesh, CLTS has now been 
implemented throughout the world[58]. However, aside from the previously described 
Mali study, there is little rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention 
approach on sustained use of improved sanitation at the community level[53]. There is a 
need to determine an approach that will sustainably improve sanitation coverage and use 
at the community level, especially in settings where open defecation is prevalent. 
 
Previous international efforts to ensure all populations have access to adequate sanitation 
focused on infrastructure at the household level, categorizing sanitation as improved 
(connection to a sewer/septic system, pour-flush, ventilated improved pit latrine) and 
unimproved (shared latrine, open pit, bucket, open defecation). The top rung of the 
updated JMP sanitation ladder defines safely managed sanitation as a private household 
latrine with fecal sludge disposed of in situ or treated off site. Although international 
targets have expanded to include the entire sanitation chain from the containment of 
human feces within improved facilities to treatment and safe disposal, the focus is still at 
the household level.  
 
Worldwide, only 39% of people used safely managed sanitation in 2015, with almost 900 
million people still practicing open defection[4]. Despite substantial improvements in the 
past decade, over half of the 892 million people practicing open defection live in India, 

20 
 
with the majority living in rural areas[4]. Similar to the new water targets under the 
Sustainable Development Goals, there is limited data available to estimate the new 
indicator for safely managed sanitation. Although India has made improvements to 
sanitation coverage over the past decade, it has continued to be an international focus 
under both the MDG and SDG monitoring updates. Given the large number of people 
practicing open defection in India, substantially faster progress than in the past decade is 
required to meet the SDG target of ending open defecation by 2030. Access to improved 
sanitation in India was relatively high in urban (65%) compared to rural (34%) 
populations in 2015[4].

ABSTRACT  
Introduction. Government efforts to address massive shortfalls in rural water and 
sanitation in India have centered on construction of community water sources and toilets 
for selected households. However, deficiencies with water quality and quantity at the 
household level, and community coverage and actual use of toilets has led Gram Vikas, a 
local NGO in Odisha, India, to develop an approach that provides household-level piped 
water connections contingent on full community-level toilet coverage. 
Methods. This matched cohort study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a 
combined piped water and sanitation intervention. Households with children under five 
years in 45 randomly selected intervention villages and 45 matched control villages will 
be followed over 17 months. The primary outcome is prevalence of diarrheal diseases; 
secondary health outcomes include soil-transmitted helminth infection, nutritional status, 
seroconversion to enteric pathogens, urogenital infections, and environmental enteric 
dysfunction. In addition, intervention effects on sanitation and water coverage, access and 
use, environmental fecal contamination, women’s empowerment, as well as collective 
efficacy, and intervention cost and cost-effectiveness will be assessed. 
Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the 
ethics boards of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, U.K. and KIIT 
University, Bhubaneswar, India. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed 
literature and presentation to stakeholders, government officials, implementers and 
researchers.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY 
• The study assesses a combined household-level piped water and sanitation 
intervention that requires complete community-level compliance. 
• The intervention was not randomly allocated; but, controls are selected through a 
restriction process to limit possible partial exposure to the intervention through 
spillover, and matched to intervention villages using pre-intervention data. 
• The study uses a holistic definition of health to assess intervention impacts on 
physical, mental and social well-being, including more novel outcomes such as 
seroconversion to enteric pathogens, environmental enteric dysfunction, and 
sanitation insecurity. It also assesses intervention coverage, cost-effectiveness, 
and collective efficacy. 
• The time lapse between intervention completion and the beginning of the 
evaluation process prevents baseline comparison or assessment of immediate 
intervention impacts. However, it allows for a biologically plausible length of 
time for die-off of even the most persistent pathogens in the environment, and 
provides time for children to have be born into this environment. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Of the one billion people practicing open defecation worldwide, over half live in 
India[51]. While international and national pressure on improving sanitation conditions in 
India has led to over 350 thousand people gaining access to improved toilets since 1990, 
it has barely kept up with population growth[51,59]. Recent studies show that even in 
areas with access to household-level improved sanitation, use of these toilets is 

24 
 
low[8,14,60]. This may be due in part to a mismatch between the culturally acceptable 
pour-flush toilets and the level of water access. Coverage of improved water sources, 
usually community-level pumps or taps, is relatively high even in rural areas in India, but 
it may not be sufficient for flushing purposes on top of other daily water needs[51,61].  
 
Although the effectiveness of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions vary,  
meta-analyses have found that individual or combined WASH interventions decrease 
diarrheal disease prevalence by up to 48%[10–13,62]. While combined interventions 
would be expected to have a greater influence on multiple exposure pathways and thus a 
greater combined impact on health, there is limited evidence of additive benefits[63]. 
This may be due to poor uptake, inconsistent use, or an incomplete understanding of 
relevant pathways[11–13]. In India, combining water and sanitation interventions may be 
more critical than just interrupting multiple transmission pathways for enteric infection; 
evidence suggests that household-level water access is integral to the use of improved 
sanitation in this context[64].  
 
While the intent of improved sanitation facilities is to separate human feces from human 
contact, most of the focus is on constructing household toilets to increase improved 
sanitation coverage—the primary metric used in monitoring progress toward international 
targets. However, studies in India have further shown that toilet construction does not 
translate into toilet use in this context[6–8,65]. Moreover, with the interdependence 
between members of households and households within communities, safe water and 
sanitation is a community-level issue. There is growing emphasis on assessing health risk 

25 
 
from poor water and sanitation conditions not simply due to individual or even 
household-level risk factors, but also from conditions in the community environment[66]. 
There is evidence that even households without toilets, and households which do not 
filter drinking water, showed decreased health risk if they live in communities with high 
levels of coverage and use[56,67,68]. 
 
Moreover, the effectiveness of community interventions may be higher in communities 
with positive perceptions of their collective ability to come together to improve their 
conditions. Collective efficacy, a latent construct comprised of the structural and 
cognitive components that facilitate a community’s shared belief in its ability to come 
together and execute actions related to a common goal, may explain some variance in 
intervention effectiveness across communities receiving WASH interventions[69]. 
 
A main risk of poor WASH conditions is enteric infection, caused by a diverse array of 
bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites, including soil-transmitted helminths. These 
infections may cause diarrhea, the second leading cause of mortality for children under 
five years worldwide and in India, a leading cause of mortality regardless of age[70,71]. 
There is also growing evidence that asymptomatic enteric infections may pose a similar 
risk, with repeat enteric infections contributing to chronic malnutrition, environmental 
enteric dysfunction, poor cognitive outcomes, and poor vaccine uptake[1,72–76]. Poor 
WASH conditions are also linked to increased risk of respiratory infection, the leading 
cause of mortality for children under five years worldwide[70,77,78]. Poor water and 
sanitation access can also affect the social, physical and mental well-being of women, 

26 
 
acting through pathways ranging from unsafe menstrual hygiene management practices 
and increased risk of violence[79–81].  
 
Description of the intervention 
Over the past decades there has been a global commitment to determine water and 
sanitation interventions with demonstrated effectiveness, not just efficacy[15]. Gram 
Vikas, a non-governmental organization based in Odisha, India 
(http://www.gramvikas.org/), has responded by implementing its MANTRA (Movement 
and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas) water and sanitation program in 
more than 1000 villages since 2002[82]. This approach includes both household-level 
piped water connections, and community-level mobilization for culturally appropriate 
household toilets. A previous interrupted time series analysis of the MANTRA 
intervention reported it to be protective against diarrheal diseases[83]. However, in 
addition to limitations of design, this study relied on outcome data collected and reported 
by Gram Vikas, the intervention implementer, and did not assess intervention coverage or 
impacts on environmental fecal contamination.  
 
The MANTRA water and sanitation intervention is rolled out in a three-phase process 
over an average of three years. During the first, or Motivational, phase (approximately 8-
12 mo), representatives of Gram Vikas visit the identified village several times to assess 
village interest and progress towards a set of Gram Vikas requirements, including: 1) the 
commitment of every household to participate, 2) creation of a village corpus fund from 

27 
 
contributions from every household, and 3) development of village guidelines for 
maintenance and use of facilities.  
 
Once this set of requirements is achieved, the village progresses into the second, or 
Operational, phase of the intervention (approximately 17-35 mo). Each household 
constructs a pour-flush toilet with two soak-pits and a separate bathing room. The 
households hire a local, skilled mason and provide their own unskilled labor and locally 
available materials to complete the superstructure. Gram Vikas provides external 
materials such as PVC pipes and porcelain pans. At the same time, a water tank, 
community meeting space, and piped water distribution system connected to every 
household, with taps in the toilet and bathing rooms and a separate tap in the kitchen, is 
constructed through a similar collaborative process.  
 
All households must construct a toilet and bathing room for the village to progress into 
the final, or Completed, phase of the intervention, in which the water system is turned on. 
Notably, this three-phase process only allows each household access to piped water once 
every household in the village has a toilet and bathing room. This model contrasts with 
most previous water and sanitation interventions, including those implemented under 
India’s Total Sanitation Campaign and other government programs, which do not require 
community-level sanitation compliance and do not provide a piped water supply at the 
household level[84].

Study aims 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined 
household-level water supply and sanitation intervention, as implemented by Gram Vikas 
in Odisha, India. Toward that objective, this study aims to: 
1) Assess the effectiveness of the intervention in improving water and sanitation 
infrastructure coverage, access, and use, and to assess fecal sludge management 
practices in intervention communities.  
2) Assess the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing environmental fecal 
contamination. 
3) Assess the effectiveness of the intervention in improving health. This includes 
reported diarrheal disease in children under 5 years (primary outcome), acute 
respiratory infection, infection with soil-transmitted helminthes, nutritional status, 
environmental enteric dysfunction, seroconversion for selected enteric pathogens, 
and urogenital diseases associated with menstrual hygiene management practices. 
Mental and social well-being will be explored through assessment of sanitation 
insecurity and women’s empowerment. 
4) Assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. 
5) Develop and assess a theoretically-grounded, empirically informed collective 
efficacy scale; and determine the effect of collective efficacy on intervention 
effectiveness.

METHODS 
Setting 
The study is located in Ganjam and Gajapati districts in eastern Odisha, India (Figure 1). 
These two contiguous districts were a single district until 1992. Over 44% of the 
population in these districts is recognized by the Government of India as being below the 
poverty line (BPL)[85]. As of 2008, a majority of households in both districts had access 
to an improved, likely community-level, drinking water source, with over 23% of 
households in Ganjam having access to any sanitation facility, compared to only 8% of 
households in Gajapati[85]. The area is primarily rural and agrarian, and the climate is 
characterized by a monsoon season from June to September, with an average rainfall of 
~1400 mms/year. 
 
Study design 
This study uses a matched cohort design to assess the effectiveness of a completed 
intervention with data collected across four study rounds from June 2015 to October 2016 
(Figure 2). Data were collected in all study rounds for diarrhea, acute respiratory 
infection, nutritional status, and stored and source water outcomes to assess seasonality. 
Data were collected in rounds 2 and 4 for environmental enteric dysfunction, 
seroconversion, and hand-rinses, and cross-sectionally in one or more rounds for the 
remaining outcomes. As described below, control villages were matched to randomly 
selected intervention villages through a multi-step restriction, genetic matching, and 
exclusion process using the following eligibility criteria.  

30 
 
 
Eligibility criteria for villages 
1. Restriction.  Intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of Gram Vikas 
villages in Ganjam and Gajapati districts provided by the NGO, after restriction to 
villages with a Motivation phase start date between 2002-2006 and a Construction phase 
start date no earlier than 2003. Since the intervention process takes on average three 
years, the criteria for the Motivation start date helped to identify those villages with 
ongoing interventions at the same time. In addition, this allowed the use of the 
Government of India Census 2001 and the Below Poverty Line (BPL) Survey 2002 data 
to characterize baseline characteristics used in the matching process in both intervention 
and control villages. 
 
Eligible control villages include all villages without a Gram Vikas intervention within the 
study districts which: 1) are not within the same Gram Panchayat (a political subdivision 
with some administrative responsibility for water and sanitation comprised of several 
villages) as a Gram Vikas village, or bordering a Gram Vikas village, and 2) had not 
received a Motivation visit from the Gram Vikas NGO. These criteria serve to limit the 
possibility of previous partial exposure to the intervention through spillover from 
adjacent villages or direct contact with the NGO. These criteria also increase the strength 
of the comparison provided by the control villages, i.e. it increases the likelihood that if 
they had received a motivation visit from Gram Vikas, the control villages would have 
been equally as likely as the intervention villages to demand the intervention. 
 

31 
 
In addition, to be eligible for inclusion both intervention and control villages must: 1) 
appear in the Government of India Census 2001 and the BPL Survey 2002, 2) have a 
population of at least 20 households, and 3) be within approximately three hours travel 
from the study office in Brahmapur, Ganjam District. This last criterion is due to 
logistical constraints. 
 
2. Matching.  After restriction, genetic matching was used to match potential control 
villages to the randomly selected intervention villages without replacement[8,86,87]. 
Villages were exact matched on district to limit any political or large scale geographic 
variation between district populations, and were also matched on pre-intervention 
demographic, socioeconomic, sanitation, and water access characteristics listed in Table 
4.1[8]. These village-level matching variables were selected due to their theorized 
association with the primary outcome, diarrheal diseases, as well as data availability.  
 
3. Exclusion.  The field team visited matched potential control villages and intervention 
villages to assess suitability for the study through a rapid assessment interview with 
village leadership and to ensure accessibility. Villages were excluded if they are not 
within three hours travel of the field office in Brahmapur, had sustained major 
infrastructure damage due to a natural disaster, or if there was a current or planned 
sanitation or water intervention by an organization external to the village in the next 12 
months as determined through the rapid assessment interview with village leadership. In 
addition, villages were excluded if there were fewer than three households with children 
under five years old. As villages were removed from the pool of prospective control 

32 
 
villages, the matching process was repeated for all intervention villages and remaining 
eligible control villages, and balance measures were assessed. The matching and 
exclusion processes were repeated as necessary. 
 
After the iterative matching and exclusion process was complete, covariate balance was 
assessed for all matching variables for the final set of intervention and control villages 
through examination of balance measures[88–90]. Matching resulted in an improvement 
in balance as assessed through comparison of several measures including q-q plots, 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov bootstrap p-values, and standardized differences. After matching, 
there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups (Table 4.1). 
 
Eligibility criteria for households 
Households within selected intervention and control villages were eligible if they had at 
least one child under 5 years old at time of enrollment, verified with birth or 
immunization card, and expected to reside in the village for the duration of the study. If 
there were more than 40 eligible households within a village, 40 were randomly selected 
to be enrolled. Informed consent was obtained from the male and/or female head of the 
selected households. All children under five years within each enrolled household were 
eligible and do not age-out over the course of the study. Households with newborn 
children were enrolled as they became eligible on an ongoing basis throughout the study, 
in villages with fewer than 40 enrolled households.  
 
Sample Size 

33 
 
Sample size was determined through a simulation estimating the log odds of diarrheal 
disease (the primary outcome) through a multilevel random effects model and 
parameterized with data from a previous study in a neighboring district in Odisha[6]. 
Sample size estimates were also checked with G*Power[91]. The simulation assumes a 
longitudinal 7-day period prevalence for diarrhea of 8.8% in children under five years, a 
heterogeneity variance between villages of 0.07, a heterogeneity variance between 
households of 0.57, and four study rounds[6]. An effect size of 0.20 was selected for 
public health importance and based on estimates of effect from systematic reviews of 
water and sanitation studies[43]. Assuming at least 80% power, 0.05 significance level, 
10% for loss to follow up, and at least one child per household, we estimate a sample size 
of 45 villages per study arm and 26 households per village. This estimate was the most 
conservative compared to sample size estimates for secondary outcomes, and was 
therefore used for the broader study population.  
 
Outcome Measurement 
Outcomes, and individual, household, and community-level risk factors, will be measured 
through surveys, interviews, or through the collection and analysis of environmental, 
stool or dried blood spot samples. All survey questions will be translated into the primary 
local language, Odia, and back-translated to confirm wording. Household surveys include 
household and individual factors and will be verbally administered by trained field 
workers to the mother or primary caregiver of the youngest child under five in each 
household, unless otherwise specified below. Community surveys will be verbally 
administered to the sarpanch (village head) or other member of village leadership. 

34 
 
Survey data will be collected on mobile phones using Open Data Kit[92]. GPS 
coordinates for households, water sources and other relevant sites will be collected using 
Garmin eTrex 10 or 20 devices (Garmin Ltd., Olathe, KS, USA). 
 
Coverage, access and use of sanitation, water and hygiene infrastructure 
Coverage, access and use of WASH infrastructure will be assessed in all four rounds. 
Presence of and access to toilets, water sources and hand-washing stations will be 
assessed through standard questions from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) 
and confirmed through spot observations. Spot observations of household toilets and 
hand-washing stations will be further used to assess indicators of functionality, 
maintenance, recent use. Reported water and sanitation practices, including child feces 
disposal practices, will be captured through household survey questions. 
 
Diarrheal diseases 
The primary outcome for this study is prevalence of diarrheal diseases, recorded as both 
daily point prevalence over the previous three days and seven-day period prevalence, for 
all household members in all four rounds. Although self-reported diarrhea is a subjective 
outcome with a well-established risk of bias, three-day recall reduces recall bias[93,94]. 
Diarrheal disease will be measured using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
definition of three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period, with or without the presence 
of blood. Field workers will use a simple calendar as a visual aid to help respondents with 
recall. Each household member will be asked to recall his or her own disease status and 
the mother or primary caregiver will be asked to report disease for children.  

35 
 
 
Respiratory infection 
Prevalence of respiratory infections will be recorded as both daily point prevalence over 
the previous three days and seven-day period prevalence for all household members in all 
four rounds. Respiratory infection is defined as the presence of cough and/or shortness of 
breath/difficulty breathing according to WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood 
Illness (IMCI)[95]. The full IMCI case definition for acute lower respiratory infection 
also includes measurement of respiratory rate and observation of chest indrawing, stridor 
and other danger signs; these criteria were excluded from our definition as there was 
concern about the technical support required to produce consistent and accurate data 
within this context[95]. Our definition provides a broad assessment of respiratory illness 
burden. Each household member will be asked to recall his or her own disease status and 
the mother or primary caregiver will be asked to report disease for children. 
 
Nutritional status 
Anthropometric data will be collected for children under age five in all four rounds using 
standard methods as established by WHO[36,96]. Field workers will be trained and 
standardized in line with WHO protocols to reduce measurement error [96]. Weight will 
be measured for all children under five years of age using Seca 385 digital scales, with 
20g increment for weight below 20kg and a 50g increment for weight between 20 and 
50kg. Recumbent length will be measured for children under two years of age using Seca 
417 measuring boards with 1mm increment. Standing height will be measured for 
children two to five years of age using Seca 213 portable stadiometers with 1mm 

36 
 
increment. Height and weight will be used to calculate height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) and 
weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) based on WHO reference standards. A random subset 
of 10% of households will receive back check visits each day to repeat height/length 
measurements to ensure inter-observer reliability.  
 
Soil-transmitted helminth infection 
Stool samples will be collected in rounds 2 and 4 from all household members in a 
randomly selected subset of 500 households, and used to assess the presence and intensity 
of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection. Formalin ether concentration and 
microscopy will be used to quantify worms and ova for hookworms, Ascaris 
lumbricoides, and Tricuris trichura[97]. Quality assurance includes independent 
duplicate assessment of all positive and 10% of negative samples. After stool collection, 
each participant will be offered a single dose of Albendazole, a broad-spectrum 
antihelmenthic drug recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 
Government of India. Stools collected in round 2 will allow for comparison of STH 
infection prevalence between intervention and control villages, while the stool samples 
collected approximately 8 months later in round 4 will provide a measure of re-infection 
rate.   
 
Environmental enteric dysfunction 
Stools from a randomly selected subset of 200 children under two years old, collected in 
rounds 2 and 4, will be used to assess environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) through 
quantification of biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and permeability. Fecal 

37 
 
myeloperoxidase (MPO), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and neopterin (NEO), markers for 
neutrophil activity, intestinal permeability and TH1 immune activation, respectively, 
were selected for this study based on evidence of association with EED, subsequent linear 
growth deficits, and household environmental fecal contamination[1,72,98]. 
 
Seroconversion for enteric pathogens 
Serological assays that assess antibody production against various enteric pathogens can 
provide an objective measure of exposure to enteric infections[99]. Enrolling children 
aged 6 to 18 months will reduce the potential for interference from maternally acquired 
antibodies and permit analysis of seroconversion data in a critical window for young 
children who experience higher diarrheal disease morbidity and mortality before two 
years of age[100–105]. Children who are 6 to 12 months during round 2 will have 
capillary blood drawn by fingerstick or heelstick, as appropriate, and will be visited again 
during round 4 for a second capillary blood sample. All blood samples will be preserved 
on TropBio (Sydney, Australia) filter discs and stored within 7 days of collection at -
20°C. Seroconversion against markers for norovirus, Giardia intestinalis, 
Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, enterotoxigenic E. coli heat-labile 
enterotoxin (ETEC-LT), Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholera, and 
Toxoplasma spp. will be assessed using multiplex immunoassay technology on the 
Luminex xMAP platform[106]. 
 
Environmental fecal contamination 

38 
 
Field workers will collect samples of household stored drinking water and source water 
from a random subset of 500 households in all four rounds, and child hand rinses in 
rounds 2 and 4. All water and hand rinse samples will be stored on ice during transport 
and analyzed within 6 hours of collection using membrane filtration. Three assays will be 
used: 1) plating on m-Coli Blue 24 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for E.coli according to 
EPA Method 10029, 2) alkaline peptone water enrichment prior to plating on thiosulfate 
citrate bile salts sucrose agar and slide agglutination serotyping for V. cholerae, and 3) 
plating on xylose lysine desoxycholate agar, and slide agglutination serotyping for 
Shigella spp.[107–109]. Source and stored water samples will be assayed for E. coli, 
Vibrio cholerae and Shigella spp., and hand rinse samples will be assayed for E. coli and 
Shigella spp. E. coli was selected as a standard non-human specific indicator of fecal 
contamination, though the limitations of this indicator are well-established[110–112]. In 
order to better characterize human fecal contamination of the household environment, 
Vibrio cholerae and Shigella spp. were selected based on prevalence in southern Asia, 
evidence of public health importance, and field laboratory limitations[113–115].  
 
Cost and cost-effectiveness 
Costs and potential cost savings (i.e., averted costs) associated with the intervention will 
be assessed through an economic costing approach that recognizes and quantifies costs 
and benefits from a societal perspective[116]. Data on program and point-of-delivery 
inputs will be collected at household, community, and implementer levels in round 3. 
Field workers will administer community surveys to a village leader, and household 
surveys to the household decision-maker for toilet installation, in 20 randomly selected 

39 
 
households in twenty matched intervention and control villages. Given cost-effectiveness 
analyses require the effect of the intervention to be measured against a counterfactual, 
and the intervention of interest is a community-based intervention, cost and effectiveness 
measures will be summarized at the village level [117]. Surveys will collect data on 
household- and community-level inputs related to materials and labor required to 
construct household toilets and wash rooms, the community water tank and distribution 
system, and household water connections; longer-term water supply and toilet 
maintenance costs; and financing required for this infrastructure as well as perceived 
benefits, including averted social opportunity costs. Implementer inputs from Gram Vikas 
will be collected through an enumeration exercise, interviews, and examination of the 
implementer’s financial records.  
 
Collective efficacy  
Collective efficacy (CE) is a latent construct comprised of the structural and cognitive 
components that facilitate a community’s shared belief in its ability to come together and 
execute actions related to a common goal[69]. A review of the literature and established 
conceptual frameworks will be performed to define the CE construct. A sequential 
exploratory mixed qualitative and quantitative design will be used to develop and refine a 
scale to measure CE and test hypotheses. Field workers will administer the refined, multi-
item, Likert-type CE scale to one randomly selected household member aged 18 years or 
older in each household in round 3.  
 
Women’s empowerment 

40 
 
Four dimensions of women’s empowerment will be measured in rounds 3 and 4: group 
participation, leadership, decision-making and freedom of movement. Group 
participation and leadership will be measured using modules from the Women’s 
Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which has been tested in South Asia[118]. 
Decision-making will be measured using questions from the women’s status module of 
Demographic and Health Surveys. Freedom of movement will be measured using 
questions from the project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-
WEAI). These measures will be collected for the primary female caregiver of the 
youngest child under 5, and were selected based on the importance of women’s 
empowerment for child nutrition[29,119]. Women’s empowerment is conceptualized as 
both an outcome and a potential mediator along the pathway between the Gram Vikas 
intervention and child health outcomes. 
 
Menstrual hygiene management  
Menstrual hygiene management practices vary worldwide and depend on personal 
preference, socioeconomic status, local traditions and beliefs, and access to water and 
sanitation resources[120]. Unhygienic washing practices are common in rural India and 
among women and girls in lower socioeconomic groups, and may increase risk of 
urogenital infection[121–123]. However, the link between access to water and sanitation, 
menstrual hygiene management and urogenital infections has been poorly studied. 
Household surveys will be administered in round 4 to a randomly selected woman aged 
18 or older, in a subset of 800 households, and will capture self-reported urogenital 
infection, defined as at least one of the following symptoms: 1) abnormal vaginal 

41 
 
discharge (unusual texture and color/more abundant than normal), 2) burning or itching 
in the genitalia, 3) burning or itching when urinating, or 4) genital sores[122]. 
  
Sanitation Insecurity 
This study will assess the associations between sanitation access and sanitation insecurity 
with mental health among women. In previous research in Odisha, a contextually specific 
definition and measure for sanitation insecurity was developed, with associations 
between facets of sanitation insecurity and mental health independent of sanitation 
facility access[124]. This previously developed measure will be used to determine if 
levels of sanitation insecurity differ between intervention and control villages and how it 
may be associated with mental health outcomes, specifically well-being, anxiety, 
depression, and distress. Household surveys will be administered in round 4 to a 
randomly selected woman aged 18 or older, in a random subset of 800 households. 
 
Fecal sludge management 
In sanitation systems where sewerage is not feasible, such as the household toilets 
constructed as part of the MANTRA intervention, safe management of fecal waste is 
necessary. Although there is growing emphasis on safe fecal sludge management (FSM), 
research has mainly focused on urban settings[125,126]. Preliminary research in Odisha 
suggests that fecal sludge management in this rural setting is a substantial challenge, and 
may impact household use of toilets. In round 3, household surveys and spot checks of 
toilets in intervention villages will be used to assess toilet use and fecal sludge 
management practices. 

42 
 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
The effect of the intervention on infrastructure coverage, access, and use (aim 1), and the 
effect of the intervention on improving health (aim 3), will be analyzed using logistic, 
linear, log binomial, or negative binomial multilevel regression depending on the 
outcome, to compare intervention versus control villages. Prevalence of fecal sludge 
management practices in intervention communities will be assessed using multilevel 
regression (aim 1). For all models, the hierarchical structure of the data will be accounted 
for using random effects. Estimation of relative risks through Poisson regression or 
binary regression methods for binary outcomes will be considered to ensure robustness of 
results. Mediation of the potential association between intervention and nutritional status 
outcomes by women’s empowerment will be assessed using multilevel structural 
equation modeling, and statistical approaches to reduce bias will be explored as 
needed[127].   
 
The impact of intervention on reducing environmental fecal contamination (aim 2), will 
be assessed through two methods. First, hierarchical logistic and negative binomial 
multilevel regression to estimate intervention effects on the relative scale will be used to 
compare intervention versus control villages. Estimation of relative risks through Poisson 
regression or binary regression methods for binary outcomes will be considered to ensure 
robustness of results. Second, a stochastic microbial risk framework will be used to 
assess differential fecal environmental contamination between intervention and control 
villages. 

43 
 
 
The cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention (aim 4) will be assessed in two steps. 
Incremental intervention benefits will be ascertained by combining health benefit data, 
from analysis of health outcome data and established averted cost data, with other averted 
social opportunity costs. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in cost per 
disease-specific DALY, will be calculated by dividing the incremental intervention costs 
by the incremental intervention benefits. 
 
The collective efficacy scale will be analyzed using a psychometric approach in which 
factor analytics are employed to identify an appropriate factor solution and test the 
reliability and validity of the CE scores. Once a CE factor solution and an empirically 
derived multilevel data structure have been identified, the association between CE and 
intervention effectiveness will be analyzed using multilevel generalized linear mixed 
models to estimate relative risks[128,129]. (aim 5). For all outcomes, variables used in 
the matching process may be considered as covariates, as needed, in addition to 
individual, household, and community-level risk factors. Covariates that are statistically 
associated with outcomes of interest in bivariate analyses will be considered for inclusion 
in final multivariable models, following standard stepwise model-building approaches. 
Secondary analyses may also evaluate models for effect modification as relevant, 
including exposure-mediator interaction for mediation models and cross-level interaction, 
by assessing changes in parameter values based on potential effect modifiers. Potential 
effect modifiers may include breastfeeding for seroconversion outcomes, and climate 
factors and population density for environmental fecal contamination and health 

44 
 
outcomes. However, this study was not designed to assess effect modification and 
therefore is not specifically powered for these analyses. For all outcomes, unadjusted 
models will be presented along with models adjusting for covariates. 
 
DISCUSSION 
This matched cohort study is one of the first to evaluate the effect of a rural combined 
household-level piped water and sanitation intervention, implemented at the community 
level, on a large scale. The matched design provides a rigorous means for estimating 
causal effects given that randomization to intervention group was not feasible due to the 
several year implementation process[8]. By focusing on an intervention where the 
implementation process is complete, it also limits the risk presented by randomized 
controlled trials, where the intervention has little uptake, an especially important study 
challenge given interdependence of exposure and outcomes within communities, and a 
problem that has characterized previous trials of sanitation interventions in India[6,7].  
 
A strength of this study is the assessment of health impacts using the holistic WHO 
definition of health, including not just disease status, but also mental, social, and physical 
well-being[130]. Outcomes along the causal chain include standard, but more subjective 
measures, such as reported diarrheal diseases and respiratory infection, as well as more 
objective measures such as fecal environmental contamination, soil transmitted helminth 
infection, and anthropometry. Although there is risk of response bias for reported 
outcomes, it is unlikely to be differential by intervention status since the study team is not 
directly linked to Gram Vikas. Even though field workers may be aware of village 

45 
 
intervention status, lab staff analyzing water, hand rinse, stool, and blood samples will be 
blinded. In addition, this study includes the more novel use of seroconversion for enteric 
pathogens, biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction, and measures of collective 
efficacy in an evaluation assessment. While there are limitations inherent to observational 
studies, the matched study design and multivariable modeling analysis plan reduce the 
potential for confounding. However, there is still the potential for residual unmeasured 
confounding.

ABSTRACT  
Background. Open defecation is widespread in rural India, and few households have 
piped water connections. While government campaigns increased toilet coverage in India, 
evaluations found limited impact on health, possibly due to sub-optimal toilet use or 
household water access.  
Methods and Findings. We conducted a matched cohort study to assess a combined 
household-level piped water and sanitation intervention implemented by Gram Vikas, in 
90 villages in rural Odisha, India. Forty-five intervention villages were randomly selected 
from a list of those where the program was implemented, and matched to 45 control 
villages. We conducted surveys and observations, and collected stool samples between 
June 2015-October 2016 in households with a child under five (N=2398). Health 
surveillance included diarrhea (primary outcome), acute respiratory infection, soil-
transmitted helminthiasis, and anthropometry to assess nutritional outcomes. Compared 
to controls, intervention villages had substantially higher improved toilet coverage (85% 
v. 18%), as well as increased toilet use by adults (74% v. 13%) and for child feces 
disposal (35% v. 6%) (all p<0.001). There was no intervention effect on diarrhea (OR: 
0.94, 95% CI: 0.74-1.20) or respiratory infection. Compared to the control, children in 
intervention villages had lower prevalence of helminthiasis (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 
1.00) and improved HAZ (+0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.31).  
Conclusions. This combined intervention, where household water connections were 
contingent on community-wide household toilet construction, was associated with 
improved household sanitation use and HAZ, and was suggestive of reduced child soil-
transmitted helminthiasis, though not reduced diarrheal disease or acute respiratory 

51 
 
infection. Further research should explore the mechanism through which these 
heterogenous effects on health may occur. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02441699).

INTRODUCTION  
Globally, over 2.4 billion people lack access to improved sanitation, and almost one 
billion people practice open defecation—over half of whom reside in India[51]. Efforts to 
address these massive sanitation shortfalls have primarily focused on construction of 
pour-flush toilets for selected households within communities. The government of India 
has implemented a succession of large-scale sanitation campaigns across the country[59]. 
However, health evaluations of these programs have shown limited impact, possibly due 
to sub-optimal increases in community-level sanitation coverage and use[6,7,59].  
 
The primary purpose of establishing safe water and improved sanitation is to limit 
exposure to pathogens associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes. Diarrheal 
diseases and acute respiratory infection (ARI) are the two leading causes of death for 
children under five worldwide; in India, diarrhea and pneumonia kill over 290 thousand 
children under five combined annually, the largest burden of any country 
worldwide[131]. In addition, soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection is highly 
prevalent in poor sanitation settings, with an estimated 223 million children in India 
requiring preventive chemotherapy for STH infection[2,132,133]. Poor nutritional 
outcomes are also linked with enteric pathogen exposure, with both underweight and 

52 
 
stunting associated with poor household and community level sanitation[53,55,134]. In 
India, almost half of children under five are stunted or severely stunted[135]. 
 
Coverage of community-level improved water sources is relatively high in rural India, 
but may not be sufficient for flushing or post-defecation cleaning purposes[51]. While 
combined water and sanitation interventions have shown limited additive benefits, 
providing piped water at the household, in addition to sanitation, may prove important to 
increasing use of pour-flush toilets in this context[64,136]. However, research on the 
effects of household level piped water in combination with sanitation is lacking. 
 
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a previously completed 
community-level combined household piped water and sanitation intervention 
implemented by Gram Vikas, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Odisha, 
India[82]. We assessed intervention impact on water and sanitation coverage, availability, 
and use, as well as on diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infection, soil-transmitted 
helminthiasis, and nutritional outcomes. 
 
METHODS 
The intervention 
The MANTRA program (Movement and Action Network for the Transformation of 
Rural Areas) was developed by Gram Vikas, an Indian NGO, as previously 
described[137]. It consists of: 1) a household pour-flush toilet with dual soak-away pits, 
2) an attached bathing room, and 3) household piped water connections[137]. 

53 
 
Importantly, for a village to be eligible for participation, every household in the village 
must agree to construct their own toilet and bathing room. For households below the 
poverty line, government incentives may cover all or part of toilet construction costs. 
Gram Vikas then works with the community to develop a piped water system, which is 
not turned on until every household has completed toilet construction. The village is 
responsible for ongoing costs of operation and maintenance.  
 
Study design and participants 
Full details regarding the study design have been previously reported[137]. Since the 
intervention takes an average of three years, a randomized controlled trial design was not 
practical. Instead, we used a matched cohort design [138]. Intervention villages were 
randomly selected from a list of villages where Gram Vikas had previously completed the 
intervention in Ganjam and Gajapati districts, Odisha, India, with an intervention start 
date of 2003-2006. Forty-five control villages were matched to the 45 randomly selected 
intervention villages through a multi-step restriction, genetic matching, and exclusion 
process[86,87,137]. Households with a child under five at any time during surveillance 
were eligible; if more than 40 households were eligible in a village, 40 were randomly 
selected. The male and/or female head of the household provided written informed 
consent for the household. 
 
Procedures and outcome measures 
Field workers collected data in four study rounds approximately every four months 
between June 2015-October 2016. Household surveys on socio-demographics, household 

54 
 
and individual water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) behaviors, and self-reported illness 
were administered to the primary caregiver in the Odia language. For each of the 
following outcomes, each household member reported his own disease status over the 
previous seven days, and the primary caregiver reported disease status for children[139]. 
Diarrheal disease was defined as at least one occasion of three or more loose stools in the 
a 24 hour period[19]. ARI was defined as cough and/or shortness of breath/difficulty 
breathing due to chest congestion[141]. Both diarrheal disease and ARI outcomes were 
collected every study round. Prevalence of bruising or scrapes (combined) was collected 
in round 3 (February-June 2016) as a negative control to allow qualitative assessment of 
differential reporting bias for the self-reported health outcomes[142].  
 
We used direct observation to assess water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure 
characteristics. We defined improved sanitation, improved water sources, and presence of 
a handwashing station, a designated location with water and a cleansing agent present, 
according to Joint Monitoring Programme standard definitions[51]. We collected 
reported interruption in the preferred drinking water source using two measures: 1) 
source unavailable for ≥24 hours in the previous two weeks, and 2) source unavailable at 
any time in the previous 24 hours. The first measure was collected in all rounds, and the 
second was collected starting round 2. To limit missing data, interruption in water source 
was categorized as any interruption, using either measure, across all study rounds. Usual 
defecation location was self-reported for the following categories within each household: 
elders ≥60 years, men 18-59 years, women 18-59 years, and children 5-17 years. For 
children under five, the caregiver reported the disposal location for the last defecation 

55 
 
event, and improved child feces disposal was defined as disposal into an improved toilet. 
We calculated household sanitation use as the proportion of household members who 
reported improved toilet use for defecation (members >5 years) or for child feces disposal 
(members <5 years), for each household.  
  
We collected anthropometric measurements for children under five during round 3 
(February-June 2016), according to WHO standard methods[36,96]. Field workers 
measured recumbent length for children <2 years, standing height for children 2-5 years, 
and weight for children <5 years. Height/length were collected in duplicate, and if 
measurements differed by more than 0.7 cm, a third was collected; the mean of 
measurements was used to calculate z-scores according to WHO 2006 growth standards 
(R igrowup macro)[143]. Back-checks on height/length were conducted on a randomly 
selected 10% of households. Stunting, wasting and underweight were defined as z-scores 
less than -2.0, and severe stunting, wasting and underweight as z-scores less than -3.0. 
 
Field workers collected stool samples in round 2 (October 2015-January 2016) from all 
household members in a randomly selected subset of 500 households to assess prevalence 
of common soil-transmitted helminths. After stool sample collection, participating 
household members, excluding pregnant and breast-feeding women, were given one dose 
of albendazole, a broad spectrum anti-helminthic, in accordance with WHO 
recommendations. We initially intended to collect a follow-up stool sample in round 4, to 
measure reinfection in these household members. However, given the low response rate 
for stool collection, and low infection rate and intensity in round 2 samples, we decided 

56 
 
to forgo the follow-up measure. We used formalin ether concentration and microscopy to 
quantify worms and ova for hookworms (A. duodenale and N. americanus), Ascaris 
lumbricoides, Hymenolepis nana, and Tricuris trichura[144]. Three slides were examined 
for each sample, with all positives and 10% of negatives examined in duplicate. The 
mean of measurements was used to estimate eggs per gram (epg) of feces and to quantify 
worm burden. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the log odds of child diarrheal disease (the 
primary outcome) we determined a sample size of 45 villages per study arm and 26 
children per village, assuming 8.8% diarrhea prevalence, 0.20 effect size, 80% power, 
0.05 significance level and 10% loss to follow-up, as previously reported[137].  
 
We used logistic regression to estimate intervention association with prevalence of 
diarrheal disease, ARI, bruising/scrapes, and STH infection, accounting for clustering of 
observations within households and villages, and linear regression to estimate association 
with height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ) z 
scores. The same model structures were used to estimate intervention association with 
WaSH infrastructure coverage, access and use. Two level models were estimated using 
Gauss-Hermite quadrature with 12 integration points; three level models were estimated 
using Laplace approximation. Profile likelihood confidence intervals were estimated to 
limit potential bias from assumptions of asymptotic normality.  
 

57 
 
Missing household-level covariate data were handled with multi-level multiple 
imputation (R pan, version 1.4, and mitml, version 0.3-4, packages)[145,146]. The 
imputation model was run for 20 iterations, included all household-level covariates 
included in regression models, and was adjusted for clustering at the village level. 
Imputations were used in all following analyses[147].  
 
We used principal components analysis (R psych package, version 1.6.12) to construct a 
household wealth index from 15 variables, including household assets, housing 
characteristics, agricultural land ownership, and below poverty line status[148,149]. We 
used mixed Pearson, tetrachoric and polychoric correlation to handle the inclusion of 
binary, categorical and continuous variables, and extracted the component which 
explained the most variability as the wealth index[150]. 
 
Adjusted models were fit with an a priori determined set of village, household and 
individual-level covariates. Adjusted models of WaSH coverage, access and use included 
household wealth, religion, caste/tribe status, head of household’s education, primary 
caregiver’s education, and village access road quality. In addition to these variables, 
adjusted models of health outcomes included the individual’s age and sex. All regressions 
were repeated using the original, unimputed data, as a sensitivity check. All analyses 
were completed in R (version 3.3.2).

RESULTS 
Characteristics of the study population 
A total of 1123 households (1530 children under 5 years) in the intervention villages, and 
1275 households (1771 children under 5 years) in the control villages were enrolled over 
the four study rounds (Fig 1). Of 11,523 possible observations for children under five, 
9550 were available and included in the analysis, an average of 26.5 child observations 
per village per round. This equates to 17.1% loss to follow-up for children under five 
(and 10.4% for all household members) over the course of the study, but was similar 
across study arms. 
 
Intervention and control villages were well balanced on pre-intervention village-level 
characteristics used in the matching process[137]. After intervention implementation, 
trends in village, household, and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics were 
still generally similar across intervention and control villages (Table 5.1). However, there 

59 
 
were differences in household wealth and house construction, with intervention 
households less poor and living in better constructed houses.  
 
Coverage, availability and use of water, hygiene and sanitation facilities 
Access to a household improved toilet was almost five times higher in intervention 
villages than in control villages (85.0% v. 17.7%), as was access to an enclosed bathing 
room in the household (82.1% v. 12.1%) (Table 5.2). Access to household piped water 
and presence of a designated hand-washing station with water and cleansing agent 
available were also both substantially higher in intervention villages than control.  
 
The intervention was positively associated with improvements in round trip time to water 
source, though average time saved was only 5.85 minutes (95% CI: -7.78, -3.94) per trip 
(Table 3). However, the intervention was associated with lower odds of water 
availability, i.e. no interruptions in reported availability (aOR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.40), 
although almost 10% of households in both intervention and control villages reported 
some interruption in their preferred drinking water source. 
 
Household improved sanitation use was also substantially higher in intervention than 
control villages (60.7% v. 31.5%) (Table 5.3). Toilet use by elders (60 years and older), 
adult men and women (18 and 59 years), and older children (5-17 years) were all over 50 
percentage points higher in intervention than control villages (Table 5.2). Prevalence of 
improved child feces disposal was substantially higher in intervention than in control 
villages (34.8% v. 6.1%).  
 

60 
 
Health outcomes  
The 7-day diarrhea prevalence for children under five was slightly lower in intervention 
villages compared to control (5.3% v. 4.9%), however, there was no association with the 
intervention (aOR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.25) (Tables 5.4 and 5.5). Among all household 
members, prevalence of diarrhea was even lower, with no association with the 
intervention. 
 
The 7-day prevalence for ARI in children under five was similar in intervention and 
control villages (9.3% v. 10.3%), and was not associated with the intervention for either 
children under five or all household members (aOR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.84-1.25; and aOR: 
1.08, 95% CI: 0.94-1.24) (Table 5.5). There was also no intervention effect on prevalence 
of bruising/scrapes, collected as a negative control for self-reported health outcomes, for 
either children under five or all household members.  
 
Prevalence of any soil-transmitted helminthiasis among children under five was higher in 
control villages compared to the intervention (6.8% v. 3.9%), and there was evidence the 
intervention had a protective effect on infection with any STH (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 
1.00)(Tables 5.4 and 5.5). Prevalence of any STH infection in all household members 
was higher in control villages than intervention (11.5% v. 8.6%), but was not associated 
with the intervention. No A. lumbricoides and few T. trichiura infections were found in 
either study arm. The helminth burden was primarily due to infection with hookworms or 
H. nana, with hookworms the most prevalent across both study arms. For both study 
arms, STH burden falls into the lowest WHO classification with low cumulative STH 

61 
 
prevalence and low intensity of infection[151]. Reported use of an antihelminthic in the 
previous six months among household members who provided stool samples was similar 
between study arms (13.6% control v. 14.4% intervention).  
 
A smaller proportion of children under five were stunted in intervention villages 
compared to control (33.3% v. 40.4%); and, the intervention was positively associated 
with increased HAZ in children under five (+0.17 HAZ, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.31) (Table 5.5). 
The association between the intervention and HAZ in children under two was similar in 
magnitude to that in children under five, but was not as strong. While a smaller 
proportion of children under five were underweight or wasted in intervention villages 
than control, there was no intervention association with either WAZ or WHZ (Table 5.3).  
 
Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted for all water, sanitation and hygiene coverage, 
availability and use models, and all health models, comparing use of the multi-level 
imputed data with the unimputated data containing missing covariate values. We found 
no meaningful difference in adjusted estimates.  
 
DISCUSSION 
Our matched-cohort study assessed the impacts of a combined water and sanitation 
intervention in rural India. In contrast to interventions that involve only community-level 
water supplies and/or partial community sanitation coverage, the Gram Vikas MANTRA 
intervention was designed to provide piped water at each home and ensure every 

62 
 
household had an improved toilet and bathing room. The intervention was associated 
with substantial increases in piped water coverage and small reductions in time spent 
collecting water. It increased access to and use of improved sanitation, including for child 
feces disposal, and reduced the proportion of household members reporting practicing 
open defecation. The intervention was also associated with increased coverage of 
household hand-washing stations and bathing rooms. In these respects, the intervention 
was effective in accomplishing the target outputs of many WaSH initiatives. However, 
intermittent availability of preferred water sources and subsequent high levels of drinking 
water storage provided a possible source of continued exposure to enteric pathogens. It is 
possible the increase in household piped water coverage mainly indirectly impacted child 
health through increasing toilet use, instead of the expected direct impact if the piped 
system provided microbiologically high-quality water.  
 
Notwithstanding these overall gains in WaSH coverage, availability, and use, the health 
impacts of the intervention were mixed. There was no evidence the intervention was 
protective against diarrheal disease, the primary study outcome. However, prevalence 
was low in both study arms.  Our results are consistent with the findings of recent 
randomized controlled trials of sanitation interventions in both rural India under the Total 
Sanitation Campaign and in Mali under the Community-Led Total Sanitation approach 
[6,7,53]. There was no evidence the intervention was protective against acute respiratory 
infection despite increases in water and hand-washing station coverage; this may be 
attributed to remaining exposure pathways not affected by the WaSH intervention.  
 

63 
 
On the other hand, our results were suggestive of a protective effect against soil-
transmitted helminthiasis in children under five, though we may have had insufficient 
power to detect an effect, given the lower than expected prevalence. This is in contrast 
with previous trials in India, but consistent with other evidence on the impact of 
sanitation, particularly in the context of  increases in piped water coverage[47,52]. Future 
analyses of intervention impact on environmental fecal contamination and on the 
pathways through which the intervention impacted health could further elucidate this. 
 
The intervention was effective in improving HAZ in children under five; we found a 
similar magnitude gain to that reported in the Mali evaluation, which found similar 
reductions in reported open defecation[53]. However, unlike in the Mali evaluation, the 
effect in our study was not driven primarily by children under two years[53]. This could 
be due in part to different patterns of growth faltering in Mali and India: in India, 
children’s HAZ decreases more dramatically and remains lower in the second through 
fifth years of life[31]. In addition, since our study began after intervention completion, 
there was the opportunity for children to be born into less fecally contaminated 
environments, benefit from the intervention from birth, and thus have sustained 
nutritional benefits past the key developmental window of 6-24 months. The sustained 
impact on HAZ for children under five may be due in part to the increased sanitation 
coverage and use achieved by the intervention or to the combined effects of sanitation 
and household-level piped water.  
 

64 
 
There are several important limitations to this study. First, due to the long 
implementation period necessary for the intervention, intervention status was not 
randomly assigned. While intervention and control arms were well balanced after 
matching, there is still the possibility of imbalance on unobserved variables. To limit 
confounding, a set of a priori determined potential confounders were included in all 
models, although estimates are still subject to potential residual confounding. Second, 
WaSH behaviors, diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection were collected using 
self- and caregiver reports—a method known to be subject to measurement bias[94,152]. 
However, we found no difference in our negative control outcome, indicating any 
potential measurement bias for self-reported outcomes was not differential by study arm. 
 
This study provides evidence that a combined intervention, where provision of household 
water connections is contingent on community sanitation coverage, can substantially 
increase piped water coverage, decrease open defecation and improve child nutritional 
outcomes in India. Given previous evidence that increasing sanitation use, even with high 
coverage, is especially difficult in rural India, this study provides evidence to support 
combining household piped water with sanitation access[6,7,14].

ABSTRACT  
Enteric pathogens are transmitted through several environmental pathways, and require 
combination of interventions to fully interrupt transmission. We assessed whether an 
intervention, where household piped water connection is contingent on full community 
toilet coverage, reduced fecal environmental contamination. We collected survey data 
and samples from 45 intervention and 45 matched control villages in four rounds from 
June 2015-Oct 2016. Source water (n=1583) and drinking water (n=2044) were assayed 
for E. coli, Shigella spp., and V. cholerae, and children’s hands (n=976) for E. coli and 
Shigella spp. There was no association between the intervention and either prevalence or 
concentration of E. coli. in source water, drinking water, or on hands. The intervention 
substantially reduced the prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in source water 
(aRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.97); however, there was no association with prevalence of 
Shigella spp. in drinking water or on hands. Although the intervention was associated 
with high toilet use and coverage of household piped water connections, it had a limited 
impact on fecal contamination of waters and hands. Future interventions should focus on 
continuous provision of piped water and adequate chlorine residual in the distribution 
system, to reduce reliance on household drinking water storage. 
 
INTRODUCTION  
Diarrheal diseases, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and subclinical conditions such as 
environmental enteric dysfunction, account for a substantial burden of disease worldwide, 
and are associated with fecal environmental contamination[21,60]. Environmental 
transmission of enteric pathogens from feces to hosts is through multiple pathways. 
These pathways were first popularly conceptualized in the F-diagram, where pathogens in 

77 
a single individual host’s feces are transmitted through fingers, flies, fluids, 
fields/fomites, and foods to a second individual, and has since grown in complexity[153]. 
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) interventions are each capable of interrupting 
multiple transmission pathways, with sanitation and hygiene interventions providing 
primary barriers, and water protections providing a secondary barrier to transmission. 
Sanitation interventions should interrupt fecal contamination of the environment as well 
as decrease breeding locations for flies, while water interventions should prevent 
contamination of water and food supplies. To fully interrupt transmission of feces in the 
environment, interventions need to be combined. 
 
While there is evidence of WaSH interventions improving child health, several recent 
randomized controlled effectiveness trials have found limited or no protective effect on 
diarrheal diseases, undernutrition, and other child health outcomes[6,7]. This has raised 
questions about the extent to which these programs have reduced exposure to enteric 
pathogens—a fundamental link in the theory of change of WaSH interventions that is 
rarely investigated. There is limited evidence of water, sanitation, and hygiene 
interventions effectively reducing fecal contamination of the environment. A 2016 
systematic review found no effect of sanitation interventions on source or stored drinking 
water quality (9 studies), or on fecal contamination of hands (5 studies). Results greatly 
varied between studies, though the overall quality of the evidence was considered very 
poor[154]. Three recent randomized controlled sanitation trials, two in India and one in 
Mali, have shown limited impact on fecal indicator bacteria in source or household stored 
water, or on hands[6,7,53]. However, the two trials in India were targeted at the 

78 
household and reached low levels of community coverage of improved sanitation (<50% 
of households). Improvements in environmental fecal contamination may require 
complete community level sanitation coverage and use.  
 
There is little evidence of water interventions providing consistent improvements in fecal 
contamination in rural settings. While interventions that provide protections at the water 
source, such as protected wells, boreholes and public taps, have been shown to improve 
water quality at the point of collection, water is quickly re-contaminated during collection 
and storage[9,155,156]. Interventions that instead focus on water protections at the point-
of-use within the household have had mixed effects on health[157,158]. This may be 
attributed to the dependence of many interventions on consistent behaviors, e.g. safe 
water storage and appropriate treatment, instead of community-level infrastructure, such 
as networked water supply with access on the household premises.  
 
This study was nested within a matched cohort evaluation of a sanitation and household-
level piped water intervention implemented at the community level. Measures of 
environmental fecal contamination were intermediate outcomes along the intervention to 
health pathways of the main evaluation. The main health outcomes have been previously 
reported (Reese et al, under review). This study describes the effects of the combined 
piped water and sanitation intervention on fecal indicator bacteria and selected bacterial 
pathogens present in: 1) sources where households report collecting drinking water, 2) 
drinking water in the household, and 3) on children’s hands.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study design 
This study is part of a matched cohort evaluation to assess the effectiveness of a water 
and sanitation intervention in rural Ganjam and Gajapati districts within Odisha, India. 
Forty-five control villages were matched to 45 randomly selected intervention villages 
through a restriction, genetic matching, and exclusion process, as described 
elsewhere[137]. Matching was effective in balancing the intervention and control study 
arms on all variables used in the matching process[137]. Households with a child under 
age 5 were eligible for enrollment. If more than 40 households were eligible in a village, 
40 were randomly selected. Data were collected from June 2015-October 2016 in four 
study rounds, each approximately four months apart. 
 
Intervention 
The MANTRA program (Movement and Action Network for the Transformation of 
Rural Areas) was implemented by the Indian NGO, Gram Vikas. The intervention 
consisted of: 1) a household pour-flush toilet with dual soak-away pits, 2) an attached 
bathing room, and 3) household piped water connections in the toilet, bathing room, and 
the kitchen. Access to the piped-water system was contingent on full community 
coverage of household toilets. The intervention details are described elsewhere[137]. 
 
 
 

80 
Ethics 
The male and/or female head of the household provided written informed consent for the 
household. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, U.K (No. 9071) and Institute Ethics 
Committee of the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences of KIIT University, 
Bhubaneswar, India (KIMS/KIIT/IEC/053/2015).  
 
Water, sanitation and hygiene measures 
We collected data in each of the four study rounds from a randomly selected subset of 
households with a child under 5 years, across all intervention and control villages. 
Household surveys were administered to the primary caregiver in Odia and collected data 
on household sociodemographic characteristics, WaSH infrastructure, and household and 
individual behaviors. Field workers conducted spot check observations of WaSH 
infrastructure and conditions, including household water storage container type, covered 
status, and implement used to retrieve drinking water; presence of water and soap at the 
designated handwashing station; and presence of animal or human feces in the household 
compound. Field workers recorded reported water treatment for drinking water. In 
addition, in round 4, field workers measured chlorine residual in source and stored water 
samples using a colorimeter and the DPD method (Tintometer Inc. Sarasota, Fl; 0-4.0 
mg/L detection range, precision ±0.2 mg/L). Two source water samples from each 
village, including one piped water sample if available, were also tested in round 4 for 
nitrates and fluoride using a colorimeter (Tintometer Inc. Sarasota, Fl; NO3-: 0-1.0 mg/L 
detection range, precision ±0.1 mg/L; F-: 0.2-2mg/L detection range, precision ±0.09 

81 
mg/L). Before collecting hand rinse samples from children under 5, field workers noted 
whether children’s palms and finger pads appeared visibly soiled. 
 
Sample collection and processing 
We collected samples of the source water and drinking water for each household four 
times, once in each study round, and child hand rinse samples two times, in rounds 2 and 
4. If a household randomly selected for sampling was absent, field workers collected 
samples from the nearest enrolled household to the right. All samples were collected in 
sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco Modesto Salida, Ca). Field workers collected drinking 
water samples (500mL) by asking the primary caregiver, usually the mother, to provide 
water as she would if her child were thirsty, and pour the water from the glass or cup into 
the Whirl-Pak bag. Source water samples (500mL) were collected from the location 
identified as the primary source for drinking water by the study household; if multiple 
households identified the same source, only a single source water sample was collected. 
If the source was a tap or pump, it was flushed for 30 seconds before sample collection. 
Surface water samples were collected by dipping the open Whirl-Pak bag into the water 
from the access location most often used for collecting drinking water. Field workers 
collected hand rinse samples of the youngest child under 5 by placing the child’s hands 
one at a time into a Whirl-Pak bag pre-filled with 300mL of sterile PBS, and gently 
massaging each hand from the outside of the bag for 20 seconds. Rinses of children’s 
hands were collected as a proxy of the child’s exposure, and to provide a more general 
assessment of fecal contamination of the household environment, captured on a child’s 
hands during play behavior, beyond drinking water. 

82 
 
Samples were stored on ice during transport, and analyzed within 6 hours of collection 
using membrane filtration. We assayed source and drinking water for Escherichia coli, a 
WHO recommended fecal indicator bacteria, as well as Vibrio cholerae (round 1 only) 
and Shigella spp., both important waterborne pathogens. We assayed hand rinse samples 
for E. coli and Shigella spp. Samples assayed for E.coli were vacuum-filtered through a 
0.45µm mixed cellulose esters filter (Millicore Corporation, Billerica, MA), plated on m-
Coli Blue 24 (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA), and incubated at 35° C for 24 hours 
according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 10029[109]. Samples 
assayed for V. cholerae were vacuum-filtered through a 0.45µm mixed cellulose esters 
filter, and enriched in alkaline peptone water (HiMedia Labs Pvt. Ltd.) incubated at 35° C 
overnight. Positive samples were streaked on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar 
(HiMedia Labs Pvt. Ltd.), and incubated at 35° C for 24 hours[107]. Samples field 
presumptive positive for Vibrio spp. after plating were subjected to biochemical tests and 
then confirmed using agglutination with antisera for V. cholerae O1 and O139 
serogroups. Samples assayed for Shigella spp. were vacuum-filtered through a 0.22µm 
mixed cellulose esters filter (Millicore Corporation, Billerica, MA), plated on xylose 
lysine desoxycholate agar (HiMedia Labs Pvt. Ltd.) for Shigella spp. and incubated at 
35° C for 24 hours[108]. Samples that were field presumptive positive for Shigella spp. 
after plating were subjected to biochemical tests and then confirmed using agglutination 
with antisera for S. flexneri and S. dysenteria serogroups[108]. 
 

83 
One laboratory blank per laboratory technician per day, one laboratory positive control 
per target microbe per week, and one field blank per field sample collection team per day 
were processed for laboratory quality control. Field workers collected field blanks by 
opening a Whirl-Pak pre-filled with 300mL sterile PBS in the field, as if collecting a 
hand rinse sample. For each sample, we processed the direct sample and a 1:10 dilution. 
Detection limits were 0-200 CFU per 100mL for source and stored water samples, and 0-
200 CFU per two hands for hand rinses. 
 
Statistical analysis 
We calculated the concentration for each sample as the average of the two dilutions, 
substituting the value of 200 CFU, the upper detection limit, for counts above the 
detection limit. We tabulated prevalence of field presumptive positive Vibrio spp. and 
Shigella spp., and confirmed positive V. cholerae o1, V. cholerae O139, Shigella 
dysenteria, and Shigella flexneri. Confirmed positive V. cholerae and Shigella spp. were 
considered positive if serotype positive, and negative if serotype negative or field 
negative. Field presumptive positive samples which were not serotyped were excluded 
from confirmed positive prevalence and further analyses.  
 
We assessed the association between E. coli concentration and intervention status using 
negative binomial regression to account for overdispersion with a random effect to 
account for observations clustered within villages. An additional random effect to 
account for observations clustered within households was considered but not included 
due to the low average number of observations per household. We assessed the 

84 
association between confirmed positive Shigella dysenteria and flexneri (combined), and 
confirmed positive V. cholerae O1 and O139 (combined), and intervention status using 
Poisson regression with robust standard errors, and including a random effect for village.  
 
For all models, we adjusted for the following a priori determined set of potential 
confounders: household caste/tribe, religion, women’s education, and wealth quintile, for 
source and drinking water samples, and additionally adjusted for child sex and age for 
hand rinse samples. Wealth quintile was calculated through principal components 
analysis of 15 variables, including household assets, housing characteristics, agricultural 
land ownership, and below poverty line status (Reese et al, under review). We assessed 
effect modification of the intervention by rainfall by including an interaction with a 
dummy variable for rainy v. dry season in adjusted models. Odisha, India typically has a 
southwest monsoon season from June to September, in which it receives the majority of 
its rainfall and environmental contamination may increase. Data processing was 
completed in R version 3.3.2 and regressions in STATA version 15 (StataCorp, College 
Station, Tx)[159]. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We collected environmental samples from 840 total households over the four rounds: 533 
households in round 1, 469 in round 2, 531 in round 3, and 549 in round 4. From these 
households, we collected 1583 source water samples, 2044 stored drinking water 
samples, and 976 rinses of children’s hands (Figure 1).  
 

85 
Depending on sample type, 3-9% of observations were missing assay results due to an 
insufficient quantity of sample collected, or turbid samples resulting in plates with too 
much particulate matter to accurately count. However, missing assay results were not 
differential by intervention arm. In addition, a lower proportion of source water samples 
were collected each round in intervention villages than control (68% v. 84% of total 
households selected for sampling). This is likely due to the reliance on piped water and 
the frequency of water system intermittencies in intervention villages. If the networked 
water system was off at the time of the field worker visit, it was not possible to collect 
source water samples for those households that reported the piped system as their primary 
source. In addition, assay results for E. coli from six villages in round 4 were excluded 
due to contamination of negative controls.  
 
The parent matched cohort study population was well-balanced on pre-intervention 
characteristics; however, there were some differences after intervention completion[137]. 
Intervention households were wealthier (18% v. 30% in the poorest quintile) than control 
households (Table 6.1). 
 
Source water 
A greater proportion of intervention households than control used a piped water source 
on the household premises (67% v. 7%), with fewer intervention than control households 
using a public piped water source (4% v. 16%)(Table 6.2). Over 29% of control 
households relied on an unprotected well, unprotected spring, or surface water, compared 
to only 12% of intervention households. Similar to the water source used for drinking 

86 
water, a greater proportion of intervention households reported using a piped water 
source on the household premises for other uses, including cooking, bathing and toilet 
use. We tested piped water sources (n=15), when available at the time of sample 
collection, and none had detectable chlorine residual (Table 6.5). Fluoride and nitrates 
were detected in the majority of source water samples in both study arms (F: 92% v. 
100%, and NO3: 76% v. 79%), though levels did not exceed the WHO guidelines (Table 
6.5)[160].  
 
Over 80% of source water samples were positive for E. coli in both study arms (Table 
6.3). Average E. coli concentration was similar between study arms (4.8 × 101 cfu/100ml 
in the intervention v. 5.2 × 101 cfu/100ml in the control) (Figure 6.2). There was no 
intervention association with prevalence (aRR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.09) or concentration 
of E. coli (0.65, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.10) adjusting for sociodemographic variables (Table 
6.4). However, after including an interaction term for rainy season and intervention, the 
intervention was associated with increased E. coli concentration in the rainy season, 
(1.49, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.20), while the intervention in the dry season was associated with 
lower E. coli concentration (0.55, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.01) (Table 6.7). A smaller proportion 
of source water samples were positive for S. dystenteriae or S. flexneri in intervention 
communities compared to control (12.2% v. 9.7%, S. dysenteriae and S. flexneri 
combined). Of these, most samples were positive for S. dysenteriae. The intervention had 
a substantial protective effect on prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in source 
water, adjusting for sociodemographic variables (aRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.97)(Table 
6.4). A slightly larger proportion of intervention source water samples were positive for 

87 
V. cholerae O1 compared to the control; however, there was no difference by study arm 
(aRR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.46, 3.14). 
 
Drinking water 
A greater proportion of intervention households reported treating their drinking water 
compared to control (47.9% v. 36.7%), with boiling the most common method across 
both study arms (Table 6.2). Only 7 households, all in the same intervention village, had 
total chlorine detected in their stored water at time of sample collection, and none had 
detectable free chlorine residual (Table 6.5). Regardless of intervention status, the 
majority of households stored their drinking water (98.0% intervention v. 99.7% control 
households). Over 80% of households in both study arms covered stored water 
containers, with approximately a quarter using a container with a narrow mouth to limit 
post-collection water contamination (Table 6.2). Few households in the intervention or 
control arms (19% v. 16%) poured water from the container, or used another method to 
retrieve water which limits contamination, when asked for a sample of the drinking 
water. 
 
The majority of drinking water samples from both intervention and control households 
were positive for E. coli (95% v. 91%) (Table 6.3). Average E. coli concentration was 
similar between study arms (4.8 × 101 cfu/100ml in the intervention v. 6.1 × 101 
cfu/100ml in the control). There was no intervention association with either prevalence 
(aRR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.03) or concentration of E. coli (0.94, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.28) 
adjusting for sociodemographic variables (Table 6.4). Approximately 10% of stored 

88 
drinking water samples were positive for S. dystenteriae or S. flexneri in both study arms 
(9.8% v. 10.4%, dysenteriae and flexneri combined). There was no intervention 
association with prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in stored drinking water 
(aRR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.49). Approximately a quarter of drinking water samples in 
both study arms were positive for V. cholerae O1; there was no difference by study arm 
(aRR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.87) (Tables 6.3 and 6.4). 
 
Hands 
We observed soap or detergent (56% v. 25%), and water (78% v. 60%) at a designated 
location for handwashing in greater proportion of intervention households compared to 
control (Table 6.2). We observed that almost half of children in both study arms had 
visibly soiled hands, with dirt equally likely to be on finger pads and palms. There was no 
intervention association with soiled hands (aRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.08) (Table 6.6). 
However, after including an interaction term for rainy season and intervention, the 
intervention was associated with a reduced risk of visibly soiled hands in the dry season 
(aRR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98), while the intervention increased risk of visibly soiled 
hands in the rainy season, though not significantly (aRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.72) 
(Table 6.7).  
 
The majority of children’s hands from both intervention and control households were 
positive for E. coli (90% v. 92%) (Table 6.3). Average E. coli concentration was similar 
between study arms (4.1 × 101 cfu/hands in the intervention v. 5.2 × 101 cfu/hands in the 
control) (Figure 6.2). There was no intervention association with either prevalence (aRR: 

89 
0.99, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.04) or concentration of E. coli (0.82, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.15) adjusting 
for sociodemographic variables (Table 6.4). Approximately 10% of children’s hands 
were positive for S. dystenteriae or S. flexneri in both study arms (10.9% v. 11.0%, S. 
dysenteriae and S. flexneri combined), and there was no association with the intervention 
(aRR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.34).  
 
Observation of feces in household compound 
While animal or suspected human feces were observed in almost a third of households, 
the intervention had no effect on observation of any feces in the household compound 
(aRR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.22) (Table 6.6).  
 
Discussion 
The combined piped-water and sanitation intervention had little effect on fecal 
contamination of the household environment. In source waters, the intervention improved 
Shigella contamination, but had no effect on E. coli or V. cholerae contamination, 
although there is some evidence that seasonality may moderate the impact of the 
intervention. This could in part be due to low exclusive use of household piped sources in 
intervention communities, diluting the potential intervention effect if adherence had been 
higher. Although two thirds of intervention households used the piped water connection 
as their primary source, 10% reported using an unimproved source. Although the 
intervention most commonly employed a gravity-fed system into a community 
containment tank with the spring protected at the source, contamination could have been 
introduced either through microbe ingress when water pressure drops during the daily or 

90 
biweekly interruptions in piped water access experienced by over 15% of intervention 
households, or through biofilm formation on the walls of the containment tank or within 
the pipe distribution system itself, with no or insufficient chlorination to last throughout 
the system[161]. In addition, there was no evidence that the piped water was chlorinated 
at the WHO recommended minimum level (0.5 mg/L chlorine)[160].  
 
The intervention did not reduce fecal contamination of drinking water, the majority of 
which was stored within the household regardless of the proximity of the water source. 
Since there were limited intervention impacts on fecal contamination of source waters, 
there would only be improvements in stored water quality if sufficient and consistent 
water treatment and safe water storage were practiced. The provision of household-level 
piped water access in intervention communities should have theoretically eliminated, or 
at least substantially reduced, the need to store drinking water within the household. The 
majority of intervention households still stored water (98%), perhaps due to cultural 
practices or concerns about water availability. In addition, the intervention focused on 
providing quality drinking water at the point-of-use in the household, and did not include 
contingencies for water storage to reduce post-collection contamination. Although over a 
third of households in both study arms report treating drinking water, the most common 
method was boiling, which is not effective at preventing recontamination.  
 
The intervention had mixed impacts on fecal contamination of children’s hands. While 
the intervention did not reduce E. coli or Shigella contamination of children’s hands in 
models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, it increased the risk of E. coli 

91 
contamination on children’s hands during the rainy season when adjusting for effect 
modification by season. This mixed impact by season in intervention households may be 
attributed in part to flooding of the household compound, not uncommon in the rainy 
season, coupled with pour flush toilets with soak-away pits located in close proximity to 
the household. Although use of the improved toilets may be high regardless of season, 
flooding of the soak-away pits has the potential to coat the household compound in fecal 
contamination, which a young child may become exposed to through normal crawling 
behaviors. Future analyses should assess fecal contamination of soil from the household 
compound to provide a broader evaluation of environmental contamination that may be 
less susceptible to diurnal variability than hand contamination.  
 
There were several limitations to this study. First, hand contamination is highly variable 
over the course of a day, and dependent on the activity the individual was doing 
immediately before the sample was collected[162]. Since it was not feasible to 
standardize the time of hand rinse collection across all households, this introduces 
additional noise into already highly variable data. We also measured observation of hand 
cleanliness as proxy measure for fecal contamination. However, this measure is likely 
also associated with similar diurnal changes as microbial contamination. Hand rinse 
samples were collected twice during the study period, water samples were collected up to 
four times for each household across the 16 month study period. This allowed for 
temporal variation in fecal contamination influenced by season. However, since 
household fecal contamination levels may vary even within the same day, the single 
collection per study round may not fully capture variability[163,164].  

92 
 
Another limitation is the use of E. coli as a fecal indicator bacteria. While E. coli is a 
standard non-human specific indicator of fecal contamination, the limitations of this 
indicator are well-established[110–112]. E. coli is not consistently correlated with enteric 
pathogens, and is associated with animal as well as human feces. Given that almost half 
of all households owned livestock (46% in both intervention and control), it’s possible 
that livestock feces may have contributed to fecal contamination of the household 
environment, also contributing to E. coli prevalence. Despite its limitations, E. coli is 
used internationally as an indicator bacteria to assess the microbiological contamination 
of water, and a systematic review provided evidence of an association with diarrheal 
diseases[111]. In addition, to better characterize likely human fecal contamination of the 
household environment, Vibrio cholerae and Shigella were selected based on prevalence 
in southern Asia, evidence of public health importance, and field laboratory 
limitations[113–115]. Although the use of both a standard fecal indicator bacteria and 
two enteric pathogens strengthened the quality of evidence provide by this study, future 
studies should use molecular techniques as a complement to culture based methods. In 
addition, this study focused only on bacterial pathogens and did not measure potential 
effects on viral or protozoan pathogens. 
 
In addition, samples which were positive for V. cholerae O1 were not further tested for 
cholera toxin, a component essential for the toxigenicity of V. cholerae O1. Since there is 
evidence of non-toxigenic V. cholerae in environmental waters, especially marine and 
estuarine waters, there is the possibility that the V. cholerae O1 detected in this study was 

93 
not toxigenic and therefore not a health concern. However, a large number of samples 
that were presumptive positive for Shigella spp. and Vibrio spp. were not serotyped, and 
were therefore excluded from further analysis. In addition, both S. sonnei, a serogroup we 
did not test for in this study, and non-agglutinable Shigella, are becoming more prevalent 
in India[113]. Thus, our estimates of both confirmed Shigella spp. and V. cholerae were 
likely conservative. 
 
Lastly, this study was part of a larger matched cohort study, with households randomly 
selected for measurement of environmental outcomes. While the matched cohort study 
was well-balanced after matching, there is the possibility of confounding. To limit the 
possibility of confounding, we adjusted for household wealth, caste/tribe status, religion, 
and the primary caregiver’s education in all models, and additionally child age and sex in 
hand rinse models. However, due to the observational nature of the study, it is possible 
that there is still some residual confounding.

Chapter 7. Conclusion 
Summary of findings 
This dissertation describes the effectiveness of a matched cohort evaluation of a 
combined WaSH intervention implemented in rural Odisha, India, which involves 
household-level piped water connections contingent on full community sanitation 
coverage. Aim 1, covered in Chapter 5, assessed the association between the intervention 
and water, sanitation and hand-washing station coverage, availability, and use. Aim 2, 
covered in Chapter 6, assessed the association between the intervention and fecal 
contamination of source water, drinking water, and children’s hands. Aim 3, also covered 
in Chapter 5, assessed the association between the intervention and diarrheal diseases, 
acute lower respiratory infections, soil-transmitted helminth infections, and 
undernutrition characterized by low height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height 
for children under 5 years.  
 
In Chapter 4, we provide a description of the intervention and the overarching study for 
the three dissertation aims. The MANTRA water and sanitation intervention was 
implemented by Gram Vikas, an NGO based in Odisha, India. The program approach 
follows a three-phase process over an average of three years. During the first, or 
Motivational, phase, Gram Vikas assesses village interest and progress towards a set of 
Gram Vikas requirements, including the commitment of every household to participate, 
creation of a village corpus fund, and development of village guidelines for maintenance 
and use of future water and sanitation infrastructure. In the second, or Operational, phase 
of the intervention, each household constructs a pour-flush toilet with two soak-pits and 

103 
an attached bathing room, through a combination of household and Gram Vikas 
resources. At the same time, a water tank and piped water distribution system protected at 
the source and connected to every household, is constructed through a similar 
collaborative process. All households must construct a toilet and bathing room for the 
village to progress into the final, or Completed, phase of the intervention, in which the 
water system is turned on. Notably, this three-phase process only allows each household 
access to piped water once every household in the village has a toilet and bathing room.  
  
This study used a matched cohort study design to assess the effectiveness of the 
completed MANTRA intervention as implemented in Ganjam and Gajapati districts in 
Odisha, India. Study intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of villages 
with completed interventions provided by Gram Vikas. Control villages were matched to 
the randomly selected intervention villages through a multi-step restriction, genetic 
matching, and exclusion process. This resulted in balance between the 45 intervention 
and 45 matched control villages on all pre-intervention sociodemographic characteristics 
used in the matching process. We conducted surveys and observations, and collected 
stool and environmental samples between June 2015-October 2016 in households with a 
child under five.  
 
In Chapter 5, we assessed the association of the intervention with WaSH coverage, 
availability and use, as well as with child health. Multi-level logistic regression was used 
to estimate intervention association with prevalence of diarrheal disease, ARI, 
bruising/scrapes, and STH infection, while linear regression was used to estimate 

104 
association with HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ. The same model structures were used to 
estimate association with WaSH coverage, availability, and use. Models were adjusted 
for clustering of observations within households and villages, as relevant, and adjusted 
for an a priori determined set of village, household and individual-level covariates. Multi-
level multiple imputation was used to handle missing household-level covariate data. The 
imputation was run for 20 iterations and was used in the remainder of analyses.  
Compared to controls, intervention villages had higher improved toilet coverage as well 
as increased toilet use by adults and for child feces disposal. However, use of a toilet for 
child feces disposal was still very low compared to adult toilet use even in intervention 
villages (35% v. 74%). The intervention was also associated with increased access to 
piped water on the household premises, and a designated hand-washing station with 
available water and cleansing agent. However, almost all households in both study arms 
storing drinking water, and only a quarter followed safe storage practices (using a 
covered, narrow mouthed container). There was no intervention association with 
prevalence of diarrheal diseases or respiratory infection; even though, unlike in previous 
rigorous evaluations in India, there were substantial increases in improved sanitation 
use[6,7]. However, children in intervention villages had substantially lower odds of 
helminthiasis (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.00) and improved HAZ (+0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-
0.31) compared to the control. This was a similar magnitude increase in HAZ to that seen 
in the Pickering et al study, although our study showed sustained impacts to age 5[53]. 
Our study provides new evidence that a combined WaSH intervention can substantially 
reduce open defecation and improve child nutritional outcomes and STH infection in 
rural India. Together with previous evidence, the findings do not support an association 

105 
between improvements in sanitation and water coverage, and diarrheal diseases in 
children under five in rural, low-resource settings, though they do provide evidence of an 
association with increases in HAZ and reductions in STH infections. Further research is 
needed to assess the different mechanisms through which these mixed impacts on health 
occur. 
 
In Chapter 6, we assessed the association of the intervention with fecal contamination of 
source water, drinking water, and children’s hands. Multi-level Poisson regression with 
robust standard errors was used to estimate intervention association with prevalence of 
E.coli, Shigella flexneri and dystenteria (combined), and V. cholerae, while negative 
binomial regression was used to estimate association with E. coli concentration. Models 
were adjusted for clustering of observations within villages, and adjusted for an a priori 
determined set of household and individual-level covariates. The majority of all samples 
in both study arms were positive for E. coli. There was no association between the 
intervention and either prevalence or concentration of E. coli. in source water, drinking 
water, or on hands. The intervention substantially reduced the prevalence of S. dysenteria 
and S. flexneri (combined) in source water; however, there was no association with 
prevalence of Shigella spp. in drinking water or on hands. There was also no association 
with prevalence of V. cholerae in source or drinking waters. These results are in line with 
previous findings that water quality declines after collection from the source[155]. Given 
the similarity in drinking water storage practices between the intervention and control 
study arms, any direct health benefit from improvements in water quality at the source 
may have been negated by post-collection contamination during drinking water storage. 

106 
Further analysis will help determine whether the on-premise piped water supply had 
indirect impacts on health, potentially through increasing use of the pour-flush toilets 
(Table 7.1). Future on-premise piped water interventions should focus on ensuring 
consistent water availability, and maintaining the WHO recommended 0.2-0.5 mg/l 
chlorine residual level within the distribution system, reducing the need for storing 
drinking water[160]. Additional research is needed to determine if there are cultural 
determinants of drinking water storage behaviors that would not be affected by changes 
in water availability and quality. 
 
Reflections on study limitations and the potential for improvements  
There are several limitations to the study used in this dissertation. Some of these 
limitations have been discussed previously within earlier chapters, but are discussed in 
more detail below. 
 
Selection of households 
There was a high level of variability in the number of eligible households between study 
villages. Some villages had as few as three households with a child under 5, while other 
villages had over a hundred eligible households. This not only reduced the ability to 
equally capture within cluster variability and assess community level characteristics, but 
increased the possibility of losing a cluster during follow-up due to absence of only a few 
children. While we were powered to detect the expected change in primary outcome, 
diarrheal disease, in the future, I would include variability in cluster size to power 
calculations[165].  
 

107 
In addition, selection of households with a child under five years, although the target 
population for the main evaluation, reduced our ability to assess the influence of WaSH 
coverage and behaviors for those households directly proximate to each child’s 
household on the child’s health, in future analyses. However, in villages with over 40 
eligible households, study households were selected using systematic random sampling to 
improve the geographic distribution of households within the village. Future analyses of 
community and sub-community effects on household or individual measures rely on the 
assumption that households with a child under 5 are similar in behaviors and exposures to 
non-study households. These analyses would also be strengthened by assessing and 
adjusting for spatial autocorrelation. 
 
Matched design  
Since it was not feasible to use a randomized controlled study design, but instead a 
matched cohort design, this study is subject to the usual limitations of observational 
studies including the potential for residual confounding. There is limited internal validity 
compared to a randomized controlled trial since the intervention was not randomly 
allocated. In addition, the criteria used to select intervention villages reduced the external 
validity of this study, providing a form of sampling bias by restricting villages included 
in the study to those that fit the restriction criteria and were similar to intervention 
communities.  
 
While the matching process resulted in balance between the intervention arms, this study 
is reliant on the quality of the matching data. The matching process relied on data from 

108 
two national level surveys, the 2001 census and the Below Poverty Line (BPL) Survey 
from 2003. These data were aggregated village estimates, and had a limited number of 
applicable variables to use. In addition, village BPL Survey data were only available 
from the associated district office, not a centralized source. Although we were able to 
obtain data from the Ganjam district office, there were complexities trying to work with 
the Gajapati office, and we eventually relied on scraping the website to obtain these 
publicly available data. Though the Gajapati data included all blocks within the district, it 
is possible there were differences in the data obtained from the district office compared to 
that available from their website. However, it is unlikely this would be differential across 
intervention and control study villages. 
 
After matching, some villages were excluded from selection due to logistical constraints, 
including being located more than a 3-hour journey from the field office. Several 
intervention villages were excluded from the study because the village was not accessible 
via car and required a long hike up the mountainside (> 3-hour total travel time). With the 
remoteness of these villages, it is quite impressive that Gram Vikas was able to 
successfully implement their intervention. Given previous evidence of a negative 
association between diarrheal diseases and village remoteness, it’s possible the 
intervention may have been more or less successful in remote villages[166]. We adjusted 
for village accessibility (access road type) for infrastructure and health outcomes as a 
proxy for remoteness in the selected villages, however future research should further 
consider the effectiveness of community level interventions in remote versus highly 
accessible villages.   

109 
 
Retrospective design 
The several year time lapse between intervention completion and the beginning of the 
evaluation process prevents baseline comparison between study arms or assessment of 
immediate intervention impacts. However, it does allow for a biologically plausible 
length of time for die-off of even the most persistent pathogens in the environment, and 
provides time for children to have be born into this environment. In addition, it allows for 
the assessment of longer-term sustained impacts; most evaluations of WaSH 
interventions assess intervention impacts shortly after implementation and provide no 
evidence of longer-term effects.  
 
Since the implementation process involved the community opting into the intervention, 
there is the potential for communities with greater collective efficacy choosing to 
participate in the intervention or potentially having more a more effective intervention. 
This evaluation was conducted retrospectively, so it was not possible to measure 
collective efficacy at baseline, nor, given the reliance on previously collected data for the 
matching process, to match on collective efficacy. Future analysis of collective efficacy 
measured during study follow-up could provide some indication of whether a 
community’s collective efficacy is associated with intervention effectiveness.  
 
In addition, since we were reliant on a retrospective design, a process evaluation to assess 
intervention implementation, and a contemporaneous accounting of implementation costs 
for the cost and cost-effectiveness analysis was not possible.  

110 
 
Intervention approach 
The single arm combined intervention approach used by Gram Vikas limited our ability 
to assess the impact of the individual water or sanitation components, or to determine 
whether there is a synergistic effect of the combined intervention. However, a future 
analysis of the direct and indirect intervention effects on health through water and 
sanitation coverage, availability, and use could provide some limited evidence of the 
indirect impacts through the program theory of change. 
 
 
Water distribution system 
We did not examine water quality along the water distribution system to determine 
relative effectiveness of the intervention process at each stage, including both structural 
and operational factors. Several factors could influence the quality of water coming 
directly from the tap within the household. First, structural factors include adequate 
protection at the source, and use of a microbiologically and chemically uncontaminated 
source. While Gram Vikas devoted resources in initial selection of a water source, 
occasionally requiring use of a source located several kilometers away from the 
benefiting community, we did not assess quality at the point where water enters the 
system due to logistical constraints. Second, the transmission main from water source to 
the community reservoir, and the distribution system from the reservoir to the 
households, are susceptible to infiltration of contaminants and biofilm formation. Third, 
the water stored in the community water reservoir is also susceptible to biofilm 
formation. Given the high prevalence of fecal contamination even in on-premise piped 

111 
waters in our study, further research of networked water supply systems in low-resource 
rural settings should include assessment of microbiological water quality, as well as 
indicators of biofilm formation, at multiple points within the distribution system.  
 
Operational factors including slow water velocity within the distribution system, changes 
in water pressure, long water detention times in the water tower, and hydraulic conditions 
within the distribution system which allow sediment to accumulate, all influence water 
quality. We measured water intermittencies (self-reported interruptions in water 
availability at any time in the previous 24 hours, and for more than a day in the previous 
two weeks) in all study communities, providing a broad measure of these operational 
characteristics. While this indicated issues with water velocity and water pressure, it is 
not specific enough to allow detailed identification of issues. In addition, we did not 
assess the maintenance and repair procedures within each village which may also have 
influenced water quality. This includes adequate regular disinfection of the reservoir, 
repair and replacement of damaged pipes, and appropriate flushing and disinfection 
processes following any pipeline repairs. Further research assessing priority operational 
measures as well as barriers to use within rural low-resource settings is of programmatic 
interest given the SDG focus on provision of piped water sources. 
 
The intervention distribution system was engineered to fit the geographic limitations and 
population needs of each community; there was no simple systematic and consistent 
methodology we could use across all 45 intervention communities to assess the water 
distribution system. Since the implementing NGO, Gram Vikas, was not able to provide 

112 
even model system blueprints, we decided obtaining blueprints for each village from the 
corresponding block administrative office (an administrative level below district) was not 
logistically feasible. Without a more detailed assessment of the distribution system, this 
study was not able to isolate the specific deficiencies of the intervention, aside from the 
need for improved water availability and increased chlorine residual, and thus has limited 
ability to provide additional evidence for programmatic improvements. 
 
Measurement methods 
There is a need for more sensitive and objective measures for behaviors, exposures, and 
health outcomes. We relied primarily on self-reported behaviors (water treatment, toilet 
use, child feces disposal), and self-reported health outcomes (diarrheal diseases and 
respiratory infections). Use of sensors, such as passive latrine use monitors (PLUMs), in 
a subset of household could have a provided more objective measures for behaviors[152]. 
For self-reported health outcomes, we used the prevalence of bruising or scrapes as a 
negative control outcome, and found no evidence of differential reporting bias. But, there 
is still the possibility of non-differential inflation or deflation of reported values. The 
reliance on self-reported diarrheal disease provides an estimate only of symptomatic 
disease during the short window captured within the recall period. The future planned 
analysis of seroprevalence for a panel of enteric pathogens will provide a more specific 
assessment, especially given previous evidence of association between reported diarrheal 
disease and Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium parvum point seroprevalence 
within a water quality intervention[167]. 
 

113 
Another limitation is the reliance on the fecal indicator bacteria, E. coli, to assess fecal 
contamination of waters and hands. An indicator specific to human feces or a panel of 
enteric pathogens could have been assessed in a subset of households, providing more 
objective and specific exposure measures. While the use of culture based methods 
provided assurance that detected bacteria were viable, use of a ddPCR or another 
quantitative molecular method would have provided more specific and precise estimates 
for a broader group of enteric pathogens. In addition, the data collection process for this 
study did not allow temporally linking exposure data (WaSH infrastructure and 
behaviors, fecal contamination of water and hands, etc.) and health outcomes. Both 
exposure and outcome data were collected the same day, and thus attribution of 
association assumes the exposure was continuous. Future studies should consider 
collection of exposure measures within the incubation period for common pathogens 
prior to collecting outcomes, although this may be logistically difficult and cost 
prohibitive in field settings.  
 
Quality control and data loss 
The discrepancies in identifiers for household observations across rounds and 
environmental samples across labs made data processing very time consuming and led to 
some data loss. Barcoding households, sample collection containers, petri dishes, and 
chain of custody forms used to document sample transfer between laboratories would 
have streamlined the process. In addition, the ODK platform used to collect data for all 
household surveys, observations, and sample collection has built-in barcode support, 
making this a very feasible improvement. 

114 
 
In addition, there were issues with incomplete implementation of chemical water 
assessment. Although we intended to test source water for chlorine residual in all 
villages, we only had results for 15. There were several barriers to this including: 1) data 
loss due to incorrect sample identification, as discussed above, 2) inability to test water 
due to lost materials (affected several villages before additional materials could be 
ordered), 3) water source unavailable during the field visit, for community or household 
piped water sources, and 4) the primary water source is not relevant for chemical 
disinfection, such as use of surface waters. Although there was negligible reported use of 
chlorination, and no detection of chlorine residual in those samples we were able to 
analyze, testing source waters in all villages would have provided much stronger 
evidence to support this conclusion.  
 
There were also issues with contamination in the field lab and with sample transfer 
between laboratories. Low level contamination (median 10 cfu/100mL) of plates within 
the field laboratory over several days resulted in data loss for that round for all village 
samples processed those days. A large number of samples that were presumptive positive 
for Shigella spp. and Vibrio spp. were not transferred to the lab to be serotyped, and were 
excluded from further analysis resulting in substantial data loss. The proportion of 
presumptive positive samples transferred for serotyping also differed substantially 
between study rounds, limiting our ability to assess seasonality, and included the 
unplanned transfer and serotyping of some negative samples. Both S. sonnei, a serogroup 
we did not test for in this study, and non-agglutinable Shigella, are becoming more 

115 
prevalent in India[114]. Multiple imputation (MI) for missing confirmed positive Shigella 
and V. cholerae outcome data could have been used to improve the power of subsequent 
analyses; however, there is evidence that use of MI for estimation of relative risks 
produces biased estimates regardless of the approach used[168]. 
 
Policy and program recommendations 
This study occurred within the context of almost two decades of Government of India 
programming to eliminate open defecation. Previous government initiatives include the 
Total Sanitation Campaign (1999-2012), Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (2012-2014), and the 
current campaign, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (2014-2019). There are only minor 
differences between the objectives of these programs: each sought to provide sanitation 
coverage across rural India through a demand-driven, community-led framework[169]. 
 
While objectives were similar between the government programs, implementation was 
not. The TSC provided small subsidies as incentives for household toilet construction for 
below poverty line (BPL) households, and included a strong information, education and 
communication (IEC) software component. However, there was a substantial gap 
between program objectives and implementation. The focus on monitoring sanitation 
coverage, and in some cases, subsidy distribution as a proxy for coverage, likely 
contributed to the general poor quality and/or incomplete construction that affected over 
30% of household toilets, according to a Comptroller and Auditor General of India 
(CAG) audit[170]. In addition, the CAG audit, as well as policy research not affiliated 
with the Indian government, determined that both the TSC and the NBA were subject to 

116 
poor coordination between administrative levels, widespread lack of fund disbursement at 
all levels, as well as misappropriation of funds that were disbursed[171,170]. The TSC 
was rebranded as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in 2012, with an increased focus on 
creating community demand for sanitation, but had minimal differences in 
implementation[171]. 
 
The NBA was then restructured into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) in 2014, with urban 
and rural programs addressed separately. It expanded incentives for household toilets to 
both BPL and select above poverty line (APL) households, and included a focus on 
construction of school and anganwadi toilets[169]. In addition, the subsidy allotted for 
household toilet construction was increased, with the aim to encourage water provision at 
the toilet, and there was an emphasis on community engagement throughout the 
implementation process. In addition, there is an increased focus on monitoring sanitation 
use, not only coverage. Due to these factors, there is reason to believe that the SBA may 
prove more effective than previous program iterations. 
 
As discussed previously within this dissertation, two independent evaluations of the TSC 
found little improvements in toilet use, and no improvements in health[6,7]. There has 
been no rigorous evaluation, to date, of the effectiveness of the newest program, the SBA, 
on child health. In contrast, this dissertation has shown that the Gram Vikas intervention 
has been effective at substantially increasing toilet coverage and use, and in improving 
select health outcomes. Given the mixed success of this program, future programming in 
rural India should build upon the framework used by Gram Vikas (community-level 

117 
mobilization, and the combination of on-premise piped water access and high-quality 
household toilets), with some additional improvements. Based on this dissertation, the 
simplest and likely most effective remaining infrastructure improvements would be 
ensuring quality water at the tap, regardless of intermittencies. An automatic chlorine 
dosing system could be installed at the community reservoir, with the dosage calibrated 
to provide an adequate free chlorine residual through the maximum time that drinking 
water is generally stored. This method would require some preliminary assessment of 
drinking water storage practices, likely water system intermittencies, and chlorine 
concentration taste-tests for the target populations to determine an appropriate and 
acceptable chlorine dose. In addition to the hardware, some behavioral programming 
could target increased toilet use by children and adult men, and for child feces disposal, 
as well as decreased use of drinking water storage, and improved storage practices 
(narrow-mouthed, covered container with a tap) for other water purposes. 
 
Recommendations for future research 
This dissertation has provided additional evidence of the effectiveness of community 
level sanitation interventions, but there are still further research gaps including 
opportunities within the current study framework. Future planned analyses within the 
Gram Vikas study are listed in Table 7.1; a few are described in more detail below. 
 
Given the strong effect of the intervention on WaSH coverage and use, but the 
heterogenous effects on child health, there is a need to further assess the pathways 
through which these impacts may occur. Structured equation modeling can be used to 

118 
examine the pathways through which the combined intervention impacted child health 
outcomes to: 1) separate direct from indirect impacts, and 2) determine where there were 
breakages in the theory of change. Further assessment will provide a stronger evidence 
base for program development in similar low-resource rural settings (Table 7.1). In 
addition, given the distribution of community sanitation coverage (35%-100% of 
households in intervention villages v. 0%-86% of households in control villages) and 
sanitation use (0%-93% of individuals in intervention villages v. 0%-66% of individuals 
in control villages) this study provides the opportunity to further examine the potential of 
a dose-response relationship between community sanitation and health outcomes (Table 
7.1). In addition, it offers the possibility to assess the relative contributions of individual, 
household, and community behaviors as well as the potential moderating effect of each 
level. While previous research has explored the effects of community, and sub-
neighborhood sanitation contributions to health, there is still a need for a stronger 
evidence base to inform program and policy development[55,172,173]. 
 
According to measures of toilet coverage and use, the sanitation intervention was 
successful in improving community level sanitation. However, the substantially lower use 
of improved sanitation for disposal of child feces compared to use by household members 
over age 5 suggests that there are different determinants for these two populations. 
Increasing safe child feces disposal to the same level as adult toilet use likely requires a 
directed behavioral component. Further research should examine determinants of safe 
child feces disposal as separate from adult use of improved sanitation. In addition, the 
benefits of provision of piped water connections at the household should be further 

119 
explored, beyond direct impacts on infectious disease prevalence. There is still a dearth 
of evidence on the benefits of on-premise piped water connections in low-income rural 
settings.

Appendix B. Description of intervention infrastructure 
 
The hardware component of the Gram Vikas intervention included a: 1) networked water 
supply system with a community water tower as the reservoir (Figure B1), 2) a pour-flush 
toilet with dual soak-away pits, and 3) an attached bathing room. In each community the 
water was generally sourced from a protected spring and used gravity-fed system or was 
sourced from a dug well or borehole and used a pumping system. Since the water system 
was engineered to fit village characteristics including hydrology, geology and population 
requirements of each village, Gram Vikas was not able to provide a common design. 
However, the toilet and bathing room complex was standard across villages (Figures B2 
and B3).
