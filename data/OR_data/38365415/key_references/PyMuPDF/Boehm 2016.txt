Abstract
We evaluated whether provision and promotion of improved sanitation hardware (toilets and child 
feces management tools) reduced rotavirus and human fecal contamination of drinking water, 
child hands, and soil among rural Bangladeshi compounds enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial. 
We also measured host-associated genetic markers of ruminant and avian feces. We found 
evidence of widespread ruminant and avian fecal contamination in the compound environment; 
non-human fecal marker occurrence scaled with animal ownership. Strategies for controlling non- 
human fecal waste should be considered when designing interventions to reduce exposure to fecal 
contamination in low-income settings. Detection of a human- associated fecal marker and 
rotavirus was rare and unchanged by provision and promotion of improved sanitation to 
intervention compounds. The sanitation intervention reduced ruminant fecal contamination in 
drinking water and general (non-host specific) fecal contamination in soil but overall had limited 
effects on reducing fecal contamination in the household environment.
INTRODUCTION
Lack of sanitation access in low-income rural settings has been linked to diarrheal illness(1) 
and impaired growth in children under 5 years old.(2) Recent evidence has also connected 
unsanitary living conditions to child environmental enteropathy.(3)

Microbial contamination on hands,(4–10) water,(7, 11–13) soil,(14, 15) and household 
floors(4) has been documented in areas with poor sanitation. However, the majority of 
studies has measured microbial contamination using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) such as 
Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT). FIB are found in feces of many animal hosts 
and even in natural reservoirs.(16–18) There have been far fewer studies that measure 
microbial contamination using enteric pathogens or host-associated genetic markers of fecal 
contamination.
Previous intervention trials have investigated whether provision of sanitation hardware has 
improved water quality and hand contamination as measured by FIB.(2, 19, 20) The results 
of those studies have been equivocal with most showing no change in contamination, which 
could indicate limited effects of the sanitation intervention on environmental contamination 
(although two of these trials had low rates of latrine adoption). Another possible explanation 
for the equivocal results is that the outcomes of interest (FIB) are not primarily from human 
feces but rather from animal feces.(21) In this case, proper disposal of human feces through 
latrine provision may not necessarily reduce overall FIB contamination.
This study evaluated whether provision and promotion of improved sanitation to rural 
Bangladeshi compounds reduced the incidence of a human-associated fecal genetic marker 
and rotavirus RNA in stored drinking water, in courtyard soil, and on child hands. In 
addition, we assessed the occurrence of ruminant and avian-associated fecal genetic markers 
to infer whether animals contribute to microbial contamination in the domestic environment.
Materials and Methods
Environmental sample collection was nested within the WASH Benefits trial in rural 
Bangladesh,(22) a randomized controlled trial designed to measure the effect of improved 
water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and nutritional interventions on child diarrhea and 
growth. We collected environmental samples (stored drinking water, soil, and child hand 
rinse) from a subset of compounds in the control and sanitation arms of the study; 497 
compounds (249 from the control arm and 248 from the sanitation arm) were included.
A compound consisted of 3–10 households comprised of typically blood relatives, with a 
shared courtyard. Each compound had at least one child under 5 years of age. Groups of 
adjacent compounds were assigned to clusters, and clusters were randomly assigned to the 
sanitation versus control arm within geographical strata. In sanitation arm compounds, each 
household lacking a hygienic latrine was provided with a concrete ring-based dual-pit latrine 
that had a slab, a water seal, and a superstructure for privacy. The sanitation intervention also 
included a potty for young children and a metal scoop for removal of child and animal feces 
from the environment and their safe disposal in the latrine. A behavior change program 
encouraged regular use of hardware components through weekly compound visits 
throughout the study. The sanitation hardware and behavior intervention were designed after 
a 2 year pilot test with documented high user uptake of the selected interventions.(22) The 
control arm received no hardware or behavior change intervention.

Microbial Source Tracking (MST) Marker Validation
We conducted a MST marker validation study to choose the most sensitive and specific MST 
markers for use in the study setting. MST marker validation has been completed in a handful 
of large studies,(23–26) but local testing is recommended before implementation in new 
geographic settings.(24, 27)
Fecal samples were collected from 20 chickens, 20 ducks, 20 cows, 20 goats, and 15 humans 
in the study communities. Three or four individual fecal specimens of the same animal 
species were combined at equal masses to form a 2.0 g composite (Table S1); the result was 
five composite samples per species. The composite samples were made into fecal slurries, 
and EC and ENT were enumerated in the slurries using defined substrate assays (IDEXX, 
Westbrook, MN). For quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analysis, 2 mL of 
slurry was filtered through membrane filters seated in disposable filter funnels. Further 
details are given in the Supporting Information.
DNA was extracted from filters using a modified MoBio (Carlsbad, CA) PowerWater RNA 
Isolation Kit.(5) For each extraction batch (10–20 samples), an extraction blank control was 
included. DNA was used as a template in QPCRs for three human-associated (BacHum,(28) 
HumM2,(26) and HF183Taqman(29)) MST markers, three ruminant-associated (BacCow,
(28) BacR,(30) and Rum2Bac(31)) MST markers, and one avian-associated (Avian 
GFD(32)) MST marker. These markers were chosen because they performed well in 
previous studies.(23, 24, 33) The sensitivity and specificity of the markers were determined 
using metrics described previously.(4, 23) The most sensitive and specific host-associated 
MST markers were selected to analyze the environmental samples (see the Supporting 
Information for more details).
Environmental Sampling and Survey
Environmental sampling occurred from November 2013 to March 2014. At each enrolled 
compound, field staff collected a stored drinking water sample, a hand rinse from one child 
under 5 years old,(7) and a soil sample from the compound’s courtyard where the youngest 
child under 5 years old had most recently played or spent time according to a compound 
resident. Respondents were asked how many ruminant and avian (e.g., chickens, ducks, and 
geese) species were owned by the compound.
Samples were preserved on ice, and processing begun within 12 h. Samples were analyzed 
for EC and fecal coliform (FC) using IDEXX defined substrate assays. Aliquots of the water 
and hand rinse samples were membrane filtered to collect nucleic acids from bacteria and 
viruses and the filters archived using the same technique that was used for the fecal slurries. 
In addition, laboratory process control blanks were processed (see the Supporting 
Information). Soil was archived in centrifuge tubes and stored at −80 °C. Filters and soil 
were tested for rotavirus RNA,(34) general Bacteroidales DNA (GenBac3),(35) and select 
host-associated MST markers. GenBac3 targets fecal bacteria in the Bacteriodetes class.(26, 
35)

DNA and RNA were co-extracted from the water and hand rinse filters using the same 
method as for the fecal samples. DNA and RNA were co-extracted from soil samples using a 
protocol developed in this study (further described in the Supporting Information). The 
recoveries of bacterial DNA and viral RNA from soil using the extraction method are 
estimated to be 50 and 10%, respectively, while recoveries from filters were previously 
estimated to be 7 and 17%, respectively.(36)
The nucleic acid extracts from environmental samples were assessed for substances that 
inhibit QPCR using a spike and dilute method;(37) results informed the dilution level of 
extract to run during QPCR. All samples were run in duplicate. Each QPCR plate included a 
standard curve run in triplicate as well as triplicate no-template controls. Environmental 
samples were scored as positive if at least one of the two replicates amplified, even if the 
concentration was below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Lowest detectable 
concentration (LDC) and LLOQ values were calculated by converting one copy (cp) per 
reaction and 10 cp per reaction (the most dilute standard that consistently amplified), 
respectively, to appropriate units (cp per 100 mL, cp per two hands, and cp per gram of dry 
soil). Linear regression using respective instrument run specific standard data was used to 
estimate molecular marker concentrations. The Supporting Information contains further 
details.
To compare the occurrence of MST markers between the control and sanitation groups, we 
used logistic regression for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes; 
all models included indicator variables for each pair-matched cluster (minus a reference 
cluster) as well as robust standard errors to account for geographic clustering of 
observations.(22)
Results and Discussion
Quality Assurance and Control
HumM2 and Avian-GFD were not detected in no-template controls, or extraction or 
laboratory processing blanks. BacR was detected at levels below the LLOQ in two of 78 
extraction blanks (these were co-extracted with hand rinse samples). GenBac3 was detected 
in 50% of the extraction blanks and 41 of 111 laboratory processing blanks, with most of 
these below or near the LLOQ (see the Supporting Information). This cross contamination is 
likely a result of the extraordinarily high levels of GenBac3 present in the samples and has 
been observed by others.(23) The LDC and LLOQ values for the environmental samples 
were 50 and 500 cp/100 mL of water, 125 and 1250 cp/two hands, and approximately 400 
and 4000 cp/g of soil (exact value depended on moisture content), respectively.
MST Marker Validation
We evaluated MST marker sensitivity and specificity using both a binary and a quantitative 
assessment approach(23) (Figure S1 and Table S2). In brief, the binary approach assesses 
the percent of target and nontarget fecal samples where the MST marker was and was not 
detected to calculate the sensitivity and specificity, respectively; a cutoff of 80% was used to 
define good performance.(23) The quantitative approach takes into account the

concentration of marker detected in tested feces and requires higher marker concentrations 
in target versus nontarget feces (see the Supporting Information).
Of the three tested human-associated MST markers, HumM2 was specific via the 
quantitative assessment approach and sensitive via the binary assessment approach. The 
other human MST markers (HF183 and BacHum) were not specific by either assessment 
approach. Previous work in urban Bangladesh (Dhaka) found that none of these three 
human-associated markers was specific(4) and that an assay not tested herein (HF183 
SYBR) was sensitive and specific.(38) A large method evaluation study in the United States 
found that HF183 and HumM2 were sensitive and specific but that BacHum lacked 
specificity.(23) The different outcomes of these validation studies underscore the need for 
local validation before human-associated MST assays are applied to environmental samples.
(27)
Of the three ruminant-associated MST markers, BacR performed the best; it was the only 
marker that was sensitive and specific as determined by both assessment approaches. The 
high specificity of ruminant-associated assays has been observed in multiple geographic 
settings.(24)
In the study presented here, the avian-associated marker was specific via the quantitative 
assessment approach and sensitive via the binary approach. Tested in the United States and 
Australia, the marker performed with good sensitivity and specificity.(32, 39) In another 
study conducted in urban Bangladesh, it was neither sensitive nor specific.(4)
Given their good sensitivity and specificity in our study area (rural Bangladesh), we used 
HumM2, BacR, and avian-GFD markers to assess the presence of human, ruminant, and 
avian fecal contamination in the environmental samples, respectively.
Environmental Fecal Contamination
Across all compounds, EC and FC concentrations were on the order of 10 MPN/two hands, 
10 MPN/100 mL of stored water, and 105 MPN/g of soil. GenBac3 concentrations were on 
the order of 106 cp/two hands, 104 cp/100 mL of water, and 106 cp/g of soil (Tables S3 and 
S4).
The number of samples positive for each MST marker and rotavirus is reported in aggregate 
and by study arm (Table 1 and Table S4). HumM2 and rotavirus were present in 0–9% of 
samples from the three environmental matrices. Mattioli et al.(5) found similar rotavirus 
prevalence (3–9% of samples tested) in hand rinses and stored water in Tanzania. A previous 
study in Bangladesh found a prevalence of rotavirus in tubewell water (40%) substantially 
higher than what we found in stored drinking water (0.6%).(40) The difference may be due 
to a number of factors, including different detection limits; Ferguson et al.(40) filtered 2–8 L 
of tubewell water, while we processed 100 mL of stored water.
Percent positive also shown by sanitation arm (N = 248) vs control (N = 249). The p value 
indicates whether the presence of a marker is associated with the study arm as indicated by 
logistic regression with robust standard errors.

bIf we exclude observations with positive extraction blanks, the total number of positive 
samples was 258 (56.7%); the difference between arms remained insignificant (p = 0.154).
BacR was prevalent in all sample matrices; 22% of water samples and more than 50% of soil 
and hand rinse samples were positive. The high prevalence of ruminant fecal contamination 
may be due to the use of cow dung for domestic fuel. Avian-GFD was present in 9% of 
water, 16% of hand rinse, and 33% of soil samples.
Ruminant-associated and avian GFD markers were more frequently detected than human 
markers in the compounds (z-test; p < 0.05 for all matrices). This suggests that ruminant and 
avian species contribute general indicators of fecal pollution such as EC, ENT, and GenBac3 
to the compound environment. The low occurrence of the human-associated marker in 
human feces relative to the occurrence of non-human-associated markers in non-human 
feces (Figure S1) confounds the direct comparison of MST marker prevalence data and may 
contribute to the reduced detection of human-associated markers relative to other markers.
(41) Although it is difficult to compare across sample types because of different units of 
measure, all MST markers assessed in this study were more prevalent in soil than in water or 
hand rinses. Results suggest ingestion of animal fecal matter is probable when children 
intentionally or accidentally consume soil.(42)
Effect of Sanitation Intervention on Marker Occurrence
Mean GenBac3 concentrations were reduced in soil (mean difference = 0.2 log unit; p = 
0.02) in sanitation compared to control compounds, suggesting the intervention reduced 
levels of general fecal contamination in compound soil, albeit modestly. GenBac3 in hand 
rinse samples (p = 0.35) and water samples (p = 0.33) was not different between sanitation 
and control compounds (Table S3). Results did not change after accounting for the low 
levels of GenBac3 contamination (see the Supporting Information).
The sanitation intervention did not significantly affect the frequency of HumM2 or rotavirus 
detection in stored water, soil, hands, or any compound sample relative to the control (Table 
1). Latrine access was high in both treatment and control compounds after the intervention; 
however, the treatment group had greater access to improved latrines (98% vs 66%) and to 
latrines with safe drainage (99% vs 73%) (Table S5). Our study documents a limited effect 
of improving and promoting basic latrines and sanitation practices on human fecal 
contamination in the household environment.
Association between Non-human MST Marker Occurrence, Sanitation Intervention, and 
Animal Ownership
Ownership of ruminant and avian species was common among compounds; 78% of 
compounds owned at least one ruminant (median of 3). BacR occurrence was twice as likely 
[odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; p < 0.001] in hand rinses from compounds that owned at least one 
ruminant than in samples from compounds without ruminants; in soil samples, BacR 
occurrence was 4 times greater among ruminant owners (OR = 4.1; p < 0.001). This analysis 
for BacR in hand rinses (as well as all other BacR hand rinse analyses) was repeated 
excluding samples co-extracted with a positive extraction blank, and the results were

unchanged. A study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, also found that owning ruminants was associated 
with the presence of BacR in households.(4)
Ninety-four percent of the households owned at least one avian species (median of 10). 
Avian-GFD marker occurrence frequency was greater in soil (OR = 1.6; p = 0.025), in hand 
rinses (OR = 1.5; p = 0.077), and in stored water (OR = 1.8; p = 0.082) from compounds that 
owned ≥10 avian species than in the same samples from compounds that owned <10.
Ruminant marker BacR was more likely detected in stored water in the control versus 
sanitation compounds (Table 1), although the proportion of compounds owning ruminants 
was not different between the two groups (χ2 test; p > 0.05). This result could be explained 
by the use of the provided sanitary scoops by the sanitation compounds to reduce the amount 
of ruminant feces in the environment that eventually entered the water supply.
Although exposure to non-human feces is considered a lower risk than exposure to the same 
amount of human feces,(43, 44) there is evidence that non-human feces can still present a 
substantial health risk. A recent systematic review reported a positive association between 
diarrheal illness and domestic animal husbandry.(45) A study in rural India reported similar 
magnitudes of increased risk of diarrhea associated with domestic animal contamination 
compared to human contamination in the household environment.(19) Non-human feces can 
harbor a number of zoonotic organisms, including bacteria (toxigenic E. coli, 
Campylobacter, and Salmonella) and protozoa (Cryptosporidium), that cause diarrheal 
illness.(46) Notably, three of the four pathogens that cause most cases of severe to moderate 
child diarrhea in low-income countries are zoonotic.(46) Biomarkers of environmental 
enteropathy have also been linked to children sleeping in the proximity of animals.(47) 
Future interventions to reduce fecal contamination in the household environment must 
consider control of animal feces, particularly in settings where domestic animal ownership is 
prevalent.
