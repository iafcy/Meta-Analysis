Abstract
Improved sanitation has been associated with a reduced prevalence of soil-transmitted hel-
minth (STH) infection and has been hypothesized to prevent fecal contamination from
spreading throughout the household environment. We evaluated the effect of providing
households with a pit latrine with a plastic slab and drophole cover, child feces management
tools, and associated behavioral messaging on reducing STH eggs in household soil. We
collected soil samples from 2107 households (898 control and 1209 improved sanitation
intervention households) that were enrolled in the WASH Benefits cluster randomized con-
trolled trial in rural Kenya and performed a post-intervention analysis after two years of inter-
vention exposure. Following a pre-specified analysis plan, we combined all households that
received the sanitation intervention into one group for comparison to control households.
The prevalence of STH eggs in soil was 18.9% in control households and 17.0% in interven-
tion households. The unadjusted prevalence ratio of total STH eggs in the intervention
groups compared to the control group was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78–1.13). The geometric mean
concentration was 0.05 eggs/g dry soil in control households and intervention households.
Unadjusted and adjusted models gave similar results. We found use of a shared latrine,
presence of a roof over the sampling area, and the number of dogs owned at baseline was
associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil; the presence of a latrine that
was at least 2 years old and a latrine with a covered drophole was associated with a reduc-
tion in the prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Soil moisture content was also associated with an
increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Our results indicate that an intervention designed
to increase access to improved latrines and child feces management tools may not be

enough to impact environmental occurrence of STH in endemic areas where latrine cover-
age is already high.
Author summary
Soil is crucial for the lifecycle and transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), a
class of parasitic intestinal worms that infect over a billion people globally. Past studies
have shown that water, sanitation, and handwashing may be able to reduce STH infection,
but the causal pathway is unclear. This study was nested within a large randomized con-
trolled trial evaluating the impact of individual and combined water, handwashing, and
sanitation interventions on child health in western Kenya. The sanitation intervention
included upgrading pit latrines by installing a plastic slab, as well as delivery and promo-
tion of child safe feces management tools. The sanitation intervention did not reduce STH
contamination in household soil, suggesting households with access to improved sanita-
tion may still be exposed to STH in the household environment. Risk factors for the
presence of STH soil contamination included sharing toilets, an uncovered latrine pit,
latrines <2 years old, owning dogs, shade on the sampling location, and high soil moisture
content.
Introduction
Soil plays a crucial role in the lifecycle of soil transmitted helminths (STH). Eggs need to incu-
bate in soil in a warm, moist environment to become infective. Hookworm species need up
to 14 days to become viable and infectious, Ascaris lumbricoides eggs need 8 to 37 days, and
Trichuris trichiura eggs need 20 to 100 days.[1] Once the eggs become infectious, Ascaris and
Trichuris eggs can remain infectious for a few months and hookworm larvae can remain infec-
tious for a few weeks[1]. Two species of STH, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, are
transmitted through the ingestion of infective eggs. Both hookworm species, Ancylostoma duo-
denale and Necator americanus, infect people through larvae penetrating the skin, but Ancylos-
toma duodenale is also transmitted by ingesting infective larvae[2]. Soil-transmitted helminth
(STH) eggs are excreted in the feces of an infected person and are present in the environment
in endemic areas. STH eggs have been found in soil in rural households in Poland, southern
Thailand, the Philippines, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa; urban households in Ethiopia
and Jamaica; informal settlements in Brazil and Turkey; urban and rural towns in Nepal; and
primary schools in northern Vietnam and South Africa[3–14].
Soil-transmitted helminth infections are endemic in our study area in rural western Kenya.
An evaluation of the Kenya national deworming program reported a reduction in the preva-
lence of overall STH infection from 2012 to 2014[15]. After two years of annual deworming,
the prevalence of STH infection in schoolchildren in Kakamega county dropped from 58.3%
to 24.8% (calculated from [15]). Much of this reduction was due to a decrease in hookworm
infection, which went from 28.8% to 0.1% (calculated from [15]). The prevalence of Ascaris
and Trichuris infection remained at similar levels at approximately 25% prevalence of Ascaris
and 1% prevalence of Trichuris[15].
Water treatment, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH) interventions may help prevent STH
infections. Pit latrines with slabs were classified as improved sanitation facilities by the Joint
Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) under the Millennium

Development Goals[16]. Pit latrines with a slab may be more likely to be used and easier to
clean, which could reduce egg transfer from the latrine to the household. Ventilated pit latrines
with slabs may also reduce the spread of fecal contamination by reducing flies in the latrine.
Previous laboratory and field studies have found STH eggs on the bodies of and inside the gut
of flies,[17–19] which suggests that flies may be able to transfer STH eggs from one location to
another. Improved sanitation facilities may reduce STH infection prevalence by making it
more likely that feces are safely contained, thereby reducing STH eggs in the environment and
the chance of exposure to infectious STH eggs. A meta-analysis of descriptive, cross-sectional
studies on sanitation and STH infection showed the availability and use of improved sanitation
facilities was associated with reduced odds of STH infection compared to lack of availability or
disuse of sanitation facilities[20]. Another meta-analysis indicated that access to any sanitation
facility, improved or unimproved, was associated with reduced odds of STH infection[21].
Few studies have examined the causal pathways by which improved sanitation could reduce
STH infection in rural low-income countries. Our hypothesized theory of change is that
improved sanitation reduces STH in soil, which then reduces the risk of STH exposure and
infection to household members. Our study focused on elucidating the importance of this
intermediate step in the potential causal pathway. In this study, we evaluate whether an
improved household sanitation intervention—incorporating a pit latrine with plastic slab and
drophole cover, a plastic child potty, and a metal scoop to safely dispose of feces in the environ-
ment—reduced STH eggs in soil outside of rural houses in western Kenya. We also explore
household, latrine, and environmental characteristics that were associated with STH eggs in
soil among households in the control arm of our study.
Methods
Ethics statement
The study procedures were approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board (Protocol
Number 23310) and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Ethical Review Commit-
tee (SSC Number 2271). All respondents gave written, informed consent prior to participating
in the survey and gave oral consent collected electronically prior to soil collection. All respon-
dents were adults.
Study design and enrollment
We enrolled a subset of households in the WASH Benefits study in Kakamega, Bungoma, and
Vihiga counties in western Kenya. The WASH Benefits study was a cluster-randomized con-
trolled trial that assessed the impact of individual and combined water, sanitation, handwash-
ing, and nutrition interventions on child health; the main trial outcomes included diarrhea,
growth, parasite infections, and cognitive development[22–25]. We describe the effect of the
interventions on child STH infections in the discussion section. We collected soil samples
from within the double-sized active control arm (non-WASH related household visits), as well
as the single sized sanitation arm, and the single sized combined water, sanitation, and hygiene
(WSH) arm in the WASH Benefits randomized controlled trial[22]. The trial enrolled 892
households in the sanitation arm, 912 in the WSH arm, and 1919 in the active control arm
[26]. Our study focuses on an intermediate outcome not pre-specified in the original trial pro-
tocol. Villages were chosen in rural areas that did not have any ongoing WSH or nutrition
interventions. Additionally, >80% households had to lack access to piped drinking water.
Households with pregnant women were selected within enrolled villages. At the time of data
collection, these households had a young child between 21 and 27 months and many had an
older child between the age of 3 and 15. Households were assigned to a cluster of households,

and randomization of the intervention was performed by cluster[22]. Each cluster included
one or two adjoining villages. Children in our study area may have received deworming medi-
cine as part of the national school-based deworming program[27]. Kenya’s national school-
based deworming program included annual deworming of the study area that began in 2012
[15,27]. We collected data on consumption of deworming medicine within the past 6 months
in each household during data collection.
Interventions
Households enrolled in the sanitation arm received an improved pit latrine with a plastic slab
with raised footings and a drop hole cover, a portable child potty made of plastic, and a metal
scoop for removing animal and child feces from the compound and placing it in the latrine.
The child potty was designed for use by children under 3 years of age, many of whom practice
open defecation daily[22,23]. Households enrolled in the combined WSH arm received the
sanitation intervention, as well hardware for facilitating treating drinking water with chlorine
and handwashing with soap. The water intervention was designed to improve microbial qual-
ity and not water quantity. Chlorine dispensers were installed at community water sources and
bottles of chlorine were delivered to homes for treating stored drinking water. Dual tippy taps
with soapy water and rinse water were installed at the latrine and food preparation areas, and
soap was delivered regularly to promote handwashing. Further details of the interventions and
WASH Benefits primary results can be found in Null et al (2018)[26]. All households, includ-
ing the active control arm, received monthly visits from community promoters who measured
the mid-upper arm circumference of children enrolled in the trial; in the sanitation and WSH
arms they also delivered behavior change messaging related to the interventions. Promotion
materials are published at https://osf.io/26r59/. Follow up survey data, including soil samples,
were collected approximately two years after the interventions were delivered.
Field data collection
We collected 2107 soil samples from February 2015 to July 2016; 898 from the active control
arm, 613 from the sanitation arm, and 596 from the combined WSH arm of the WASH Bene-
fits trial (Fig 1). We collected samples from households in 113 control clusters, 77 sanitation
clusters, and 76 WSH clusters. All clusters enrolled in the sanitation and WSH arms of the
main trial were enrolled into this study, while a subset (approximately 75%) of clusters was
enrolled from the two control groups (grouped together in the trial analyses to form a double-
sized control group). Households were enrolled in the WASH Benefits control groups ran-
domly, and our sub-study was only able to visit one control group out of the two control
groups within some blocks due to logistical constraints. For each sample, we collected approxi-
mately 50 grams of soil within a 900 cm2 area that was exposed in front of the primary entrance
to the house. Samples were collected by scraping the top layer of soil with a clean metal spade
into a sterile Whirlpak bag (118 mL capacity, Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI). Most (94%) samples
were collected within 2 meters of the house entrance. In a few instances (124 out of 2107), we
collected a sample over 2 meters away from the house entrance because there was no soil pres-
ent directly in front of the house entrance. We chose to collect samples at the house entrance
because previous work suggested that STH egg presence and concentration was similar at the
latrine entrance and house entrance, and we wanted to collect samples from a location that
could be standardized across households. The location was also consistent with our theory of
change that improved sanitation reduces STH infection through reduced environmental STH
contamination in the house environment. Samples were collected throughout the day and the

time of collection was noted. A household survey was performed at the same time that the soil
samples were collected.
We performed an electronic survey using SurveyCTO, which is a mobile data collection
platform based on Open Data Kit (ODK), on Samsung Galaxy tablets. We collected informa-
tion about soil sampling and the physical conditions around the sampling site, including

presence of trash, presence of animal or human feces, presence of visible soil moisture, pres-
ence of a roof extending over the sampling location, the presence of sun on the sampling loca-
tion at the sampling time, and the characteristics of the soil (hard or soft packed, presence of
vegetation, and presence of brick or concrete under the soil). We also collected information
about the type and number of animals that households kept.
Laboratory analysis
We analyzed soil samples for the presence of STH eggs following the protocol outlined in
Steinbaum et al. (2017)[28]. The protocol has an Ascaris recovery efficiency of 73% and has
been used to detect Ascaris and Trichuris in field studies in Kenya and Bangladesh, but its abil-
ity to detect hookworm eggs and larvae is unknown. We selected this standardized protocol
because Ascaris was the most prevalent soil-transmitted helminth in our study area[15]. Sam-
ples were transported from the field to the laboratory at room temperature. They were placed
in a 4˚C refrigerator immediately upon arrival to the laboratory and remained there until pro-
cessing. We microscopically examined and enumerated the number of fertilized and larvated
Ascaris, Trichuris, and hookworm eggs in each sample, and we incubated all positive samples
to determine egg viability. We classified an egg a fertilized egg if it was fertilized, including sin-
gle-celled and multiple-celled eggs, and it did not contain a larvae. We classified an egg a lar-
vated egg if it contained a larvae before incubation. We classified an egg a viable egg if it
contained a larvae after incubation. We also determined the moisture content and soil texture
of each sample following the protocol in Steinbaum et al. (2017)[28]. Separate aliquots of each
soil sample were used for measuring moisture content through oven drying and for STH egg
enumeration.
We incorporated several levels of quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) into the
microscopy portion of the laboratory analysis. Soil laboratory technicians counted the number
of STH eggs in each sample before and after incubation. A microscopy expert reviewed a sub-
set (14%, 295 out of 2107) of the microscopy slides. Additionally, we took a photo of the first
non-larvated and larvated egg of every STH species that we found in every sample prior to
incubation. A microscopy expert reviewed every photo and provided feedback to the labora-
tory technicians. We also included QAQC measures into our laboratory process. Each labora-
tory technician processed a technical replicate of the soil sample in every other day and a
laboratory blank on the alternate days. We defined a technical replicate as an additional 15g
aliquot of homogenized soil that was processed using the same laboratory procedure as the
original sample aliquot. Our laboratory blank was 5 mL distilled water that was processed
using the same procedure as the original sample aliquot. We did not detect contamination in
any of our laboratory blanks. The technicians and microscopy expert were blinded to the treat-
ment assignments. The detection limit of the method is 1 egg per 15g wet weight of soil
sample.
Data analysis
We calculated the prevalence of eggs as the binary presence or absence of any eggs in a sample
and the concentration of eggs as the number of eggs per gram of dry soil that was processed.
We measured viable eggs because they are infectious, and we considered eggs to be viable if
they contained a larvae after incubation. Percent viability was calculated as the percent of eggs
in each sample that were viable out of the total number of eggs.
Our pre-specified primary analysis (S1 Appendix) compares the presence of eggs in soil
between households that received the sanitation intervention (combining WSH and sanitation
arms) compared to the control group. The control group had varying levels of sanitation

coverage (SI). A subgroup analysis was performed to understand if the combined WSH inter-
vention had a greater reduction in eggs in soil compared to the sanitation intervention. We
performed this analysis for the following outcomes: binary presence of all STH eggs, all Ascaris
eggs, all Trichuris eggs, viable STH eggs, viable Ascaris eggs, and viable Trichuris eggs. We
planned to also perform the analysis with the outcome of hookworm eggs or larvae in soil, but
we did not perform this analysis because we did not find any hookworm eggs or larvae in our
samples. The prevalence of hookworm infection in study children in the control group was
low at 2.2% [25]. We used a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and log link
with the presence of eggs as the dependent variable and the intervention as the independent
variable. The model included fixed effects for randomization block and accounted for cluster-
ing using Hubert Sandwich Estimator robust standard errors. We ran this model for all out-
comes. We modified our model specification from logistic regression, which was indicated in
the pre-specified plan, to Poisson regression because of convergence issues.
Our pre-specified secondary analysis (S1 Appendix) compares the concentration of STH in
soil between households that received the interventions compared to the control group. We
also compared the concentration of STH eggs in soil in the WSH and sanitation interventions.
We used a targeted maximum likelihood estimation model with Gaussian distribution and log
link to estimate the soil egg count reduction in intervention arms compared to the control
arm. We performed this analysis using a continuous outcome of the concentration of all STH
eggs, all Ascaris eggs, all Trichuris eggs, viable STH eggs, viable Ascaris eggs, and viable Tri-
churis eggs. We calculated the reduction in the concentration of STH eggs in soil using the geo-
metric mean. To perform this analysis, we log10-transformed the concentration of STH eggs
in soil. For non-detect samples, we substituted the concentration of 0 eggs/g dry soil with half
of the detection limit (0.5 egg/sample) divided by the grams of dry soil processed per sample,
then took the log10 to get a concentration in log10-units of eggs/g dry soil.
We analyzed adjusted models for the primary and secondary analysis. We prescreened
covariates and only included those that had an association (p<0.2) with the outcome. We
assessed the association of the following covariates: past deworming of a young child (under 3
years), soil texture (sandy loam or clay loam), sunlight exposure on sampling location, a roof
over the sampling location, soil moisture content, month of sampling, house materials (con-
crete floor and iron roof), and household assets (electricity, radio, television, mobile phone,
clock, bicycle, motorcycle, stove, number of cows, number of goats, number of dogs, and num-
ber of chickens). Month was included as a categorical (factor) variable. Wealth indicator data
(house materials and household assets) were collected during baseline data collection for the
WASH Benefits study. Minor deviations from our pre-specified analysis plan included
removal of several covariates in the adjusted analysis due to a large number of missing values,
including past deworming of an older child, rain within the past week, temperature, and
humidity. We also included a covariate for the laboratory technician who processed the sample
in the adjusted models. We used robust standard errors clustered by randomization block for
all of our analysis. Since randomization was performed with pair-matched clusters, 101 obser-
vations were dropped that did not have a corresponding pair match. There were also 48 obser-
vations dropped from the adjusted analysis due to missing covariate data. We performed the
primary and secondary analysis using R version 3.4.2.
Additionally, we followed a pre-specified analysis plan (S1 Appendix) to assess the extent to
which household, latrine, and environmental characteristics were associated with the preva-
lence of STH eggs in household soil in all households that had access to an observable latrine,
including factors not expected to be affected by the sanitation intervention. We chose our
independent variables based on a few hypotheses. Household factors—number of household
members, past deworming of household members, safe child feces management (child feces

collected in potty or diaper and thrown in latrine)—may influence initial egg deposition in the
household environment. Latrine factors—observed presence of a latrine, self-reported age of
latrine, observed presence of concrete or plastic latrine slab, observed presence of drop hole
cover, and observed cleanliness of the latrine—may prevent STH egg deposition and transfer
in the house environment. Additionally, environmental factors—soil moisture content, soil
texture, presence of sun[12] or a roof over the sampling area, past rain, temperature, humidity,
and month[1]—may affect the persistence and viability of STH eggs in the environment.
Finally, individual wealth indicators—iron roof, concrete floor, electricity, radio, TV, mobile
phone, clock, bicycle, radio, stove, number of cows, number of goats, number of dogs, number
of poultry—could confound the association between the explanatory variables, i.e. household
and latrine factors, and the outcome.
We assessed bivariate associations between these variables and the presence of any STH
eggs in soil. Then, we included any variables that had a significant association (p<0.2) with the
outcome in a multivariable Poisson regression model with Hubert Sandwich Estimator robust
standard errors. We assessed variance inflation factors and excluded correlated variables. Our
final model includes use of a shared latrine, presence of a roof over the sample site, presence of
a latrine slab, presence of a fully covered drophole, visible stool on the latrine floor, a young
child (under 3 years) dewormed within the past 6 months, presence of a latrine that is at least
two years old, soil moisture content, and the number of dogs owned at baseline as independent
variables. Independent variables in the multivariable model were considered significantly asso-
ciated with the presence of STH eggs in soil at α = 0.05 (p-value<0.05). We used Stata version
13 to perform this analysis.
Finally, we used logistic regression to assess the association between sample storage time
and the presence of STH eggs in soil samples, and to assess the association between individual
lab technician and the presence of STH eggs in soil samples.
Results
Baseline sanitation coverage
At baseline, 3.3% (30/896) of control households did not have access to a toilet, 77.2% (692/
896) had a toilet without a slab (i.e. unimproved latrine), and 15.1% (135/896) had a toilet with
a slab (i.e. improved sanitation facilities) that was observed by an enumerator. In control
households, respondents reported that 3.3% of young children under 3 years, 46.3% of young
children age 3 to 7 years, 83.9% of men, and 85.9% of women in the household always use the
latrine. Additional information about baseline characteristics of WASH Benefits households
can be found in the primary results manuscript from the WASH Benefits trial.[23]
Endline household characteristics
Few control households owned pigs (5.7%) and some households owned dogs (18.9%)
(Table 1). Overall, we found 77 households in the study kept pigs. Most control households
had earth floors (94.4%) defined as mud covering 80–100% of the floor inside the house.
Respondents reported that 40.0% of young children under the age of 3 and 41.2% of older chil-
dren between 3 and 15 years were dewormed within the past month.
Endline WSH coverage in intervention and control groups
Two years after the start of intervention activities, 20.2% of WSH households had detectable
free chlorine in stored water at the time of sampling and 20.3% had soap and water available
for handwashing (S5 Table). Free chlorine was detected in stored water in 2.0% of control

households and 2.0% of sanitation households. Soap and water were present in handwashing
areas in 9.1% of control households and 9.0% of sanitation households. In sanitation and WSH
households, 79.6% and 83.7% had access to an improved latrine compared to 17.9% of control
households. Stool was present on the floor of the latrine in 30.3% of control households, 23.3%
of sanitation households, and 23.3% of WSH households. Reported adult open defecation was
low with 0.1% of respondents reporting it in the active control arm, 0.2% in the sanitation
arm, and 0.2% in the WSH arm. The intervention’s metal scoops were observed in 4.1% of
control households, 71.0% of sanitation households, and 60.7% of WSH households, and were
reported as the primary tool for child feces removal in 0.1% of control households, 72.9% of
sanitation households, and 61.8% of WSH households. Child potties were observed in 3.0% of
control households, 84.5% of sanitation households, and 82.7% of WSH households. Young
children were reported to have used a potty for more than half of defecation events in the past
week in 1.6% of control households, 33.8% of sanitation households, and 28.9% of WSH
households. In sanitation and WSH study arms, 35.7% and 34.1% of households reported dis-
posing of child feces in the latrine compared to 9.7% of control households.
STH egg prevalence and concentration in soil
We found STH eggs in 17.8% of all soil samples (Table 2). Ascaris was the most prevalent STH
egg (13.0%), followed by Trichuris (6.9%). We did not find any hookworm eggs or larvae in
any of our samples. The geometric mean concentration of total STH eggs in all samples was
0.05 egg/g dry soil (Table 3). We found the mean of the percent of viable Ascaris eggs at each

household was 83.5% and the mean of the percent of viable Trichuris eggs at each household
was 73.2%. The intraclass correlation for the presence of STH eggs by cluster was 0.07 for any
STH, 0.05 for Ascaris, and 0.04 for Trichuris. The presence of any STH eggs before and after
incubation was consistent in 76.1% of samples. The presence of eggs in technical replicates was
consistent in 88.7% of samples for Ascaris and 94.4% for Trichuris. We did not find a signifi-
cant effect of sample storage time on the presence of STH eggs in soil (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97,
95% CI = 0.92–1.02, p = 0.26). We did find a difference in the proportion of eggs positive for
any STH by which of our two main laboratory technicians counted the sample (OR = 2.95,
95% CI = 2.33–3.74, p<0.01). None of our blanks were contaminated with STH eggs.
The mean moisture content of soil samples was 11.0% (SD = 9.8%). The dry weight of pro-
cessed soil samples ranged from 6.1 g to 15.6 g, with a mean of 13.4 g. The mean temperature
in the middle of the compound at the time of sample collection was 27.3˚C (SD = 3.3˚C) and
the mean relative humidity at the time of sample collection was 56.6% (SD = 12.7%). The most
common soil textures were sandy loam and clay loam. We found 37.3% (785 out of 2105) of
samples were sandy loam and 41.5% (873 out of 2105) were clay loam. Silty loam accounted
for 0.9% of samples (18 out of 2105), silty clay loam for 2% (42 out of 2105), silty clay for 3.7%
(77 out of 2105), loam for 7.8% (163 out of 2105), clay for 3.1% (65 out of 2105), sandy clay
loam for 3.1% (65 out of 2105), and sandy clay for 0.8% (17 out of 2105). Two samples were
not tested for soil texture. At the time of collection, 40.7% (860 out of 2017) of samples were
collected from areas with hard packed soil and 57.9% (1219 out of 2107) of samples were col-
lected from areas with soft packed soil.
Effect of the interventions on STH eggs in soil
We did not find an effect of the improved household sanitation intervention on the presence
of total STH eggs, Ascaris eggs, or Trichuris eggs (Table 4). The unadjusted prevalence ratio of
total STH eggs in the intervention groups (mean 17.0%) compared to the control group (mean
18.9%) was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78–1.13), and the unadjusted effect of the intervention on total via-
ble STH eggs was similar (PR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.76–1.25) (Table 4). When we adjusted for
covariates, we still did not find any significant decrease in the prevalence of STH eggs
(PR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.78–1.13) (Table 4, S2 Appendix). In our subgroup analysis, we did not
find a significant effect of the sanitation only group or WSH intervention group on the pres-
ence of STH eggs in soil (S1 and S3 Tables). When analyzing each species of STH, we found no
significant reduction in the prevalence of Ascaris eggs (PR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.76–1.21) or Tri-
churis eggs (PR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.51–1.16) in the intervention and control groups (Table 4).
Additionally, we saw similar results for viable eggs as we did for total STH eggs (Table 4).
Additionally, the intervention did not significantly reduce the concentration of total STH
eggs or the concentration of viable STH eggs in soil (Table 3). We did not detect an interven-
tion effect for total STH, Ascaris, or Trichuris eggs (Table 5). We saw a slight reduction in

viable Trichuris eggs in the unadjusted analysis, but the effect was not detected in the adjusted
analysis (Table 5, S2 Appendix). In our subgroup analysis, we did not detect a difference
between total and viable STH in the sanitation only and control arms or between the WSH
and control arm (S2 and S4 Tables). We saw a slight reduction of viable Trichuris in the unad-
justed analysis of the sanitation intervention, but the effect was not significant in the adjusted
analysis (S4 Table).
We performed the analysis excluding the 77 households that kept pigs, and the results were
consistent with the reported results.
We included use of a shared latrine, presence of a roof over the sampling site, presence of a
latrine slab, presence of a completely covered drophole, presence of stool on the latrine floor,
past deworming of a young child (under 3 years old), use of a latrine that is at least 2 years old,
percent soil moisture content, and the number of dogs owned at baseline in the multivariable
model (S6 Table, S1 Text, Table 6). Use of a shared latrine was associated with a 39% increase
in the prevalence of STH eggs in soil (Table 6, PR = 1.39, CI = (1.13, 1.72), p < 0.01) and the
presence of a roof fully covering the sample site was associated with a 27% increase in the prev-
alence of STH eggs in soil (Table 6, PR = 1.27, CI = (1.05, 1.53), p = 0.01). Increasing soil mois-
ture content was associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Each additional
dog owned by the household at baseline was associated with an 11% increase in the presence
of STH eggs in soil (Table 6, PR = 1.11, (1.05, 1.18), p < 0.01). Having the latrine drophole
completely covered was associated with a 34% reduction in the prevalence of STH eggs in soil
(Table 6, PR = 0.66, CI = (0.48, 0.91), p = 0.01), and having a latrine that was at least 2 years
old was associated with a 17% reduction (Table 6, PR = 0.83, CI = (0.70, 0.99), p = 0.03).

Discussion
Among all study households, we found 17.8% (N = 376/2107) of households had STH eggs in
soil from the house entrance. Ascaris eggs were most common, which is consistent with STH
infection prevalence in the area. The geometric mean concentration of STH in soil from all
households was 0.05 eggs/g dry soil. An average of 79.9% of these eggs were viable, indicating
that they pose a human health risk.
Our results indicate the sanitation intervention was not effective in reducing the prevalence
of STH eggs in household soil. We also did not find an added benefit of the WSH intervention
compared to the sanitation intervention delivered alone on reducing STH eggs in soil. It is use-
ful to interpret our findings together with the observed effects of the WSH and single sanita-
tion interventions on actual child STH infection prevalence levels in the same trial. Infection
prevalence with Ascaris was significantly lower among children in the WSH arm compared to
the control arm, while there was no statistically significant reduction among children in the
single sanitation arm[25]. The lack of a health impact in the single sanitation arm is consistent
with the lack of effect of the improved sanitation intervention on soil STH levels. The reduc-
tion in STH infection prevalence observed in the WSH arm could be due to the water treat-
ment or handwashing with soap components of the WSH intervention interrupting other
environmental STH transmission pathways (e.g. ingestion through drinking water or food
contaminated by hands).
Our results are consistent with a cross-sectional study in Tanzania by Exley et al. that found
no difference in STH eggs in composite soil samples in urban and rural compounds with dif-
ferent levels of sanitation on the JMP sanitation ladder[29]. Additionally, a study in Brazil
found there was no correlation between the concentration of Ascaris eggs in composite house-
hold soil samples in households with varying levels of sanitation quality[30]. However, some
households had flush toilets that emptied into the community and children practiced open
defecation, which potentially spread Ascaris eggs. In contrast to previous studies, our interven-
tion also included child feces management tools that were thought to potentially reduce STH
eggs in soil originating from child feces. However, uptake of the tools was incomplete at
endline.
A potential explanation for the null effect of our intervention is that transitioning from
access to unimproved sanitation to access to improved sanitation may not have a measurable
impact on STH eggs in household soil; transitioning a population from prevalent open defeca-
tion to using even unimproved sanitation may be more likely to affect the presence and con-
centration of STH eggs in soil. In our study, many respondents in control households reported
that their household had access to a latrine that was in use (98.1%, 881/898). According to the
JMP definition, the main difference between an unimproved and an improved latrine is the
presence of a plastic or concrete slab[16]. A benefit of a plastic or concrete slab is that it is eas-
ier to clean, and our study found that receiving our improved sanitation intervention was asso-
ciated with reduced stool on the floor of the latrine. The presence of stool on the latrine floor
makes it more likely that fecal contamination could be spread from the latrine to other areas in
the house.
Our multivariable regression results indicated that a shared latrine was associated with an
increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil, which is consistent with previous cross-sectional
studies that have shown an association between shared latrines and increased helminth infec-
tion[31]. Mahfouz et al. (1997) indicated that increased child STH infection (OR = 1.95, 95%
CI = 1.38–2.75) was associated with living in households where latrines were shared[32]. A
potential explanation is that shared latrines are less clean and may have a greater likelihood of
containing STH eggs because they are used by a larger number of people than a private

household latrine. People who use a shared latrine may track contaminated feces from the
latrine to their households, where the eggs incubate and become infective. Heijnen et al.
(2015) found that shared latrines in India were more likely to be dysfunctional, less clean, and
to have flies and feces. Additionally, they found that people who have access to a shared latrine
were more likely to practice open defecation,[33] which would reduce the effectiveness of the
latrine in preventing environmental contamination.
Our multivariate modeling also revealed several additional household and environmental
factors to be associated with the presence of STH eggs in soil. Presence of a roof over the sam-
pling area was also associated with increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Sampling soil in
sunny areas has been associated with lower egg counts in soil in previous studies[12,14].
Higher moisture content was associated with STH presence, which may be due to the persis-
tence of helminth eggs in moist soil under temperate conditions[1]. The number of dogs
owned by a household at baseline was associated with increased STH eggs in soil. Studies have
shown dogs can transmit Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides in their stool [34,35] and
suggest that they may also carry infectious eggs on their fur[35]. However, there was no signifi-
cant association with dog ownership at endline. Additionally, presence of a latrine that was at
least 2 years old and a latrine with a covered drophole were associated with reduced prevalence
of STH eggs in soil. Since STH eggs are persistent in the environment, a household with a new
latrine could have residual STH contamination from prior to latrine installation. Latrines with
a covered drophole may prevent flies from entering the latrine and depositing feces and STH
eggs throughout the house environment.
One limitation of our study was that we do not have precise measures of compound defeca-
tion practices. Measurement of the uptake of the sanitation intervention focused on the physi-
cal presence of an improved latrine or respondent-reported measures of usual latrine use and
defecation behaviors within the past week for some compound members. Also, an increased
sample size would have decreased the minimum detectable effect. Another limitation is that
the soil analysis method has been optimized for Ascaris recovery. The recovery efficiency of
the method using Trichuris and hookworm eggs and larvae is unknown, and field tests in
Kenya and Bangladesh did not detect any hookworm. Another potential study limitation is
that pigs can carry Ascaris with eggs that are microscopically indistinguishable from humans;
however, less than 6% of households in our study that reported animal ownership kept pigs.
Also, excluding households that kept pigs from the analysis did not change results. Addition-
ally, despite thorough training and QA/QC throughout the study, the laboratory technician
effect was a significant covariate in our adjusted analyses. However, for most of the study, the
two laboratory technicians worked in different field laboratories that received samples from
different study areas, either Kakamega and Vihiga or Bungoma. Future studies should try to
mitigate this effect through additional training and by hiring additional laboratory technicians.
Finally, our analysis of STH risk factors in the control group is cross-sectional and may be sus-
ceptible to confounding. The context of the study should be considered when generalizing the
results; our study was carried out during a national school-based deworming campaign in an
area that already had high access to sanitation facilities.
Our study indicates an improved household sanitation intervention did not reduce the
presence or concentration of STH eggs in household soil within our soil sampling area in our
study area in rural Kenya. Our study compared households with an improved sanitation inter-
vention with those in a control group who mostly had access to unimproved sanitation facili-
ties. Kenya is one of the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa where elimination of STH as a
public health problem may be possible because of the transmission intensity, capacity of
funding partners, and political and financial logistics and infrastructure[36]. As home

environments have been identified as an important consideration for elimination of STH
infection in Kenya,[36] more work should be done to evaluate drivers of household soil STH
contamination and their potential impact on STH infection and elimination.
