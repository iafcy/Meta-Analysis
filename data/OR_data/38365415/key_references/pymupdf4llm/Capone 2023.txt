ABSTRACT: Synanthropic filth flies transport enteric pathogens
from feces to food, which upon consumption poses an infection
risk. We evaluated the effect of an onsite sanitation intervention�
including fly control measures�in Maputo, Mozambique, on the
risk of infection from consuming fly-contaminated food. After
enumerating flies at intervention and control sites, we cultured
fecal indicator bacteria, quantified gene copies for 22 enteric
pathogens via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR), and developed quantitative microbial risk
assessment (QMRA) models to estimate annual risks of infection
attributable to fly-contaminated foods. We found that the
intervention reduced fly counts at latrine entrances by 69% (aRR
= 0.31, [0.13, 0.75]) but not at food preparation areas (aRR = 0.92,

[0.33, 2.6]). Half of (23/46) of individual flies were positive for culturable Escherichia coli, and we detected ≥1 pathogen gene from
45% (79/176) of flies, including enteropathogenic E. coli (37/176), adenovirus (25/176), Giardia spp. (13/176), and Trichuris
_trichiura (12/176). We detected ≥1 pathogen gene from half the flies caught in control (54%, 30/56) and intervention compounds_
(50%, 17/34) at baseline, which decreased 12 months post-intervention to 43% (23/53) at control compounds and 27% (9/33) for
intervention compounds. These data indicate flies as a potentially important mechanical vector for enteric pathogen transmission in
this setting. The intervention may have reduced the risk of fly-mediated enteric infection for some pathogens, but infrequent
detection resulted in wide confidence intervals; we observed no apparent difference in infection risk between groups in a pooled
estimate of all pathogens assessed (aRR = 0.84, [0.61, 1.2]). The infection risks posed by flies suggest that the design of sanitation
systems and service delivery should include fly control measures to prevent enteric pathogen transmission.

Large controlled trials of water, sanitation, and hygiene[13][−][16]

found mixed effects of WASH interventions on children’s
health outcomes. An intermediate outcome of some of these
trials was to assess the impact of WASH interventions on
enteric pathogens in the environment, and several studies
measured the impact of these interventions on fecal indicator
bacteria or pathogens in environmental matrices.[17][−][23] Outcome variables to assess a WASH intervention’s impact have
tended to include the binary presence of a target or its
concentration in a specific environmental matrix. However, the
risk of infection from environmental hazards is mediated by
human behaviors, pathogen concentrations, and pathogenspecific dose−response relationships.[24] Quantitative microbial
risk assessment (QMRA)�a mechanistic framework for
estimating health outcomes (e.g., infection and illness) using
microbial measurements, exposure assessment, and pathogenspecific dose−response models�offers an alternative approach
that considers how these additional factors influence transmission. Such an approach offers the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of the interactions between WASH
interventions, fecal contamination in the environment, and
children’s health outcomes compared to epidemiological
methods.
Community-scale insecticide application reduced childhood
diarrhea by 24% in rural Gambia[25] and 23% in Pakistan.[26] A
study of US military bases found intensive fly control via baited
traps reduced clinic visits attributable to diarrhea by 42% and
_Shigella seroconversion by 76%.[27]_ Unlike these communitywide interventions, onsite sanitation typically exists at the
household level, and interventions may only target a subset of
the population. In low-income informal settlements where
onsite sanitation predominates, flies may be highly mobile
between fecal wastes, food for human consumption, and other
household surfaces. Flies can not only travel several kilometers
in a single day but may also remain near common feeding
locations, such as a pit latrine, for several days.[2] It is then
unclear if onsite sanitation interventions can reduce exposures
to human food contaminated by flies. Our research aims were
to (1) evaluate the enteric pathogen profile carried by flies in
Maputo, Mozambique; (2) assess if a localized shared onsite
sanitation reduced fly densities at latrine entrances and food
preparation areas; and (3) estimate the impact of the
intervention on a person’s annual risk of infection from
consuming fly-contaminated food compared to a control
group.

# ■Study Setting.[METHODS] The Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) Trial

was a controlled before-and-after trial that evaluated the effect
of an urban onsite sanitation intervention on child health
outcomes.[16] The trial took place in low-income, informal
neighborhoods in Maputo, Mozambique, where WASH
conditions are poor and the burden of enteric disease is
high.[16][,][17] A nongovernmental organization delivered the
intervention to compounds, which were occupied by multiple
households that shared sanitation and a common outdoor
living space. Sanitation facilities in poor condition at
intervention compounds were replaced with shared pourflush toilets that included septic tanks and soak-away pits.
These intervention systems were built inside the compound
boundary and were part of the households’ living environment.
Neighborhood-level coverage was not the intention of the
intervention; approximately 6% (n = 8601/145,000) of


neighborhood residents received the intervention.[28] The
intervention infrastructure contained physical barriers�
including mesh netting over ventilation pipes and water-seal
toilets�that reduced the potential for flies to breed in the fecal
sludge in the septic tank. Control compounds were
concurrently enrolled from the same or adjacent neighborhoods as intervention compounds and continued using existing
shared sanitation. Detailed descriptions of the inclusion criteria
and the sanitation intervention are described elsewhere.[16][,][28]

**Sample Collection. We collected flies at latrine entrances**
and food preparation areas using sticky traps[29] [(Text S1) from](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
a convenience sample of 50 control and 50 intervention
compounds at baseline (pre-intervention) and 12 months
following delivery of the intervention (median difference = 383
days, interquartile range = 372, 405). Enumerators hung
individual rectangular blue sticky traps (pre-intervention:
Suterra, Bend, Oregon; post-intervention: Great Lakes IPM,
Vestaburg, Michigan) at least 1.5 m off the ground and within
one meter of the latrine entrance and the food preparation
area. Approximately 24 h later, the enumerator returned and
recorded the number of flies on each trap. Then, the
enumerator carefully removed each fly from the trap using
tweezers that were sterilized with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol
between compounds but not between flies. All flies caught in
the traps were collected into Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, Fort
Atkinson, WI) pre-intervention and into sterile 15 mL
centrifuge tubes (VWR, Radnor, PA) post-intervention. Flies
were stored on ice and transported to laboratories at the
Ministry of Health in Maputo, Mozambique. Samples were
deposited into a freezer at −80 °C on the same day as
collection. Some flies remained frozen at the Mozambican
Ministry of Health for analysis, and the remainder were
shipped from Maputo, Mozambique, to Atlanta, Georgia, on
dry ice (−80 °C) with temperature monitoring for later
molecular analysis.
**_Escherichia coli Culture. We randomly selected 46 flies_**
collected at baseline to measure the fecal indicator bacteria E.
_[coli (Figure S1) following storage at −80 °C for approximately](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)_
4 years. We placed them into sterile tubes, determined the
mass of each fly, crushed flies using a sterile disposable pestle
(Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ), added 3 mL of sterile
phosphate buffered saline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO),
manually shook the tubes for 2 min, and then waited for 10
min for the solids to settle.[30] Next, we pipetted 1 mL of the
supernatant onto E. coli-specific Compact Dry plates (Compact
Dry EC, VWR, Vienna, Austria), then incubated the plates at
37 °C for 24 h, and counted colony-forming units (CFUs).
The remaining supernatant was stored at 4 °C, and if a plate
was too numerous to count, the following day, the supernatant
was diluted 1:100 and re-analyzed. Based on the manufacturer’s instructions and the dilutions used, the lower limit of
detection (LOD) was 3 CFU E. coli per fly, and the upper limit
of detection was approximately 10[4] CFU E. coli per fly. We
included one negative process control each day.
**Nucleic Acid Extraction. We aimed to extract nucleic**
acids from one fly per compound, for which we had flies
available in Atlanta, Georgia. Given the heterogeneity in fly
capture, we followed a procedure to select flies for analysis.
From compounds where we caught a single fly, we analyzed
the fly regardless of the species or location caught. In cases
where we caught at least one housefly and bottle fly, we
randomly selected a housefly because houseflies were caught
more frequently than bottle flies If we caught flies from both

the latrine entrance and the food preparation area, we selected
a fly from the food preparation area because these flies were
more likely to land on food. Descriptive examples of this
[selection process are described in Text S2.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
We used a modification of the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to extract total nucleic
acids from 188 individual flies. First, we bead-beat flies for four
cycles of 45 s in bead-beating tubes containing three sizes of
glass beads and 180 μL Qiagen Buffer ATL. Next, we
incubated the flies following the addition of another 180 μL of
Buffer ATL, 40 μL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), and 6 μL of carrier RNA (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) for 3 h at 56 °C. Then, we proceeded with
extraction, following the manufacturer’s protocol. We spiked in
approximately 10[7] gene copies of bacteriophage MS2 (ATCC,
Manassas, VA), an RNA phage, and 10[6] copies of a synthetic
DNA sequence (IDT, Coralville, IA) as our extraction-positive
controls.[31] On each day of extraction, we included at least one
negative extraction control.
**TaqMan Array Card. We assayed nucleic acids using a**
custom TaqMan Array Card (TAC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) that tested for 29 gene targets corresponding to
22 pathogens, following Liu et al.[32][,][33] [(Table S1), including](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
nine bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Clostridium difficile,
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), Shigella/Enteroinvasive E.
_coli (EIEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Enterotoxigenic_
_E. coli (ETEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC),_
_Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae), six viruses (adenovirus,_
astrovirus, pan-enterovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus),
three protozoa (Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium
_hominis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia spp.), and four_
helminths (Ancylostoma duodenale, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator
_americanus, and Trichuris trichiura). The TAC also included_
targets for antimicrobial resistance genes; these data will be
published separately. We combined 40 μL of template with 60
_μL of AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Thermo_
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then added the mixture
into each TAC port. Cards were centrifuged twice for 1 min at
1200 rpm, sealed, and trimmed. We performed reverse
transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using a QuantStudio 7 Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) with the following thermocycling conditions: 45 °C for
20 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C
for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min. We manually set the threshold by
comparing exponential curves and multicomponent plots with
[the positive control plots (Figure S2).[34][,][35]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf) Only amplification
before a quantification cycle (Cq) of 40 was called as positive
for a target, which was based off the performance of our
[negative controls (Tables S1 and S2).[17][,][36]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)

We developed a positive control, which was a plasmid that
contained all target sequences, according to Kodani and
Winchell, 2012.[37] From an 8-fold serial dilution of this positive
control, we ran standard curves to validate the performance of
each assay and estimated gene copy concentrations. In
addition, we ran dilutions ranging from 10[−][1] to 10[3] gene
copies per reaction well to determine the 95% limit of
detection for each assay according to Stokdyk et al.[38] On each
day of TAC analysis, we included at least one negative
extraction control and one PCR positive control.
**Digital PCR. We assayed extracted nucleic acids using**
digital PCR (dPCR) to test for the E. coli-specific gene,
_ybbW,[39]_ with a QIAcuity Four instrument (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). We combined 2 μL of template with 13.3 μL of


QIAcuity EvaGreen PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), forward and reverse primers (0.4 μM concentration), and DNase/RNase free water. After assay mixtures
were pipetted into the wells of a QIAcuity 26k nanoplate, we
sealed the plate and used the following thermocycling
condition: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C
for 15 s, 59 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s, and then a 5 min cool
down at 40 °C. We included at least one PCR positive control
and one PCR negative control on each plate. We manually set
the threshold between distinct positive and negative bands.
**Exposure Assessment. We used the methods described in**
Capone et al.[40] for each pathogen detected in at least 5% of
intervention and control flies at the baseline phase and at least
5% in either study arm at the 12-month phase. These
pathogens included Giardia, EPEC, EAEC, ETEC, adenovirus,
and T. trichiura. For pathogens with multiple targets, we
[selected the largest gene copy value detected (Table S1).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
The intervention was not associated with a difference in fly
counts in the food preparation area, and we lacked site-specific
data regarding fly contact with food. Consequently, we used
QMRA to model a scenario where a single fly landed on food
once a week immediately before consumption. This is a
conservative estimate based on Lindeberg et al., which
reported 1.1 fly landings per minute on uncovered rice in
urban Dhaka, Bangladesh.[41] The potential difference in
QMRA-estimated infection risk between study arms is
subsequently driven by the enteric pathogen concentration in
flies and not fly counts.
We used the fitdistrplus[42] package in R to fit a log-normal
distribution to the mass (mg) of individual flies we assessed. In
our model, we divide the value reported by De Jesus et al.,́ [58]�
that a fly transfers 0.1 mg of mass per landing on average�by a
random value from this fly mass distribution. We used this
method as a conservative estimate of the transfer efficiency of
pathogens from a fly to food (median efficiency = 1.4%,
interquartile range = 0.78, 2.6%). This estimate includes the
total pathogens transferred from fly vomit, defecation, and
[mechanical transport from the fly body (Table S3).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
**Dose Harmonization. Some of the pathogens we assessed**
contain multiple copies of the target sequence. We included
point estimates and uniform distributions across the range of
possible gene copies per genome based on values reported in
[the literature (Table S3).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
**Infectious Unit. PCR assays measure nucleic acids from**
viable and nonviable organisms. We estimated pathogen
viability using a ratio of colony-forming units (CFUs) of E.
_coli to gene copies of the E. coli gene ybbW for bacterial, viral,_
and protozoan pathogens. These measures were determined on
separate flies, preventing direct comparison of matched values.
Instead, we subtracted the median log10 transformed gene
copies of ybbW per fly from the median log10 transformed
CFUs per fly to generate a point estimate of viability. We used
the average of the log10 transformed standard deviations from
these two measures to represent the standard deviation around
the viability point estimate. We input this log10 transformed
point estimate and standard deviation as a normal distribution
to propagate the variability of pathogen viability into our
model. In addition, helminth ova are more persistent than
other pathogens, so we assumed that 75% of T. trichiura ova
were viable based on Steinbaum et al.,[18][,][43] [(Table S3).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
**Dose−Response. We estimated the daily probability of**
infection for each pathogen using dose−response parameters
[taken from the literature (Table S3).](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)

Figure 1. QMRA model overview.

**Risk Characterization. We programmed the model as a**
Monte Carlo simulation in R (Figure 1). In the model, we
fixed the microbial measurements to link the variance in our
empirical data with our model outcome. Then, we randomly
sampled from stochastic distributions to calculate a daily
infection risk for each independent trial. We repeated the
model 52 times, representing one exposure event per week for
a year to calculate the annual risk of infection using eq 1.[44][,][45]

Then, to ensure the convergence of our estimates, we repeated
this process 100 times (i.e., estimating 5200 weekly risks of
infection and 100 annual risks of infection per microbial
measurement) and used the median annual risk of infection for
each microbial measurement from these 100 datasets as the
outcome variable during hypothesis testing.

**Power Analysis. We did not perform power analysis a**
_priori, as the sample size was limited by fly capture and_
subsequent fly availability for nucleic acid extraction. Instead,
we performed a post hoc power analysis using the WebPower
package in R.[49] While infrequent detection resulted in low
[power for individual pathogen estimates (Table S4), we had](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
80% power (α = 0.05) to observe a 23% reduction (RR = 0.77)
in estimated infection risk for the pooled analysis.
**Sensitivity Analysis. Recognizing that infection risk**
estimates are dependent on the model parameters used, we
re-ran alternative model scenarios to demonstrate how changes
[in model parameters impacted our results (Table S5). The](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
parameters included a lower imputed value for nondetects (i.e.,
using the theoretical limit of detection), an alternative estimate
for fly-food transfer efficiency based on a back-of-the-envelope
calculation,[50][−][52] viability estimates taken from the literature
instead of our empirical data,[53][,][54] and a scenario where flies
land on food twice per week instead of once.

# ■Controls.[RESULTS] From the 188 flies we analyzed on TAC, we

excluded 12 because either the RNA or DNA extraction
control did not amplify as expected. Our eight PCR positive
controls (i.e., plasmids containing all target sequences)
amplified as expected on each day we ran TAC. We did not
observe amplification for any target before a Cq of 40 among
our 12 negative extraction controls. The two negative process
controls used to monitor our E. coli culture methods were also
negative.
**Fly Prevalence and Counts. At baseline�combined from**
latrine entrances and food preparation areas�we caught a
mean of 18 flies per intervention compound (95% CI: 13, 24)
and 13 flies per control compound (95% CI: 9.6, 17). At the
12-month follow-up period, we caught fewer flies; the mean
number of flies caught at intervention compounds was 3.2
(95% CI: 1.8, 4.7) and was 4.5 at control compounds (95% CI:
2.8, 6.2). Disaggregated between compound locations, the
intervention reduced mean fly counts at latrine entrances by
69% (aRR = 0.31, [0.13, 0.75]) but had no effect on fly counts
at food preparation areas (aRR = 0.92, [0.33, 2.6]). Fly counts
and prevalence divided by phase, arm, and compound location
[can be found in Table S6.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
**_E. coli. We found that half (23/46) of the flies analyzed_**
were positive for culturable E. coli. The median concentration
was 0 45 log10 CFU E coli per fly, and the mean was 1 0 log10


**Difference-in-Difference (DID) Analysis. The output of**
the risk characterization step was 176 annual estimates of
infection risk�between 0 and 100%�directly tied to our
microbial measurements, which included control and intervention compounds at baseline and the 12-month follow-up.
We used a difference-in-difference (DID) approach[46] to assess
the impact of the intervention on fly counts at latrine entrances
and food preparation areas and the estimated annual infection
risk for each pathogen. In addition, we used to same methods
to estimate the impact of the intervention on the pooled
infection risk for a hypothetical pathogen by analyzing the risk
estimates from the six most frequently detected pathogens in a
single model. The DID approach is a quasi-experimental
approach that typically uses longitudinal data from control and
intervention groups. This approach relies on the parallel trend
assumption, meaning that the initial difference between the
two groups is assumed to remain constant over time. We used
generalized estimating equations (GEE)[47] to fit unadjusted
Poisson regression models with robust standard errors and
accounted for clustering at the compound level. As our
infection risk estimates were linked to the original microbial
measurements, we were also able to fit adjusted Poisson
regression models that included the following covariates
chosen a priori: fly species (bottle vs housefly), location the
fly was caught (food preparation vs latrine), and wealth
index.[48] Adjusted models using fly count data as the outcome
variable only included wealth index as a covariate

Figure 2. Culture and PCR results for all microbial targets. Note: All points below the dotted line were nondetects. We analyzed 19 flies for E. coli
gene copies, 46 flies for culturable E. coli, and 176 flies for pathogen genes.


(Figure 2). All extracted nucleic acids measured via dPCR (19/
19) were positive for the E.coli-specific gene ybbW, with a
median concentration of 3.0 log10 gene copies per fly and a
mean of 3.6 log10 gene copies per fly (Figure 2).
**Pathogen Genes. We detected ≥1 pathogen gene from**
half the flies caught in control (54%, 30/56) and intervention
compounds (50%, 17/34) at baseline. The prevalence
decreased during the 12-month phase to 43% (23/53) for
flies from control compounds and 27% (9/33) for flies from
intervention compounds (Table 1). In addition, we detected a
gene associated with each pathogen assayed using the TAC
from ≥1 fly except for C. difficile, Salmonella, the two
hookworm targets A. duodenale and N. americanus, and the
two Cryptosporidium targets (Figure 2 and Table 1). The most
prevalent bacterial pathogen was EPEC (37/176), helminth
was T. trichiura (12/176), protozoa was Giardia (13/176), and
virus was adenovirus (25/176) (Figure 2 and Table 1).
**Annual Risk of Infection. As we did not detect any**
pathogen in more than 50% of flies, the median annual risk of
infection for each pathogen was calculated from an imputed
value for both study arms and phases, resulting in
homogeneous median risk estimates. The annual risk estimates
approached 100% for most data above the limit of detection
(Table 1).
**Intervention Impact. According to the traditional**
definition of statistical significance,[55] we estimated a significant
reduction in the annual risk of infection from Giardia (RR =
0.41, [0.18, 0.96]) in the unadjusted model (Table 1).
Likewise, the adjusted point estimates for five of the six most
frequently detected pathogens�adenovirus (aRR = 0.57,

[0.30, 1.1]), EAEC (aRR = 0.73, [aRR = 0.48, 1.1]), ETEC
(aRR = 0.93, [0.74, 1.2]), T. trichiura (aRR = 0.46, [0.16,
1.3]), and Giardia (aRR = 0.50, [0.23, 1.1)]�also suggested
the intervention had a protective effect In addition, the point


estimate for pooled infection risk indicated a protective effect
(aRR = 0.84, [0.61, 1.2]). However, the confidence intervals
included one for these five pathogens and the pooled risk
estimate, indicating that the intervention may have had no
effect or even increased the risk of infection compared to the
control group.
**Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in model parameters did**
not affect the directionality of point estimates but did result in
[changes to individual point estimates (Table S7). Setting](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf)
nondetects to the theoretical limit of detection (LOD)�
instead of imputing them from zero to 95% LOD�resulted in
lower infection risk estimates for nondetect samples. Models
using this lower LOD suggested the intervention reduced the
fly-mediated risk of infection for adenovirus (aRR = 0.32,

[0.14, 0.97]), Trichuris (aRR = 0.12, [0.03, 0.48]), and Giardia
(aRR = 0.19, [0.05, 0.80]) but not for the pooled infection risk
estimate (aRR = 0.75, [0.42, 1.4]). Using viability estimates
from the literature for Giardia and adenovirus�instead of our
empirical data�resulted in nearly the same result for Giardia
(aRR = 0.46, [0.20, 1.1]) but suggested a protective effect for
adenovirus (aRR = 0.08, [0.02, 0.42]). An alternative estimate
of transfer efficiency (3.2%)�instead of our stochastic
method�also resulted in similar infection risk estimates.
Except, this model suggested the intervention reduced the flymediated risk of infection by adenovirus (aRR = 0.73, [0.52,
1.0]) and Trichuris (aRR = 0.14, [0.04, 0.53]). Finally,
doubling the frequency of fly contact with food also resulted in
similar infection risk estimates (pooled aRR = 0.84, [0.58,
1.2]).

# ■ [DISCUSSION]

A large body of literature from the 1880s[56] to the mid1900s[1][−][4] demonstrated that flies were capable of transporting
enteric pathogens on body surfaces and in the alimentary canal

While these early studies were limited by the methods
available, application of the methods available in the 21st
Century has broadened our understanding of the link between
flies and disease. Some of these studies have focused on
culturing fecal indicator bacteria from flies,[21][,][57] the potential
contamination of food,[7][,][41][,][58] fly densities,[59] and fly-mediated
spread of antimicrobial resistance.[60][,][61] According to a 2018
systematic review of human pathogens carried by flies,[62] our
novel multipathogen assessment of individual flies represents
the first PCR-based detection of human enteric viruses (i.e.,
adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus, and sapovirus)
from wild caught flies. The high prevalence and concentration
of pathogens we detected in flies, combined with their mobility
in the living environment, suggests flies may be capable of
distributing any enteric pathogen present in fecal wastes to


surfaces and food where the opportunity for such transmission
exists.
We infrequently detected individual pathogens, which
resulted in low power for these regression model estimates
and wide confidence intervals. While low power suggests a
cautious interpretation of individual pathogen estimates, there
was a general trend; five of six individual point estimates
showed the onsite sanitation intervention may have reduced
the fly-mediated risk of enteric infection.[55] In addition, the
general trend was reproduced in the sensitivity analyses.
However, the results clearly indicated that the shared urban
onsite sanitation intervention did not dramatically reduce the
QMRA-estimated infection risk from fly-contaminated foods
after 1 year, and wide confidence intervals indicated the
intervention may have increased the risk of infection These


-----

results corroborate other studies of environmental fecal
contamination as part of the MapSan trial during the 12-[63]

and 24-month[17] phases, which found the intervention may
have had a small protective effect against some enteric
pathogens in latrine entrance soils, but levels of fecal
contamination remained high post-intervention. While the
intervention was associated with a reduction in fly counts at
latrine entrances, we observed no difference at food
preparation areas, which is where fly contact with food is
more likely to occur.
Two community wide fly control interventions�that used
insecticide treatment[25] and baited traps[27]�reduced fly counts
by approximately 75%. A study in Pakistan found that villagescale insecticide spraying reduced fly counts by more than
90%, though baited traps had no effect.[26] At both control and
intervention compounds, there was a substantial decrease in fly
counts from baseline to the 12-month phase. However, this
finding may have been the result of the methods we used. The
manufacturer discontinued the fly trap used at baseline, and
anecdotally, field workers reported the fly traps used postintervention were not as sticky as those used pre-intervention.
In addition, fly traps capture a subset of the flies from an area
of interest as they must compete with alternative sites (e.g.,
feces, fecal sludge, and solid waste).[29] The actual number of
flies inside study compounds was likely greater than indicated
by our fly count results.
The high prevalence and concentration of culturable E. coli
and pathogen-associated genes we detected suggest that the
fly-food-ingestion pathway may be underappreciated in
Maputo and similar informal low-income communities.
Effective fly control strategies are essential to reduce risks.
These strategies can be classified as either source or contact
control. Certain onsite sanitation systems that are properly
constructed and maintained�such as VIPs and pour-flush
systems�offer the opportunity for source control by
preventing fly breeding,[12] whereas contact control strategies
include fly traps, insecticides, and covering food.[26][,][41] Contact
control strategies may be easier to implement in the near
future compared to investments in sanitation infrastructure.
However,[64][,][65] there is mixed evidence that fly trap
interventions reduce fly counts[26][,][27] and some insects�
including flies�are evolving resistance to insecticides.[64][,][65]

Physical barriers to limit fly breeding�namely mesh screens
over ventilation pipes and water seals�would not require the
same degree of ongoing effort as contract control strategies.
However, this infrastructure will deteriorate after a few years
without consistent maintenance[12] and may need to achieve a
certain threshold of community coverage to reduce fly counts
at locations relevant to exposure (i.e., food preparation areas).
The sanitation intervention we evaluated included a water seal
and mesh screen over a ventilation pipe. These physical
barriers may explain the large reduction in fly counts at
intervention latrine entrances compared to controls. In
addition to human excreta, efforts to control fly breeding in
low- and middle-income countries are complicated by the
presence of animal feces, which may exceed the quantity of
human feces in some settings.[66] The difficulty associated with
managing animal waste suggests alternative and sustainable fly
control strategies may be needed to dramatically reduce the
infection risks posed by fly-contaminated food in Maputo and
similar informal urban settlements.
A wide range of media is suitable for fly larval development.
Houseflies have been observed to reproduce in human and


animal excrement, fecal sludges, decaying foods, household
refuse, and solid wastes.[3] The high water content of septic tank
sludge may prevent flies from breeding. However, Hargreaves
observed large numbers of flies breeding in the scum layer of
septic tanks.[67] We did not attempt to observe fly larvae in
latrines and septic tanks, and it is unclear what role�if any�
sludge characteristics played in fly reproduction habits.
Flies may be able to transmit enteric pathogens from feces to
food: this pathway is directly observable and has been used
widely in Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) programming to exemplify exposure risks of uncontained fecal
contamination.[68] Well-fed houseflies have been observed to
defecate approximately every four and a half minutes.[3]

Although pathogen residence time in the alimentary canal
varies, Sieyro, 1942,[69] found cysts of E. histolytica could be
passed by houseflies in as little as 1 min and were detectable up
to 34 h after feeding. In addition, flies often regurgitate their
food, but the structure of the proboscis selectively filters some
protozoan cysts and helminth ova such that they are more
likely to be shed in feces than vomit.[2] After vomiting, flies may
re-ingest this material to aid with mechanical digestion.[2]

Graham-Smith,[50] and Wenyon and O’Connor,[51] reported that
houseflies fed once on milk produced 16−31 specks (i.e.,
vomitus or excreta) per fly, most of which they classified as
vomit. Houseflies cannot typically swallow particles larger the
40 μm in diameter, which may prevent them from ingesting
some Ascaris ova, but oblong Trichuris ova could be swallowed
lengthwise (minimum diameter ∼ 20−25 μm). This size
limitation may be why we detected Trichuris more frequently
than Ascaris (minimum diameter ∼45 μm) despite Ascaris
being more prevalent in fecal sludges collected from trial
[compounds (Table S8).[70]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.2c06864/suppl_file/es2c06864_si_001.pdf) In addition to the abundance of
vomit and excreta that flies generate, they have a compulsion
for cleaning. Flies constantly preen their wings or brush their
body parts, which dislodges organisms that may have become
attached to their integument.[2]

There are several limitations to consider as part of our study.
First, we sterilized tweezers between compounds and not
individual flies, which may have led to contamination between
flies from the same compound. Second, we lacked empirical
evidence to describe the frequency of fly contact with food,
though we used a highly conservative estimate based on
Lindeberg et al.[41] Further, we conservatively estimated equal
contact between flies and food among study arms. While we
observed no difference in fly counts at food preparation areas,
the substantial reduction in fly counts at latrine entrances
suggests we may have underestimated the impact of the
intervention. Third, there is a paucity of literature quantifying
the transfer of pathogens from flies to food, but we used a
conservative estimate based on values reported in the
literature. Fourth, the applicability of dose−response relationships developed in high-income countries to individuals living
in informal settlements is unclear. Endemic exposure may
result in acquired immunity, but repeated enteric infections
may also compromise the immune system, leading to greater
susceptibility.[71] Further, the prevalence of individual pathogens
was low because we extracted nucleic acids from individual
flies�rather than pools of flies�and the LOD for TAC is
higher than traditional qPCR or dPCR.[72] Preamplification of
nucleic acid extracts is an alternative method to lower the high
LOD associated with the TAC workflow.[34] In addition, low
pathogen prevalence likely resulted in limited power to observe
significant effects However, our results indicate that the


-----

intervention did not result in substantial reductions in QMRAestimated infection risks, which is similar to the null effect
observed in the main outcome of the MapSan trial.[16]

Viability is a key variable in QMRA;[73] we used an empirical
ratio of culturable to gene copies of E. coli. This approach may
have underestimated infection risks from Giardia and
adenovirus, as these pathogens may be more persistent than
_E. coli,[74][,][75]_ but we offered an alternative viability estimate for
these pathogens in the sensitivity analysis. However, this
alternative used an estimate that likely relied on an assumption
of unknown and unknowable validity. And the feeding habits
of houseflies and green bottle flies in this setting�namely on
fresh feces�gives credence to our estimates that some
pathogen-specific genes came from viable organisms. Additionally, flies were frozen before culturing, which may have
resulted in an underestimate of viability and subsequently
resulted in an underestimate of annual infection risks.
Flies are capable of transporting enteric pathogens from
feces to food and other surfaces, which may then cause enteric
infection and illness. We used QMRA to demonstrate that the
fly-food pathway is highly plausible and may contribute to the
burden of enteric disease in low-income Maputo and similar
settings.[26] We found some evidence to suggest that the onsite
sanitation intervention reduced the annual risk of infection
from consuming fly-contaminated food, but low power limited
the interpretation of effects for individual pathogens. The
onsite sanitation intervention we assessed was not implemented at a community level, indicating it is possible the
intervention did not reach an adequate threshold of
community coverage to substantially reduce infection risks
from fly-contaminated foods. In addition, the intervention fly
barriers�mesh netting over the ventilation pipe, the water
seal, and the sealed septic tank�may have become damaged
post-intervention and enabled flies to breed in the fecal sludge.
Transformative WASH[30][,][76] interventions should consider the
maintenance of fly barriers and fly contact control
interventions (e.g., traps, insecticides, and covering food) as
necessary components of holistic interventions that might
achieve substantial reductions in environmental fecal contamination and improve children’s health outcomes.
