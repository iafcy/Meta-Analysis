ABSTRACT: Diarrheal illnesses from enteric pathogens are a leading
cause of death in children under five in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). Sanitation is one way to reduce the spread of
enteric pathogens in the environment; however, few studies have
investigated the effectiveness of sanitation in rural LMICs in reducing
pathogens in the environment. In this study, we measured the impact
of a sanitation intervention (dual-pit latrines, sani-scoops, child potties
delivered as part of a randomized control trial, WASH Benefits) in
rural Bangladeshi household compounds by assessing prevalence
ratios, differences, and changes in the concentration of pathogen genes
and host-specific fecal markers. We found no difference in the
prevalence of pathogenic Escherichia coli, norovirus, or Giardia genes
in the domestic environment in the sanitation and control arms. The
prevalence of the human fecal marker was lower on child hands and the concentration of animal fecal marker was lower on mother
hands in the sanitation arm in adjusted models, but these associations were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.
In the subset of households with ≥10 individuals per compound, the prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli genes on child hands was
lower in the sanitation arm. Incomplete removal of child and animal feces or the compound (versus community-wide) scale of
intervention could explain the limited impacts of improved sanitation.

# ■ [INTRODUCTION]

Globally, deaths due to diarrheal illnesses in children under five produce 4 times the amount of feces as humans and animal

feces exposure is of particular concern in low- and middle
are decreasing, yet the rate remains high.[1] In South Asia,
approximately 10% of all deaths in children under five are due income countries, where animal husbandry in the household

environment is common.[7] Livestock excrete pathogens such as

to diarrhea.[2] These illnesses result from the transmission of

Giardia, Campylobacter, and STEC,[8] and a single infected

enteric pathogens facilitated by inadequate drinking water,

animal may excrete a higher number of pathogens than a single

sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions. Pathogens can be

human due to either higher mass concentrations or higher

transmitted from the feces of an infected host to a new host

volume of feces.[9] Due to the potential hazard posed by animal

through the fecal-oral route, mediated through environmental
reservoirs.[3] Specifically, transmission can occur through feces, a broadened scope of sanitation interventions has been

suggested that combines animal fecal management (e.g.,

exposure to contaminated water, soil, hands, fomites, vectors
(e.g., flies), and food. Drinking water treatment, sanitation separating animals from living spaces, removal of animal
infrastructure, and hygiene interventions use different mech- feces from the household environment with tools, and

reducing the movement of animals) with human fecal
management (e.g., latrines).[4]

Determining the levels of fecal contamination in environmental reservoirs, and the impact of sanitation, can provide a
mechanistic understanding of how sanitation interventions are
effective, or not, at reducing the spread of enteric pathogens.
Existing studies have investigated the impact of sanitation on
health outcomes, but few have quantified the impact of
sanitation on indicators of fecal contamination along exposure
routes (soil, hands, water, food, fomites, flies).[10][−][15] Notably,
fewer studies have measured the impact of sanitation on the
presence of specific pathogens in these reservoirs.[15][,][16]

In this study, we quantify the impact of a sanitation
intervention (a combined human and animal fecal management intervention that included dual-pit latrines, sani-scoops,
and child potties) on enteric pathogen genes and indicators in
household environmental reservoirs, within a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits) in rural Bangladesh. We
measured pathogen genes (pathogenic Escherichia coli,
norovirus, and Giardia lamblia) and microbial source tracking
(MST) markers in soil, stored drinking water, and on mother
and child hands in a subset of enrolled compounds to assess
the impact of the intervention on (1) the prevalence of
pathogen genes, (2) the prevalence of human fecal markers,
and (3) the prevalence and concentration of animal fecal
markers in the domestic environment.

# ■ [METHODS]
The study methods (setting, design, sample collection, and
pathogen and indicator gene detection) were the same as
described in Fuhrmeister et al.[17] and are briefly summarized
here. The analysis plan was prespecified prior to data analysis
and is publicly available on the Open Science Framework
[(https://osf.io/xrbpz/). Data were analyzed using R and the](https://osf.io/xrbpz/)
analysis was independently replicated by two blinded analysts
(ERF, YC). This paper complements a previously published
paper from the same field trial, which investigated the
prevalence and concentration of indicator E. coli in all
households enrolled in the control; sanitation; and combined
water, sanitation, and handwashing arms four months after the
intervention was delivered.[13] Another publication documents
the relationship between indicator E. coli, microbial source
tracking markers, and pathogen genes in the same subset of
households sampled as this study.[17] Future publications are
planned that will report on the prevalence and concentration of
indicator E. coli in a subset of sanitation and control
households at multiple time points over two years to assess
the long-term effect of sanitation.
Study Setting and Design. We conducted our study in a
randomly selected subset of households from the sanitation
and control arms (300 households per arm) of the WASH
Benefits trial in rural Bangladesh.[18] WASH Benefits enrolled
clusters of households that were geographically pair-matched
and then randomly allocated to one of seven intervention or
control arms.[19] One household was selected per compound
(defined as groups of 3−10 households, typically relatives,
living in adjacent households surrounding a central courtyard).
The sanitation intervention included potties for young
children, sani-scoop hoes to remove child and animal feces,
and dual-pit latrines in each study compound. Community
promoters visited study compounds about 6 times per month
to deliver behavior change messages that focused on the use of
child potties and latrines for defecation and disposal of human


and animal feces. At the time of sample collection, it had been
16−35 months since the latrines were constructed. WASH
Benefits enrolled households with a pregnant woman and
followed their birth cohort. The interventions were delivered
around the time of the cohort’s birth. Therefore, at the time of
sample collection, study households contained at least one
young child (aged 9−44 months) and any siblings of the birth
cohort.
Data Collection. Trained field staff from the International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b)
visited enrolled households, unannounced, between March and
October 2015. They collected environmental samples,
interviewed the female caregiver of young children regarding
household practices related to sanitation and handling of
human and animal feces, and conducted environmental spot
checks using a structured questionnaire.
Sample Collection. Approximately 720 soil samples, 720
stored drinking water samples, 720 mother hand rinses, and
360 child hand rinses were collected from 600 study
households (some households were sampled twice, approximately 4 months apart to capture both the wet and dry
seasons; exact sample numbers for each assay are reported in
the relevant figures and tables). Soil samples were collected
from an area as close to the house entrance as possible by
scraping the top layer of soil within a 30 × 30 cm[2] stencil into a
sterile Whirlpak bag (Nasco, Modesto, CA). For stored water
samples, mothers were asked to provide a glass of water as they
would give it to their child under five. To collect mother hand
rinse samples, mothers placed their left hand into a sterile
Whirlpak bag filled with 250 mL of sterile distilled water. The
hand was massaged from the outside of the bag for 15 s,
followed by 15 s of shaking. The same procedure was repeated
with the right hand in the same bag. For child hand rinse
samples, respondents placed their child’s hand into a separate
Whirlpak bag and followed the same procedure. All samples
were placed on ice and transported to the icddr,b field
laboratory within 8 h of collection and processed by lab
technicians within 12 h of collection.
Detection of Pathogenic E. coli Genes. Previously
published methods were used to identify pathogenic E. coli
genes.[20][,][21] In brief, IDEXX Colilert-18 was used to determine
which samples contained E. coli. Samples that tested positive
were then archived for pathogenic E. coli gene analysis. For
archiving, broth from up to 20 positive large IDEXX wells was
aseptically extracted, pooled, centrifuged, and stored at −80
°C. Samples were transported to UC Berkeley at room
temperature (approximately 30 h) and stored at −80 °C upon
arrival (2−28 months) prior to sample processing. Multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions were used to
detect seven E. coli virulence genes indicative of five pathotypes
of E. coli: EAEC (aggR), EPEC/EHEC (eaeA), STEC (stx1/
[stx2/eaeA), EIEC (ipaH), and ETEC (lt1/st1b) (Table S1).](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
Blanks were included during archiving, DNA extraction, and
PCR processing to verify sterile procedures, which resulted in a
total of 72 laboratory blanks and 84 extraction blanks
[(additional information on blanks is available in the Supporting](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)

Filtration and Nucleic Acid Extraction for Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) Targets. Field
laboratory technicians filtered 50 mL of hand rinse samples
and up to 500 mL of stored water (range 100−500 mL)
through a 0.45 μm HA filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA) to
capture both viruses and bacteria. MgCl2 was added to all

samples to increase the retention of viruses.[22] Filters were
stored at −80 °C before and after transport to UC Berkeley at
room temperature. Five grams of soil (wet weight) was
weighed and stored at −80 °C until transport to UC Berkeley
(under USDA soil import permit, PPQ 525). Filter and soil
samples were stored at UC Berkeley at −80 °C between 5 and
24 months prior to processing. DNA and RNA were extracted
from soil and filters using modified Mobio PowerWater and
PowerViral (both now Qiagen, Germantown, MD) protocols.[15][,][23] A total of 168 blanks were processed during filtration
and 119 during nucleic acid extraction. A subset of samples
(175 of 2608 total samples, 7%) was spiked with Pseudomonas
syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph6) and MS2 (99 of 2608, 4%) to
quantify the extraction of nucleic acids. Detailed methods for
extraction protocols and quantification of extraction efficiency
[are available in the Supporting Information of Fuhrmeister et](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
al.[17]

qPCR Assays. We used qPCR to analyze samples for
norovirus GII, G. lamblia, Cryptosporidium spp. specific genes,
[and microbial source tracking markers (Table S2). To detect](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
human-specific fecal contamination, we used the HumM2
qPCR assay (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency research
license #864-14) that targets human-associated Bacteroidaleslike microorganisms.[24][,][25] The HumM2 protocol was modified
to employ a different master mix designed to reduce inhibition,
and the qPCR threshold was selected based on our instrument
(StepOnePlus). To detect animal-associated fecal contamination, we used the BacCow assay.[26] Both HumM2 and
BacCow assays were previously evaluated for sensitivity and
specificity in rural Bangladesh.[15] The BacCow assay detected
Bacteroidales in feces of cows, ducks, goats, and chickens but
not humans in this setting.[15] HumM2 performed the best out
of all human-associated assays tested (HumM2, HF183, and
BacHum), although it also amplified, indicating a positive
result, in the feces of chickens and goats.[15]

Initially, a subset of samples (105 child hands, 112 mother
hands, 110 stored water, and 109 soil samples) from 50
households (25 control and 25 sanitation) were tested for the
presence of norovirus GII, G. lamblia, and Cryptosporidium
specific genes. Within this subset, less than 1% of both soil
samples and stored water samples tested positive for norovirus
and Giardia genes; less than 1% of all sample types were
positive for the Cryptosporidium gene. Therefore, we only
analyzed remaining hand rinse samples for norovirus and
Giardia genes. We did not test any remaining samples for the
presence of the Cryptosporidium gene.
Samples were run on a StepOnePlus thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in triplicate on a 96-well plate
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each run contained
one standard curve (ranging from 10 to 10[5] gene copies/2 μL)
and three no-template controls. A subset of samples (10 filters
and 13 soil samples, ≈1%) were tested for inhibition using the
spike and dilute method.[27] Filter samples were uninhibited for
all DNA and RNA assays. In soil samples, Cryptosporidium spp.
and MS2 assays were inhibited in some samples. HumM2,
BacCow, G. lamblia, pph6, and Norovirus GII were
uninhibited for all samples. A 1:10 dilution for the extraction
efficiency of RNA in soil was used for MS2. We decided not to
dilute Cryptosporidium due to the resulting increase in the
detection limit. A standard curve for quantification for each
assay was determined by pooling all standard curves and using
a linear mixed-effects model to correct for batch effects.[28]

Results from inhibition testing and standard curve quantifica

Fuhrmeister et al.[17]

Data Analysis for Quantitative Assays. BacCow was the
only qPCR assay that produced data in the quantifiable range;
nearly all samples amplified below the lowest point on the
standard curve (10 gene copies/2 μL) in all other assays.
BacCow measurements were quantifiable in 76% of child
hands, 67% of mother hands, 10% of stored water, and 49% of
soil. For quantitative analysis, hand rinse samples below the
limit of detection (BLOD) were assigned half the value of the
limit of detection (LOD). Hand rinse samples below the limit
of quantification (BLOQ) were assigned the midpoint between
the LOD and the limit of quantification (LOQ). To determine
which quantities to assign to samples BLOD and BLOQ in
stored water and soil samples, which were impacted by
differences in processing volume and moisture content, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis with four scenarios. The overall
results for difference in concentration of BacCow between
[arms were similar in all scenarios (Table S3). Thus, we chose](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
to assign samples BLOD half the LOD accounting for the
volume of water filtered and the moisture content for each
sample. Samples BLOQ were assigned the midpoint between
the LOD and LOQ. Blanks that amplified for BacCow were
BLOQ; samples that amplified in the same region (BLOQ)
were treated as BLOD (see the Supporting Information for
[more details, including Table S4 for the number of samples](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
BLOD and BLOQ).
Data Analysis for Presence Absence Assays. Most
samples did not amplify within the quantifiable range for
norovirus GII, Giardia, and HumM2. Therefore, these assays
were analyzed as presence absence data and samples were
considered positive for qPCR targets if at least one of three
replicates amplified, even if amplification was BLOQ. For
binary analyses of pathogen/source tracking marker presence,
all samples with positive lab, extraction, or archiving blanks
were removed from the analysis according to the date
processed and the lab technician. This resulted in removing
30 child and 33 mother hand samples from norovirus GII and
51 child and 115 mother hands from Giardia gene analyses. In
total, 29 child hand, 74 mother hand, 76 stored water, and 92
soil samples were removed from HumM2 analyses. For
pathogenic E. coli virulence genes, 6 child hand, 9 mother
hand, 11 stored water, and 12 soil samples were removed from
eaeA analyses. A total of 3 child hand, 5 mother hand, 5 stored
water, and 6 soil samples were removed from stx1/stx2
analyses. A total of 4 child hand, 6 mother hand, 9 stored
water, and 8 soil samples were removed from lt1 analyses.
Linear Models. The impact of the sanitation intervention
was assessed using generalized linear models with robust
standard errors to account for the trial’s clustered study design
and did not assume outcome distributions.[18] For binary
outcomes, we estimated the prevalence, prevalence differences
(PD), and prevalence ratios (PR) for pathogen genes and
microbial source tracking markers. For BacCow, the only
continuous marker, we determined the mean concentration in
each arm as well as the difference in concentration between the
arms. The analyzed values for BacCow concentrations were
log10-transformed.
Randomization in the parent trial resulted in balanced
covariates between arms; thus, we used the unadjusted models
as our primary analysis.[18] We conducted three prespecified
subgroup analyses to estimate our parameters of interest in
subsets of the data. Data were subset by season (wet vs dry),

crows, pigeons). For the latter two subsets, the cutoffs were
determined based on the empirical data distribution. In a
deviation from the analysis plan, the wet season was defined as
June−September (rather than May−October) to achieve a
better balance in sample numbers in the subgroups and to
reflect the actual rainfall in 2015. In a secondary analysis, we
adjusted our estimates for covariates anticipated to be
associated with our outcomes. We included the same
covariates as described in the WASH Benefits analysis plan
(season, rainfall, and household characteristics) with the
addition of sampling condition covariates (sampling location
for soil (sun, shade), soil moisture content, cover status of the
stored water container, stored water container type, and
observation of handwashing during sample collection). We
corrected for multiple comparisons, multiplying p-values by
four (i.e., the same pathogen evaluated in multiple sample
types) using a Bonferroni correction.[29]

Ethics. Participants provided written informed consent. The
study protocol was approved by human subjects committees at
the icddr,b (PR-11063), University of California, Berkeley
(2011-09-3652), and Stanford University (25863).

# ■ [RESULTS]

Prevalence of Pathogen Genes and Microbial Source
Tracking Markers. The prevalence of each E. coli virulence
gene (ECVG) was consistently higher on child hands than
[mother hands (Figure 1 and Table S5). On child hands in both](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
study arms, the most prevalent ECVG was stx1/2 (control
(C): 13.4 (95% CI: 8.6, 18.3)%; sanitation (S): 16.8 (11.2,
22.5)%). On mother hands, the most prevalent ECVGs were
eaeA, aggR, and stx1/2 genes (C and S: 6.1−9.3%). The
prevalence of norovirus and G. lamblia genes was 1.7−5.1% in
all hand samples in both arms. In other household reservoirs,
ECVGs were present in ≈37% (C: 37.5 (33.0, 42.1) %; S: 36.4
(31.3, 41.6)%) of stored water and ≈60% (C: 61.5 (56.4, 66.6)
[%; S: 58.9 (53.9, 64.0)%) of soil (Figure 2 and Table S5). The](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
most commonly detected ECVG in stored water was stx1/2
(C: 16.6 (12.6, 20.6) %; S: 16.5 (12.6, 20.4)%), and eaeA (C:
38.6 (33.2, 44.1)%; S: 36.7 (31.7, 41.6)%) was the most
commonly detected ECVG in soil. The least prevalent ECVG
across all sample types was ipaH (≤2%).
Human and animal microbial source tracking markers were
detected in all four reservoirs. The prevalence of BacCow was
higher than any other target including both pathogen genes
and microbial source tracking markers. In total, 99.5 (98.4,
100.0)% and 95.6 (92.4, 98.9)% of child hands in the control
and sanitation arms were positive for BacCow and a similar
prevalence was also found on mother hands (C: 97.6 (96.0,
99.1)%; S: 95.8 (93.9, 97.7)%). BacCow was detected in 70.0
(65.1, 74.8)% and 67.0 (61.6, 72.4)% of stored water and in
91.2 (88.4, 94.1)% and 90.2 (86.1, 94.2)% of soil in the control
and sanitation arms. The prevalence of the human fecal marker
(HumM2) was substantially lower than the animal marker in
all reservoirs. In the control and sanitation arms, the prevalence
of HumM2 on child hands was 26.3 (19.7, 33.0)% and 17.6
(12.0, 23.3)% and a similar level was found on mother hands
(C: 18.5 (13.8, 23.1)%; S: 17.7 (13.3, 22.1)%). We detected
HumM2 in <5% of stored water samples (C: 3.6 (1.5, 5.6)%;
S: 1.6 (0.2, 2.9)%) and in approximately 20% of soil (C: 18.4
(14.3, 22.5)%; S: 22.0 (17.3, 26.6)%). Hand rinses, stored
water, and soil samples have different units (per 2 hands, 100
mL of stored water, and g of dry soil); therefore, it is difficult


to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the different
prevalence results between environmental sample types.
Intervention Impact. Almost all compounds in both the
sanitation and control arms contained a latrine (C: 99%; S:
100%) at the time of sample collection (Table 1). Most

sanitation arm compounds had a pour-flush latrine (C: 63%; S:

of intervention arm latrines drained into the environment,
whereas more than 20% of control households had latrines
draining into the environment or had feces spilling out from
the pit. While ownership does not guarantee use, most adults
(94%) in the sanitation arm used the latrine during structured
observations in the main field trial.[30] There were also more
compounds with young children defecating in latrines or
potties (C, 13%; S, 56%) and using a scoop or hoe to handle
animal feces (C, 48%; S, 97%) in the intervention arm.

prevalence of BacCow was 4% lower in the sanitation arm
(prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.00); corrected p
= 0.21). This association was not significant after correcting for
multiple comparisons in the unadjusted model but was
significant in the adjusted model (PR: 0.95 (0.92, 0.97);
corrected p < 0.001). There was a borderline significant
difference in the prevalence of the human fecal marker on child
hands between arms in the adjusted model (PR: 0.66 (0.44,
0.99); corrected p = 0.19). There was also a borderline
significant difference in the prevalence of st1b/lt1 between
arms in stored water (PR, 0.64 (0.39, 1.03); corrected p =
0.27) and soil (0.74 (0.54, 1.03); corrected p = 0.29) in the

Prevalence of Pathogen Genes and Microbial Source
Tracking Markers. Considering that stored drinking water is
a direct exposure route for the ingestion of enteric pathogens,
the high prevalence of BacCow (C: 70%; S: 67%) and E. coli
virulence genes (C: 38%; S:67%) in stored water in both study
arms is a concern. As we did not measure pathogen genes or


BacCow in tubewells (source water), we were unable to
differentiate contamination in the tubewells from contamination introduced during storage. It is possible that some of
the fecal contamination in stored drinking water originated
from the source water, as other studies have found indicators
of fecal contamination and pathogen genes in these
sources.[31][−][34] Another possible mechanism of stored water
contamination is through contact with hands,[35][−][37] which we
have shown to be contaminated with multiple types of
pathogenic E. coli virulence genes (Figure 1). In this same
study area, Ercumen et al.[13] found that the prevalence of
indicator E. coli was significantly higher in stored water (C:
77%; S: 76%) than was found in tubewells (C: 25%; S: 23%);[13]

thus, contamination during storage is likely responsible for
some of the observed high prevalence of BacCow and E. coli
virulence genes. Comparing with previously published results
on indicator E. coli in all sample types, it is interesting to note
that the prevalence of BacCow on hands was higher than the
prevalence of indicator E. coli (≈75%), whereas indicator E. coli
were more prevalent than BacCow in stored water (88%) and
soil (95%).[17]

Previous studies have investigated the presence of microbial
source tracking markers in the household environment in rural
India. We found a higher prevalence of the same animal fecal
marker (BacCow) in hand rinses and stored water in rural
Bangladesh than was observed in Odisha, India.[16] We also
found a similar level of the human fecal markers on hands as
was found in India but a higher prevalence in stored drinking
water; however, the results are difficult to compare given that
different fecal markers were used based on sensitivity and
specificity for each study location.[15][,][38]

A comparable study on rural Bangladeshi households found
lower prevalence of human fecal contamination using the same
human marker (HumM2).[15] This study was also conducted in
a subset of WASH Benefits households in the sanitation and
control arms, but samples were collected at an earlier date
(November 2013−March 2014). In the control arm, 9.0% of
soil samples, 0% of stored drinking water, and 2.0% of child
hands were positive for HumM2 compared to 18.4% soil, 3.6%
stored water, and 26.3% of child hands in our study. Taken
together, the results indicate a high degree of temporal
variability in human fecal contamination. These studies
sampled in different years as well as months; the previous
study was conducted during the dry season of Bangladesh,
while our sampling spanned both seasons. Therefore, differences in the occurrence of HumM2 could be due to both
seasonal and yearly variations. Previous studies have found
higher levels of fecal contamination in various environmental
reservoirs during the wet season in Bangladesh.[6] In our study
and Boehm et al.’s, the prevalence of viruses on child hands
was low (<10%), although the studies investigated different
viruses. In the control and sanitation arms, rotavirus was
detected in 5.7 and 6.5% of child hands in the earlier
Bangladesh study and norovirus was detected in ≈4% of child
hands in our study.
Intervention Impact. Overall, the use of the sanitation
intervention in the WASH Benefits trial was not sufficient to
reduce fecal contamination in the household environment, as
evidenced by the similar prevalence of pathogen genes and
microbial source tracking markers in both the sanitation and
control study arms. This finding is consistent with the results
of a previously published indicator bacteria study that found no
difference between indicator E. coli concentrations in


-----

tubewells, ponds, stored water, food, soil, and on child hands
and flies in the sanitation arm compared to those in the control
arm.[13] One possible explanation provided was that the
observed concentrations of indicator E. coli were occluded by
“naturalized” E. coli (E. coli naturally found in soil and water
that is not derived from fecal sources), which masked the effect
of the sanitation intervention. This is still a possibility,
although we also did not find a difference in the prevalence
of microbial source tracking markers and select pathogen genes
between the sanitation and control arms. Another suggested
hypothesis from the indicator E. coli study was that spread of
human feces, but not animal feces, was reduced by the
intervention. The authors reasoned that the indicator E. coli
detected could have come predominantly from animal feces,
which was still present in intervention households despite the
provision of sani-scoops. This is consistent with our finding
that the animal fecal marker was substantially more prevalent
than the human fecal marker among all sample types in our
study. However, given that we saw no significant differences in
the human fecal marker (HumM2) between the study arms,
apart from a borderline reduction on child hands, we conclude
that human fecal contamination was not substantially impacted
by the sanitation intervention. Similarly, there was no
difference between the prevalence of the animal fecal marker
(BacCow) between the two arms except for a small difference
in the prevalence on child hands, suggesting no intervention
impact on animal fecal contamination.
The WASH Benefits study reported a lower prevalence of
childhood diarrhea in households in the sanitation arm,[18] while
our study found few significant differences in the prevalence of
pathogens or fecal indicators in environmental samples
collected from a subset of these same households. We expected
that because the prevalence of diarrhea was lower in the
sanitation arm, containment of feces was better and therefore
fewer pathogens would be present in the household environment. One possible explanation for why we did not measure a
difference is that pathogen detection limits were too high,
resulting in many false negatives and insufficient sensitivity to
detect a difference between the two arms. In other words, our
study may not have detected whether some of these samples
(false negatives) contained pathogen concentrations sufficient
to exceed the minimum infective dose. For example, WASH
Benefits measured protozoan pathogens in the stool of study
participants and found a 25% reduction in the prevalence of
Giardia infections in the sanitation arm.[39] However, we did not
observe a similar reduction in the prevalence of Giardia in
environmental reservoirs. The concentration of Giardia in
environmental samples is much lower than in the stool of
infected individuals, which could have resulted in lower
sensitivity to detect a difference in the environmental samples.
Another possibility to explain the discrepancy between the
prevalence of diarrhea and pathogens in environmental
samples is that we did not measure all pathogens that could
be etiological agents of diarrhea. Our study focused on
pathogenic E. coli, Giardia, and norovirus, but rotavirus,
Shigella, Aeromonas, and Campylobacter jejuni are other possible
etiological agents of disease in Bangladesh.[40] Also, we did not
measure pathogen genes and microbial source tracking markers
on fomites or food which could be dominant reservoirs for
enteric pathogen transmission.[41] The duration between latrine
construction and sample collection (16−35 months) should
have been sufficiently long for fecal associated organisms and
nucleic acids present before construction to degrade in


environmental reservoirs, including soil.[42][−][45] Therefore, it is
unlikely the genes detected in this study persisted from before
the intervention.
A benefit to the pathogenic E. coli detection method used in
this study is the enrichment step, which allowed us to detect
pathogenic E. coli genes likely from viable organisms. However,
there are some limitations to this and the other detection
methods used and these could influence the measured impact
of the sanitation intervention. The method we used for
pathogenic E. coli was not quantitative, and a quantitative
method such as qPCR could have determined whether the
concentrations of pathogenic E. coli, not just prevalence, were
impacted in the trial. However, using qPCR does not guarantee
that quantitative results will be produced, as occurred in this
study. Despite using qPCR to detect norovirus, Giardia, and
HumM2, most of the results were below the limit of
quantification. The quantitative analysis of BacCow results in
stored water and soil was also impacted by a high proportion of
[nonquantitative samples in stored water and soil (Table S4),](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835/suppl_file/es9b04835_si_001.pdf)
which may have reduced the ability to detect a difference
between the study arms. Detection can be improved by
processing larger sample volumes; however, sample volumes
are constrained in the household setting. For example, stored
water samples are restricted to the volume that can be spared
at the time of collection and the logistical constraints of
transporting samples from the field to the lab. We were unable
to filter the targeted 500 mL from all households. This volume
was selected to reduce the lower detection limit (from the
standard 100 mL sample volume), but in some households,
less than 500 mL was available at the time of collection or in
other cases filters clogged before the full sample was filtered.
The variable filtration volumes resulted in variable detection
limits; however, the impact on detection limits was similar in
sanitation and control arms. Therefore, we do not believe that
this was a limitation in our ability to detect a difference
between arms. More effort is needed to develop methods with
lower detection limits compatible with complex environmental
samples. While there have been recent developments in
aptamer-based detection (nucleotides that bind to a target),
with potential for lower detection limits, very few have been
tested in environmental matrices.[46]

Our results are generally in agreement with a previous study
in rural India that found no reduction in pathogens and
microbial source tracking markers in household reservoirs
despite a 27% increase in latrine coverage.[16] One notable
finding in our study was a slightly lower (5%) prevalence of
BacCow on child hands in the sanitation arm, although the
prevalence was still high (100 versus 96% in control and
sanitation arms, respectively). However, the lower prevalence
of BacCow was not reflected in the difference in log10
concentration of BacCow on child hands. The lower
prevalence of BacCow could be due to the use of sani-scoops
for animal feces removal in 97% of the sanitation arm
households. We observed a lower prevalence of cow feces in
sanitation versus control compound courtyards (C, 36%; S,
27%), although poultry feces were still visible in 90% of
courtyards overall (Table 1). We also observed 89% lower
prevalence of st1b/lt1 genes (indicative of ETEC) in sanitation
versus control arm households with ≥10 individuals. More
research is needed to understand differences in sanitation
practices in households with more individuals, which could be
impacted by different social dynamics in larger families. It
should be noted that while our results are in agreement with


-----

previous rural studies, they may not be generalizable to more
urban settings.
Poor child and animal fecal management could be a main
reason we did not see lower fecal contamination in household
reservoirs in the sanitation arm. While there were more
children using a potty or latrine in the sanitation arm, it was
still just over half of the households (C: 13%; S: 56%).
Interestingly, the percent of households that reported hygienic
disposal of child feces in the sanitation arm is higher in this
study than the 21% of sanitation households that reported
disposing of child feces in a latrine approximately one year
prior.[15] Although this is a promising result and could be due to
more exposure to community promoters and children reaching
an appropriate age to use the latrine, there is still significant
room for improvement. Similar practices are also evident in the
management of animal feces. The animal fecal marker
(BacCow) was prevalent in all environmental reservoirs in
both study arms, and a concurrent study showed that increased
concentrations of BacCow were associated with the increased
prevalence of some pathogen genes on mother hands.[17]

Another reason we did not see the impact of the sanitation
intervention could be due to the compound scale of the
intervention. Intercompound transmission can occur through a
variety of pathways,[47] and pathogens can be transferred from
schools, neighboring compounds, agriculture fields, and other
places of work.
It is also possible that the quality of the latrine may not have
been sufficient to isolate human fecal contamination from the
household environment. The latrine improvements in this
study provided a hygienic barrier between feces and the
environment through the metrics evaluated such as functional
water seal and reduced flow from overfull pits or latrines
draining directly into the environment. However, Bangladesh
has a high water table and leakage from latrines into
groundwater is possible but was not measured in this
study.[48] It should be noted that the sanitation intervention
did not include specific procedures for pit emptying or
treatment offsite, although pit emptying is unlikely to be a
main source of exposure as very few pit latrines in the
sanitation arm were emptied during the study period (3%).
In this study, access to latrines in both arms was high (C:
98.7%; S: 100%), but the management of child and animal
feces was still incomplete. Modeling could be a useful tool to
estimate the impact of further improvements in the management of child and animal feces on the concentration of
pathogens in the environment and the prevalence of diarrhea
in children under five. Quantitative microbial risk assessment,
including exposure models,[41][,][49] can be combined with
pathogen measurements to predict the number of pathogens
children ingest in their household environment and estimate
the resulting prevalence of diarrhea. Our study provides an
opportunity to calibrate a model using actual data on
environmental pathogen concentrations and diarrheal prevalence. Other recent studies in Bangladesh can provide more
detailed information on child behavior and interactions with
the environment,[50][,][51] providing a foundation for exposure
models to investigate fecal contamination pathways that result
in pathogen ingestion by children in these households.
Previous work has taken a similar approach via calibrating a
QMRA model to field observations of diarrheal prevalence to
model the reduction in infection risk due to different levels of
use of household water treatment.[52][−][54] Modeling the impacts
of varying strategies of child and animal fecal management


interventions could be used to explore which interventions and
degree of compliance are needed to significantly reduce fecal
contamination levels in the household environment. Finally,
this study was not designed to measure fecal pathogen levels in
potential reservoirs outside of the household environment to
which children may be exposed such as open drains, fecal
sludge dumping sites, open defecation sites, and animal feces
for fertilizer. Additional research is needed to better understand exposure in public versus private realms.[41][,][55][,][56]
