Effectiveness of a combined sanitation and household-level piped water 
intervention on infrastructure coverage, availability and use, environmental fecal 
contamination, and child health in rural Odisha, India: a matched cohort study 

ver half of the almost 1 billion people who practice open defecation live in India. While 
access to community water sources has improved in rural India, few households have on- 
site piped water. Although a primary motivation for water, sanitation and hygiene 
improvements is associated improvements in health, there is mixed evidence of effective 
interventions, especially in India. 
household piped water connections were contingent on community-wide household toilet 
and bathing room construction, implemented in rural Odisha, India. Forty-five 
intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where the program was 
implemented, and matched to 45 control villages. We conducted surveys and 
observations, and collected stools and environmental samples (source water, drinking 
water, and rinses of children’s hands) between June 2015-October 2016 in households 
with a child under five (N=2398). Health surveillance included diarrhea, acute respiratory 
infection, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and anthropometry to assess undernutrition. 
Source water, drinking water, and children’s hands were assayed for fecal indicator 
bacteria, and select waterborne pathogens. 

ultilevel regression using generalized linear models was used to assess the effect of the 
intervention on WaSH coverage, availability and use; fecal environmental contamination; 
and child health. Compared to controls, intervention villages had substantially higher 
improved toilet coverage and use. Although the intervention was associated with higher 
access to piped water on the household premises, both study arms experienced 
intermittencies in water availability. Most source and drinking waters in both study arms 
were positive for E. coli, and there was no intervention effect on E. coli. in source water, 
drinking water, or on children’s hands. However, the intervention substantially reduced 
the prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in source water (aRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 
0.97). Similarly, there was no intervention effect on child diarrhea or respiratory 
infection. However, compared to the control, children in intervention villages had lower 
odds of helminthiasis (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.00) and improved HAZ (+0.17, 95% 
CI: 0.03-0.31). Future research should focus on the pathways through which these mixed 
effects on fecal environmental contamination and health outcomes occur.

the incredible opportunity of working on the Gram Vikas study, and whose humor and 
mentorship has encouraged me throughout the last few years; Joe Brown, for your insight 
and remarkable responsiveness; Howard Chang, for your thoughtful advice, 
encouragement, and patience with my many questions; Matt Freeman, for your 
mentorship not only during this study but throughout my time at Emory; and Amy 
Pickering, for your guidance and advice throughout the study from sample collection to 
data analysis.

Table 7.1. Planned future analyses within the Gram Vikas MANTRA study framework. An asterisk denotes those analyses I am 
leading or mentoring. 

1) Determine an EED factor solution for this study, 2) assess the effect of the intervention on each EED marker 
and factor solution, 3) assess EED markers/factor solution as mediators for HAZ, and 4) assess association 
between fecal environmental contamination and EED 


Direct and indirect effects of the 
intervention on health * 
Assess the direct and indirect effects of the intervention on child health via WaSH coverage, WaSH 
access/availability and WaSH use, including the intersecting contributions of the three water, sanitation and 
hygiene pathways 




Assess individual, household, community, and environmental risk factors for STH infection 
1. Assess association of household and community coverage and use of sanitation with undernutrition, and 2. 
determine whether there is sub-community clustering of sanitation coverage and use, and the association with 
undernutrition 
Intervention, dietary diversity, and 
undernutrition 
Assess whether the intervention acts through improved crop production and/or livestock ownership, to improve 
dietary diversity, and decrease undernutrition 

1. Assess potential for threshold or dose-response relationship between of sanitation coverage/use and health, and 
2) assess household and community WaSH behaviors as mediators of individual health 
Determinants of fecal environmental 
contamination * 
Assess individual, household, community, and environmental risk factors for fecal contamination of source water, 
drinking water, and children’s hands 

1. Quantitative microbial risk assessment for hands/drinking pathways by intervention and control study arm, 2. 
compare theorized and measured exposures between study arms, and 3. assess differences in exposure by child 
age and season

effectiveness 
Collective efficacy: exploratory 
Cost and cost-effectiveness 



1. Determine the intervention cost, and 2. calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for disease-specific 
DALYs averted and other averted social opportunity costs 
MHM and urogenital health 
Women's empowerment, food security 
and growth 
1. Determine the effect of the intervention on MHM, and 2. determine MHM effect on urogenital health 
1. Determine the effect of the intervention on women's empowerment and food security, and 2. assess women's 
empowerment as a mediator between intervention status and growth 

Sanitation insecurity, well-being and 
urogenital infection 
1. Assess the association between sanitation insecurity and anxiety/well-being, and 2. determine direct and 
indirect effects of sanitation insecurity on urogenital infection via anxiety/well-being 
 
 
 
Menstrual hygiene management, 
sanitation insecurity, and well-being

of the stools? 
What is the main source of drinking 
water for members of your household? 
[confirmed with observation] 
Currently, what is the main source of 
water used by your household for other 
purposes such as cooking, bathing and 
handwashing? What is that water 
source used for?
