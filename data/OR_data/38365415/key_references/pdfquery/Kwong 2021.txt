Improved sanitation has been hypothesized to reduce soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infec- 
tions by reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs/larvae in soil. We evalu- 
ated the effect of a randomized sanitation program (providing households with an improved 
dual-pit latrine, tools for child/animal feces management, and behavioral messaging) on 
reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in soil from household courtyards. 
We collected soil samples from 1405 households enrolled in the sanitation intervention (n = 
419) and control (n = 914) groups of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits) 
in rural Bangladesh approximately 2 years after the initiation of the interventions. We ana- 
lyzed samples for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm eggs by micros- 
copy. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and egg count ratio (ECR) to compare the 
prevalence of STH eggs and arithmetic and geometric mean egg counts for STH eggs per 
gram of soil in the sanitation and control arms. Among intervention households, latrines 
achieved high and sustained user uptake by adults while child open defecation remained 
common and most households did not dispose of child feces hygienically. In courtyard soil 
from control households, the prevalence of any STH eggs was 75.7% and the prevalence of 
any larvated STH eggs was 67.3%. A. lumbricoides was detected in 63.0% of control sam- 
ples and T. trichiura in 55.7% of control samples; hookworm was not detected in any sam- 
ple. In the control arm, the arithmetic mean egg count for any STH was 3.96 eggs/dry gram, 
while the geometric mean was 1.58 eggs/dry gram. There was no difference between the

1.05)) or mean egg counts (ECR = 0.08 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.26) for geometric mean and 0.07 
(95% CI: -0.22, 0.37) for arithmetic mean). Adjusted models gave similar results. A com- 
pound-level sanitation intervention that provided improved latrines and tools for disposal of 
child and animal feces did not have an impact on STH eggs in soil. In order to effectively 
reduce the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in the environment, sustained, wide- 
spread use of sanitation strategies to isolate and hygienically dispose of child and animal 
feces may need to complement traditional strategies for containment of adult human feces. 


Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections affect more than 1.5 billion people worldwide [1]. 
These infections include A. lumbricoides (roundworm), T. trichiura (whipworm), and Necator 
americanus, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworm) infections. The 
principal approach to mitigating the impact of STH infections is mass drug administration, 
often delivered through school-based programs or integrated into vaccination programs [2]. 
Anthelmintic benzimidazoles drugs such as albendazole and mebendazole are effective in reduc- 
ing STH infection [3,4]. The WHO recommends annual mass drug administration in areas 
where STH prevalence is 20% or more because rapid reinfection following treatment is common 
[5]. A systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that, 12 months post-treatment, the infec- 
tion prevalence can revert to 94% of pre-treatment levels for A. lumbricoides, 82% for T. tri- 
chiura and 57% for hookworms [6]. The frequent and widespread use of anthelmintic drugs 
may result in the emergence of drug resistance, which would substantially reduce the effective- 
ness of the limited number of drugs currently available for treatment of STH infections [2]. 

new hosts from ingesting STH eggs from the feces of infected individuals. Hence, sanitation 
improvements that interrupt environmental transmission cycles of STH may be critical to sus- 
tainably reduce the global burden of STH infections [7,8]. Two systematic reviews have found 
that households that reported access to and use of any sanitation facility had approximately

evaluated the effect of a randomized sanitation program (providing households with an

sanitation intervention arms of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits) in 
rural Bangladesh approximately 2 years after the initiation of the interventions. We analyzed 
samples for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm eggs by microscopy. 
We found no effect of the sanitation intervention on STH eggs in soil. In order to effectively

half the odds of STH infection compared to households with no reported availability or use of 
sanitation facilities [9,10]; however, this evidence was mostly based on observational studies of 
low quality. In rural India, Bangladesh, Kenya and Timor-Leste, randomized controlled trials 
of sanitation interventions providing on-site latrine access, alone or combined with water and 
hygiene interventions, have either found no effect on STH [11–13] or reductions in some but 
not other STH species [14–16]. In contrast, a study in urban Brazil found that increasing 
household connections to sewerage halved the prevalence of STH infections [17]. Sanitation 
interventions are hypothesized to reduce STH infection through reducing the prevalence and/ 
or concentration of STH eggs in the environment. However, there are little empirical data on 
the impact of sanitation interventions on this intermediate outcome [18]. 
The impact of sanitation interventions on environmental transmission of STH may be 
assessed by quantifying STH eggs in the soil, a necessary component of the STH life cycle. 
Unembryonated eggs of all three species are passed in stool and incubate in soil. A. lumbri- 
coides and T. trichiura eggs can survive in soil for months, becoming infective in 1–15 weeks 
[19]. Hookworm eggs, on the other hand, quickly hatch in soil; the larvae that hatch seek mois- 
ture and can survive for weeks and become infective within 2 weeks [19]. As such, it is more 
likely to find A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura eggs than hookworm eggs in the soil. Egg survival 
is longer in warm and moist environments without direct sunlight [19,20]. 

etation [20]. STH eggs have been detected in outdoor soil in various settings in South/South- 
east Asia [21–28], South America [29] and sub-Saharan Africa [30,31]. STH eggs have also 
been detected on floors inside homes in the Philippines [27] and in classrooms with soil floors 
in Nigeria [31]. These studies were mostly descriptive, and sample sizes were relatively small, 
ranging from 15 [29] to 330 [28] people. One study assessed the effect of a randomized sanita- 
tion intervention on STH eggs in environmental reservoirs in rural Kenya and found no effect 
[18]. 
Here, we examine the effect of a randomized sanitation intervention on the presence and 
concentration of STH eggs in courtyard soil in rural Bangladeshi households. We conducted 
this study among a subset of households enrolled in a cluster-randomized controlled trial 
(WASH Benefits Bangladesh, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01590095) that measured the 
impact of individual and combined water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition interventions on 
linear growth, cognitive development, and enteric disease, including STH infections, in young 
children [32]. The trial also measured pathogens and indicators of fecal contamination in the 
environment in a subset of enrolled households as intermediate outcomes between the inter- 
ventions and child health outcomes. 
Methods 
Ethics statement 
Participants provided written informed consent in the local language. The study protocol was 
approved by the Ethical Review Committee at The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease 
Research, Bangladesh (PR-11063), the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the 
University of California, Berkeley (2011-09-3652), and the institutional review board at Stan- 
ford University (25863). 

In Bangladesh, the WASH Benefits trial enrolled participants in four rural districts. Eight preg- 
nant women in their second or third trimester who lived in nearby households were grouped 
into clusters and eight adjacent clusters were grouped into a block. Clusters were block- 




randomized into one of six intervention arms or a double-sized control arm. The intervention 
arms consisted of single and combined water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions. 
This study involved households in the control and sanitation arms of the WASH Benefits trial. 
The prevalence of STH infection among children aged 2–12 years old in the control arm 
was 36.8% for A. lumbricoides, 9.2% for hookworm, and 7.5% for T. trichiura [16]. Bangladesh 
has conducted school-based deworming for school-aged children and immunization-based 
deworming for pre-school-aged children with mebendazole two times per year since 2008 
[33]. A 2010 evaluation of the 2009 mass drug administration campaign in two districts of Ban- 
gladesh found that for children aged 5–14 years old treatment coverage for one of the twice- 
annual campaigns was 46–54% depending on district and campaign month [33]. Among chil- 
dren aged 4–12 years old enrolled in WASH Benefits, 74% of children in the sanitation arm 
and 70% of children in the control arm were reported to have received deworming within the 
last six months [16]. 

The compound-level sanitation intervention included upgrading or replacing existing latrines 
with improved latrines that were lined with concrete rings and had two pits so that after the 
first pit filled, the superstructure could be moved to a second pit while the contents of the first 
pit were left to undergo natural inactivation of pathogens such as STH eggs. The intervention 
also included potties for young children, and sani-scoop hoes to remove animal and child 
feces from households and courtyards. Households in Bangladesh are clustered in multi-family 
compounds that share a central courtyard; each household in compounds with study house- 
holds received a latrine upgrade, potty and sani-scoop. Locally recruited community health 
promoters visited households in the intervention group at least twice a month to deliver sanita- 
tion-related behavior change communication focused on safe management of human and ani- 
mal feces. Promoters did not visit control households. 

Structured observations of intervention uptake were conducted by WASH Benefits staff mem- 
bers as part of the intervention uptake assessment, approximately 15 months after the interven- 
tion delivery and 9 months before our STH assessment [34]. At this timepoint, adults were 
observed to use a hygienic latrine, defined as a latrine with a functional water seal and no feces 
visible on the latrine slab or floor, in 94% of sanitation-arm households and 40% of control-arm 
households [34]. However, open defecation by children and unhygienic child feces management 
remained prevalent. The percentage of children reported to defecate in the open was 81% among 
children 0–2 years old, 37% among children 3–7 years old, and 9% among children 8–14 years 
old in the sanitation arm; prevalence of open defecation was similar among children in the con- 
trol arm [16]. Open defecation by children commonly occurred in the compound courtyard and 
child feces were typically disposed of unhygienically, i.e., thrown into bushes, open waste heaps 
and drains, or left on the ground [35]. Households were observed to unhygienically dispose of 
child feces in 64% of sanitation-arm households and 84% of control-arm households [34]. 
Hence, human feces were observed in 21% of sanitation-arm compounds and 30% of control- 
arm compounds [34]. Further details of the trial design, intervention delivery, and uptake assess- 
ments have been described elsewhere [34,36–38]. 

Soil was collected from a random subset of households enrolled in the sanitation or control 
arms of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial from May 2015 to April 2016. From 1991–2020, 




the average rainfall ranged from a low of 7.4 mm in January to 498.0 mm in August [39]. Data 
collection followed the order of intervention roll-out among participating households so that 
samples were collected approximately 24 months after initiation of interventions in each 
household. Data collection spanned one year, allowing for comparison of samples collected in 
the wet and dry seasons. 
Field staff sampled courtyard soil from the area just in front of the entrance of the enrolled 
household [18]. Previous work has found STH eggs concentration in soil to be similar in front 
of the household entrance and the latrine entrance [30]. Field staff marked a 30 x 30 cm area 
using an ethanol-disinfected metal stencil and used an ethanol-disinfected metal trowel to 
scrape the area once horizontally and once vertically to collect approximately 50 g of topsoil in 
a sterile Whirlpak bag. Samples were transported on ice to the field laboratory of the Interna- 
tional Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh and processed within one day to 
quantify eggs of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm using a protocol adapted from 
the USEPA method for enumerating A. lumbricoides eggs in fecal sludge [40,41]. The adapted 
protocol demonstrated a recovery efficiency of 73% for A. lumbricoides eggs in laboratory 
experiments [41]. As the method was optimized to detect A. lumbricoides, the recovery effi- 
ciencies for other STH species were likely lower. 
In brief, a 15 g soil aliquot was soaked overnight in 1% 7X detergent solution (MP Biomedi- 
cals, Irvine, CA), then hand-shaken for 2 minutes and vortexed on 2000 rpm for 15 seconds to 
dislodge STH eggs from soil particles. The solution was poured through a 50-mesh sieve to 
remove large soil particles. The supernatant was left to settle for 30 minutes and then aspirated 
without disturbing the soil at the bottom. Approximately 40 mL of 1% 7X solution was added 
to the precipitate and the solution was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes; the supernatant 
was discarded. 5 mL of zinc sulfate flotation solution (1.25 specific gravity) was added to the 
precipitate, vortexed for 30 seconds, centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant 
was saved; this procedure was conducted a total of three times. The combined supernatant 
from the three flotation steps was filtered through a 500-mesh sieve to capture STH eggs. The 
sieve was rinsed into a Falcon tube using distilled water, the rinse water was centrifuged at 
1000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed with a pipette until there was 1 mL left at 
the bottom of the tube. 25 mL of 0.1 N sulfuric acid solution was added to the tube. The tube 
was capped loosely and incubated at 28˚ C for 28 days to allow viable eggs to develop larvae. At 
the end of the incubation period, the solution was centrifuged at 1000 g for 3 min and aspi- 
rated to a final volume of 1 mL. The 1 mL solution was transferred to a Sedgewick-Rafter slide 
and examined under the microscope for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm eggs 
using a visual identification chart to distinguish the type of egg and whether it was larvated or 
non-larvated [41]. The numbers of larvated and non-larvated eggs for each species were 
recorded separately to differentiate viable and non-viable eggs. An additional 5 g soil aliquot 
was oven-dried overnight to determine moisture content and dry weight. 
For quality control, a laboratory blank was processed once every other day by repeating the 
protocol without a soil sample. 10% of samples were processed twice, with the second sample 
referred to as the technical replicate. 10% of samples were counted by two independent analysts 
to assess interrater reliability. Additionally, for each sample, lab technicians took a picture of the 
first occurrence of each type of egg (larvated A. lumbricoides, non-larvated A. lumbricoides etc.); 
the pictures were reviewed for accuracy of categorization by study investigators (LHK, AE). 

Internal pilot data from the first 100 samples in the control arm found that the prevalence of 
eggs in soil was 67% for A. lumbricoides, 36% for T. trichiura and 78% for either one of the 




species; hookworm was not detected, potentially because fragile hookworm eggs degraded 
while the sample was soaked in detergent overnight or during other processing steps. The pilot 
data were used to calculate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) by geographical area of 
0.05 for A. lumbricoides and 0.26 for T. trichiura. Based on the daily processing capacity of the 
lab, we aimed to sample 1500 compounds. This sample size allowed a minimum detectable rel- 
ative reduction in prevalence between arms (with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05) of 
13% for A. lumbricoides, 33% for T. trichiura and 10% for any STH. 

Full replication of blinded analysis was conducted by two authors (LHK and AE) according to 
the pre-specified analysis plan (https://osf.io/6u7cn/). We calculated the prevalence of total 
and larvated eggs in soil for each species (A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm), for any 
STH, and for multiple species of STH. We calculated the concentration of STH in soil for each 
species and for any STH. Prevalence was defined as the presence of STH eggs of the specified 
species, and concentration was defined the number of eggs of the specified species per dry 
gram of soil. 

count ratio (ECR) between the sanitation and control arms. PD was defined as the difference 
in the prevalence and PR as the ratio of the prevalence in the sanitation vs. control arm. ECR 
was defined as the ratio of egg counts in the sanitation vs. control arm minus 1 such that values 
<0 indicate a reduction in the sanitation arm. We calculated ECRs using both arithmetic and 
geometric means. Arithmetic means are more sensitive to high infection intensities that are 
associated with higher morbidity burden and higher likelihood of transmission; geometric 
means are less sensitive to extreme data points that skew arithmetic means [4,42,43]. Geomet- 
ric means were calculated by taking the natural log of the egg count values after replacing 
counts of 0 eggs per gram [epg] with 0.5 epg. Technical replicates (the second aliquot of a sam- 
ple analyzed) were dropped from the analysis. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted inten- 
tion-to-treat effects using the R (version 3.3.2) package for targeted maximum likelihood 
estimation with SuperLearner; SuperLearner is an algorithm that uses cross-validation to test 
and weight multiple machine learning models to optimize predictive accuracy [44,45]. We 
used robust standard errors that accounted for clustering. We defined a result as significant if 
the corresponding 95% confidence intervals did not cross 1 for prevalence and egg count ratios 
or 0 for prevalence differences. 

tion, and hygiene characteristics across arms [36] (Table 1), bias due to confounding due to 
these factors is unlikely. Additionally, adjustments are unlikely to substantially improve the 
precision of binary outcomes such as prevalence [46]. Hence, we report unadjusted effect esti- 
mates as our primary parameters. Secondary adjusted analyses accounted for the lab staff 
member who processed or counted the sample, sampling month, soil moisture content, moth- 
er’s education level (stratified into no education, primary or secondary), degree of household 
food insecurity, number of children <18 years in the household, total number of individuals 
living in the compound, reported time to the household’s primary drinking water source, 
housing materials (floor, walls, roof), presence of electricity, and household assets (a table, 
chair, wardrobe, bed, stool, clock, radio, landline phone, mobile phone, working black/white 
or color TV, working refrigerator, adult bicycle, motorcycle, sewing machine). Covariates 
were included in the adjusted analysis if bi-variate models using the likelihood ratio test indi- 
cated that the covariate was associated with the outcomes (p<0.2). Categorical covariates that 
occurred in <5% of the sample were excluded from models.

factors and the load of STH eggs potentially entering the environment: 1) wet season (Jun- 
Oct) vs. dry season (Nov-May); 2) number of individuals living in the compound (<10 vs. 
�10); 3) reported deworming of children in the compound within the prior 6 months (<2/3 
vs. �2/3 dewormed); and 4) reported deworming of children in the cluster (8 nearby study 
compounds) within the prior 6 months (<2/3 vs. �2/3 dewormed). The cut-off values for 
number of individuals living in the compound and proportion of children dewormed corre- 
spond to the median of the empirical data across both arms. 
Results 
STH prevalence and concentration in soil 
We sampled courtyard soil from 914 control and 491 intervention households. Randomization 
led to very good covariate balance across arms among the subset of sampled households 
(Table 1). Few households had animals that can spread STH by passage after consuming 
human feces (pigs, dogs) and/or are known hosts for the STH species we investigated (A. lum- 
bricoides in pigs, A. ceylanicum in dogs and cats). During all 8 rounds of surveillance, at most 
4/750 households (0.5%) owned one or more pigs and 8/750 households (1.1%) owned one or 
more cats or dogs. Within the control arm, the prevalence of total eggs (larvated or non-lar- 
vated) was 63.0% for A. lumbricoides and 55.7% for T. trichiura; hookworm was not detected

in any sample and therefore hookworm data is omitted from all presentations of results (Fig 
1). Considering only A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, the prevalence of any STH eggs was 
75.7% and the prevalence of multiple species of STH eggs was 43.0%. The prevalence of lar- 
vated (i.e., viable) STH eggs was 54.9% for A. lumbricoides and 46.2% for T. trichiura (Fig 1). 
The prevalence of any larvated STH eggs was 67.3% and the prevalence of multiple species of 
larvated STH eggs was 33.8%. The arithmetic and geometric mean counts of total and larvated 
eggs per gram dry soil are shown in Fig 2. 
Quality control assessment found the two-way, mixed, agreement, single-measures intra- 
class correlation was 0.969 for samples processed in replicate and 0.995 for egg counts of the 
same slide enumerated by different technicians (excellent correlation). There was 0% contami- 
nation in blanks. 

The sanitation intervention had no significant impact on the prevalence in soil of total A. lum- 
bricoides eggs (PR = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88–1.06)), T. trichiura eggs (PR = 1.03 (95% CI: 0.92, 
1.15)), any STH eggs (PR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.05) or multiple species of STH eggs (PR = 1.03 
(95% CI: 0.90–1.19)) (Fig 1). Similarly, the sanitation intervention had no significant impact on 
the prevalence in soil of larvated A. lumbricoides eggs, larvated T. trichiura eggs, any larvated 
STH eggs, or multiple species of larvated STH eggs (Fig 1). The sanitation intervention also did 
not reduce the arithmetic or geometric mean egg count for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, or any 
STH for total or larvated eggs (Fig 2). Results from adjusted analyses were consistent with unad- 
justed analyses and showed no significant differences in prevalence or concentration of STH 
eggs between the intervention and control arms (Tables A and B in S1 Appendix).

(n = 914) and sanitation (n = 491) arms. 






The prevalence of T. trichiura was significantly higher in the dry season (61% (95% CI: 57, 65)) 
compared to the wet season (40% (95% CI: 32, 49)) while the prevalence of A. lumbricoides 
was not significantly different between the seasons (Table C in S1 Appendix). There were no 
significant differences in the prevalence of larvated eggs across seasons. The concentration of 
STH eggs was also higher in the dry season than the wet season; the arithmetic mean egg count 
per gram dry soil for A. lumbricoides was 2.71 epg (95% CI: 2.06, 3.36) in the dry season and 
1.20 epg (95% CI: 0.87, 1.53) in the wet season; for T. trichiura the mean egg count was 1.98 
epg (95% CI: 1.51, 2.44) in the dry season and 0.57 epg (95% CI: 0.37, 0.77) in the wet season 
(Table D in S1 Appendix). Seasonal trends were similar for geometric means (Table D in S1 
Appendix). Neither the prevalence nor the concentration of total or larvated eggs significantly 
differed by number of individuals in the compound, or reported deworming status of children 
in the compound or cluster (Tables C and D in S1 Appendix). 
Subgroup analyses on the effect of the sanitation intervention by season, number of individ- 
uals living in the compound, and reported deworming status of children in the compound and 
cluster in the prior six months showed no significant differences between the intervention and 
control arms in prevalence or concentration of STH eggs in soil in any subgroup, consistent 
with the primary analysis using data from all samples (Figs 3, 4 and Fig A and Table E-H in S1 
Appendix). We observed modest reductions of borderline significance in the prevalence of A. 
lumbricoides in the sanitation vs. control groups when �2/3 of children in the compound were 
dewormed (PR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.04)) or when �2/3 of children in the cluster were 
dewormed (PR = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.02)). 

We have demonstrated that nearly three-quarters (75.7%) of courtyard soil samples were con- 
taminated with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura eggs in rural Bangladeshi households, with two- 
thirds (67.3%) of samples contaminated with larvated eggs that are expected to be infectious. 
Among households in the sanitation arm, where adults regularly used hygienic latrines but 
only a third of households safely disposed of child feces [34,47], the prevalence and concentra- 
tion of total or larvated A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura eggs in courtyard soil was not signifi- 
cantly lower compared to households in the control arm. 
The prevalence of STH eggs we found in courtyard soil were on the higher end of estimates 
from other settings. In other studies, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides in soil ranged from 6% 
in Thailand [28] to 61% in Nigeria [31], and prevalence of T. trichiura in soil ranged from 6% 
in Nepal [25] to 41% in the Philippines [27]. While other studies have found that the preva- 
lence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura in the soil was higher during the wet season than the 
dry season [25,27,28], we found that the prevalence of A. lumbricoides was not significantly dif- 
ferent between seasons, and the prevalence and concentration of T. trichiura was higher dur- 
ing the dry season. 
In our study’s sister site (WASH Benefits Kenya), the prevalence of A. lumbricoides or T. tri- 
chiura in soil in front of households was 19% using the same sampling and enumeration proto- 
col [18]. The geometric mean of A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura eggs in our study (2 epg) was 
also higher than what was observed in Kenya (0.05 epg). This is consistent with the higher 
prevalence of STH infection in the study population in Bangladesh vs. Kenya and with the 
higher population density of Bangladesh, which would be expected to provide more opportu- 
nities for environmental contamination with STH eggs. In Bangladesh, 37% of children 
enrolled in the WASH Benefits trial were infected with A. lumbricoides and 8% with T. tri- 
chiura, with the geometric mean fecal egg count of 5.2 epg for A. lumbricoides and 0.4 epg for

T. trichiura [16]. In Kenya, 23% of enrolled children were infected with A. lumbricoides and 
1% with T. trichiura, with the geometric mean fecal egg count of 4.0 epg for A. lumbricoides 
and 0.5 epg for T. trichiura [14]. Differences in ambient and soil temperature, relative humid- 
ity, soil moisture and soil texture may also have increased the survival of STH eggs in the soil 
in Bangladesh compared to Kenya. Mean soil moisture during the study was 15.8% in Bangla- 
desh vs. 11.0% in Kenya [18]. 
Use of improved sanitation facilities would be expected to reduce environmental contami- 
nation with STH eggs by reducing open defecation and isolating feces from the environment 
until STH eggs have degraded. Given that approximately 30% of children <2 years old in the 
control and sanitation arms were infected with A. lumbricoides and 3–5% were infected with 
T. trichiura in our study population, continuing child open defecation and unsafe disposal of 
child feces in the sanitation arm could be a source of STH eggs to contaminate courtyards and 
contribute to the lack of impact on STH eggs in the environment from the sanitation 
intervention. 
Another reason for why the prevalence and concentration of A. lumbricoides and T. tri- 
chiura eggs was not significantly lower in the sanitation arm compared to the control arm 
could be that Bangladeshi households periodically build up the height of their courtyard and 
household floor using agricultural soil. This soil may have been contaminated by non-study 
households that lived in the same community as study households. The WASH Benefits trial 
only enrolled approximately 10% of households in a given geographical area (due to the trial’s 
eligibility criteria), and enrolled households were therefore surrounded by non-enrolled 
households that continued their day-to-day sanitation practices. Their sanitation practices 
may have contaminated the soil with soil-transmitted helminths. STH-contaminated soil may 
also have been carried on the soles of household members’ shoes or feet back to the courtyard 
soil of study households, but this practice on its own is unlikely to account for the high STH 
levels observed. 

coides in pigs, A. ceylanicum in dogs and cats). These domestic animals are uncommon in 
rural Bangladesh. However, the domestic animals that are present may distribute STH eggs 
across household courtyards by passage after coprophagia. In the control arm, 91% of house- 
holds had chickens, 69% had cows, and 39% had goats and/or sheep, and 56% households 
allows their animals to roam freely [48]. These animals may step on feces in the courtyard, in 
neighboring compounds, in agricultural fields or patches of bush, and then track STH eggs on 
their feet and hooves back to the courtyard where they stay. Additionally, animals may inten- 
tionally or inadvertently consume feces contaminated with STH eggs or food contaminated 
with soil that contains STH eggs and deposit these eggs in their own feces. After chickens were 
fed viable porcine A. lumbricoides (formerly known as A. suum) [49] and T. suis eggs, these 
eggs were recovered in their feces and, after embryonation in vermiculite, were able to cause 
infection in pigs [50]. The ten chickens studied passed through 61% of porcine A. lumbricoides 
and 42% of T. suis eggs they ingested. Twelve days after pigs had been inoculated with embryo- 
nated eggs that had passed through the chickens, 34% of porcine A. lumbricoides eggs and 82% 
of T. suis eggs were recovered from the pig feces [50]. This suggests that chickens may act as 
transfer hosts for STH species that are infective to humans. Animal feces were observed in 
85% of sanitation compounds and 92% of control compounds [34], indicating that animal 
feces, in addition to human feces, may contribute to the re-inoculation of soil with STH eggs. 
In future studies, use of molecular detection methods could distinguish STH species that com- 
monly infect animals from those that more commonly infect humans. 
Community-level, sustained sanitation and/or animal confinement interventions could 
prevent community-wide STH-contamination of soil, thereby limiting exposure to STH ova 




and larvae. We are not aware of any studies that have examined the impact of community- 
wide animal confinement interventions on STH in soil or STH infections in children. With 
regards to community-level human feces management, previous work has found mixed evi- 
dence on whether increased access to latrines is associated with reduced STH infection rates. 
An observational study in rural Ethiopia found that, after adjusting for individual, household, 
and community characteristics, hookworm prevalence was not associated with community- 
level latrine usage (defined as the proportion of households in a cluster that had observed indi- 
cators of latrine use such as a defined path to a latrine and feces observed in the latrine pit) 
[51]. In the same study, T. trichiura prevalence and A. lumbricoides prevalence were higher in 
communities where community latrine usage was �60% vs. <20%. Household latrine usage 
did not modify the effect of community latrine usage for hookworm or T. trichiura prevalence. 
In communities with latrine usage �80%, children in households with a latrine in use had a 
significantly lower prevalence of A. lumbricoides compared to children in households without 
a latrine. In contrast, in communities with sanitation coverage <20%, children in households 
with a latrine in use had a significantly higher prevalence of A. lumbricoides compared to chil- 
dren in households without a latrine. The authors posited that higher community latrine usage 
may be associated with urbanization, which has been associated with increased STH preva- 
lence and may not have been fully accounted for by including population density in their mod- 
els. They also suggested that A. lumbricoides prevalence in communities with low coverage of 
latrines may be driven by increased latrine sharing. In India, a cluster-randomized trial of 
latrine promotion and construction found that 46% of people in the intervention arm had 
access to a functional latrine at the end of the trial compared to 15% of people in the control 
arm. Despite this, the intervention had no effect on the prevalence or intensity of hookworm, 
A. lumbricoides, or T. trichiura infections [11]. In an observational study in Vietnam, 98% of 
households had latrines, but infection with STH was 58% for hookworm, 45% for T. trichiura, 
and 14% for A. lumbricoides [52]. One hypothesis for this finding was that households in this 
community use fresh night soil as fertilizer. These finding suggest that the impact of commu- 
nity-wide sanitation may be mediated by factors such as household latrine use, latrine sharing, 
and use of human fecal waste for fertilization, and confounded by factors such as urbanization. 
Our finding that the sanitation intervention did not significantly reduce prevalence or con- 
centration of STH eggs in courtyard soil compared to the control arm is consistent with find- 
ings from the WASH Benefits trial that the prevalence of A. lumbricoides infection in children 
was not significantly different in the sanitation vs. control arms [16]. This could indicate that 
persistent A. lumbricoides eggs in soil continued to infect children in the sanitation arm, that 
infected children continued to contaminate the soil in the sanitation arm, or a combination of 
both. In contrast, the WASH Benefits trial found a 29% reduction in T. trichiura infection in 
children in the sanitation vs. control arms. However, this could be a chance finding as there 
was no significant reduction of T. trichiura infection in the other trial arms that included a san- 
itation component [16]. Our findings of no difference in the prevalence or concentration of 
T. trichiura in soil between the sanitation and control arms supports the possibility that the 
observed reduction in T. trichiura infection in the sanitation arm could be a chance finding. 
Our findings are also consistent with other environmental measurements conducted among 
trial households showing no reduction in E. coli contamination or bacterial, viral and proto- 
zoan pathogens in soil (or other types of environmental samples) between the sanitation and 
control arms [53,54]. A parallel study nested within the WASH Benefits Kenya trial also found 
no reduction in STH eggs in soil from the sanitation intervention [18]. Consistent with the the- 
ory that water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions are more effective when coupled with 
mass drug administration [13], our pre-specified subgroup analyses showed that the sanitation 
intervention had a modest reduction effect on STH eggs in soil in clusters and compounds in 




which �2/3 of children were dewormed. We cannot rule out the role of chance in these find- 
ings as the effects were borderline and multiple subgroup analyses increase the likelihood of 
chance findings. 
One limitation of this study is that we were unable to recover hookworm eggs from the soil 
and therefore cannot draw conclusions about their presence in the environment. The WASH 
Benefits trial found a borderline 24% reduction in hookworm infection in children in the sani- 
tation arm [16]; we could not assess the effect of the sanitation intervention on hookworm 
eggs in soil as we did not detect any. Detection of hookworm eggs in soil has been reported in 
only two studies; of 345 total samples in these studies, hookworm eggs were detected in three 
samples [27,28]. The inability of other studies to detect hookworm eggs in soil indicates that 
these three samples may have had eggs of other species misclassified as hookworm. It is possi- 
ble that hookworm eggs degraded during our sample processing steps. In order to assess the 
prevalence and concentration of hookworm in soil, hookworm larvae (rather than eggs) can 
be recovered from soil samples. One study successfully used damp gauze pads placed on the 
soil surface to recover hookworm larvae [21]. A related limitation is that our method was opti- 
mized for the recovery of A. lumbricoides eggs from soil [41] and the recovery efficiency of T. 
trichiura eggs is unknown. While this does not affect the estimated effect of the sanitation 
intervention on T. trichiura eggs in soil, it influences the interpretation of the prevalence and 
concentration of T. trichiura we observed in soil. Finally, we relied on microscopy to quantify 
STH eggs. Microscopic inspection is vulnerable to misclassification of STH eggs [55,56], and 
has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to DNA-based diagnostics [57,58]. Future work 
to validate DNA-based methods for detection of STH in soil could improve the reliability of 
future studies and allow for inclusion of more fragile STH species, such as hookworm. 

scoops for feces disposal was not effective in reducing the prevalence and concentration of 
STH eggs in courtyard soil in rural Bangladesh. Access to and use of latrines by adults was 
insufficient to prevent feces from contaminating the domestic environment when the majority 
of young children continued to practice open defecation in the household courtyard and the 
feces of children and animals were not disposed of hygienically. In order to effectively reduce 
the transmission of STH infections in low-resource contexts, interventions may need to focus 
on widespread access to and use of hardware for hygienic disposal of child and animal feces in 
addition to adult feces.
