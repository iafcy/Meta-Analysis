sı Supporting Information 

The causal relationship between flies and disease has been 
hypothesized for centuries and understood since the germ 
theory of disease developed in the 1800s.1−4 Synanthropic filth 
flies�including houseflies (Musca domestica) and green bottle 
flies (Lucilia sericata)�feed on feces and can transport enteric 
pathogens in their alimentary canal and on their body.1−4 
When a fly lands on food�or any other surface�it may 
vomit, defecate, or transfer enteric pathogens from its body 
onto the surface.2,3 These mechanisms enable flies to serve as 
vectors 
for pathogenic viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and 
helminths, which all may survive passage through the 
alimentary canal.2,3 Some bacteria may even proliferate in 
the fly gut5,6 and in fly regurgitate.7 The presence of enteric 
pathogens in food�via flies as a vector�then poses an 
infection risk to individuals upon consumption. This environ- 
mentally mediated transmission pathway is one of several 
enteric pathogen pathways,8,9 though flies remain understudied 
compared to other pathways such as drinking water.10,11 
Some onsite sanitation technologies, such as ventilated 
latrines (VIPs) and pour-flush systems, use 
improved pit 
physical barriers that reduce opportunities for flies to breed. In 
a properly constructed VIP, the inside of the superstructure 
remains dark, and newly hatched flies will be attracted to the 
light in the ventilation pipe.12 A mesh screen at the top of the 
ventilation pipe prevents their escape; flies that cannot escape 
will die. Pour-flush systems may contain a water seal, which, if 
present, serves as a physical barrier between flies and the fecal 
material in the pit. Reduced access to breeding locations in the 
living environment may reduce fly counts and subsequently 
reduce the potential for flies to transport enteric pathogens 
from fecal wastes to the living environment.

ABSTRACT: Synanthropic filth flies transport enteric pathogens 
from feces to food, which upon consumption poses an infection 
risk. We evaluated the effect of an onsite sanitation intervention� 
including fly control measures�in Maputo, Mozambique, on the 
infection from consuming fly-contaminated food. After 
risk of 
enumerating flies at intervention and control sites, we cultured 
fecal 
indicator bacteria, quantified gene copies for 22 enteric 
pathogens via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR), and developed quantitative microbial risk 
assessment (QMRA) models to estimate annual risks of infection 
attributable to fly-contaminated foods. We found that 
the 
intervention reduced fly counts at latrine entrances by 69% (aRR 
= 0.31, [0.13, 0.75]) but not at food preparation areas (aRR = 0.92, 
[0.33, 2.6]). Half of (23/46) of individual flies were positive for culturable Escherichia coli, and we detected ≥1 pathogen gene from 
45% (79/176) of flies, including enteropathogenic E. coli (37/176), adenovirus (25/176), Giardia spp. (13/176), and Trichuris 
trichiura (12/176). We detected ≥1 pathogen gene from half the flies caught in control (54%, 30/56) and intervention compounds 
(50%, 17/34) at baseline, which decreased 12 months post-intervention to 43% (23/53) at control compounds and 27% (9/33) for 
intervention compounds. These data indicate flies as a potentially important mechanical vector for enteric pathogen transmission in 
this setting. The intervention may have reduced the risk of fly-mediated enteric infection for some pathogens, but infrequent 
detection resulted in wide confidence intervals; we observed no apparent difference in infection risk between groups in a pooled 
estimate of all pathogens assessed (aRR = 0.84, [0.61, 1.2]). The infection risks posed by flies suggest that the design of sanitation 
systems and service delivery should include fly control measures to prevent enteric pathogen transmission.

Large controlled trials of water, sanitation, and hygiene13−16 
found mixed effects of WASH interventions on children’s 
health outcomes. An intermediate outcome of some of these 
trials was to assess the impact of WASH interventions on 
enteric pathogens in the environment, and several studies 
measured the impact of these interventions on fecal indicator 
bacteria or pathogens in environmental matrices.17−23 Out- 
come variables to assess a WASH intervention’s impact have 
tended to include the binary presence of a target or its 
concentration in a specific environmental matrix. However, the 
risk of infection from environmental hazards is mediated by 
human behaviors, pathogen concentrations, and pathogen- 
specific dose−response relationships.24 Quantitative microbial 
risk assessment (QMRA)�a mechanistic framework for 
estimating health outcomes (e.g., infection and illness) using 
microbial measurements, exposure assessment, and pathogen- 
specific dose−response models�offers an alternative approach 
that considers how these additional factors influence trans- 
mission. Such an approach offers the potential for a more 
nuanced understanding of the interactions between WASH 
fecal contamination in the environment, and 
interventions, 
children’s health outcomes compared to epidemiological 
methods. 
Community-scale insecticide application reduced childhood 
diarrhea by 24% in rural Gambia25 and 23% in Pakistan.26 A 
study of US military bases found intensive fly control via baited 
traps reduced clinic visits attributable to diarrhea by 42% and 
Shigella seroconversion by 76%.27 Unlike these community- 
wide interventions, onsite sanitation typically exists at the 
household level, and interventions may only target a subset of 
the population. In low-income informal settlements where 
onsite sanitation predominates, flies may be highly mobile 
between fecal wastes, food for human consumption, and other 
household surfaces. Flies can not only travel several kilometers 
in a single day but may also remain near common feeding 
locations, such as a pit latrine, for several days.2 It is then 
unclear if onsite sanitation interventions can reduce exposures 
to human food contaminated by flies. Our research aims were 
to (1) evaluate the enteric pathogen profile carried by flies in 
Maputo, Mozambique; (2) assess if a localized shared onsite 
sanitation reduced fly densities at latrine entrances and food 
preparation areas; and (3) estimate the impact of 
the 
intervention on a person’s annual risk of 
infection from 
consuming fly-contaminated food compared to a control 
group. 

Study Setting. The Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) Trial 
was a controlled before-and-after trial that evaluated the effect 
of an urban onsite sanitation intervention on child health 
outcomes.16 The trial took place in low-income, 
informal 
neighborhoods 
in Maputo, Mozambique, where WASH 
conditions are poor and the burden of enteric disease is 
high.16,17 A nongovernmental organization delivered the 
intervention to compounds, which were occupied by multiple 
households that shared sanitation and a common outdoor 
living space. Sanitation facilities 
in poor condition at 
intervention compounds were replaced with shared pour- 
flush toilets that included septic tanks and soak-away pits. 
These intervention systems were built inside the compound 
boundary and were part of the households’ living environment. 
Neighborhood-level coverage was not the intention of the 
intervention; approximately 6% (n = 8601/145,000) of 
neighborhood residents received the intervention.28 The 
intervention infrastructure contained physical barriers� 
including mesh netting over ventilation pipes and water-seal 
toilets�that reduced the potential for flies to breed in the fecal 
sludge in the septic tank. Control compounds were 
concurrently enrolled from the same or adjacent neighbor- 
hoods as intervention compounds and continued using existing 
shared sanitation. Detailed descriptions of the inclusion criteria 
and the sanitation intervention are described elsewhere.16,28 
Sample Collection. We collected flies at latrine entrances 
and food preparation areas using sticky traps29 (Text S1) from 
a convenience sample of 50 control and 50 intervention 
compounds at baseline (pre-intervention) and 12 months 
following delivery of the intervention (median difference = 383 
interquartile range = 372, 405). Enumerators hung 
days, 
individual 
rectangular blue sticky traps (pre-intervention: 
Suterra, Bend, Oregon; post-intervention: Great Lakes IPM, 
Vestaburg, Michigan) at least 1.5 m off the ground and within 
one meter of the latrine entrance and the food preparation 
area. Approximately 24 h later, the enumerator returned and 
the 
recorded the number of flies on each trap. Then, 
enumerator carefully removed each fly from the trap using 
tweezers that were sterilized with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol 
between compounds but not between flies. All flies caught in 
the traps were collected into Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, Fort 
Atkinson, WI) pre-intervention and into sterile 15 mL 
centrifuge tubes (VWR, Radnor, PA) post-intervention. Flies 
were stored on ice and transported to laboratories at the 
Ministry of Health in Maputo, Mozambique. Samples were 
deposited into a freezer at −80 °C on the same day as 
collection. Some flies remained frozen at the Mozambican 
Ministry of Health for analysis, and the remainder were 
shipped from Maputo, Mozambique, to Atlanta, Georgia, on 
dry ice (−80 °C) with temperature monitoring for later 
molecular analysis. 
Escherichia coli Culture. We randomly selected 46 flies 
collected at baseline to measure the fecal indicator bacteria E. 
coli (Figure S1) following storage at −80 °C for approximately 
4 years. We placed them into sterile tubes, determined the 
mass of each fly, crushed flies using a sterile disposable pestle 
(Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ), added 3 mL of sterile 
phosphate buffered saline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO), 
manually shook the tubes for 2 min, and then waited for 10 
min for the solids to settle.30 Next, we pipetted 1 mL of the 
supernatant onto E. coli-specific Compact Dry plates (Compact 
Dry EC, VWR, Vienna, Austria), then incubated the plates at 
37 °C for 24 h, and counted colony-forming units (CFUs). 
The remaining supernatant was stored at 4 °C, and if a plate 
was too numerous to count, the following day, the supernatant 
was diluted 1:100 and re-analyzed. Based on the manufac- 
turer’s instructions and the dilutions used, the lower limit of 
detection (LOD) was 3 CFU E. coli per fly, and the upper limit 
of detection was approximately 104 CFU E. coli per fly. We 
included one negative process control each day. 
Nucleic Acid Extraction. We aimed to extract nucleic 
acids from one fly per compound, for which we had flies 
available in Atlanta, Georgia. Given the heterogeneity in fly 
capture, we followed a procedure to select flies for analysis. 
From compounds where we caught a single fly, we analyzed 
the fly regardless of the species or location caught. In cases 
where we caught at least one housefly and bottle fly, we 
randomly selected a housefly because houseflies were caught 
more frequently than bottle flies. If we caught flies from both

the latrine entrance and the food preparation area, we selected 
a fly from the food preparation area because these flies were 
more likely to land on food. Descriptive examples of this 
selection process are described in Text S2. 
We used a modification of the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and 
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to extract total nucleic 
acids from 188 individual flies. First, we bead-beat flies for four 
cycles of 45 s in bead-beating tubes containing three sizes of 
glass beads and 180 μL Qiagen Buffer ATL. Next, we 
incubated the flies following the addition of another 180 μL of 
Buffer ATL, 40 μL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany), and 6 μL of carrier RNA (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany) for 3 h at 56 °C. Then, we proceeded with 
extraction, following the manufacturer’s protocol. We spiked in 
approximately 107 gene copies of bacteriophage MS2 (ATCC, 
Manassas, VA), an RNA phage, and 106 copies of a synthetic 
DNA sequence (IDT, Coralville, IA) as our extraction-positive 
controls.31 On each day of extraction, we included at least one 
negative extraction control. 

TaqMan Array Card. We assayed nucleic acids using a 
custom TaqMan Array Card (TAC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA) that tested for 29 gene targets corresponding to 
22 pathogens, following Liu et al.32,33 (Table S1), including 
nine bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Clostridium difficile, 
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. 
coli (EIEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Enterotoxigenic 
E. 
coli (STEC), 
Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae), six viruses (adenovirus, 
astrovirus, pan-enterovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus), 
three protozoa (Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium 
hominis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia spp.), and four 
helminths (Ancylostoma duodenale, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator 
americanus, and Trichuris trichiura). The TAC also included 
targets for antimicrobial resistance genes; these data will be 
published separately. We combined 40 μL of template with 60 
μL of AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then added the mixture 
into each TAC port. Cards were centrifuged twice for 1 min at 
1200 rpm, sealed, and trimmed. We performed reverse 
transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using a Quant- 
Studio 7 Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA) with the following thermocycling conditions: 45 °C for 
20 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C 
for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min. We manually set the threshold by 
comparing exponential curves and multicomponent plots with 
the positive control plots (Figure S2).34,35 Only amplification 
before a quantification cycle (Cq) of 40 was called as positive 
for a target, which was based off the performance of our 
negative controls (Tables S1 and S2).17,36 
We developed a positive control, which was a plasmid that 
contained all 
target sequences, according to Kodani and 
Winchell, 2012.37 From an 8-fold serial dilution of this positive 
control, we ran standard curves to validate the performance of 
each assay and estimated gene copy concentrations. 
In 
addition, we ran dilutions ranging from 10−1 to 103 gene 
copies per reaction well 
to determine the 95% limit of 
detection for each assay according to Stokdyk et al.38 On each 
least one negative 
day of TAC analysis, we included at 
extraction control and one PCR positive control. 
Digital PCR. We assayed extracted nucleic acids using 
digital PCR (dPCR) to test for the E. coli-specific gene, 
ybbW,39 with a QIAcuity Four instrument (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany). We combined 2 μL of template with 13.3 μL of 
QIAcuity EvaGreen PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, 
forward and reverse primers (0.4 μM concen- 
Germany), 
tration), and DNase/RNase free water. After assay mixtures 
were pipetted into the wells of a QIAcuity 26k nanoplate, we 
sealed the plate and used the following thermocycling 
condition: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C 
for 15 s, 59 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s, and then a 5 min cool 
down at 40 °C. We included at least one PCR positive control 
and one PCR negative control on each plate. We manually set 
the threshold between distinct positive and negative bands. 
Exposure Assessment. We used the methods described in 
Capone et al.40 for each pathogen detected in at least 5% of 
intervention and control flies at the baseline phase and at least 
5% in either study arm at 
the 12-month phase. These 
pathogens included Giardia, EPEC, EAEC, ETEC, adenovirus, 
and T. 
trichiura. For pathogens with multiple targets, we 
selected the largest gene copy value detected (Table S1). 
The intervention was not associated with a difference in fly 
counts in the food preparation area, and we lacked site-specific 
data regarding fly contact with food. Consequently, we used 
QMRA to model a scenario where a single fly landed on food 
once a week immediately before consumption. This is a 
conservative estimate based on Lindeberg et al., which 
reported 1.1 fly landings per minute on uncovered rice in 
urban Dhaka, Bangladesh.41 The potential difference in 
is 
QMRA-estimated infection risk between study arms 
subsequently driven by the enteric pathogen concentration in 
flies and not fly counts. 
We used the f itdistrplus42 package in R to fit a log-normal 
distribution to the mass (mg) of individual flies we assessed. In 
our model, we divide the value reported by De Jesús et al.,58� 
that a fly transfers 0.1 mg of mass per landing on average�by a 
random value from this fly mass distribution. We used this 
method as a conservative estimate of the transfer efficiency of 
pathogens from a fly to food (median efficiency = 1.4%, 
interquartile range = 0.78, 2.6%). This estimate includes the 
total pathogens transferred from fly vomit, defecation, and 
mechanical transport from the fly body (Table S3). 
Dose Harmonization. Some of the pathogens we assessed 
contain multiple copies of the target sequence. We included 
point estimates and uniform distributions across the range of 
possible gene copies per genome based on values reported in 
the literature (Table S3). 
Infectious Unit. PCR assays measure nucleic acids from 
viable and nonviable organisms. We estimated pathogen 
viability using a ratio of colony-forming units (CFUs) of E. 
coli to gene copies of the E. coli gene ybbW for bacterial, viral, 
and protozoan pathogens. These measures were determined on 
separate flies, preventing direct comparison of matched values. 
Instead, we subtracted the median log10 transformed gene 
copies of ybbW per fly from the median log10 transformed 
CFUs per fly to generate a point estimate of viability. We used 
the average of the log10 transformed standard deviations from 
these two measures to represent the standard deviation around 
the viability point estimate. We input this log10 transformed 
point estimate and standard deviation as a normal distribution 
to propagate the variability of pathogen viability into our 
model. In addition, helminth ova are more persistent than 
other pathogens, so we assumed that 75% of T. trichiura ova 
were viable based on Steinbaum et al.,18,43 (Table S3). 
Dose−Response. We estimated the daily probability of 
infection for each pathogen using dose−response parameters 
taken from the literature (Table S3).

Risk Characterization. We programmed the model as a 
Monte Carlo simulation in R (Figure 1). In the model, we 
fixed the microbial measurements to link the variance in our 
empirical data with our model outcome. Then, we randomly 
sampled from stochastic distributions to calculate a daily 
infection risk for each independent trial. We repeated the 
model 52 times, representing one exposure event per week for 
a year to calculate the annual risk of infection using eq 1.44,45 
Then, to ensure the convergence of our estimates, we repeated 
this process 100 times (i.e., estimating 5200 weekly risks of 
infection and 100 annual risks of 
infection per microbial 
measurement) and used the median annual risk of infection for 
each microbial measurement from these 100 datasets as the 
outcome variable during hypothesis testing. 

Difference-in-Difference (DID) Analysis. The output of 
the risk characterization step was 176 annual estimates of 
infection risk�between 0 and 100%�directly tied to our 
microbial measurements, which included control and inter- 
vention compounds at baseline and the 12-month follow-up. 
We used a difference-in-difference (DID) approach46 to assess 
the impact of the intervention on fly counts at latrine entrances 
and food preparation areas and the estimated annual infection 
risk for each pathogen. In addition, we used to same methods 
to estimate the impact of the intervention on the pooled 
infection risk for a hypothetical pathogen by analyzing the risk 
estimates from the six most frequently detected pathogens in a 
single model. The DID approach is a quasi-experimental 
approach that typically uses longitudinal data from control and 
intervention groups. This approach relies on the parallel trend 
assumption, meaning that the initial difference between the 
two groups is assumed to remain constant over time. We used 
generalized estimating equations (GEE)47 to fit unadjusted 
Poisson regression models with robust standard errors and 
accounted for clustering at 
the compound level. As our 
infection risk estimates were linked to the original microbial 
measurements, we were also able to fit adjusted Poisson 
regression models that 
included the following covariates 
chosen a priori: fly species (bottle vs housefly), location the 
fly was caught (food preparation vs latrine), and wealth 
index.48 Adjusted models using fly count data as the outcome 
variable only included wealth index as a covariate. 
Power Analysis. We did not perform power analysis a 
priori, as the sample size was limited by fly capture and 
subsequent fly availability for nucleic acid extraction. Instead, 
we performed a post hoc power analysis using the WebPower 
package in R.49 While infrequent detection resulted in low 
power for individual pathogen estimates (Table S4), we had 
80% power (α = 0.05) to observe a 23% reduction (RR = 0.77) 
in estimated infection risk for the pooled analysis. 
Sensitivity Analysis. Recognizing that 
infection risk 
estimates are dependent on the model parameters used, we 
re-ran alternative model scenarios to demonstrate how changes 
in model parameters impacted our results (Table S5). The 
parameters included a lower imputed value for nondetects (i.e., 
using the theoretical limit of detection), an alternative estimate 
for fly-food transfer efficiency based on a back-of-the-envelope 
calculation,50−52 viability estimates taken from the literature 
instead of our empirical data,53,54 and a scenario where flies 
land on food twice per week instead of once. 

Controls. From the 188 flies we analyzed on TAC, we 
excluded 12 because either the RNA or DNA extraction 
control did not amplify as expected. Our eight PCR positive 
controls (i.e., plasmids containing all 
sequences) 
amplified as expected on each day we ran TAC. We did not 
observe amplification for any target before a Cq of 40 among 
our 12 negative extraction controls. The two negative process 
controls used to monitor our E. coli culture methods were also 
negative. 

Fly Prevalence and Counts. At baseline�combined from 
latrine entrances and food preparation areas�we caught a 
mean of 18 flies per intervention compound (95% CI: 13, 24) 
and 13 flies per control compound (95% CI: 9.6, 17). At the 
12-month follow-up period, we caught fewer flies; the mean 
number of flies caught at intervention compounds was 3.2 
(95% CI: 1.8, 4.7) and was 4.5 at control compounds (95% CI: 
2.8, 6.2). Disaggregated between compound locations, the 
intervention reduced mean fly counts at latrine entrances by 
69% (aRR = 0.31, [0.13, 0.75]) but had no effect on fly counts 
at food preparation areas (aRR = 0.92, [0.33, 2.6]). Fly counts 
and prevalence divided by phase, arm, and compound location 
can be found in Table S6. 
E. coli. We found that half (23/46) of the flies analyzed 
were positive for culturable E. coli. The median concentration 
was 0.45 log10 CFU E. coli per fly, and the mean was 1.0 log10

Figure 2. Culture and PCR results for all microbial targets. Note: All points below the dotted line were nondetects. We analyzed 19 flies for E. coli 
gene copies, 46 flies for culturable E. coli, and 176 flies for pathogen genes. 
(Figure 2). All extracted nucleic acids measured via dPCR (19/ 
19) were positive for the E.coli-specific gene ybbW, with a 
median concentration of 3.0 log10 gene copies per fly and a 
mean of 3.6 log10 gene copies per fly (Figure 2). 
Pathogen Genes. We detected ≥1 pathogen gene from 
half the flies caught in control (54%, 30/56) and intervention 
compounds (50%, 17/34) at baseline. The prevalence 
decreased during the 12-month phase to 43% (23/53) for 
flies from control compounds and 27% (9/33) for flies from 
intervention compounds (Table 1). In addition, we detected a 
gene associated with each pathogen assayed using the TAC 
from ≥1 fly except 
the two 
hookworm targets A. duodenale and N. americanus, and the 
two Cryptosporidium targets (Figure 2 and Table 1). The most 
prevalent bacterial pathogen was EPEC (37/176), helminth 
was T. trichiura (12/176), protozoa was Giardia (13/176), and 
virus was adenovirus (25/176) (Figure 2 and Table 1). 

Annual Risk of Infection. As we did not detect any 
pathogen in more than 50% of flies, the median annual risk of 
infection for each pathogen was calculated from an imputed 
value for both study arms and phases, 
resulting in 
homogeneous median risk estimates. The annual risk estimates 
approached 100% for most data above the limit of detection 
(Table 1). 
Intervention Impact. According to the traditional 
definition of statistical significance,55 we estimated a significant 
reduction in the annual risk of infection from Giardia (RR = 
0.41, [0.18, 0.96]) in the unadjusted model (Table 1). 
Likewise, the adjusted point estimates for five of the six most 
frequently detected pathogens�adenovirus (aRR = 0.57, 
[0.30, 1.1]), EAEC (aRR = 0.73, [aRR = 0.48, 1.1]), ETEC 
(aRR = 0.93, [0.74, 1.2]), T. trichiura (aRR = 0.46, [0.16, 
1.3]), and Giardia (aRR = 0.50, [0.23, 1.1)]�also suggested 
the intervention had a protective effect. In addition, the point 
estimate for pooled infection risk indicated a protective effect 
(aRR = 0.84, [0.61, 1.2]). However, the confidence intervals 
included one for these five pathogens and the pooled risk 
estimate, indicating that the intervention may have had no 
effect or even increased the risk of infection compared to the 
control group. 
Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in model parameters did 
not affect the directionality of point estimates but did result in 
changes to individual point estimates (Table S7). Setting 
limit of detection (LOD)� 
nondetects to the theoretical 
instead of imputing them from zero to 95% LOD�resulted in 
lower infection risk estimates for nondetect samples. Models 
using this lower LOD suggested the intervention reduced the 
fly-mediated risk of infection for adenovirus (aRR = 0.32, 
[0.14, 0.97]), Trichuris (aRR = 0.12, [0.03, 0.48]), and Giardia 
(aRR = 0.19, [0.05, 0.80]) but not for the pooled infection risk 
estimate (aRR = 0.75, [0.42, 1.4]). Using viability estimates 
from the literature for Giardia and adenovirus�instead of our 
empirical data�resulted in nearly the same result for Giardia 
(aRR = 0.46, [0.20, 1.1]) but suggested a protective effect for 
adenovirus (aRR = 0.08, [0.02, 0.42]). An alternative estimate 
transfer efficiency (3.2%)�instead of our stochastic 
of 
method�also resulted in similar infection risk estimates. 
Except, this model suggested the intervention reduced the fly- 
mediated risk of infection by adenovirus (aRR = 0.73, [0.52, 
1.0]) and Trichuris (aRR = 0.14, [0.04, 0.53]). Finally, 
doubling the frequency of fly contact with food also resulted in 
similar infection risk estimates (pooled aRR = 0.84, [0.58, 
1.2]).

aNote: *Indicates the risk of enteric pathogen infection in the intervention group compared to the control group. †Represents the pooled infection 
risk of enteropathogenic E. coli, adenovirus, enteroaggregative E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, T. trichiura, and Giardia; there is no corresponding 
prevalence or annual infection risk for this estimate. Bold indicates p < 0.05. The following pathogens were not detected: A. duodenale, C. difficile, C. 
parvum, C. hominis, N. americanus, and Salmonella. 
While these early studies were limited by the methods 
available, application of the methods available in the 21st 
Century has broadened our understanding of the link between 
flies and disease. Some of these studies have focused on 
culturing fecal indicator bacteria from flies,21,57 the potential 
contamination of food,7,41,58 fly densities,59 and fly-mediated 
spread of antimicrobial resistance.60,61 According to a 2018 
systematic review of human pathogens carried by flies,62 our 
novel multipathogen assessment of individual flies represents 
the first PCR-based detection of human enteric viruses (i.e., 
adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus, and sapovirus) 
from wild caught flies. The high prevalence and concentration 
of pathogens we detected in flies, combined with their mobility 
in the living environment, suggests flies may be capable of 
distributing any enteric pathogen present in fecal wastes to 
surfaces and food where the opportunity for such transmission 
exists. 
We infrequently detected individual pathogens, which 
resulted in low power for these regression model estimates 
and wide confidence intervals. While low power suggests a 
cautious interpretation of individual pathogen estimates, there 
was a general trend; five of six individual point estimates 
showed the onsite sanitation intervention may have reduced 
the fly-mediated risk of enteric infection.55 In addition, the 
trend was reproduced in the sensitivity analyses. 
general 
However, the results clearly indicated that the shared urban 
onsite sanitation intervention did not dramatically reduce the 
QMRA-estimated infection risk from fly-contaminated foods 
after 1 year, and wide confidence intervals indicated the 
intervention may have increased the risk of infection. These

results corroborate other studies of environmental 
fecal 
contamination as part of the MapSan trial during the 12-63 
and 24-month17 phases, which found the intervention may 
have had a small protective effect against some enteric 
pathogens 
fecal 
contamination remained high post-intervention. While the 
intervention was associated with a reduction in fly counts at 
food 
latrine entrances, we observed no difference at 
preparation areas, which is where fly contact with food is 
more likely to occur. 


Two community wide fly control interventions�that used 
insecticide treatment25 and baited traps27�reduced fly counts 
by approximately 75%. A study in Pakistan found that village- 
scale insecticide spraying reduced fly counts by more than 
90%, though baited traps had no effect.26 At both control and 
intervention compounds, there was a substantial decrease in fly 
counts from baseline to the 12-month phase. However, this 
finding may have been the result of the methods we used. The 
manufacturer discontinued the fly trap used at baseline, and 
anecdotally, field workers reported the fly traps used post- 
intervention were not as sticky as those used pre-intervention. 
In addition, fly traps capture a subset of the flies from an area 
of interest as they must compete with alternative sites (e.g., 
feces, fecal sludge, and solid waste).29 The actual number of 
flies inside study compounds was likely greater than indicated 
by our fly count results. 

The high prevalence and concentration of culturable E. coli 
and pathogen-associated genes we detected suggest that the 
fly-food-ingestion pathway may be underappreciated in 
low-income communities. 
Maputo and similar 
Effective fly control strategies are essential to reduce risks. 
These strategies can be classified as either source or contact 
control. Certain onsite sanitation systems that are properly 
constructed and maintained�such as VIPs and pour-flush 
systems�offer 
source control by 
preventing fly breeding,12 whereas contact control strategies 
include fly traps, insecticides, and covering food.26,41 Contact 
control strategies may be easier to implement in the near 
future compared to investments in sanitation infrastructure. 
However,64,65 
there is mixed evidence that fly trap 
interventions reduce fly counts26,27 and some insects� 
including flies�are evolving resistance to insecticides.64,65 

Physical barriers to limit fly breeding�namely mesh screens 
over ventilation pipes and water seals�would not require the 
same degree of ongoing effort as contract control strategies. 
However, this infrastructure will deteriorate after a few years 
without consistent maintenance12 and may need to achieve a 
certain threshold of community coverage to reduce fly counts 
at locations relevant to exposure (i.e., food preparation areas). 
The sanitation intervention we evaluated included a water seal 
and mesh screen over a ventilation pipe. These physical 
barriers may explain the large reduction in fly counts at 
In 
intervention latrine entrances compared to controls. 
addition to human excreta, efforts to control fly breeding in 
low- and middle-income countries are complicated by the 
presence of animal feces, which may exceed the quantity of 
human feces in some settings.66 The difficulty associated with 
managing animal waste suggests alternative and sustainable fly 
control strategies may be needed to dramatically reduce the 
infection risks posed by fly-contaminated food in Maputo and 
similar informal urban settlements. 
A wide range of media is suitable for fly larval development. 
Houseflies have been observed to reproduce in human and 
animal excrement, fecal sludges, decaying foods, household 
refuse, and solid wastes.3 The high water content of septic tank 
sludge may prevent flies from breeding. However, Hargreaves 
observed large numbers of flies breeding in the scum layer of 
septic tanks.67 We did not attempt to observe fly larvae in 
latrines and septic tanks, and it is unclear what role�if any� 
sludge characteristics played in fly reproduction habits. 

Flies may be able to transmit enteric pathogens from feces to 
food: this pathway is directly observable and has been used 
widely in Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program- 
ming to exemplify exposure risks of uncontained fecal 
contamination.68 Well-fed houseflies have been observed to 
defecate approximately every four and a half minutes.3 
Although pathogen residence time in the alimentary canal 
varies, Sieyro, 1942,69 found cysts of E. histolytica could be 
passed by houseflies in as little as 1 min and were detectable up 
to 34 h after feeding. In addition, flies often regurgitate their 
food, but the structure of the proboscis selectively filters some 
protozoan cysts and helminth ova such that they are more 
likely to be shed in feces than vomit.2 After vomiting, flies may 
to aid with mechanical digestion.2 
re-ingest 
Graham-Smith,50 and Wenyon and O’Connor,51 reported that 
houseflies fed once on milk produced 16−31 specks (i.e., 
vomitus or excreta) per fly, most of which they classified as 
vomit. Houseflies cannot typically swallow particles larger the 
40 μm in diameter, which may prevent them from ingesting 
some Ascaris ova, but oblong Trichuris ova could be swallowed 
lengthwise (minimum diameter ∼ 20−25 μm). This size 
limitation may be why we detected Trichuris more frequently 
than Ascaris (minimum diameter ∼45 μm) despite Ascaris 
being more prevalent in fecal sludges collected from trial 
compounds (Table S8).70 In addition to the abundance of 
vomit and excreta that flies generate, they have a compulsion 
for cleaning. Flies constantly preen their wings or brush their 
body parts, which dislodges organisms that may have become 
attached to their integument.2 
There are several limitations to consider as part of our study. 
First, we sterilized tweezers between compounds and not 
individual flies, which may have led to contamination between 
flies from the same compound. Second, we lacked empirical 
evidence to describe the frequency of fly contact with food, 
though we used a highly conservative estimate based on 
Lindeberg et al.41 Further, we conservatively estimated equal 
contact between flies and food among study arms. While we 
observed no difference in fly counts at food preparation areas, 
the substantial reduction in fly counts at latrine entrances 
suggests we may have underestimated the impact of 
the 
intervention. Third, there is a paucity of literature quantifying 
the transfer of pathogens from flies to food, but we used a 
conservative estimate based on values 
reported in the 
literature. Fourth, the applicability of dose−response relation- 
ships developed in high-income countries to individuals living 
in informal settlements is unclear. Endemic exposure may 
result in acquired immunity, but repeated enteric infections 
may also compromise the immune system, leading to greater 
susceptibility.71 Further, the prevalence of individual pathogens 
was low because we extracted nucleic acids from individual 
flies�rather than pools of flies�and the LOD for TAC is 
higher than traditional qPCR or dPCR.72 Preamplification of 
nucleic acid extracts is an alternative method to lower the high 
LOD associated with the TAC workflow.34 In addition, low 
pathogen prevalence likely resulted in limited power to observe 
the 
significant effects. However, our results indicate that

intervention did not result in substantial reductions in QMRA- 
estimated infection risks, which is similar to the null effect 
observed in the main outcome of the MapSan trial.16 
Viability is a key variable in QMRA;73 we used an empirical 
ratio of culturable to gene copies of E. coli. This approach may 
have underestimated infection risks 
from Giardia and 
adenovirus, as these pathogens may be more persistent than 
E. coli,74,75 but we offered an alternative viability estimate for 
these pathogens in the sensitivity analysis. However, 
this 
alternative used an estimate that likely relied on an assumption 
of unknown and unknowable validity. And the feeding habits 
of houseflies and green bottle flies in this setting�namely on 
fresh feces�gives credence to our estimates that some 
pathogen-specific genes came from viable organisms. Addi- 
tionally, flies were frozen before culturing, which may have 
resulted in an underestimate of viability and subsequently 
resulted in an underestimate of annual infection risks. 
Flies are capable of transporting enteric pathogens from 
feces to food and other surfaces, which may then cause enteric 
infection and illness. We used QMRA to demonstrate that the 
fly-food pathway is highly plausible and may contribute to the 
burden of enteric disease in low-income Maputo and similar 
settings.26 We found some evidence to suggest that the onsite 
sanitation intervention reduced the annual risk of infection 
from consuming fly-contaminated food, but low power limited 
the interpretation of effects for individual pathogens. The 
onsite sanitation intervention we assessed was not imple- 
mented at a community level, 
indicating it is possible the 
intervention did not 
reach an adequate threshold of 
community coverage to substantially reduce infection risks 
from fly-contaminated foods. In addition, the intervention fly 
barriers�mesh netting over the ventilation pipe, the water 
seal, and the sealed septic tank�may have become damaged 
post-intervention and enabled flies to breed in the fecal sludge. 
Transformative WASH30,76 interventions should consider the 
maintenance of fly barriers and fly contact control 
interventions (e.g., traps, insecticides, and covering food) as 
necessary components of holistic interventions that might 
achieve substantial reductions in environmental 
fecal con- 
tamination and improve children’s health outcomes.
