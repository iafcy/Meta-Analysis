Globally, deaths due to diarrheal illnesses in children under ﬁve 
are decreasing, yet the rate remains high.1 In South Asia, 
approximately 10% of all deaths in children under ﬁve are due 
to diarrhea.2 These illnesses result from the transmission of 
enteric pathogens facilitated by inadequate drinking water, 
sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions. Pathogens can be 
transmitted from the feces of an infected host to a new host 
through the fecal-oral route, mediated through environmental 
reservoirs.3 Speciﬁcally, 
through 
exposure to contaminated water, soil, hands, fomites, vectors 
(e.g., ﬂies), and food. Drinking water treatment, sanitation 
infrastructure, and hygiene interventions use diﬀerent mech- 
anisms to block these exposure pathways. Of these, sanitation 
has the potential 
to block the most upstream fecal-oral 
transmission pathways by isolating and preventing the spread 
of feces through soil, water, and ﬂies. 

Both humans and animals can serve as hosts for enteric 
pathogens and contribute to environmental 
fecal contami- 
nation. Recent studies highlight the importance of animal-to- 
human pathogen transmission pathways.4−6 Globally, livestock 
produce 4 times the amount of feces as humans and animal 
feces exposure is of particular concern in low- and middle- 
income countries, where animal husbandry in the household 
environment is common.7 Livestock excrete pathogens such as 
Giardia, Campylobacter, and STEC,8 and a single infected 
animal may excrete a higher number of pathogens than a single 
human due to either higher mass concentrations or higher 
volume of feces.9 Due to the potential hazard posed by animal 
feces, a broadened scope of sanitation interventions has been 
suggested that combines animal 
fecal management (e.g., 
separating animals from living spaces, removal of animal 
feces from the household environment with tools, and

ABSTRACT: Diarrheal illnesses from enteric pathogens are a leading 
cause of death in children under ﬁve in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). Sanitation is one way to reduce the spread of 
enteric pathogens in the environment; however, 
few studies have 
investigated the eﬀectiveness of sanitation in rural LMICs in reducing 
pathogens in the environment. In this study, we measured the impact 
of a sanitation intervention (dual-pit latrines, sani-scoops, child potties 
delivered as part of a randomized control trial, WASH Beneﬁts) in 
rural Bangladeshi household compounds by assessing prevalence 
ratios, diﬀerences, and changes in the concentration of pathogen genes 
and host-speciﬁc fecal markers. We found no diﬀerence in the 
prevalence of pathogenic Escherichia coli, norovirus, or Giardia genes 
in the domestic environment in the sanitation and control arms. The 
prevalence of the human fecal marker was lower on child hands and the concentration of animal fecal marker was lower on mother 
hands in the sanitation arm in adjusted models, but these associations were not signiﬁcant after correcting for multiple comparisons. 
In the subset of households with ≥10 individuals per compound, the prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli genes on child hands was 
lower in the sanitation arm. Incomplete removal of child and animal feces or the compound (versus community-wide) scale of 
intervention could explain the limited impacts of improved sanitation. 



reducing the movement of animals) with human fecal 
management (e.g., latrines).4 
Determining the levels of fecal contamination in environ- 
mental reservoirs, and the impact of sanitation, can provide a 
mechanistic understanding of how sanitation interventions are 
eﬀective, or not, at reducing the spread of enteric pathogens. 
Existing studies have investigated the impact of sanitation on 
few have quantiﬁed the impact of 
health outcomes, but 
sanitation on indicators of fecal contamination along exposure 
routes (soil, hands, water, food, fomites, ﬂies).10−15 Notably, 
fewer studies have measured the impact of sanitation on the 
presence of speciﬁc pathogens in these reservoirs.15,16 
In this study, we quantify the impact of a sanitation 
intervention (a combined human and animal fecal manage- 
ment intervention that included dual-pit latrines, sani-scoops, 
and child potties) on enteric pathogen genes and indicators in 
household environmental reservoirs, within a cluster-random- 
ized controlled trial (WASH Beneﬁts) in rural Bangladesh. We 
measured pathogen genes (pathogenic Escherichia coli, 
norovirus, and Giardia lamblia) and microbial source tracking 
(MST) markers in soil, stored drinking water, and on mother 
and child hands in a subset of enrolled compounds to assess 
the impact of 
the intervention on (1) the prevalence of 
pathogen genes, (2) the prevalence of human fecal markers, 
and (3) the prevalence and concentration of animal 
fecal 
markers in the domestic environment. 

The study methods (setting, design, sample collection, and 
pathogen and indicator gene detection) were the same as 
described in Fuhrmeister et al.17 and are brieﬂy summarized 
here. The analysis plan was prespeciﬁed prior to data analysis 
and is publicly available on the Open Science Framework 
(https://osf.io/xrbpz/). Data were analyzed using R and the 
analysis was independently replicated by two blinded analysts 
(ERF, YC). This paper complements a previously published 
from the same ﬁeld trial, which investigated the 
paper 
prevalence and concentration of 
in all 
households enrolled in the control; sanitation; and combined 
water, sanitation, and handwashing arms four months after the 
intervention was delivered.13 Another publication documents 
the relationship between indicator E. coli, microbial source 
tracking markers, and pathogen genes in the same subset of 
households sampled as this study.17 Future publications are 
planned that will report on the prevalence and concentration of 
indicator E. 
in a subset of sanitation and control 
households at multiple time points over two years to assess 
the long-term eﬀect of sanitation. 


Study Setting and Design. We conducted our study in a 
randomly selected subset of households from the sanitation 
and control arms (300 households per arm) of the WASH 
Beneﬁts trial in rural Bangladesh.18 WASH Beneﬁts enrolled 
clusters of households that were geographically pair-matched 
and then randomly allocated to one of seven intervention or 
control arms.19 One household was selected per compound 
(deﬁned as groups of 3−10 households, typically relatives, 
living in adjacent households surrounding a central courtyard). 
for young 
The sanitation intervention included potties 
children, sani-scoop hoes to remove child and animal feces, 
and dual-pit latrines in each study compound. Community 
promoters visited study compounds about 6 times per month 
to deliver behavior change messages that focused on the use of 
child potties and latrines for defecation and disposal of human 
and animal feces. At the time of sample collection, it had been 
16−35 months since the latrines were constructed. WASH 
Beneﬁts enrolled households with a pregnant woman and 
followed their birth cohort. The interventions were delivered 
around the time of the cohort’s birth. Therefore, at the time of 
sample collection, study households contained at least one 
young child (aged 9−44 months) and any siblings of the birth 
cohort. 
Data Collection. Trained ﬁeld staﬀ from the International 
Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) 
visited enrolled households, unannounced, between March and 
October 2015. They collected environmental 
samples, 
interviewed the female caregiver of young children regarding 
household practices related to sanitation and handling of 
human and animal feces, and conducted environmental spot 
checks using a structured questionnaire. 
Sample Collection. Approximately 720 soil samples, 720 
stored drinking water samples, 720 mother hand rinses, and 
360 child hand rinses were collected from 600 study 
households (some households were sampled twice, approx- 
imately 4 months apart to capture both the wet and dry 
seasons; exact sample numbers for each assay are reported in 
the relevant ﬁgures and tables). Soil samples were collected 
from an area as close to the house entrance as possible by 
scraping the top layer of soil within a 30 × 30 cm2 stencil into a 
sterile Whirlpak bag (Nasco, Modesto, CA). For stored water 
samples, mothers were asked to provide a glass of water as they 
would give it to their child under ﬁve. To collect mother hand 
rinse samples, mothers placed their left hand into a sterile 
Whirlpak bag ﬁlled with 250 mL of sterile distilled water. The 
hand was massaged from the outside of the bag for 15 s, 
followed by 15 s of shaking. The same procedure was repeated 
with the right hand in the same bag. For child hand rinse 
samples, respondents placed their child’s hand into a separate 
Whirlpak bag and followed the same procedure. All samples 
were placed on ice and transported to the icddr,b ﬁeld 
laboratory within 8 h of collection and processed by lab 
technicians within 12 h of collection. 
Detection of Pathogenic E. coli Genes. Previously 
published methods were used to identify pathogenic E. coli 
genes.20,21 In brief, IDEXX Colilert-18 was used to determine 
which samples contained E. coli. Samples that tested positive 
were then archived for pathogenic E. coli gene analysis. For 
archiving, broth from up to 20 positive large IDEXX wells was 
aseptically extracted, pooled, centrifuged, and stored at −80 
°C. Samples were transported to UC Berkeley at 
room 
temperature (approximately 30 h) and stored at −80 °C upon 
arrival (2−28 months) prior to sample processing. Multiplex 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions were used to 
detect seven E. coli virulence genes indicative of ﬁve pathotypes 
of E. coli: EAEC (aggR), EPEC/EHEC (eaeA), STEC (stx1/ 
stx2/eaeA), EIEC (ipaH), and ETEC (lt1/st1b) (Table S1). 
Blanks were included during archiving, DNA extraction, and 
PCR processing to verify sterile procedures, which resulted in a 
total of 72 laboratory blanks and 84 extraction blanks 
(additional information on blanks is available in the Supporting 
Information). 
Filtration and Nucleic Acid Extraction for Quantita- 
tive Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) Targets. Field 
laboratory technicians ﬁltered 50 mL of hand rinse samples 
and up to 500 mL of stored water (range 100−500 mL) 
through a 0.45 μm HA ﬁlter (Millipore, Burlington, MA) to 
capture both viruses and bacteria. MgCl2 was added to all

samples to increase the retention of viruses.22 Filters were 
stored at −80 °C before and after transport to UC Berkeley at 
room temperature. Five grams of soil (wet weight) was 
weighed and stored at −80 °C until transport to UC Berkeley 
(under USDA soil import permit, PPQ 525). Filter and soil 
samples were stored at UC Berkeley at −80 °C between 5 and 
24 months prior to processing. DNA and RNA were extracted 
from soil and ﬁlters using modiﬁed Mobio PowerWater and 
PowerViral (both now Qiagen, Germantown, MD) proto- 
cols.15,23 A total of 168 blanks were processed during ﬁltration 
and 119 during nucleic acid extraction. A subset of samples 
(175 of 2608 total samples, 7%) was spiked with Pseudomonas 
syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph6) and MS2 (99 of 2608, 4%) to 
quantify the extraction of nucleic acids. Detailed methods for 
extraction protocols and quantiﬁcation of extraction eﬃciency 
are available in the Supporting Information of Fuhrmeister et 
al.17 
qPCR Assays. We used qPCR to analyze samples for 
norovirus GII, G. lamblia, Cryptosporidium spp. speciﬁc genes, 
and microbial source tracking markers (Table S2). To detect 
human-speciﬁc fecal contamination, we used the HumM2 
qPCR assay (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency research 
license #864-14) that targets human-associated Bacteroidales- 
like microorganisms.24,25 The HumM2 protocol was modiﬁed 
to employ a diﬀerent master mix designed to reduce inhibition, 
and the qPCR threshold was selected based on our instrument 
(StepOnePlus). To detect animal-associated fecal contami- 
nation, we used the BacCow assay.26 Both HumM2 and 
BacCow assays were previously evaluated for sensitivity and 
speciﬁcity in rural Bangladesh.15 The BacCow assay detected 
Bacteroidales in feces of cows, ducks, goats, and chickens but 
not humans in this setting.15 HumM2 performed the best out 
of all human-associated assays tested (HumM2, HF183, and 
BacHum), although it also ampliﬁed, 
indicating a positive 
result, in the feces of chickens and goats.15 
Initially, a subset of samples (105 child hands, 112 mother 
hands, 110 stored water, and 109 soil samples) from 50 
households (25 control and 25 sanitation) were tested for the 
presence of norovirus GII, G. 
lamblia, and Cryptosporidium 
speciﬁc genes. Within this subset, less than 1% of both soil 
samples and stored water samples tested positive for norovirus 
and Giardia genes; less than 1% of all sample types were 
positive for the Cryptosporidium gene. Therefore, we only 
analyzed remaining hand rinse samples for norovirus and 
Giardia genes. We did not test any remaining samples for the 
presence of the Cryptosporidium gene. 
Samples were run on a StepOnePlus thermal cycler (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in triplicate on a 96-well plate 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each run contained 
one standard curve (ranging from 10 to 105 gene copies/2 μL) 
and three no-template controls. A subset of samples (10 ﬁlters 
and 13 soil samples, ≈1%) were tested for inhibition using the 
spike and dilute method.27 Filter samples were uninhibited for 
all DNA and RNA assays. In soil samples, Cryptosporidium spp. 
and MS2 assays were inhibited in some samples. HumM2, 
BacCow, G. 
lamblia, pph6, and Norovirus GII were 
uninhibited for all samples. A 1:10 dilution for the extraction 
eﬃciency of RNA in soil was used for MS2. We decided not to 
dilute Cryptosporidium due to the resulting increase in the 
detection limit. A standard curve for quantiﬁcation for each 
assay was determined by pooling all standard curves and using 
a linear mixed-eﬀects model to correct for batch eﬀects.28 
Results from inhibition testing and standard curve quantiﬁca- 
tion can be found in the Supporting Information of 
Fuhrmeister et al.17 
Data Analysis for Quantitative Assays. BacCow was the 
only qPCR assay that produced data in the quantiﬁable range; 
nearly all samples ampliﬁed below the lowest point on the 
standard curve (10 gene copies/2 μL) in all other assays. 
BacCow measurements were quantiﬁable in 76% of child 
hands, 67% of mother hands, 10% of stored water, and 49% of 
soil. For quantitative analysis, hand rinse samples below the 
limit of detection (BLOD) were assigned half the value of the 
limit of detection (LOD). Hand rinse samples below the limit 
of quantiﬁcation (BLOQ) were assigned the midpoint between 
the LOD and the limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ). To determine 
which quantities to assign to samples BLOD and BLOQ in 
stored water and soil samples, which were impacted by 
diﬀerences in processing volume and moisture content, we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis with four scenarios. The overall 
results for diﬀerence in concentration of BacCow between 
arms were similar in all scenarios (Table S3). Thus, we chose 
to assign samples BLOD half the LOD accounting for the 
volume of water ﬁltered and the moisture content for each 
sample. Samples BLOQ were assigned the midpoint between 
the LOD and LOQ. Blanks that ampliﬁed for BacCow were 
BLOQ; samples that ampliﬁed in the same region (BLOQ) 
were treated as BLOD (see the Supporting Information for 
more details, including Table S4 for the number of samples 
BLOD and BLOQ). 
Data Analysis for Presence Absence Assays. Most 
samples did not amplify within the quantiﬁable range for 
norovirus GII, Giardia, and HumM2. Therefore, these assays 
were analyzed as presence absence data and samples were 
considered positive for qPCR targets if at least one of three 
replicates ampliﬁed, even if ampliﬁcation was BLOQ. For 
binary analyses of pathogen/source tracking marker presence, 
all samples with positive lab, extraction, or archiving blanks 
were removed from the analysis according to the date 
processed and the lab technician. This resulted in removing 
30 child and 33 mother hand samples from norovirus GII and 
51 child and 115 mother hands from Giardia gene analyses. In 
total, 29 child hand, 74 mother hand, 76 stored water, and 92 
soil samples were removed from HumM2 analyses. For 
pathogenic E. coli virulence genes, 6 child hand, 9 mother 
hand, 11 stored water, and 12 soil samples were removed from 
eaeA analyses. A total of 3 child hand, 5 mother hand, 5 stored 
water, and 6 soil samples were removed from stx1/stx2 
analyses. A total of 4 child hand, 6 mother hand, 9 stored 
water, and 8 soil samples were removed from lt1 analyses. 
Linear Models. The impact of the sanitation intervention 
was assessed using generalized linear models with robust 
standard errors to account for the trial’s clustered study design 
and did not assume outcome distributions.18 For binary 
outcomes, we estimated the prevalence, prevalence diﬀerences 
(PD), and prevalence ratios (PR) for pathogen genes and 
microbial source tracking markers. For BacCow, the only 
continuous marker, we determined the mean concentration in 
each arm as well as the diﬀerence in concentration between the 
arms. The analyzed values for BacCow concentrations were 
log10-transformed. 

trial resulted in balanced 
covariates between arms; thus, we used the unadjusted models 
as our primary analysis.18 We conducted three prespeciﬁed 
subgroup analyses to estimate our parameters of interest in 
subsets of the data. Data were subset by season (wet vs dry),

Animals included cows, goats, sheep, chickens, non-chicken

crows, pigeons). For the latter two subsets, the cutoﬀs were 
determined based on the empirical data distribution. In a 
deviation from the analysis plan, the wet season was deﬁned as 
June−September (rather than May−October) to achieve a 
better balance in sample numbers in the subgroups and to 
reﬂect the actual rainfall in 2015. In a secondary analysis, we 
adjusted our estimates 
for covariates anticipated to be 
associated with our outcomes. We included the same 
covariates as described in the WASH Beneﬁts analysis plan 
(season, 
rainfall, and household characteristics) with the 
addition of sampling condition covariates (sampling location 
for soil (sun, shade), soil moisture content, cover status of the 
stored water container, stored water container type, and 
observation of handwashing during sample collection). We 
corrected for multiple comparisons, multiplying p-values by 
four (i.e., the same pathogen evaluated in multiple sample 
types) using a Bonferroni correction.29 
Ethics. Participants provided written informed consent. The 
study protocol was approved by human subjects committees at 
the icddr,b (PR-11063), University of California, Berkeley 
(2011-09-3652), and Stanford University (25863). 

Prevalence of Pathogen Genes and Microbial Source 
Tracking Markers. The prevalence of each E. coli virulence 
gene (ECVG) was consistently higher on child hands than 
mother hands (Figure 1 and Table S5). On child hands in both 
study arms, the most prevalent ECVG was stx1/2 (control 
(C): 13.4 (95% CI: 8.6, 18.3)%; sanitation (S): 16.8 (11.2, 
22.5)%). On mother hands, the most prevalent ECVGs were 
eaeA, aggR, and stx1/2 genes (C and S: 6.1−9.3%). The 
prevalence of norovirus and G. lamblia genes was 1.7−5.1% in 
all hand samples in both arms. In other household reservoirs, 
ECVGs were present in ≈37% (C: 37.5 (33.0, 42.1) %; S: 36.4 
(31.3, 41.6)%) of stored water and ≈60% (C: 61.5 (56.4, 66.6) 
%; S: 58.9 (53.9, 64.0)%) of soil (Figure 2 and Table S5). The 
most commonly detected ECVG in stored water was stx1/2 
(C: 16.6 (12.6, 20.6) %; S: 16.5 (12.6, 20.4)%), and eaeA (C: 
38.6 (33.2, 44.1)%; S: 36.7 (31.7, 41.6)%) was the most 
commonly detected ECVG in soil. The least prevalent ECVG 
across all sample types was ipaH (≤2%). 
Human and animal microbial source tracking markers were 
detected in all four reservoirs. The prevalence of BacCow was 
higher than any other target including both pathogen genes 
and microbial source tracking markers. In total, 99.5 (98.4, 
100.0)% and 95.6 (92.4, 98.9)% of child hands in the control 
and sanitation arms were positive for BacCow and a similar 
prevalence was also found on mother hands (C: 97.6 (96.0, 
99.1)%; S: 95.8 (93.9, 97.7)%). BacCow was detected in 70.0 
(65.1, 74.8)% and 67.0 (61.6, 72.4)% of stored water and in 
91.2 (88.4, 94.1)% and 90.2 (86.1, 94.2)% of soil in the control 
and sanitation arms. The prevalence of the human fecal marker 
(HumM2) was substantially lower than the animal marker in 
all reservoirs. In the control and sanitation arms, the prevalence 
of HumM2 on child hands was 26.3 (19.7, 33.0)% and 17.6 
(12.0, 23.3)% and a similar level was found on mother hands 
(C: 18.5 (13.8, 23.1)%; S: 17.7 (13.3, 22.1)%). We detected 
HumM2 in <5% of stored water samples (C: 3.6 (1.5, 5.6)%; 
S: 1.6 (0.2, 2.9)%) and in approximately 20% of soil (C: 18.4 
(14.3, 22.5)%; S: 22.0 (17.3, 26.6)%). Hand rinses, stored 
water, and soil samples have diﬀerent units (per 2 hands, 100 
mL of stored water, and g of dry soil); therefore, it is diﬃcult 
to draw meaningful conclusions 
prevalence results between environmental sample types. 

Intervention Impact. Almost all compounds in both the 
sanitation and control arms contained a latrine (C: 99%; S: 
100%) at the time of sample collection (Table 1). Most

sanitation arm compounds had a pour-ﬂush latrine (C: 63%; S:

of 
intervention arm latrines drained into the environment, 
whereas more than 20% of control households had latrines 
draining into the environment or had feces spilling out from 
the pit. While ownership does not guarantee use, most adults 
(94%) in the sanitation arm used the latrine during structured 
observations in the main ﬁeld trial.30 There were also more 
compounds with young children defecating in latrines or 
potties (C, 13%; S, 56%) and using a scoop or hoe to handle 
animal feces (C, 48%; S, 97%) in the intervention arm.

isons (Figures 1 and 2 and Table S6). On child hands, the 
prevalence of BacCow was 4% lower in the sanitation arm 
(prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.00); corrected p 
= 0.21). This association was not signiﬁcant after correcting for

corrected p < 0.001). There was a borderline signiﬁcant 
diﬀerence in the prevalence of the human fecal marker on child 
hands between arms in the adjusted model (PR: 0.66 (0.44, 
0.99); corrected p = 0.19). There was also a borderline 
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the prevalence of st1b/lt1 between 
arms in stored water (PR, 0.64 (0.39, 1.03); corrected p = 
0.27) and soil (0.74 (0.54, 1.03); corrected p = 0.29) in the 
adjusted model. The average log10 concentration of BacCow 
on mother hands was lower in the sanitation arm in the 
unadjusted (Δ, −0.16 (95% CI: −0.30, −0.03); corrected p = 
0.07) and adjusted models (−0.37 (−0.66, −0.08); corrected p 
these associations were not signiﬁcant after

correcting for multiple comparisons (Figure 3 and Table S7). 
Figure 3. Mean log10 concentration of BacCow on hands, in stored 
drinking water and soil samples from the sanitation (S) versus control

mL of water, and gram of dry soil. 

there were no signiﬁcant 
associations, correcting for multiple comparisons and separat- 
ing the data by season (Table S8). In households with ≥20 
animals in their compound, there was a borderline signiﬁcant 
diﬀerence in the prevalence of st1b/lt1 between arms on child 
hands (0.22 (0.04, 1.06); corrected p = 0.16) and in soil (0.46 
(0.23, 0.92); corrected p = 0.21) (Table S9). In households 
with ≥10 individuals in their compound, the prevalence of 
st1b/lt1 on child hands was 89% lower in the sanitation arm 
versus the control arm (0.11 (0.02, 0.77); corrected p = 0.04) 
(Table S10). We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in log10 
concentration of BacCow in any subgroup analyses, correcting 
for multiple comparisons, but there were some borderline 
signiﬁcant eﬀects on mother hands (Table S11). 

Prevalence of Pathogen Genes and Microbial Source 
Tracking Markers. Considering that stored drinking water is 
a direct exposure route for the ingestion of enteric pathogens, 
the high prevalence of BacCow (C: 70%; S: 67%) and E. coli 
virulence genes (C: 38%; S:67%) in stored water in both study 
arms is a concern. As we did not measure pathogen genes or 

BacCow in tubewells (source water), we were unable to 
diﬀerentiate contamination in the tubewells from contami- 
nation introduced during storage. It is possible that some of 
the fecal contamination in stored drinking water originated 
from the source water, as other studies have found indicators 
of 
in these 
sources.31−34 Another possible mechanism of stored water 
contamination is through contact with hands,35−37 which we 
have shown to be contaminated with multiple types of 
pathogenic E. coli virulence genes (Figure 1). In this same 
study area, Ercumen et al.13 found that the prevalence of 
indicator E. coli was signiﬁcantly higher in stored water (C: 
77%; S: 76%) than was found in tubewells (C: 25%; S: 23%);13 
thus, contamination during storage is likely responsible for 
some of the observed high prevalence of BacCow and E. coli 
virulence genes. Comparing with previously published results 
on indicator E. coli in all sample types, it is interesting to note 
that the prevalence of BacCow on hands was higher than the 
prevalence of indicator E. coli (≈75%), whereas indicator E. coli 
were more prevalent than BacCow in stored water (88%) and 
soil (95%).17 
Previous studies have investigated the presence of microbial 
source tracking markers in the household environment in rural 
India. We found a higher prevalence of the same animal fecal 
marker (BacCow) in hand rinses and stored water in rural 
Bangladesh than was observed in Odisha, India.16 We also 
found a similar level of the human fecal markers on hands as 
was found in India but a higher prevalence in stored drinking 
water; however, the results are diﬃcult to compare given that 
diﬀerent fecal markers were used based on sensitivity and 
speciﬁcity for each study location.15,38 
A comparable study on rural Bangladeshi households found 
lower prevalence of human fecal contamination using the same 
human marker (HumM2).15 This study was also conducted in 
a subset of WASH Beneﬁts households in the sanitation and 
control arms, but samples were collected at an earlier date 
(November 2013−March 2014). In the control arm, 9.0% of 
soil samples, 0% of stored drinking water, and 2.0% of child 
hands were positive for HumM2 compared to 18.4% soil, 3.6% 
stored water, and 26.3% of child hands in our study. Taken 
together, 
temporal 
the results indicate a high degree of 
variability in human fecal contamination. These studies 
sampled in diﬀerent years as well as months; the previous 
study was conducted during the dry season of Bangladesh, 
while our sampling spanned both seasons. Therefore, diﬀer- 
ences in the occurrence of HumM2 could be due to both 
seasonal and yearly variations. Previous studies have found 
higher levels of fecal contamination in various environmental 
reservoirs during the wet season in Bangladesh.6 In our study 
and Boehm et al.’s, the prevalence of viruses on child hands 
was low (<10%), although the studies investigated diﬀerent 
viruses. In the control and sanitation arms, rotavirus was 
detected in 5.7 and 6.5% of child hands in the earlier 
Bangladesh study and norovirus was detected in ≈4% of child 
hands in our study. 
Intervention Impact. Overall, the use of the sanitation 
intervention in the WASH Beneﬁts trial was not suﬃcient to 
reduce fecal contamination in the household environment, as 
evidenced by the similar prevalence of pathogen genes and 
microbial source tracking markers in both the sanitation and 
control study arms. This ﬁnding is consistent with the results 
of a previously published indicator bacteria study that found no 
diﬀerence between indicator E. 
in

tubewells, ponds, stored water, food, soil, and on child hands 
and ﬂies in the sanitation arm compared to those in the control 
arm.13 One possible explanation provided was that 
the 
observed concentrations of indicator E. coli were occluded by 
“naturalized” E. coli (E. coli naturally found in soil and water 
that is not derived from fecal sources), which masked the eﬀect 
of 
the sanitation intervention. This is still a possibility, 
although we also did not ﬁnd a diﬀerence in the prevalence 
of microbial source tracking markers and select pathogen genes 
between the sanitation and control arms. Another suggested 
hypothesis from the indicator E. coli study was that spread of 
human feces, but not animal 
feces, was reduced by the 
intervention. The authors reasoned that the indicator E. coli 
detected could have come predominantly from animal feces, 
which was still present in intervention households despite the 
provision of sani-scoops. This is consistent with our ﬁnding 
that the animal fecal marker was substantially more prevalent 
than the human fecal marker among all sample types in our 
study. However, given that we saw no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in 
the human fecal marker (HumM2) between the study arms, 
apart from a borderline reduction on child hands, we conclude 
that human fecal contamination was not substantially impacted 
by the sanitation intervention. Similarly, 
there was no 
diﬀerence between the prevalence of the animal fecal marker 
(BacCow) between the two arms except for a small diﬀerence 
in the prevalence on child hands, suggesting no intervention 
impact on animal fecal contamination. 

The WASH Beneﬁts study reported a lower prevalence of 
childhood diarrhea in households in the sanitation arm,18 while 
our study found few signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the prevalence of 
indicators in environmental samples 
pathogens or 
collected from a subset of these same households. We expected 
that because the prevalence of diarrhea was lower in the 
sanitation arm, containment of feces was better and therefore 
fewer pathogens would be present in the household environ- 
ment. One possible explanation for why we did not measure a 
diﬀerence is that pathogen detection limits were too high, 
resulting in many false negatives and insuﬃcient sensitivity to 
detect a diﬀerence between the two arms. In other words, our 
study may not have detected whether some of these samples 
(false negatives) contained pathogen concentrations suﬃcient 
to exceed the minimum infective dose. For example, WASH 
Beneﬁts measured protozoan pathogens in the stool of study 
participants and found a 25% reduction in the prevalence of 
Giardia infections in the sanitation arm.39 However, we did not 
observe a similar reduction in the prevalence of Giardia in 
environmental reservoirs. The concentration of Giardia in 
environmental samples is much lower than in the stool of 
infected individuals, which could have resulted in lower 
sensitivity to detect a diﬀerence in the environmental samples. 
Another possibility to explain the discrepancy between the 
prevalence of diarrhea and pathogens 
in environmental 
samples is that we did not measure all pathogens that could 
be etiological agents of diarrhea. Our study focused on 
pathogenic E. coli, Giardia, and norovirus, but 
rotavirus, 
Shigella, Aeromonas, and Campylobacter jejuni are other possible 
etiological agents of disease in Bangladesh.40 Also, we did not 
measure pathogen genes and microbial source tracking markers 
on fomites or food which could be dominant reservoirs for 
enteric pathogen transmission.41 The duration between latrine 
construction and sample collection (16−35 months) should 
have been suﬃciently long for fecal associated organisms and 
nucleic acids present before construction to degrade in 
environmental reservoirs, including soil.42−45 Therefore, it is 
unlikely the genes detected in this study persisted from before 
the intervention. 
A beneﬁt to the pathogenic E. coli detection method used in 
this study is the enrichment step, which allowed us to detect 
pathogenic E. coli genes likely from viable organisms. However, 
there are some limitations to this and the other detection 
methods used and these could inﬂuence the measured impact 
the sanitation intervention. The method we used for 
of 
pathogenic E. coli was not quantitative, and a quantitative 
method such as qPCR could have determined whether the 
concentrations of pathogenic E. coli, not just prevalence, were 
impacted in the trial. However, using qPCR does not guarantee 
that quantitative results will be produced, as occurred in this 
study. Despite using qPCR to detect norovirus, Giardia, and 
HumM2, most of 
the results were below the limit of 
quantiﬁcation. The quantitative analysis of BacCow results in 
stored water and soil was also impacted by a high proportion of 
nonquantitative samples in stored water and soil (Table S4), 
which may have reduced the ability to detect a diﬀerence 
between the study arms. Detection can be improved by 
processing larger sample volumes; however, sample volumes 
are constrained in the household setting. For example, stored 
water samples are restricted to the volume that can be spared 
at the time of collection and the logistical constraints of 
transporting samples from the ﬁeld to the lab. We were unable 
to ﬁlter the targeted 500 mL from all households. This volume 
was selected to reduce the lower detection limit (from the 
standard 100 mL sample volume), but in some households, 
less than 500 mL was available at the time of collection or in 
other cases ﬁlters clogged before the full sample was ﬁltered. 
The variable ﬁltration volumes resulted in variable detection 
limits; however, the impact on detection limits was similar in 
sanitation and control arms. Therefore, we do not believe that 
this was a limitation in our ability to detect a diﬀerence 
between arms. More eﬀort is needed to develop methods with 
lower detection limits compatible with complex environmental 
samples. While there have been recent developments in 
aptamer-based detection (nucleotides that bind to a target), 
with potential for lower detection limits, very few have been 
tested in environmental matrices.46 
Our results are generally in agreement with a previous study 
in rural India that found no reduction in pathogens and 
microbial source tracking markers in household reservoirs 
despite a 27% increase in latrine coverage.16 One notable 
ﬁnding in our study was a slightly lower (5%) prevalence of 
BacCow on child hands in the sanitation arm, although the 
prevalence was still high (100 versus 96% in control and 
sanitation arms, respectively). However, the lower prevalence 
of BacCow was not reﬂected in the diﬀerence in log10 
concentration of BacCow on child hands. The lower 
prevalence of BacCow could be due to the use of sani-scoops 
for animal 
the sanitation arm 
households. We observed a lower prevalence of cow feces in 
sanitation versus control compound courtyards (C, 36%; S, 
27%), although poultry feces were still visible in 90% of 
courtyards overall (Table 1). We also observed 89% lower 
prevalence of st1b/lt1 genes (indicative of ETEC) in sanitation 
versus control arm households with ≥10 individuals. More 
research is needed to understand diﬀerences in sanitation 
practices in households with more individuals, which could be 
impacted by diﬀerent social dynamics in larger families. It 
should be noted that while our results are in agreement with 



https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b04835 
Environ. Sci. Technol. 2020, 54, 4316−4326 



previous rural studies, they may not be generalizable to more 
urban settings. 
Poor child and animal fecal management could be a main 
reason we did not see lower fecal contamination in household 
reservoirs in the sanitation arm. While there were more 
children using a potty or latrine in the sanitation arm, it was 
still 
just over half of the households (C: 13%; S: 56%). 
Interestingly, the percent of households that reported hygienic 
disposal of child feces in the sanitation arm is higher in this 
study than the 21% of sanitation households that reported 
disposing of child feces in a latrine approximately one year 
prior.15 Although this is a promising result and could be due to 
more exposure to community promoters and children reaching 
an appropriate age to use the latrine, there is still signiﬁcant 
room for improvement. Similar practices are also evident in the 
management of animal 
fecal marker 
(BacCow) was prevalent in all environmental reservoirs in 
both study arms, and a concurrent study showed that increased 
concentrations of BacCow were associated with the increased 
prevalence of some pathogen genes on mother hands.17 
Another reason we did not see the impact of the sanitation 
intervention could be due to the compound scale of the 
intervention. Intercompound transmission can occur through a 
variety of pathways,47 and pathogens can be transferred from 
schools, neighboring compounds, agriculture ﬁelds, and other 
places of work. 

It is also possible that the quality of the latrine may not have 
been suﬃcient to isolate human fecal contamination from the 
household environment. The latrine improvements in this 
study provided a hygienic barrier between feces and the 
environment through the metrics evaluated such as functional 
water seal and reduced ﬂow from overfull pits or latrines 
draining directly into the environment. However, Bangladesh 
table and leakage from latrines 
has a high water 
into 
groundwater 
is possible but was not measured in this 
study.48 It should be noted that the sanitation intervention 
include speciﬁc procedures for pit emptying or 
did not 
treatment oﬀsite, although pit emptying is unlikely to be a 
main source of exposure as very few pit 
latrines in the 
sanitation arm were emptied during the study period (3%). 
In this study, access to latrines in both arms was high (C: 
98.7%; S: 100%), but the management of child and animal 
feces was still incomplete. Modeling could be a useful tool to 
estimate the impact of further improvements in the manage- 
feces on the concentration of 
ment of child and animal 
pathogens in the environment and the prevalence of diarrhea 
in children under ﬁve. Quantitative microbial risk assessment, 
including exposure models,41,49 can be combined with 
pathogen measurements to predict the number of pathogens 
children ingest in their household environment and estimate 
the resulting prevalence of diarrhea. Our study provides an 
opportunity to calibrate a model using actual data on 
environmental pathogen concentrations and diarrheal preva- 
lence. Other recent studies in Bangladesh can provide more 
detailed information on child behavior and interactions with 
the environment,50,51 providing a foundation for exposure 
models to investigate fecal contamination pathways that result 
in pathogen ingestion by children in these households. 
Previous work has taken a similar approach via calibrating a 
QMRA model to ﬁeld observations of diarrheal prevalence to 
model the reduction in infection risk due to diﬀerent levels of 
use of household water treatment.52−54 Modeling the impacts 
of varying strategies of child and animal fecal management 
interventions could be used to explore which interventions and 
degree of compliance are needed to signiﬁcantly reduce fecal 
contamination levels in the household environment. Finally, 
this study was not designed to measure fecal pathogen levels in 
potential reservoirs outside of the household environment to 
which children may be exposed such as open drains, fecal 
sludge dumping sites, open defecation sites, and animal feces 
for fertilizer. Additional research is needed to better under- 
stand exposure in public versus private realms.41,55,56
