countries (LMICs). Sanitation is one way to reduce the spread of

rural Bangladeshi household compounds by assessing prevalence

found a similar level of the human fecal markers on hands as
was found in India but a higher prevalence in stored drinking

different fecal markers were used based on sensitivity and
