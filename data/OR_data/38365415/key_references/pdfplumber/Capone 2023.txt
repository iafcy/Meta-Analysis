ABSTRACT: Synanthropic filth flies transport enteric pathogens
from feces to food, which upon consumption poses an infection
risk.Weevaluatedtheeffectofanonsitesanitationintervention�
including fly control measures�in Maputo, Mozambique, on the
risk of infection from consuming fly-contaminated food. After
enumerating flies at intervention and control sites, we cultured
fecal indicator bacteria, quantified gene copies for 22 enteric
pathogens via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR), and developed quantitative microbial risk
assessment (QMRA) models to estimate annual risks of infection
attributable to fly-contaminated foods. We found that the
intervention reduced fly counts at latrine entrances by 69% (aRR
